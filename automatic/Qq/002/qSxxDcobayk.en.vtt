00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.250 

okay<00:00:09.150> you<00:00:09.210> might<00:00:09.389> feel<00:00:09.570> that's<00:00:09.719> pretty<00:00:09.960> fast

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
okay you might feel that's pretty fast

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.020 
okay you might feel that's pretty fast
but<00:00:10.530> if<00:00:10.710> we<00:00:10.860> actually<00:00:11.010> now<00:00:11.429> change<00:00:11.910> the

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
but if we actually now change the

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.509 
but if we actually now change the
pendulum<00:00:12.450> action<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:12.900> put<00:00:13.019> it<00:00:13.110> up<00:00:13.200> into<00:00:13.620> its

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
pendulum action and put it up into its

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.640 
pendulum action and put it up into its
third<00:00:14.790> position<00:00:15.330> this<00:00:16.080> SH<00:00:16.109> actually<00:00:16.470> put

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
third position this SH actually put

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.980 
third position this SH actually put
maximum<00:00:17.100> sweep<00:00:17.550> into<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.970> blade<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.300> made<00:00:18.779> me

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
maximum sweep into the blade and made me

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.950 
maximum sweep into the blade and made me
to<00:00:19.140> actually<00:00:19.410> cut<00:00:19.680> even<00:00:20.340> faster<00:00:20.910> we<00:00:21.720> just

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
to actually cut even faster we just

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.570 
to actually cut even faster we just
noticed<00:00:22.410> now<00:00:22.619> we're<00:00:22.859> on<00:00:22.949> this<00:00:23.070> section<00:00:23.460> here

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
noticed now we're on this section here

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.730 
noticed now we're on this section here
which<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:23.850> number<00:00:24.210> three<00:00:24.539> dead<00:00:25.170> easy<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.500> set

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
which is number three dead easy to set

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.830 
which is number three dead easy to set
up<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:26.070> don't<00:00:26.279> need<00:00:26.430> any<00:00:26.580> special<00:00:26.730> tools<00:00:27.000> but

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
up I don't need any special tools but

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.120 
up I don't need any special tools but
this<00:00:27.960> would<00:00:28.140> completely<00:00:28.289> change<00:00:28.680> the

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
this would completely change the

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:48.680 
this would completely change the
characteristics<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:30.150> jigsaw

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.390 

okay<00:00:49.690> so<00:00:49.750> let's<00:00:50.170> say<00:00:50.350> actually<00:00:50.650> try<00:00:51.040> this<00:00:51.100> more

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
okay so let's say actually try this more

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.160 
okay so let's say actually try this more
complicated<00:00:51.610> cut<00:00:52.300> which<00:00:52.540> is<00:00:52.660> called<00:00:52.810> a<00:00:52.870> plunge

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
complicated cut which is called a plunge

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.710 
complicated cut which is called a plunge
cut<00:00:53.320> to<00:00:54.190> do<00:00:54.340> this<00:00:54.520> I<00:00:54.700> must<00:00:54.880> take<00:00:55.150> it<00:00:55.300> off<00:00:55.390> the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
cut to do this I must take it off the

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.200 
cut to do this I must take it off the
number<00:00:56.170> three<00:00:56.530> pendulum<00:00:57.070> action<00:00:57.430> and<00:00:57.940> move<00:00:58.090> it

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
number three pendulum action and move it

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.330 
number three pendulum action and move it
over<00:00:58.270> to<00:00:58.390> a<00:00:58.480> number<00:00:58.810> zero<00:00:59.080> they're<00:00:59.800> easy<00:00:59.950> to<00:01:00.190> do

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
over to a number zero they're easy to do

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.070 
over to a number zero they're easy to do
again<00:01:00.640> what<00:01:00.880> we're<00:01:01.450> actually<00:01:01.540> going<00:01:01.750> to<00:01:01.840> do<00:01:01.960> is

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080 
again what we're actually going to do is

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.450 
again what we're actually going to do is
try<00:01:02.200> and<00:01:02.290> enter<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:02.830> material<00:01:03.370> we've

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
try and enter the material we've

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.550 
try and enter the material we've
actually<00:01:03.610> not<00:01:03.910> making<00:01:04.239> a<00:01:04.300> whole<00:01:04.330> first<00:01:04.839> so

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
actually not making a whole first so

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.710 
actually not making a whole first so
this<00:01:05.710> is<00:01:05.800> where<00:01:05.950> variable<00:01:06.400> speed<00:01:06.729> is<00:01:06.940> a<00:01:06.970> real

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
this is where variable speed is a real

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.200 
this is where variable speed is a real
asset<00:01:08.050> and<00:01:08.440> I<00:01:08.920> can<00:01:09.100> still<00:01:09.310> easily<00:01:09.580> get<00:01:09.970> to<00:01:10.090> that

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
asset and I can still easily get to that

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.240 
asset and I can still easily get to that
accelerator<00:01:10.870> button<00:01:11.229> using<00:01:11.740> my<00:01:12.010> little

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
accelerator button using my little

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:29.210 
accelerator button using my little
finger

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.890 

as<00:01:30.220> you<00:01:30.340> can<00:01:30.490> see<00:01:30.700> now<00:01:30.880> I'm<00:01:31.030> in<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:31.390> material

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
as you can see now I'm in the material

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.720 
as you can see now I'm in the material
and<00:01:32.020> able<00:01:32.770> to<00:01:32.890> actually<00:01:33.040> go<00:01:33.400> in<00:01:33.520> whatever

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
and able to actually go in whatever

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.790 
and able to actually go in whatever
direction<00:01:34.060> I<00:01:34.450> want<00:01:34.660> to<00:01:34.870> without<00:01:35.320> using<00:01:35.620> a

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
direction I want to without using a

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.580 
direction I want to without using a
drill<00:01:36.270> okay<00:01:37.270> so<00:01:37.330> the<00:01:37.540> next<00:01:37.570> thing<00:01:37.870> we're<00:01:38.470> gonna

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
drill okay so the next thing we're gonna

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.350 
drill okay so the next thing we're gonna
look<00:01:38.710> at<00:01:38.860> is<00:01:38.920> how<00:01:39.130> black<00:01:39.670> and<00:01:39.910> decker<00:01:40.060> have

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
look at is how black and decker have

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.410 
look at is how black and decker have

how can you make it easier for the user
to<00:01:53.680> actually<00:01:54.250> use<00:01:54.550> gone<00:01:55.480> are<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.690> actual

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
to actually use gone are the actual

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.480 
to actually use gone are the actual
screwdriver<00:01:56.590> slots<00:01:57.010> for<00:01:57.190> actually<00:01:57.460> doing

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
screwdriver slots for actually doing

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.400 
screwdriver slots for actually doing
your<00:01:57.760> blade<00:01:57.940> changes<00:01:58.270> and<00:01:58.780> we've<00:01:59.260> actually

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
your blade changes and we've actually

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.260 
your blade changes and we've actually
moved<00:01:59.710> over<00:02:00.070> to<00:02:00.250> a<00:02:00.280> lever<00:02:00.640> now<00:02:00.880> which<00:02:01.000> can<00:02:01.180> be

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
moved over to a lever now which can be

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.560 
moved over to a lever now which can be
simply<00:02:01.780> pulled<00:02:02.020> back<00:02:02.260> by<00:02:02.290> your<00:02:02.650> finger<00:02:03.510> so<00:02:04.510> you

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
simply pulled back by your finger so you

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.240 
simply pulled back by your finger so you
pull<00:02:04.870> this<00:02:05.020> trigger<00:02:05.290> right<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.710> way<00:02:05.830> up<00:02:06.010> and

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
pull this trigger right the way up and

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.860 
pull this trigger right the way up and
this<00:02:06.670> enables<00:02:07.090> you<00:02:07.150> to<00:02:07.210> actually<00:02:07.390> put<00:02:07.750> the

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
this enables you to actually put the

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.410 
this enables you to actually put the
blade<00:02:08.080> in<00:02:08.320> as<00:02:08.980> soon<00:02:09.220> as<00:02:09.340> you<00:02:09.430> release<00:02:09.550> it<00:02:09.700> it's

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
blade in as soon as you release it it's

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.270 
blade in as soon as you release it it's
actually<00:02:10.600> grabbed<00:02:11.230> that<00:02:11.440> blade<00:02:11.770> and<00:02:12.040> it's<00:02:12.130> not

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
actually grabbed that blade and it's not

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.090 
actually grabbed that blade and it's not
going<00:02:12.430> to<00:02:12.520> come<00:02:12.670> out<00:02:13.170> if<00:02:14.170> you<00:02:14.440> look<00:02:14.590> here<00:02:14.860> and

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
going to come out if you look here and

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.580 
going to come out if you look here and
move<00:02:15.400> this<00:02:15.430> lever<00:02:16.090> forward<00:02:16.630> you<00:02:17.260> can<00:02:17.440> actually

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
move this lever forward you can actually

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.550 
move this lever forward you can actually
see<00:02:17.800> through<00:02:18.310> this<00:02:18.460> window<00:02:18.700> here<00:02:19.440> that<00:02:20.440> we

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
see through this window here that we

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.610 
see through this window here that we
actually<00:02:20.710> set<00:02:21.100> on<00:02:21.340> zero<00:02:21.970> degrees<00:02:22.510> as<00:02:22.810> we

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
actually set on zero degrees as we

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.890 
actually set on zero degrees as we
adjust<00:02:23.740> the<00:02:24.160> base<00:02:24.400> into<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.510> viewing<00:02:25.870> window

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
adjust the base into the viewing window

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.610 
adjust the base into the viewing window
shows<00:02:26.680> exactly<00:02:27.130> and<00:02:27.610> precisely<00:02:28.080> what<00:02:29.080> angle

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
shows exactly and precisely what angle

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.130 
shows exactly and precisely what angle
the<00:02:29.800> jigsaw<00:02:30.220> is<00:02:30.250> actually<00:02:30.820> yom<00:02:31.090> set<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:32.020> the

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
the jigsaw is actually yom set to the

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.960 
the jigsaw is actually yom set to the
base<00:02:32.350> and<00:02:32.709> then<00:02:33.220> when<00:02:33.370> you're<00:02:33.459> happy<00:02:33.610> you<00:02:33.730> just

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
base and then when you're happy you just

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.240 
base and then when you're happy you just
simply<00:02:34.180> push<00:02:34.540> this<00:02:34.690> lever<00:02:34.930> down<00:02:35.260> it's<00:02:35.830> locked

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
simply push this lever down it's locked

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.240 
simply push this lever down it's locked
into<00:02:36.610> place<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.150> you<00:02:37.390> can't<00:02:37.660> move<00:02:37.930> it<00:02:38.110> again

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
into place and you can't move it again

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.740 
into place and you can't move it again
or<00:02:39.250> what<00:02:39.670> we've<00:02:39.790> actually<00:02:39.940> come<00:02:40.180> up<00:02:40.330> with<00:02:40.480> here

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
or what we've actually come up with here

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.770 
or what we've actually come up with here
is<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.930> new<00:02:41.290> system<00:02:41.800> called<00:02:42.070> Auto<00:02:42.640> Select<00:02:43.480> and

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
is a new system called Auto Select and

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.470 
is a new system called Auto Select and
what<00:02:44.470> we<00:02:44.620> have<00:02:44.830> is<00:02:45.010> still<00:02:45.340> pendulum<00:02:45.940> action<00:02:46.300> as

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
what we have is still pendulum action as

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.690 
what we have is still pendulum action as
you<00:02:46.690> found<00:02:46.930> on<00:02:47.050> our<00:02:47.170> other<00:02:47.290> jigsaws<00:02:47.830> but<00:02:48.550> this

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
you found on our other jigsaws but this

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.790 
you found on our other jigsaws but this
is<00:02:48.850> really<00:02:49.480> actually<00:02:49.720> takes<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.230> hard<00:02:50.560> work

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
is really actually takes the hard work

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.340 
is really actually takes the hard work
out<00:02:51.070> of<00:02:51.250> pendulum<00:02:51.670> action<00:02:52.060> this<00:02:52.840> simple

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
out of pendulum action this simple

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.500 
out of pendulum action this simple
symbol<00:02:53.680> is<00:02:53.980> actually<00:02:54.340> just<00:02:54.520> actually<00:02:55.090> are

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
symbol is actually just actually are

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.870 
symbol is actually just actually are
designed<00:02:55.930> so<00:02:56.650> you<00:02:56.680> actually<00:02:57.010> line<00:02:57.520> up<00:02:57.550> a

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
designed so you actually line up a

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.479 
designed so you actually line up a
picture<00:02:58.480> with<00:02:59.050> what<00:02:59.320> is<00:02:59.530> most<00:02:59.980> suitable<00:03:00.370> for

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
picture with what is most suitable for

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.460 
picture with what is most suitable for
you<00:03:00.670> actually<00:03:00.940> to<00:03:01.060> be<00:03:01.090> cutting<00:03:01.690> and<00:03:01.930> it

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
you actually to be cutting and it

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.500 
you actually to be cutting and it
automatically<00:03:03.190> sets<00:03:03.610> the<00:03:03.910> speed<00:03:04.239> of<00:03:04.390> the

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
automatically sets the speed of the

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.140 
automatically sets the speed of the
jigsaw<00:03:04.989> and<00:03:05.200> actually<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.250> pendulum<00:03:06.760> action

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
jigsaw and actually the pendulum action

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.740 
jigsaw and actually the pendulum action
as<00:03:07.300> well<00:03:07.510> this<00:03:08.350> just<00:03:08.590> takes<00:03:08.860> that<00:03:09.040> the

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
as well this just takes that the

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.330 
as well this just takes that the
calculations<00:03:10.750> out<00:03:10.930> of<00:03:11.110> it<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:11.380> from<00:03:11.920> lots<00:03:12.160> of

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
calculations out of it and from lots of

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.550 
calculations out of it and from lots of
research<00:03:12.760> research<00:03:13.300> and<00:03:13.480> design<00:03:13.600> we<00:03:14.380> know

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
research research and design we know

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.830 
research research and design we know
this<00:03:14.709> actually<00:03:15.040> set<00:03:15.250> your<00:03:15.430> jigsaw<00:03:15.820> or<00:03:16.150> up<00:03:16.330> for

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
this actually set your jigsaw or up for

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.520 
this actually set your jigsaw or up for
the<00:03:16.930> perfect<00:03:17.470> application<00:03:19.350> moving<00:03:20.350> across

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
the perfect application moving across

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.500 
the perfect application moving across
the<00:03:20.620> jigsaw<00:03:21.220> we've<00:03:21.790> also<00:03:21.970> thought<00:03:22.300> about

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
the jigsaw we've also thought about

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.420 
the jigsaw we've also thought about
blade<00:03:22.840> storage<00:03:23.260> there's<00:03:24.040> hundreds<00:03:24.400> of

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
blade storage there's hundreds of

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.979 
blade storage there's hundreds of
different<00:03:24.580> types<00:03:25.030> of<00:03:25.150> jigsaw<00:03:25.570> blades<00:03:25.840> that

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
different types of jigsaw blades that

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.900 
different types of jigsaw blades that
can<00:03:26.050> be<00:03:26.290> used<00:03:26.530> but<00:03:27.160> what<00:03:27.340> we've<00:03:27.489> actually<00:03:27.670> done

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
can be used but what we've actually done

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.270 
can be used but what we've actually done
is<00:03:28.270> just<00:03:28.450> to<00:03:28.570> make<00:03:28.720> it<00:03:28.750> easy<00:03:29.050> the<00:03:29.590> most<00:03:29.830> common

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
is just to make it easy the most common

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.740 
is just to make it easy the most common
types<00:03:30.520> can<00:03:30.790> actually<00:03:31.060> be<00:03:31.150> kept<00:03:31.450> in<00:03:31.630> this

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
types can actually be kept in this

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.120 
types can actually be kept in this
cassette<00:03:32.140> on<00:03:32.320> the<00:03:32.410> side<00:03:32.620> of<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:32.800> machine

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
cassette on the side of the machine

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.729 
cassette on the side of the machine
we've<00:03:33.430> actually<00:03:33.580> fitted<00:03:34.320> magnetic<00:03:35.320> pads<00:03:35.560> in

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
we've actually fitted magnetic pads in

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.830 
we've actually fitted magnetic pads in
there<00:03:35.770> which<00:03:36.760> actually<00:03:37.000> hold<00:03:37.329> the<00:03:37.450> blade<00:03:37.630> so

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
there which actually hold the blade so

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.300 
there which actually hold the blade so
they<00:03:37.959> don't<00:03:38.140> just<00:03:38.260> fall<00:03:38.470> out<00:03:38.530> on<00:03:38.829> the<00:03:38.920> floor<00:03:39.130> as

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
they don't just fall out on the floor as

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.400 
they don't just fall out on the floor as
soon<00:03:39.459> as<00:03:39.549> you<00:03:39.609> open<00:03:39.880> the<00:03:39.970> door<00:03:40.180> and<00:03:40.420> then<00:03:41.290> to

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
soon as you open the door and then to

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.300 
soon as you open the door and then to
put<00:03:41.590> them<00:03:41.709> back<00:03:41.799> in<00:03:42.010> again

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
put them back in again

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.940 
put them back in again
simply<00:03:43.000> grips<00:03:43.330> using<00:03:44.140> the<00:03:44.230> magnets<00:03:44.680> and<00:03:44.890> they

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
simply grips using the magnets and they

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.610 
simply grips using the magnets and they
have<00:03:45.610> a<00:03:45.640> nice<00:03:45.819> snap<00:03:46.239> down<00:03:46.420> firm<00:03:46.780> lead<00:03:47.050> which

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
have a nice snap down firm lead which

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.500 
have a nice snap down firm lead which
stops<00:03:47.950> any<00:03:48.250> charge<00:03:48.640> of<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:48.849> blades<00:03:49.120> actually

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
stops any charge of the blades actually

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.360 
stops any charge of the blades actually
fallen<00:03:49.840> out<00:03:49.989> the<00:03:50.650> advantage<00:03:51.099> of<00:03:51.160> this<00:03:51.310> is

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
fallen out the advantage of this is

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.160 
fallen out the advantage of this is
you've<00:03:51.610> always<00:03:51.910> got<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.180> right<00:03:52.390> blade<00:03:52.720> with

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
you've always got the right blade with

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.589 
you've always got the right blade with
your<00:03:53.319> jigsaw<00:03:53.880> looking<00:03:54.880> down<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.180> top<00:03:55.390> of<00:03:55.510> the

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 
your jigsaw looking down the top of the

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.809 
your jigsaw looking down the top of the
jigsaw<00:03:55.989> again<00:03:56.530> what<00:03:56.860> we've<00:03:57.010> actually<00:03:57.160> done<00:03:57.340> is

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
jigsaw again what we've actually done is

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.330 
jigsaw again what we've actually done is
looked<00:03:58.450> at<00:03:58.599> a<00:03:58.690> way<00:03:58.870> of<00:03:59.019> actually<00:03:59.340> increasing

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
looked at a way of actually increasing

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.490 
looked at a way of actually increasing
the<00:04:00.459> actual<00:04:00.819> sight<00:04:01.090> line<00:04:01.390> again<00:04:01.690> so<00:04:02.260> you<00:04:02.380> can

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
the actual sight line again so you can

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.630 
the actual sight line again so you can
be<00:04:02.590> confident<00:04:03.069> you<00:04:03.220> can<00:04:03.340> actually<00:04:03.459> see

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
be confident you can actually see

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.250 
be confident you can actually see
exactly<00:04:04.269> where<00:04:04.569> you're<00:04:04.690> cutting<00:04:04.870> against

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
exactly where you're cutting against

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
once you actually finished work you

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.120 
once you actually finished work you
haven't<00:04:31.870> got<00:04:31.990> so<00:04:32.139> much<00:04:32.290> clearing<00:04:32.710> up<00:04:32.800> to<00:04:32.919> do<00:04:33.040> at

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
haven't got so much clearing up to do at

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.550 
haven't got so much clearing up to do at
the<00:04:33.220> end<00:04:33.630> but<00:04:34.630> if<00:04:34.720> we<00:04:34.780> actually<00:04:34.990> look<00:04:35.139> along

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
the end but if we actually look along

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.560 
the end but if we actually look along
here<00:04:35.830> this<00:04:36.580> machine<00:04:36.970> has<00:04:37.120> a<00:04:37.180> compass

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
here this machine has a compass

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.360 
here this machine has a compass
something<00:04:37.810> completely<00:04:38.260> different<00:04:38.500> which<00:04:39.340> is

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
something completely different which is

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.850 
something completely different which is
actually<00:04:39.850> the<00:04:39.910> dust<00:04:40.150> extraction<00:04:40.860> continuing

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
actually the dust extraction continuing

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.770 
actually the dust extraction continuing
right<00:04:42.340> to<00:04:42.550> where<00:04:42.729> the<00:04:42.760> blade<00:04:43.180> actually<00:04:43.389> pops

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
right to where the blade actually pops

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.990 
right to where the blade actually pops
out<00:04:44.020> the<00:04:44.200> machine<00:04:44.560> this<00:04:45.250> enables<00:04:45.610> to<00:04:45.729> suck

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
out the machine this enables to suck

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.670 
out the machine this enables to suck
away<00:04:46.150> very<00:04:46.570> closely<00:04:46.900> to<00:04:47.140> the<00:04:47.260> blade<00:04:47.500> itself

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
away very closely to the blade itself

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.090 
away very closely to the blade itself
and<00:04:48.220> really<00:04:49.060> see<00:04:49.330> the<00:04:49.810> visibility<00:04:50.470> of<00:04:50.650> the

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
and really see the visibility of the

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.550 
and really see the visibility of the
pencil<00:04:51.520> line<00:04:51.669> that<00:04:51.820> you're<00:04:51.940> actually<00:04:52.060> cutting

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
pencil line that you're actually cutting

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
pencil line that you're actually cutting
ok<00:04:53.560> we're<00:04:53.710> going<00:04:53.800> to<00:04:53.860> actually<00:04:53.979> show<00:04:54.280> you<00:04:54.340> with

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
ok we're going to actually show you with

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.580 
ok we're going to actually show you with
a<00:04:54.610> jigsaw<00:04:55.120> how<00:04:55.690> to<00:04:55.750> actually<00:04:55.990> do<00:04:56.169> a<00:04:56.200> proper

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
a jigsaw how to actually do a proper

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.219 
a jigsaw how to actually do a proper
application<00:04:57.030> so<00:04:58.030> I've<00:04:58.120> got<00:04:58.240> some<00:04:58.450> skirting

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
application so I've got some skirting

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:00.750 
application so I've got some skirting
board<00:04:59.470> here<00:04:59.740> we're<00:05:00.190> going<00:05:00.310> to<00:05:00.370> need<00:05:00.460> to<00:05:00.580> cut<00:05:00.729> a

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
board here we're going to need to cut a

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.940 
board here we're going to need to cut a
45-degree<00:05:01.630> angle<00:05:01.930> on<00:05:01.990> it<00:05:02.020> so<00:05:02.200> he<00:05:02.289> fits<00:05:02.650> into<00:05:02.830> a

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
45-degree angle on it so he fits into a

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.040 
45-degree angle on it so he fits into a
corner<00:05:03.310> so<00:05:03.880> the<00:05:04.210> jigsaw<00:05:04.570> is<00:05:04.600> actually<00:05:04.870> set<00:05:05.020> up

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
corner so the jigsaw is actually set up

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.620 
corner so the jigsaw is actually set up
ready<00:05:05.260> to<00:05:05.350> go<00:05:05.650> for<00:05:05.800> that<00:05:05.919> application<00:05:06.630> that

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
ready to go for that application that

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.029 
ready to go for that application that
would<00:05:07.720> be<00:05:07.810> just<00:05:07.990> too<00:05:08.169> easy<00:05:08.350> to<00:05:08.590> leave<00:05:08.710> it<00:05:08.890> like

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
would be just too easy to leave it like

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:10.680 
would be just too easy to leave it like
that<00:05:09.070> let's<00:05:09.490> show<00:05:09.700> you<00:05:09.729> how<00:05:10.060> I<00:05:10.090> got<00:05:10.390> it<00:05:10.479> there

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
that let's show you how I got it there

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.840 
that let's show you how I got it there
it's<00:05:11.380> very<00:05:11.620> easy<00:05:11.770> we<00:05:12.039> just<00:05:12.070> actually<00:05:12.370> take<00:05:12.729> it

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
it's very easy we just actually take it

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.969 
it's very easy we just actually take it
completely<00:05:13.360> back<00:05:13.570> out<00:05:13.780> again<00:05:13.990> and<00:05:14.620> set<00:05:14.860> it<00:05:14.950> up

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
completely back out again and set it up

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:16.379 
completely back out again and set it up
as<00:05:15.160> if<00:05:15.250> it<00:05:15.370> you<00:05:15.490> just<00:05:15.700> bought<00:05:15.880> it<00:05:15.910> out<00:05:16.210> of<00:05:16.240> the

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
as if it you just bought it out of the

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:19.529 
as if it you just bought it out of the
box<00:05:17.039> now<00:05:18.039> we<00:05:18.100> need<00:05:18.400> to<00:05:18.430> we<00:05:18.820> know<00:05:19.060> we<00:05:19.270> need<00:05:19.419> to

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
box now we need to we know we need to

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:21.600 
box now we need to we know we need to
cut<00:05:19.720> a<00:05:19.750> 45-degree<00:05:20.590> angle<00:05:20.950> so<00:05:21.190> the<00:05:21.220> first<00:05:21.520> thing

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
cut a 45-degree angle so the first thing

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.180 
cut a 45-degree angle so the first thing
to<00:05:21.820> do<00:05:21.970> is<00:05:22.180> actually<00:05:22.750> slacking<00:05:23.470> off<00:05:23.590> the<00:05:23.950> shoe

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
to do is actually slacking off the shoe

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.300 
to do is actually slacking off the shoe
and<00:05:24.550> then<00:05:24.729> we<00:05:25.389> actually<00:05:25.720> dial<00:05:25.960> in<00:05:26.310> 45

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
and then we actually dial in 45

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.620 
and then we actually dial in 45
hopefully<00:05:27.580> you<00:05:27.789> can<00:05:27.880> just<00:05:28.090> see<00:05:28.240> that<00:05:28.270> in<00:05:28.510> that

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
hopefully you can just see that in that

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.210 
hopefully you can just see that in that
window<00:05:28.930> that<00:05:29.080> it's<00:05:29.169> nice<00:05:29.289> and<00:05:29.350> clear<00:05:29.710> for<00:05:29.889> me<00:05:29.919> I

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
window that it's nice and clear for me I

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.550 
window that it's nice and clear for me I
push<00:05:31.150> the<00:05:31.270> lever<00:05:31.389> over<00:05:31.600> and<00:05:31.840> lock<00:05:31.990> that<00:05:32.320> and

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
push the lever over and lock that and

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.680 
push the lever over and lock that and
that<00:05:33.190> enables<00:05:33.550> the<00:05:33.729> sexual<00:05:34.060> base<00:05:34.240> to<00:05:34.479> stay

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
that enables the sexual base to stay

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.080 
that enables the sexual base to stay
exactly<00:05:34.840> where<00:05:35.200> it<00:05:35.380> needs<00:05:35.410> to<00:05:35.650> be<00:05:35.940> then<00:05:36.940> I

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
exactly where it needs to be then I

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.879 
exactly where it needs to be then I
simply<00:05:37.419> look<00:05:37.570> at<00:05:37.720> these<00:05:37.840> these<00:05:38.200> actual<00:05:38.650> where

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:38.889 
simply look at these these actual where

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:41.279 
simply look at these these actual where
pictures<00:05:39.220> here<00:05:39.610> and<00:05:39.639> relate<00:05:40.090> it<00:05:40.120> to<00:05:40.300> what<00:05:40.720> I'm

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 
pictures here and relate it to what I'm

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:42.990 
pictures here and relate it to what I'm
cutting<00:05:41.770> well<00:05:42.460> I'm<00:05:42.550> not<00:05:42.639> cutting<00:05:42.970> the

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
cutting well I'm not cutting the

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.670 
cutting well I'm not cutting the
tortoise<00:05:43.539> but<00:05:44.110> I<00:05:44.139> now<00:05:44.320> I'm<00:05:44.410> going<00:05:44.530> to<00:05:44.590> be

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
tortoise but I now I'm going to be

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.170 
tortoise but I now I'm going to be
cutting<00:05:44.830> wood<00:05:45.130> so<00:05:45.580> what<00:05:45.729> I'm<00:05:45.820> going<00:05:45.940> to<00:05:45.970> do<00:05:46.090> is

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
cutting wood so what I'm going to do is

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.300 
cutting wood so what I'm going to do is
wet<00:05:46.389> this<00:05:46.539> straight<00:05:46.870> round<00:05:47.110> to<00:05:47.229> wood<00:05:47.590> it's

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
wet this straight round to wood it's

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.010 
wet this straight round to wood it's
actually<00:05:48.460> sets<00:05:48.880> the<00:05:49.000> right<00:05:49.210> speed<00:05:49.630> and<00:05:49.900> then

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
actually sets the right speed and then

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.659 
actually sets the right speed and then
the<00:05:50.139> right<00:05:50.320> pendulum<00:05:50.830> action<00:05:51.190> and<00:05:51.400> there

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
the right pendulum action and there

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:53.130 
the right pendulum action and there
should<00:05:51.849> be<00:05:51.940> good<00:05:52.090> to<00:05:52.150> go<00:05:52.270> let's<00:05:52.630> see<00:05:52.960> how<00:05:53.020> we

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:53.140 
should be good to go let's see how we

00:05:53.140 --> 00:06:17.820 
should be good to go let's see how we
get<00:05:53.260> on

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.710 

so<00:06:18.830> we're<00:06:18.980> going<00:06:19.070> to<00:06:19.190> cut<00:06:19.370> the<00:06:19.720> hardest

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 
so we're going to cut the hardest

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.270 
so we're going to cut the hardest
hardest<00:06:20.960> piece<00:06:21.260> of<00:06:21.440> material<00:06:21.620> to<00:06:21.920> cut<00:06:22.130> of<00:06:22.220> a

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 
hardest piece of material to cut of a

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.550 
hardest piece of material to cut of a
jigsaw<00:06:22.670> and<00:06:22.850> I've<00:06:23.630> got<00:06:23.810> to<00:06:23.900> make<00:06:24.020> sure<00:06:24.050> I've
