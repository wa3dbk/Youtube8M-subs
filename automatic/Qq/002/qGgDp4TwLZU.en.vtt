abdominus okay then what we did was we

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.109 
abdominus okay then what we did was we
work<00:01:34.780> on<00:01:35.020> a<00:01:35.050> block<00:01:35.800> of<00:01:36.130> muscles<00:01:36.640> in<00:01:36.910> the<00:01:37.090> neck

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
work on a block of muscles in the neck

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.080

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.570 
both sides of the neck and so when we
scanned<00:01:44.050> both<00:01:44.259> sides<00:01:44.560> of<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.830> neck<00:01:45.009> we<00:01:45.340> saw

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
scanned both sides of the neck we saw

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.280 
scanned both sides of the neck we saw
some<00:01:45.850> things<00:01:45.880> we<00:01:46.240> had<00:01:46.390> to<00:01:46.420> preserve<00:01:46.869> for<00:01:47.140> later

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290

under<00:02:10.239> the<00:02:10.360> jaw<00:02:10.540> the<00:02:10.959> digastric<00:02:11.380> muscle<00:02:12.750> we

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
under the jaw the digastric muscle we

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.949 
under the jaw the digastric muscle we
found<00:02:14.019> the<00:02:14.440> Milo<00:02:15.130> highway<00:02:15.610> with<00:02:16.450> I<00:02:16.570> gastric

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
found the Milo highway with I gastric

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.979 
found the Milo highway with I gastric
would<00:02:17.140> be<00:02:17.290> my<00:02:17.739> low-high<00:02:17.920> explained<00:02:18.370> like<00:02:18.549> this

would be my low-high explained like this
we<00:02:19.989> found<00:02:20.200> up<00:02:20.470> under<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.370> mylohyoid<00:02:22.049> one<00:02:23.049> that

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
we found up under the mylohyoid one that

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.020 
we found up under the mylohyoid one that
goes<00:02:23.440> straight<00:02:23.680> up<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:24.190> down<00:02:24.250> called<00:02:24.670> Jeanne

Ohio<00:02:25.480> aight<00:02:25.750> we<00:02:26.620> went<00:02:26.830> below<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.160> hyoid<00:02:27.580> and

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
Ohio aight we went below the hyoid and

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.910 
Ohio aight we went below the hyoid and
we<00:02:28.360> found<00:02:28.600> and<00:02:28.959> my<00:02:29.140> cat's<00:02:29.380> not<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.769> best

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
we found and my cat's not the best

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.400 
we found and my cat's not the best
example<00:02:30.070> because<00:02:30.730> this<00:02:30.910> one<00:02:31.060> has<00:02:31.090> been<00:02:31.480> pretty

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
example because this one has been pretty

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.560 
example because this one has been pretty
badly<00:02:32.709> suffered<00:02:33.160> when<00:02:33.250> they<00:02:33.400> injected<00:02:33.820> it<00:02:33.970> the

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
badly suffered when they injected it the

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.690 
badly suffered when they injected it the
sternohyoid<00:02:35.290> going<00:02:35.830> from<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.070> sternum<00:02:36.549> to

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
sternohyoid going from the sternum to

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.170 
sternohyoid going from the sternum to
the<00:02:36.820> hyoid<00:02:37.060> is<00:02:37.540> a<00:02:37.810> big<00:02:38.019> long<00:02:38.230> one<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:38.820> then<00:02:39.820> if

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
the hyoid is a big long one and then if

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.830 
the hyoid is a big long one and then if
you<00:02:40.420> look<00:02:41.280> laterally<00:02:42.299> under<00:02:43.299> the<00:02:43.420> sternohyoid

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
you look laterally under the sternohyoid

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.650 
you look laterally under the sternohyoid
you'll<00:02:44.530> find<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:45.459> thyroid<00:02:45.880> cartilage<00:02:45.910> and

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
you'll find the thyroid cartilage and

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.960 
you'll find the thyroid cartilage and
thyroid<00:02:47.230> muscle<00:02:47.709> a<00:02:47.860> thyroid<00:02:48.220> gland<00:02:48.459> excuse<00:02:48.820> me

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
thyroid muscle a thyroid gland excuse me

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
whole length of the sternohyoid one only

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.699 
whole length of the sternohyoid one only
goes<00:02:57.459> up<00:02:57.489> to<00:02:57.760> that<00:02:58.120> thyroid<00:02:58.329> cartilage<00:02:58.930> sterno

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
goes up to that thyroid cartilage sterno

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.180 
goes up to that thyroid cartilage sterno
thyroid<00:03:00.549> okay<00:03:01.480> and<00:03:01.720> then<00:03:02.350> one<00:03:02.530> goes<00:03:02.769> along<00:03:03.160> the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
thyroid okay and then one goes along the

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.069 
thyroid okay and then one goes along the
edge<00:03:03.459> of<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.790> thyroid<00:03:04.000> cartilage<00:03:04.180> up<00:03:04.840> to<00:03:04.959> the

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
high weight and

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.680 
high weight and
the<00:03:06.250> thyrohyoid<00:03:07.140> yes<00:03:08.140> right<00:03:08.409> there<00:03:08.590> okay<00:03:09.690> that

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
the thyrohyoid yes right there okay that

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.750 
the thyrohyoid yes right there okay that
goes<00:03:10.900> back<00:03:11.049> into<00:03:11.290> place<00:03:11.560> there<00:03:12.280> was<00:03:12.430> another

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
goes back into place there was another

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.640 
goes back into place there was another
muscle<00:03:13.150> that<00:03:13.450> we<00:03:13.569> found<00:03:13.750> attached<00:03:14.260> to<00:03:14.530> the

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
muscle that we found attached to the

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.210 
muscle that we found attached to the
sternum<00:03:15.040> and<00:03:15.430> that<00:03:15.909> was<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.239> sterno<00:03:17.220> mastoid

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
sternum and that was the sterno mastoid

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.580 
sternum and that was the sterno mastoid
went<00:03:18.430> to<00:03:18.549> the<00:03:18.670> mastoid<00:03:19.090> process<00:03:19.750> and<00:03:20.049> the

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
went to the mastoid process and the

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.320 
went to the mastoid process and the
sternomastoid<00:03:21.099> was<00:03:21.489> very<00:03:21.730> close<00:03:22.030> to<00:03:22.060> the

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
sternomastoid was very close to the

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.500 
sternomastoid was very close to the
clave<00:03:22.780> Oh<00:03:22.930> trapezius<00:03:23.799> so<00:03:24.790> we<00:03:24.910> actually<00:03:25.060> had<00:03:25.390> to

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
clave Oh trapezius so we actually had to

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.830 
clave Oh trapezius so we actually had to
separate<00:03:26.049> those<00:03:26.319> two<00:03:26.709> get<00:03:27.340> to<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:28.269> slide<00:03:28.810> Oh

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
separate those two get to the slide Oh

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.289 
separate those two get to the slide Oh
math<00:03:29.709> boys<00:03:30.069> all<00:03:30.430> right<00:03:30.760> we<00:03:30.940> didn't<00:03:31.180> do<00:03:31.269> that

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
math boys all right we didn't do that

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:32.520 
math boys all right we didn't do that
one<00:03:31.540> that<00:03:31.690> we<00:03:31.810> do<00:03:31.930> I<00:03:31.959> should<00:03:32.200> do<00:03:32.290> it<00:03:32.349> on<00:03:32.410> the
