00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
could care less about them other than

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.650 
could care less about them other than
the<00:00:34.610> lines<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.910> stuff<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.360> we're<00:00:36.570> gonna

the lines and stuff that we're gonna

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.530 
the lines and stuff that we're gonna
replace<00:00:37.079> because<00:00:37.590> those<00:00:37.770> are<00:00:37.950> pretty<00:00:38.129> much

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
replace because those are pretty much

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.889
