the<00:00:59.309> consistency<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.420> little<00:01:00.960> bit<00:01:01.140> thick<00:01:01.559> it

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
the consistency is a little bit thick it

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.990 
the consistency is a little bit thick it
doesn't<00:01:02.160> spread<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:02.850> well<00:01:03.030> on<00:01:03.059> my<00:01:03.329> cheeks<00:01:03.690> done
