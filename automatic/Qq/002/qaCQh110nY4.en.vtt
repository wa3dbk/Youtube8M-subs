functions if I need to do so I just

what I want you to take away from this

identity of the elements is completely
irrelevant<00:05:41.470> the<00:05:42.010> underlying<00:05:42.310> behavior<00:05:43.060> is

irrelevant the underlying behavior is

irrelevant the underlying behavior is
what<00:05:43.360> we're<00:05:43.480> concerned<00:05:43.780> with<00:05:43.930> and<00:05:44.230> the

what we're concerned with and the

what we're concerned with and the
