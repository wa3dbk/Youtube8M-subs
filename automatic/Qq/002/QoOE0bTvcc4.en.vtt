00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
and hypnosis is black culture so it can

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.749 
and hypnosis is black culture so it can
use<00:01:50.070> this<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.399> hypnotize<00:01:51.149> people<00:01:52.189> not<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.549> got

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
use this to hypnotize people not you got

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.530 
use this to hypnotize people not you got
it<00:01:54.060> doesn't<00:01:54.329> really<00:01:54.420> work<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.869> think<00:01:55.310> sure<00:01:56.540> that

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
it doesn't really work I think sure that

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.789 
it doesn't really work I think sure that
increases<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.259> speed<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.560> guess<00:01:58.860> yeah<00:01:59.369> does

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
increases the speed I guess yeah does

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.350 
increases the speed I guess yeah does
then<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:02.159> can<00:02:02.369> jump<00:02:02.579> into<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.939> premium
