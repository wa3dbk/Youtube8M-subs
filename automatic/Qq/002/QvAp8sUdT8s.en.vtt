show you that the NYC like you can see
for<00:01:25.100> NYC<00:01:25.759> is<00:01:25.939> like<00:01:26.210> has<00:01:26.720> like<00:01:26.929> an<00:01:27.080> empty<00:01:27.350> strip

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
for NYC is like has like an empty strip

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:29.139 
for NYC is like has like an empty strip
in<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:27.799> middle<00:01:27.860> because<00:01:28.220> depending<00:01:28.729> on<00:01:29.030> the

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
in the middle because depending on the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.389 
in the middle because depending on the
best<00:01:29.330> quality<00:01:29.479> it's<00:01:30.470> more<00:01:30.710> of<00:01:30.860> a<00:01:30.920> gray<00:01:31.130> black

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
best quality it's more of a gray black

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.880 
best quality it's more of a gray black
where<00:01:32.390> this<00:01:32.600> one<00:01:32.869> definitely<00:01:33.350> black

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
where this one definitely black

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.679 
where this one definitely black
definitely<00:01:34.610> strong<00:01:34.880> I<00:01:35.060> make<00:01:35.240> out<00:01:35.420> of<00:01:35.570> its

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
definitely strong I make out of its

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.449 
definitely strong I make out of its
thick<00:01:35.869> line<00:01:36.080> for<00:01:36.289> both<00:01:36.409> I'm<00:01:36.649> just<00:01:36.770> trying<00:01:37.039> pair

00:01:37.449 --> 00:01:37.459 
thick line for both I'm just trying pair

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:39.760 
thick line for both I'm just trying pair
a<00:01:37.700> little<00:01:38.420> bit<00:01:38.569> easier<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:39.289> color<00:01:39.530> wise<00:01:39.740> I

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
a little bit easier the color wise I

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.850 
a little bit easier the color wise I
guess<00:01:40.159> so<00:01:40.850> you<00:01:40.940> can<00:01:41.090> see<00:01:41.330> that<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:42.470> Revlon

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
guess so you can see that the Revlon

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.539 
guess so you can see that the Revlon
just<00:01:42.890> wins<00:01:43.670> and<00:01:44.030> that<00:01:44.149> 1i<00:01:44.360> in<00:01:44.690> my<00:01:44.869> opinion

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
just wins and that 1i in my opinion

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.109 
just wins and that 1i in my opinion
those<00:01:46.549> are<00:01:46.759> with<00:01:46.880> the<00:01:46.970> two<00:01:47.090> islanders<00:01:47.539> are<00:01:47.690> I

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
those are with the two islanders are I

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.820 
those are with the two islanders are I
bought<00:01:50.119> this<00:01:50.390> I<00:01:50.630> don't<00:01:50.869> really<00:01:51.020> regret<00:01:51.259> buying

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
bought this I don't really regret buying

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.980 
bought this I don't really regret buying
it<00:01:52.159> because<00:01:52.280> it's<00:01:52.640> still<00:01:53.149> completely<00:01:53.450> fine
