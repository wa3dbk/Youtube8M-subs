 chris paul 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.049
 m 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.680
 hello that such friends are welcome to 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.470
 a new video in which we are going to 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.700
 be watching a little bit about this 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.650
 plugin that what allows us is in 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.960
 a map we will not be able to insert 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.870
 images either from internet of any 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.630
 page that we can take out and we can 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.220
 insert an image no and then the ping is 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.440
 extremely simple you do not need any 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.970
 type of configuration just what 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.100
 we download and what we are going to do is 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:48.030
 put in the pro folder and of our 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.710
 bukit server would have my server already 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.230
 I put in the folder and what I'm going to 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.090
 do is execute it 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.230
 I'm going to press the video while it happens 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.940
 this 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.770
 and well we are already on the server 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.800
 minecraft in which I always use to 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.570
 Do the tests 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.040
 and once here what we are going to do 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.010
 let's do our inventory what 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.990
 let's look is a cloak 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.790
 once having the map 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.680
 we have it in hand we click 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.149
 right and we begin to see how they will see 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.869
 there we are visualizing what would be 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:21.390
 well the real map but now we are going to 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.560
 do let's continue there and we're going to 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.420
 direct to our internet 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.009
 let's go to any image any 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.590
 image as for example and I'm going to put the 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.610
 lower of my channel 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.370
 and the Wolf 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.210
 and will load us here 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:38.190
 so project and this link what we're going 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.330
 do what we copy we go again 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:45.180
 the server and what are we going to put map and 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.480
 the link and they will see what is going to start 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.480
 happen 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.070
 now in this great project I 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:57.130
 it looks like a very cool phenomenal plugin 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.110
 but I like it a lot 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.149
 and good here what we can do for 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.200
 example we have on our server so 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:07.560
 for we put him 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.390
 I put you, we take a frame and what 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.519
 we do what we are going to place in any 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.310
 structure either in the space where 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:18.030
 be and what we put here and as you will see 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.380
 it looks and everything all good 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.380
 let's see another image 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.620
 and had some loading we're going to take this 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.220
 that charges the internet is fine 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.680
 we see 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.840
 Well, this plan seemed to me quite 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:49.390
 curious not because we allow this thing 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.390
 that not all projects allow 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.700
 and those are worth it, let's see any 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.360
 image does not work as long as the anthem 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.360
 be so long 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:13.000
 and now it is loading not what would be the 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.000
 the image that you place 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.260
 Anna is loading has been loaded 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.160
 and as you will see there is the pixelated image 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.350
 some images look a little weird 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.980
 because they are in hd and thus pixelated 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.330
 they change but hey he looks is very curious 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.400
 the plugin since it allows us to put 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.519
 images 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.870
 in a simple map and nothing I think this 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:49.189
 it would be the whole tutorial of today 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:49.189
 I hope you liked it and nothing goodbye
