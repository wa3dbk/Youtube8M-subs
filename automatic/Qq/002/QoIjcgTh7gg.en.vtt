hello and welcome to my third lesson in

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.370 
hello and welcome to my third lesson in
armrest<00:00:02.429> Maya<00:00:02.899> today<00:00:03.899> we're<00:00:04.049> going<00:00:04.140> to<00:00:04.230> create

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
armrest Maya today we're going to create

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.690 
armrest Maya today we're going to create
a<00:00:04.440> simple<00:00:04.680> vaz<00:00:04.980> using<00:00:05.430> common<00:00:05.759> deformers<00:00:06.299> and

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:07.700 
a simple vaz using common deformers and

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.879 
a simple vaz using common deformers and
subdivisions<00:00:09.080> alright<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.200> start<00:00:10.290> off<00:00:10.590> we're

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
subdivisions alright to start off we're

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.499 
subdivisions alright to start off we're
just<00:00:11.040> gonna<00:00:11.160> create<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.639> simple<00:00:11.969> polygon

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
just gonna create a simple polygon

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.470 
just gonna create a simple polygon
sphere<00:00:13.490> notice<00:00:14.490> how<00:00:14.610> my<00:00:14.759> spheres<00:00:15.059> start<00:00:15.360> off

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
sphere notice how my spheres start off

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.480 
sphere notice how my spheres start off
in<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.750> middle<00:00:15.990> if<00:00:16.650> yours<00:00:16.859> isn't<00:00:17.100> starting

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
in the middle if yours isn't starting

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.529 
in the middle if yours isn't starting
off<00:00:17.670> in<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.910> middle<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.240> you<00:00:18.300> have<00:00:18.449> to

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
off in the middle and you have to

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.689 
off in the middle and you have to
interactively<00:00:19.170> place<00:00:19.590> your<00:00:19.830> sphere<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.520> just

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
interactively place your sphere you just

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.120 
interactively place your sphere you just
go<00:00:20.820> up<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.119> top<00:00:21.619> create<00:00:22.619> polygon

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
go up to the top create polygon

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.759 
go up to the top create polygon
primitives<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:24.119> deselect<00:00:24.810> interactive

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
primitives and deselect interactive

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.089 
primitives and deselect interactive
creation<00:00:26.900> alright<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:28.260> next<00:00:28.560> we're<00:00:29.070> just

creation alright so next we're just

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.189 
creation alright so next we're just
gonna<00:00:29.340> bump<00:00:29.580> down<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.910> subdivisions<00:00:30.599> here<00:00:30.779> to

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
gonna bump down the subdivisions here to

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.870 
gonna bump down the subdivisions here to
eight<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.969> eight<00:00:34.610> next<00:00:35.610> thing<00:00:35.700> we're<00:00:35.820> gonna

eight and eight next thing we're gonna
do<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.120> select<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.870> top<00:00:37.079> faces<00:00:38.090> all<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.149> top

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
do is select the top faces all the top

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.770 
do is select the top faces all the top
faces<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.730> we're<00:00:41.730> gonna<00:00:41.820> go<00:00:42.030> up<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.540> top

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
faces and we're gonna go up to the top

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.319 
faces and we're gonna go up to the top
we're<00:00:43.170> gonna<00:00:43.260> change<00:00:43.530> our<00:00:43.710> thing<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.640> polygons

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
we're gonna change our thing to polygons

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.340 
we're gonna change our thing to polygons
and<00:00:45.719> go<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.500> edit<00:00:46.710> mesh<00:00:47.039> extrude<00:00:48.170> I'm<00:00:49.170> just

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
and go to edit mesh extrude I'm just

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.110 
and go to edit mesh extrude I'm just
gonna<00:00:49.440> hit<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.739> hotkey<00:00:50.430> arm<00:00:50.640> like<00:00:50.940> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
gonna hit the hotkey arm like the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.000 
gonna hit the hotkey arm like the
keyboard<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:52.500> get<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> straighter

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
keyboard so we get a straighter

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.400 
keyboard so we get a straighter
extrusion<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.000> I'm<00:00:54.660> gonna<00:00:54.750> extrude<00:00:55.320> them

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
extrusion and I'm gonna extrude them

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.520 
extrusion and I'm gonna extrude them
inwards<00:00:56.190> now<00:00:57.180> I'm<00:00:57.239> gonna<00:00:57.329> hit<00:00:57.510> G<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.199> that'll

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
inwards now I'm gonna hit G and that'll

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.790 
inwards now I'm gonna hit G and that'll
screw<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.340> again<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:00.350> pull<00:01:01.350> them<00:01:01.469> up<00:01:01.590> where

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
screw it again and pull them up where

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.399 
screw it again and pull them up where
it's<00:01:01.920> bent<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:03.229> just<00:01:04.229> gonna<00:01:04.379> hit<00:01:04.589> G<00:01:05.129> again

it's bent and just gonna hit G again

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.649 
it's bent and just gonna hit G again
scale<00:01:07.409> them<00:01:07.560> outwards<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.280> just<00:01:09.119> upwards<00:01:09.540> a

they're just Center and we're just gonna

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.550 
they're just Center and we're just gonna
pull<00:01:19.290> them<00:01:19.500> downwards

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
pull them downwards

next thing we're gonna do is just delete
these<00:02:05.929> bottom<00:02:06.319> faces<00:02:06.709> edges<00:02:07.399> here<00:02:08.229> just<00:02:09.229> for

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
these bottom faces edges here just for

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.910 
these bottom faces edges here just for
them<00:02:10.569> this<00:02:11.569> way<00:02:11.750> we<00:02:11.870> have<00:02:11.989> a<00:02:12.019> night<00:02:12.319> nicer

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
them this way we have a night nicer

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.350 
them this way we have a night nicer
outcome<00:02:13.310> when<00:02:13.579> we<00:02:13.760> convert<00:02:14.180> them<00:02:14.299> to

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
outcome when we convert them to

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.130 
outcome when we convert them to
subdivisions<00:02:16.390> alright<00:02:17.390> so<00:02:17.690> now<00:02:17.900> that<00:02:17.930> we<00:02:18.049> have

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
subdivisions alright so now that we have

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.720 
subdivisions alright so now that we have
those<00:02:18.410> deleted<00:02:18.890> we're<00:02:19.130> gonna<00:02:19.220> go<00:02:19.400> up<00:02:19.489> to<00:02:19.549> the

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
those deleted we're gonna go up to the

top edit mesh insert edge loop tool and
we're<00:02:23.840> just<00:02:23.930> gonna<00:02:24.049> insert<00:02:24.530> an<00:02:24.739> edge<00:02:24.890> loop

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
we're just gonna insert an edge loop

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.940 
we're just gonna insert an edge loop
along<00:02:25.720> here<00:02:26.720> you<00:02:27.019> notice<00:02:27.200> how<00:02:27.440> it<00:02:27.560> goes<00:02:27.739> to<00:02:27.890> the

other side and along here let's make

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.780 
other side and along here let's make
that<00:02:34.880> a<00:02:34.940> little<00:02:35.090> closer

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790

all right so we inserted those edge
loops<00:02:55.430> now<00:02:56.430> you're<00:02:57.180> gonna<00:02:59.810> go<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.870> object<00:03:01.079> mode

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
loops now you're gonna go to object mode

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:06.110 
loops now you're gonna go to object mode
and<00:03:01.819> select<00:03:02.819> the<00:03:03.329> paws<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.939> we're<00:03:05.939> going<00:03:06.090> to

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.279 
the lower bound notice how you get a
wider<00:04:13.290> twist<00:04:13.799> when<00:04:14.669> you<00:04:14.760> do<00:04:14.909> that<00:04:15.139> you<00:04:16.139> could

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
wider twist when you do that you could

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:21.140 
wider twist when you do that you could
