how<00:04:44.009> are<00:04:44.160> you<00:04:44.250> feel<00:04:44.460> when<00:04:44.580> you<00:04:44.639> walk<00:04:44.759> out<00:04:44.940> the

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
how are you feel when you walk out the

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.689 
how are you feel when you walk out the
tunnel<00:04:45.360> with<00:04:45.449> the<00:04:45.479> armband<00:04:45.900> on<00:04:46.050> I<00:04:46.320> think<00:04:47.220> I'll

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
tunnel with the armband on I think I'll

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.370 
tunnel with the armband on I think I'll
be<00:04:47.850> a<00:04:47.880> bit<00:04:47.970> nervous<00:04:48.120> to<00:04:48.509> be<00:04:48.539> honest<00:04:48.840> I<00:04:49.020> mean<00:04:49.050> I

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
be a bit nervous to be honest I mean I

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.779 
be a bit nervous to be honest I mean I
generally<00:04:49.770> get<00:04:49.860> nervous<00:04:50.070> before<00:04:50.430> every<00:04:50.520> game

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
generally get nervous before every game

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.340 
generally get nervous before every game
but<00:04:50.970> I<00:04:51.210> think<00:04:51.479> this<00:04:51.720> would<00:04:51.840> be<00:04:51.870> a<00:04:51.960> special

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
but I think this would be a special

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.770 
but I think this would be a special
moment<00:04:52.530> to<00:04:52.919> be<00:04:53.039> named<00:04:53.220> captain<00:04:53.699> and<00:04:53.940> to<00:04:54.630> lead

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
moment to be named captain and to lead

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.450 
moment to be named captain and to lead
the<00:04:54.900> girls<00:04:55.110> out<00:04:55.350> and<00:04:55.380> it's<00:04:56.070> our<00:04:56.190> first

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
the girls out and it's our first

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.839 
the girls out and it's our first
qualifier<00:04:57.139> under<00:04:58.139> mark<00:04:58.410> and<00:04:58.710> I<00:04:59.009> think<00:04:59.370> all<00:04:59.699> the

00:04:59.839 --> 00:04:59.849 
qualifier under mark and I think all the

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:00.950 
qualifier under mark and I think all the
girls<00:05:00.060> are<00:05:00.270> wanting<00:05:00.479> to<00:05:00.539> put<00:05:00.690> on<00:05:00.780> a<00:05:00.810> good

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
girls are wanting to put on a good

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.409 
girls are wanting to put on a good
performance<00:05:01.139> were<00:05:01.740> awfully<00:05:02.639> a<00:05:02.669> really<00:05:03.270> good

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
performance were awfully a really good

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.870 
performance were awfully a really good
crowd<00:05:03.720> and<00:05:04.070> we<00:05:05.070> know<00:05:05.190> what<00:05:05.370> we've<00:05:05.490> got<00:05:05.639> to<00:05:05.729> do

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.820 
crowd and we know what we've got to do

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
and but most importantly it's all about

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.740 
and but most importantly it's all about
getting<00:05:08.160> three<00:05:08.340> points<00:05:08.729> and<00:05:08.910> making<00:05:09.630> sure
