00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.790
 well it is everyone is 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.810
 I hope you are well 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.910
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.260
 new video a bit special this time 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.260
 because I was talking to you about the 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.610
 backward compatibility on bbox one and i 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.440
 can offer you a set of gameplay 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.449
 so today we will talk about retro 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.040
 combativeness on xbox so what is this 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:41.050
 that is that the retro so in fact 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.280
 it's the possibility of playing games 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.170
 xbox 360 from your xbox one you have 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.390
 regrets we know about it and everything and 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.489
 everything but adjust explain how 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.230
 to do and where and how does it work and 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.840
 how is it done either you go all 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.760
 see at once that's where I'm going 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.710
 to go in but I see there we see there 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.800
 I actually have the opportunity 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.430
 now to play games he's flying 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.720
 growth 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.180
 why because I'm a member 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.009
 preview because it's actually going to be going out 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.450
 officially to the shale of the 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:11.890
 bullshit that says no nonsense in the month 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.560
 from December to the Christmas season 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.000
 something like that but here it is 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.920
 not available to all players 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.840
 publicly now so it takes 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.979
 to be a member preview first we will launch 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.479
 that for you I show you that it 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.939
 really works and that it works 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.220
 well and that's never the thing because 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.750
 that frankly to play 360 games this 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.340
 is not really that's what 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.670
 was missing what they give us 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.020
 old cola does it's all about it 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.640
 so to speak but here you are 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.950
 have the guibole too recent that starts 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.900
 finally here we are at the animation 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.299
 here we are on xbox one I 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.960
 not kidding of course and how it was 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.840
 announced at e3 then we will go back in 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.470
 full screen is better still 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.390
 here you have the loading time 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.920
 we are waiting we are in no hurry to 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:00.080
 way voila voila xbox live arcade so 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.110
 his charge well everything and everything and everything and 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.420
 good we can open our 360 menu when 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.210
 the light am there frankly we can 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.399
 show all the successes here finally 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.500
 everything works perfectly even more 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:17.600
 quickly I find that about 360 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:19.640
 we see there is so the game is good 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.560
 launched and all so well 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.110
 now we will go back to the moment when 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.120
 how to be a member preview 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.380
 I saw a lot of people posing 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.640
 question on forums this this 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.390
 frankly it leaves its part of a 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.010
 pretty simple action actually it's you 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.230
 go say yeah but wait here 12 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.870
 actually explains me I have the application 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.000
 that's it but actually if you want 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.320
 become a member preview you need to 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.120
 invite by one of your friends 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.940
 I have the possibility to invite my 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.110
 friends for example that's it if you want 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.520
 to have sail had too complicated 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.410
 now if you want to have these 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.140
 things I have to do you have to do 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.670
 invite by a friend like here you see 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.410
 the person has to have this 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.519
 application and all but there you go 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.930
 say it but wait for the first person 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.390
 she did how did classify not do 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.550
 invite and where is ben actually I was 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.470
 member or preview but me with my 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.060
 microsoft account about 360 at the time and 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.489
 it worked differently and in fact 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.140
 it followed month sam actually went on 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.360
 on that same pitch you say I was 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.180
 still still world preview on one 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.470
 despite that it was over 360 at the time and 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.320
 aulas suddenly if you do not have this 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.170
 app you need a friend or them 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.730
 someone or whatever and they 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.900
 invite is actually after three 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.049
 four days you will receive a 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.400
 microsoft message in the stuff with 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.080
 a code what something like that 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.239
 yeah that's it and you just have to 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.010
 download the app and come here 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.680
 inscriptions here look at me I'm 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.330
 preview member ruled by train 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.680
 to evolve so here I have all the 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.530
 novelties that every time it comes out 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.630
 in preview not I have them so here it is 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.459
 you have to be invited to come here 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.040
 limit what I can do since I have 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.989
 not enormously 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.879
 dabo but it depends the number of views of 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.689
 this video frankly this is not the 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:00.370
 to do for everyone 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:03.010
 but let's admit that you would like to be 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.829
 preview and you do not have any friends who at 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.170
 the app will send me your 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.790
 gamertag to the limit within the limits of the 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.280
 reasonable so to 100 people it's okay 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.319
 to be a little hot but hey that's so 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.760
 is at 15 or whatever he wants to do it and 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.579
 all here they are not friend first 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.650
 inquire with your friends see 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.300
 if we do not apply it and want 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.770
 ask for an invitation if it's not the 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.530
 case that nobody in your friends list 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.690
 at this app down you send me again 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.099
 in comment yeah here I have not 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.800
 you can not do it 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:34.840
 for me and me of course I'm you 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.419
 will invite as my preview is there 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.949
 no problem so here you have seen that 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.979
 it works the game is well launched here 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:43.840
 look ok will revive 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.370
 I had closed in France so be 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.490
 here they said if they were going 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.349
 update her to the number of 100 games 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.759
 per month 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:53.650
 good it's still a little complicated to do 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:55.330
 because here they are in the process of 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.770
 to emulate the games so for those who 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.729
 could say emulate and so it's going 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.740
 they do not know in fact 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.110
 emule and that's actually they take 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.610
 the games he is numerically master and 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.870
 or thing and everything is actually they do 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.210
 believe in games that turn on a 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.919
 xbox 360 while he is on the xbox one 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.930
 as you can see so it stays 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.940
 a technology or a pretty system 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.349
 complex anyway but hey 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.380
 they succeed their bet because 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:18.880
 it turns and it's good that's all 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.460
 for me I hope this video will have you 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.830
 it helped you anyway if you 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.199
 do not have any friends who has this app ben 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.240
 here you put in comment and so 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:29.139
 here 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.909
 I tell you next time for a 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:33.240
 next video it was hard dance had 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:33.240
 everyone
