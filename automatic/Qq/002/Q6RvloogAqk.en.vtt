00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.650 
weird-looking you notice the door looks
like<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.130> almost<00:02:23.310> opened<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:24.000> mean<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:24.209> doesn't

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
like it almost opened I mean it doesn't

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.180 
like it almost opened I mean it doesn't
but<00:02:24.780> looks<00:02:24.930> like<00:02:24.989> they<00:02:25.200> maybe<00:02:25.560> thought<00:02:25.920> about

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
but looks like they maybe thought about

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.340 
but looks like they maybe thought about
it<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.489> just<00:02:26.520> I<00:02:26.970> don't<00:02:27.300> know<00:02:27.450> look<00:02:27.690> how<00:02:27.720> far

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
it and just I don't know look how far

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.440 
it and just I don't know look how far
that<00:02:28.410> protrudes<00:02:29.040> kind<00:02:29.640> of<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.760> weird<00:02:30.000> weird

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
that protrudes kind of a weird weird

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.860 
that protrudes kind of a weird weird
casting<00:02:30.959> not<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.680> lot<00:02:31.830> of<00:02:31.920> detail<00:02:32.600> it's<00:02:33.600> not<00:02:33.720> be

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
casting not a lot of detail it's not be

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.210 
casting not a lot of detail it's not be
good<00:02:34.019> for<00:02:34.080> its<00:02:34.320> customs<00:02:34.709> I'm<00:02:34.800> not<00:02:34.950> gonna<00:02:35.070> do

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.560 
good for its customs I'm not gonna do
anything<00:02:35.400> like<00:02:35.550> that<00:02:35.640> but<00:02:35.940> this<00:02:36.209> is<00:02:36.360> why<00:02:36.540> I

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
anything like that but this is why I

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.210 
anything like that but this is why I
really<00:02:36.870> wanted<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.140> set<00:02:37.470> kind<00:02:37.830> of<00:02:37.920> markets

that's<00:03:00.930> kind<00:03:01.140> of<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.290> one<00:03:01.470> that<00:03:01.790> I've<00:03:02.790> got<00:03:02.940> a

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
that's kind of the one that I've got a

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.120 
that's kind of the one that I've got a
ton<00:03:03.269> of<00:03:03.300> and<00:03:03.720> we'll<00:03:03.840> end<00:03:04.050> it<00:03:04.170> with<00:03:04.350> Boss<00:03:04.860> Hogg's

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
last one did that's pretty sharp it's

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.970 
last one did that's pretty sharp it's
gonna<00:03:39.600> be<00:03:39.750> hard<00:03:39.930> to<00:03:39.959> beat<00:03:40.140> that<00:03:42.530> look<00:03:43.530> even<00:03:43.829> got

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980
