all dried up and ready to go
it's<00:03:21.140> having<00:03:21.500> a<00:03:21.530> place<00:03:21.770> to<00:03:21.800> be<00:03:22.010> fabric<00:03:22.459> on<00:03:22.610> the

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
it's having a place to be fabric on the

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.210 
it's having a place to be fabric on the
seat<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:23.360> since<00:03:23.840> I<00:03:23.959> don't<00:03:24.170> have<00:03:24.290> a<00:03:24.320> stapler<00:03:24.920> I

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
seat and since I don't have a stapler I

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.720 
seat and since I don't have a stapler I
decided<00:03:26.150> to<00:03:26.480> use<00:03:26.690> hot<00:03:27.080> glue<00:03:27.260> and<00:03:27.980> yeah<00:03:28.520> it

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
decided to use hot glue and yeah it

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.850 
decided to use hot glue and yeah it
works<00:03:28.970> great<00:03:29.330> so<00:03:29.390> I<00:03:30.050> think<00:03:30.080> this<00:03:30.410> is<00:03:30.470> probably

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
works great so I think this is probably

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.040 
works great so I think this is probably
just<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.160> lazy<00:03:31.430> way<00:03:31.730> out<00:03:31.940> but<00:03:32.480> it<00:03:32.600> works<00:03:32.780> so

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
just the lazy way out but it works so

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.860 
just the lazy way out but it works so
hey<00:03:33.739> anyway<00:03:34.310> so<00:03:34.459> as<00:03:34.670> you<00:03:34.820> can<00:03:34.970> see<00:03:35.180> I<00:03:35.209> placed<00:03:35.660> my

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
hey anyway so as you can see I placed my

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.300 
hey anyway so as you can see I placed my
seat<00:03:36.140> upside<00:03:36.500> down<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:36.830> I<00:03:36.920> just<00:03:37.130> measured

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
seat upside down and I just measured

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.090 
seat upside down and I just measured
around<00:03:37.640> there<00:03:38.030> and<00:03:38.209> I<00:03:38.570> cut<00:03:38.989> the<00:03:39.320> extra<00:03:39.739> fabric

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
around there and I cut the extra fabric

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.150 
around there and I cut the extra fabric
and<00:03:40.640> then<00:03:41.120> I<00:03:41.239> just<00:03:41.420> began<00:03:41.720> by<00:03:42.050> adding<00:03:42.560> some<00:03:42.860> hot

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
and then I just began by adding some hot

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.150 
and then I just began by adding some hot
glue<00:03:43.400> on<00:03:43.520> there<00:03:43.940> and<00:03:44.150> just<00:03:45.110> gluing<00:03:45.410> my<00:03:45.709> fabric

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
glue on there and just gluing my fabric

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.740 
glue on there and just gluing my fabric
on<00:03:46.280> top<00:03:46.489> of<00:03:46.670> it

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.320 

and<00:03:50.750> since<00:03:51.530> I<00:03:51.620> had<00:03:51.830> extra<00:03:52.250> fabric<00:03:52.550> on<00:03:52.850> there<00:03:53.090> I

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
and since I had extra fabric on there I

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.479 
and since I had extra fabric on there I
