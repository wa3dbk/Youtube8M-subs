use that one I could go ahead and select
one<00:01:43.730> of<00:01:43.850> them<00:01:43.970> here<00:01:44.300> and<00:01:44.420> there<00:01:45.080> I<00:01:45.140> did<00:01:46.390> let's

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
one of them here and there I did let's

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.330 
one of them here and there I did let's
try<00:01:47.570> out<00:01:47.720> the<00:01:47.870> rapid<00:01:48.290> /<00:01:48.560> I<00:01:48.800> really<00:01:49.010> like<00:01:49.160> that

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
try out the rapid / I really like that

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.400 
try out the rapid / I really like that
one<00:01:49.400> here<00:01:49.850> and<00:01:50.030> that<00:01:50.630> one<00:01:50.780> should<00:01:50.960> just<00:01:51.200> it

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
one here and that one should just it

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.570 
one here and that one should just it
should<00:01:51.560> be<00:01:51.650> a<00:01:51.680> done<00:01:51.920> deal<00:01:52.100> for<00:01:52.310> that<00:01:52.430> monster

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
should be a done deal for that monster

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.100 
should be a done deal for that monster
that<00:01:52.910> now<00:01:53.030> we've<00:01:53.180> got<00:01:53.360> one<00:01:53.540> more<00:01:53.570> I<00:01:53.780> think<00:01:53.900> I

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
that now we've got one more I think I

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.080 
that now we've got one more I think I
could<00:01:54.290> head<00:01:54.560> bash<00:01:54.770> there<00:01:55.100> I<00:01:55.310> like<00:01:55.730> that<00:01:55.909> one

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
could head bash there I like that one

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.280 
could head bash there I like that one
too<00:01:56.150> I<00:01:56.270> like<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:56.540> sound<00:01:56.690> it<00:01:56.810> out<00:01:56.930> when<00:01:57.110> that

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
too I like to sound it out when that

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.800 
too I like to sound it out when that
halfway<00:01:57.740> done<00:01:58.190> let's<00:01:58.880> take<00:01:59.180> it<00:01:59.330> take<00:01:59.630> them<00:01:59.720> out

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
halfway done let's take it take them out

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.080 
halfway done let's take it take them out
with<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.080> ember<00:02:00.409> wheel<00:02:00.560> here<00:02:00.980> and<00:02:01.159> be<00:02:01.880> done

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
with the ember wheel here and be done

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.910 
with the ember wheel here and be done
with<00:02:02.270> them<00:02:02.450> no<00:02:02.690> I<00:02:02.990> thought<00:02:03.530> that<00:02:03.650> that<00:02:03.800> would

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
with them no I thought that that would

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.310 
with them no I thought that that would
kill<00:02:04.159> it<00:02:04.280> so<00:02:04.430> now<00:02:04.700> I<00:02:05.060> think<00:02:05.780> we'll<00:02:06.140> try<00:02:06.290> a

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
kill it so now I think we'll try a

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.630 
kill it so now I think we'll try a
different<00:02:06.680> one<00:02:06.710> just<00:02:07.040> for<00:02:07.190> the<00:02:07.250> sake<00:02:07.430> of<00:02:07.460> the

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
different one just for the sake of the

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.059 
different one just for the sake of the
video<00:02:07.880> but<00:02:08.090> I<00:02:08.119> would<00:02:08.360> normally<00:02:09.319> I<00:02:09.649> would<00:02:09.890> just

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
video but I would normally I would just

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.100 
video but I would normally I would just
go<00:02:10.220> with<00:02:10.459> the<00:02:10.700> strongest<00:02:11.330> all<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.659> time<00:02:11.900> but

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
go with the strongest all the time but

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.470 
go with the strongest all the time but
there<00:02:12.349> it<00:02:12.470> is<00:02:12.560> and<00:02:12.909> after<00:02:13.909> every<00:02:14.150> single

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
there it is and after every single

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.790 
there it is and after every single
battle<00:02:14.900> your<00:02:15.110> monsters<00:02:15.500> will<00:02:15.650> gain

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
battle your monsters will gain

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.740 
battle your monsters will gain
experience<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.580> it<00:02:17.150> will<00:02:17.239> improve<00:02:17.510> their

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
experience and it will improve their

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.630 
experience and it will improve their
speed<00:02:18.019> attack<00:02:18.409> and<00:02:18.650> defense<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.129> there<00:02:19.550> you

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
speed attack and defense and there you

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.330 
speed attack and defense and there you
see<00:02:19.849> my<00:02:20.030> monsters<00:02:20.540> did<00:02:20.749> gain<00:02:21.469> some<00:02:21.799> of<00:02:21.920> that<00:02:21.950> so

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
see my monsters did gain some of that so

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.920 
see my monsters did gain some of that so
just<00:02:22.579> walking<00:02:22.969> around<00:02:23.060> like<00:02:23.329> I<00:02:23.510> said<00:02:23.719> you'll

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
just walking around like I said you'll

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.100 
just walking around like I said you'll
pick<00:02:24.139> up<00:02:24.290> some<00:02:24.469> battle

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
pick up some battle

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.500 
pick up some battle
and<00:02:25.230> there's<00:02:25.950> another<00:02:26.250> one<00:02:26.520> so<00:02:27.150> now<00:02:27.300> we've

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
and there's another one so now we've

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.330 
and there's another one so now we've
only<00:02:27.660> got<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.900> level<00:02:28.140> six<00:02:28.530> year<00:02:28.740> should<00:02:28.920> be<00:02:28.980> very

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
only got a level six year should be very

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.800 
only got a level six year should be very
easy<00:02:29.430> against<00:02:30.030> my<00:02:30.150> 3<00:02:30.390> monsters<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:35.570> think<00:02:36.570> one

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
easy against my 3 monsters I think one

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.630 
easy against my 3 monsters I think one
more<00:02:37.020> should<00:02:37.290> do<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.500> I<00:02:37.860> haven't<00:02:38.340> shown<00:02:38.490> you

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640
