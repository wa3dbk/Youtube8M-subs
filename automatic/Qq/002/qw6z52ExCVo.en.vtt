that's the the source of the problem of

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.200 
that's the the source of the problem of
that<00:01:16.320> well<00:01:16.920> sort<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.400> conversation<00:01:17.580> about

yeah I mean I think that that's very of

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.260 
yeah I mean I think that that's very of
course<00:01:20.280> that's<00:01:20.549> what<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.909> root<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.119> this

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
course that's what that the root of this

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.820 
course that's what that the root of this
the<00:01:21.509> idea<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.869> for<00:01:22.290> any<00:01:22.439> number<00:01:22.650> of

about legitimate or illegitimate rape in
our<00:01:52.619> that's<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.189> different<00:01:53.520> topic<00:01:54.450> it's

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
our that's a different topic it's

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.690 
our that's a different topic it's
different<00:01:55.530> but<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.189> same<00:01:56.430> in<00:01:56.670> the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
different but it is the same in the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.459 
different but it is the same in the
sense<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:57.060> somebody<00:01:57.390> would<00:01:57.630> argue<00:01:57.960> even<00:01:58.229> if

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469
