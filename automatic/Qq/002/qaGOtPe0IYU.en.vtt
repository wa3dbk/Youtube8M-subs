00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:08.099
 hello today i will tell you how 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:12.179
 collect cube cube rubik methods 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:16.740
 jessica frederick this method is needed for 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.539
 sleeps coolers who collect it very 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.619
 quickly and on time 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.960
 and that you just build a cube and more 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.789
 never collect it on diesel 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.859
 youtube and see there if the method is one 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:34.530
 there are no more there you can hardly find 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:40.140
 more methods and it's the easiest 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:50.010
 assemble this method consists of four 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:52.920
 stages of assembly of the cross here is the second stage 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.930
 called ftl 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.649
 or f2l translated from English first 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.379
 two layers 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:06.119
 here they are here they are the first two layers 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:11.700
 there are two layers going right away 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.950
 they are first layer second layer as in the very 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.590
 easy method 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:21.890
 next is going to top layer 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:26.340
 called stage a l and climbs 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:32.880
 top layer and she is not the top last 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:35.939
 layer the third layer is called first here 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:42.570
 we stirred the cube turned us 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:44.040
 the situation now we collect the cross to me 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.149
 more convenient when 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:51.210
 set and at the top should be white or 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:55.380
 black is more convenient for some 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:02:00.780
 so that he was at the bottom but at assembly 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:06.630
 Christ I always keep at the top of the beginning we 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:10.590
 must find rib cubes with black 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.160
 or white white this one 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.900
 instead of black white 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:22.200
 here we found one you have to put it 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:28.840
 here or here or here or here simply 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:32.800
 we turn all one we put here 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:37.540
 Another is simply threw it here at 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:40.720
 we have here it turns from us 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:45.550
 one appeared again in the gut-wrenching 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:48.810
 all of you have just gathered this one 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.610
 all we have collected a cross but it 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:57.240
 wrong and we need the right 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:03:03.840
 cross to collect the right cross us 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:06.700
 rib cube color must be 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.580
 same with the center here for example here 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.240
 black or green means center should 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.910
 be too green match where blue is he 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.280
 there must be a blue center there is a red he 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.250
 should be red here is orange 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.280
 There must be a circulation here, but this one coincided 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:28.660
 so we should have all the costal 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.130
 cubes match if we match one 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:35.020
 we move the top 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:36.810
 topsoil arrows see times 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:44.880
 nothing matched 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:48.760
 2 see coincided one coincided rain times 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:56.370
 matched matched and here two matched 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:56.370
 when the two are not close together we put on 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:07.290
 spending a trace on us put a position 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:11.620
 to the left of the assembled wing of the assembled 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.870
 center like that so here was 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:19.850
 on the left should be assembled on the right not 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:21.980
 collected if we have two near just 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.550
 change these two places in these two 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.370
 change then we just make a shape 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.070
 right counterclockwise 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:35.710
 upper counterclockwise 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:40.640
 see here matched the green green right 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:44.180
 Here is the clock bright clockwise thinner 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:47.120
 coincided and then coincided it is necessary just right 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:52.730
 slot watch move everything with us 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:58.060
 the situation coincided but when 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:05:01.000
 here the light coincides and here 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:04.160
 opposite colors match a 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.480
 the opposite is not if we have so then we 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:11.360
 We put on the color where we do not have software 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:15.230
 we have the same grande will do 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:19.900
 such a form right counter clockwise left 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:24.020
 donut and top two times 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:27.740
 right clockwise clockwise and left 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:35.780
 all creativity we are going to cross 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:39.770
 correct cross all thanks next 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:48.200
 I will show you a lesson how to put together two layers. 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:48.950
 Immediately there all for ftl formulas 40 41 or 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:56.710
 47 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:56.710
 I don't remember exactly, thank you
