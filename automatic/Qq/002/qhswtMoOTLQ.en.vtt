these so that we can really focus on

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.490 
these so that we can really focus on
each<00:01:57.180> arm<00:01:57.450> at<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.719> time

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
each arm at a time

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.920 
each arm at a time
so<00:01:58.920> you're<00:01:59.010> going<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.160> curl<00:01:59.430> up<00:01:59.720> squeezing<00:02:00.720> at

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
so you're going to curl up squeezing at

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.680 
so you're going to curl up squeezing at
the<00:02:01.020> top<00:02:01.230> and<00:02:01.740> then<00:02:02.700> releasing<00:02:03.090> back<00:02:03.180> down<00:02:03.420> and

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
moving on to the next arm so we're

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.440 
moving on to the next arm so we're
alternating<00:02:06.870> here<00:02:07.610> going<00:02:08.610> again<00:02:08.820> for<00:02:09.060> 10<00:02:09.270> to
