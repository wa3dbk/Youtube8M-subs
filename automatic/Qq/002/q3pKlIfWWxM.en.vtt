00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.900 
looks like more a race car so it is very
different<00:02:31.810> I<00:02:32.019> like<00:02:32.380> it<00:02:32.620> when<00:02:33.519> you<00:02:33.640> look<00:02:33.790> from

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
different I like it when you look from

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.580 
different I like it when you look from
the<00:02:34.060> front<00:02:34.269> we<00:02:35.200> have<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.349> typical<00:02:36.540> 911<00:02:37.590> front

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
the front we have a typical 911 front

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.420 
the front we have a typical 911 front
ends<00:02:38.920> we<00:02:39.550> have<00:02:39.670> three<00:02:40.090> opening<00:02:40.930> optic<00:02:41.620> we<00:02:42.190> have

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
ends we have three opening optic we have

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.150 
ends we have three opening optic we have
also<00:02:43.239> a<00:02:43.269> really<00:02:43.600> wide<00:02:43.900> front<00:02:44.410> it<00:02:44.739> looks<00:02:44.980> like

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
also a really wide front it looks like

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.479 
also a really wide front it looks like
much<00:02:45.450> sporty<00:02:46.450> but<00:02:47.019> what<00:02:47.350> very<00:02:47.830> interesting<00:02:48.340> is

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
much sporty but what very interesting is

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.180 
much sporty but what very interesting is
is<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.670> new<00:02:48.940> outline<00:02:49.450> from<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.170> new<00:02:50.380> front

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
is a new outline from the new front

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.850 
is a new outline from the new front

blend modules I will like it it looks

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.410 
blend modules I will like it it looks
like<00:02:53.950> much<00:02:54.310> dynamic<00:02:55.410> so<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:57.700> looks<00:02:57.880> wonderful
