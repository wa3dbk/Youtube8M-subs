00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.700 
Apple product and so I can see why Mac
users<00:01:48.270> would<00:01:48.450> find<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:48.990> very<00:01:49.020> funny<00:01:49.500> that

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
users would find it very funny that

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.539 
users would find it very funny that
always<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> PC<00:01:50.579> version<00:01:51.060> comes<00:01:51.689> out<00:01:51.899> first<00:01:52.549> but

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
always a PC version comes out first but

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.460 
always a PC version comes out first but
I<00:01:53.579> guess<00:01:53.790> that's<00:01:54.000> down<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.390> code<00:01:54.630> up<00:01:54.810> so

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
I guess that's down to the code up so

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.440 
I guess that's down to the code up so
when<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.009> hit<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.700> download<00:01:56.909> link<00:01:57.270> you'll<00:01:57.420> be

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
when you hit the download link you'll be

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.719 
when you hit the download link you'll be
ball<00:01:57.719> hit<00:01:57.930> just<00:01:58.229> click<00:01:58.409> download<00:01:58.649> okay<00:01:59.520> guys

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
ball hit just click download okay guys

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.660 
ball hit just click download okay guys
so<00:02:00.060> once<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.570> download<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:00.990> complete<00:02:01.670> you

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
so once the download is complete you

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.580 
so once the download is complete you
will<00:02:02.700> have<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.420> zip<00:02:03.689> file<00:02:03.899> on<00:02:04.079> your<00:02:04.229> desktop

will start to jailbreak if you get the

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.430 
will start to jailbreak if you get the
storage<00:02:50.950> fault<00:02:51.370> don't<00:02:51.760> worry<00:02:51.940> about<00:02:52.030> that

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
storage fault don't worry about that

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.410 
storage fault don't worry about that
just<00:02:53.440> click<00:02:53.620> done<00:02:53.800> now<00:02:57.000> we've<00:02:58.000> got<00:02:58.150> a<00:02:58.180> little

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
just click done now we've got a little

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.480 
just click done now we've got a little
smiley<00:02:58.780> face<00:02:58.990> there<00:02:59.020> so<00:02:59.410> I<00:02:59.440> guess<00:02:59.740> the

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
smiley face there so I guess the

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.070 
smiley face there so I guess the
procedure<00:03:00.910> is<00:03:01.120> done<00:03:01.150> we'll<00:03:01.690> just<00:03:01.870> wait<00:03:02.050> for

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
procedure is done we'll just wait for

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.280 
procedure is done we'll just wait for
the<00:03:02.290> reboot<00:03:06.240> there<00:03:07.240> we<00:03:07.330> go<00:03:07.480> city<00:03:07.870> up<00:03:07.990> on<00:03:08.170> the

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
the reboot there we go city up on the

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.210 
the reboot there we go city up on the
device<00:03:09.480> real<00:03:10.480> simple<00:03:10.930> real<00:03:11.200> quick<00:03:11.560> of<00:03:11.890> course

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
device real simple real quick of course

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.890 
device real simple real quick of course
the<00:03:12.580> first<00:03:12.760> time<00:03:12.850> you<00:03:13.060> open<00:03:13.240> up<00:03:13.300> cydia<00:03:13.510> it's
