00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.160 

it's<00:00:40.340> all<00:00:40.460> pretty<00:00:40.790> tight

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.530 

once<00:00:45.500> we<00:00:45.620> get<00:00:45.770> down<00:00:45.829> below<00:00:46.640> to<00:00:46.700> eat<00:00:47.000> you'll<00:00:47.300> see

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
once we get down below to eat you'll see

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.240 
once we get down below to eat you'll see
that<00:00:47.720> where<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:48.050> sunlight<00:00:48.500> hits<00:00:48.800> it<00:00:48.980> it's

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
that where the sunlight hits it it's

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.340 
that where the sunlight hits it it's
really<00:00:49.610> starting<00:00:49.850> to<00:00:50.180> peel<00:00:50.450> now<00:00:51.050> we're<00:00:51.230> going

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
really starting to peel now we're going

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.500 
really starting to peel now we're going
to<00:00:51.440> work<00:00:51.590> that<00:00:51.829> over<00:00:52.250> there<00:00:52.399> by<00:00:52.640> working<00:00:53.180> the

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
to work that over there by working the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.990 
to work that over there by working the
water<00:00:54.110> stream<00:00:54.470> like<00:00:54.710> a<00:00:54.739> chisel<00:00:55.400> that<00:00:55.790> will

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
water stream like a chisel that will

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:11.990 
water stream like a chisel that will
chisel<00:00:56.239> up<00:00:56.600> all<00:00:56.840> of<00:00:56.989> those<00:00:57.110> loose<00:00:57.410> flake

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.150

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
now that's how we were moved to lose

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.460 
now that's how we were moved to lose
chips<00:01:14.520> on<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.000> wall<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.840> rest<00:01:16.050> of<00:01:16.230> the<00:01:16.320> wall
