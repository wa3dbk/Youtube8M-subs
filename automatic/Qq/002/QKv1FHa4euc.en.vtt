00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:19.020

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.900
 building 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.129
 in the background we hear the cars 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.129
 So drive pretty close to the road 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.620
 the front is the entrance 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.010
 or with it the possible impossibility 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.440
 An entrance to the customer entrance is on 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.000
 I'm from the other side now 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.670
 steer to the right 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.860
 for the same at the bmw dealership 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.180
 moment in the shell the ceiling will be 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.060
 So next week is poured 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.750
 When you look at it, you see support forest 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.970
 see the turned-in roofsides pages 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.550
 we already support the forest of the workshop 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.110
 there is still a lot more to tell 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.600
 So the roof carrier and at all 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.750
 outside wall, the company had the 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:31.100
 dimensions like the contour of the street 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:35.420
 So here is the workshop in front 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.770
 Washing hall and preparation in the first 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.870
 Workshop otherwise from the back 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.110
 Once there, there is a vehicle 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.370
 from the fourth drive to the workshop 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.730
 here we are on the back 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.800
 plateau you can see that real 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.170
 Plateau is below the staff park 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.930
 the light is already low on the 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.850
 You can see the street as deep as it is not 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.790
 even if it is at first glance 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.590
 looks 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:06.250
 it is not quite that fair 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:11.159
 terrain by the multi-storey kite 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:13.450
 and from the country additional massive walls 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:17.199
 of fire protection also on ours 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.750
 load capacity here still construction site we 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:21.549
 hope that now the weather again 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.080
 a bit reserved rain scare 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.870
 the builders, the influential for ignoring 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.050
 if I do not pour in streams 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.050
 suitable clothes
