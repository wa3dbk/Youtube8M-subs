solid<00:01:01.410> play<00:01:01.590> we've<00:01:01.770> had<00:01:01.920> over<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.160> last<00:01:02.219> few

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.119 
solid play we've had over the last few
months<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:03.589> physical<00:01:04.589> presence<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.070> the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
months that physical presence in the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.830 
months that physical presence in the
penalty<00:01:05.369> box<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:06.060> think<00:01:06.420> he's<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> more

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
penalty box I think he's a more

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.719 
penalty box I think he's a more
effective<00:01:07.260> impact<00:01:08.040> substitute<00:01:08.549> than

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
effective impact substitute than

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.100 
effective impact substitute than
walk-off<00:01:09.180> would<00:01:09.479> be<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.740> tight<00:01:10.950> game<00:01:12.049> as<00:01:13.049> a

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
walk-off would be in a tight game as a

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.560 
walk-off would be in a tight game as a
goalkeeper<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:14.100> think<00:01:15.060> she<00:01:15.299> does<00:01:15.330> need<00:01:15.509> a

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
goalkeeper I think she does need a

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.700 
goalkeeper I think she does need a
better<00:01:15.689> keeper<00:01:16.020> than<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> subpoena<00:01:16.409> but<00:01:16.590> I

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
better keeper than a subpoena but I

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.990 
better keeper than a subpoena but I
probably<00:01:16.920> would<00:01:17.189> have<00:01:17.250> gone<00:01:17.729> with<00:01:17.790> the
