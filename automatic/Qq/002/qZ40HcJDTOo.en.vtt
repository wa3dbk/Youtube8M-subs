I<00:00:06.509> kept<00:00:07.290> this<00:00:07.410> on<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.680> down-low<00:00:07.919> for<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.550> bit

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
I kept this on the down-low for a bit

of<00:00:23.010> spotlight<00:00:23.869> anyway<00:00:24.869> here<00:00:25.350> are<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.590> few

its<00:01:04.290> railways<00:01:04.860> uh<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.489> guess<00:01:06.150> I'm<00:01:06.330> assuming

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
its railways uh I guess I'm assuming

its railways uh I guess I'm assuming
she's<00:01:07.170> female<00:01:07.470> because<00:01:08.040> she<00:01:08.189> was<00:01:08.310> named<00:01:08.580> after

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
she's female because she was named after

by the way you have really nice eyes
thanks<00:01:19.320> but<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.530> wasn't<00:01:19.979> really<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.220> question

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
thanks but that wasn't really a question

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.270 
thanks but that wasn't really a question
anyway<00:01:21.390> I'm<00:01:21.570> working<00:01:21.990> on<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.590> want<00:01:23.189> to

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
anyway I'm working on that I want to

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.130 
anyway I'm working on that I want to
make<00:01:23.369> Jaques<00:01:23.729> model<00:01:24.150> really<00:01:24.600> good<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.110> I

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
make Jaques model really good so I

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.469 
make Jaques model really good so I
haven't<00:01:25.590> rushed<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.220> might<00:01:26.820> also<00:01:27.000> wait<00:01:27.330> it

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
haven't rushed it I might also wait it

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.999 
haven't rushed it I might also wait it
out<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.630> bit<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.990> see<00:01:28.140> if<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.320> show<00:01:28.500> gives<00:01:28.829> any

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
out a bit and see if the show gives any

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.850 
out a bit and see if the show gives any
sign<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.369> introducing<00:01:30.090> him<00:01:30.180> who<00:01:30.990> knows<00:01:31.229> maybe

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
sign of introducing him who knows maybe

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.310 
sign of introducing him who knows maybe
we'll<00:01:32.100> get<00:01:32.250> thumper<00:01:32.759> instead<00:01:33.210> number<00:01:33.960> three

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
we'll get thumper instead number three

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.109 
we'll get thumper instead number three
do<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.100> think<00:01:35.159> she<00:01:35.549> will<00:01:35.610> appear<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:36.030> the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
do you think she will appear in the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.469 
do you think she will appear in the
actual<00:01:36.600> show<00:01:37.189> probably<00:01:38.220> now<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.939> Caleb<00:01:39.329> went

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
actual show probably now that Caleb went

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.819 
actual show probably now that Caleb went
through<00:01:39.630> all<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.810> trouble<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.140> paint<00:01:40.470> her<00:01:40.650> and
