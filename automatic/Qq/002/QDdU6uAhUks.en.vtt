00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
of string for this particular racket I

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.370 
of string for this particular racket I
tie<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.779> knot<00:00:19.080> first<00:00:20.390> i'm<00:00:21.390> using<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.930> dunlop

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380

aerogel<00:00:22.670> 200<00:00:23.670> i<00:00:23.760> think<00:00:23.970> it's<00:00:24.090> called<00:00:27.439> sort<00:00:28.439> of

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
aerogel 200 i think it's called sort of

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.860 
aerogel 200 i think it's called sort of
thing<00:00:28.680> tragic<00:00:29.070> as<00:00:29.310> tight<00:00:29.550> as<00:00:29.670> possible<00:00:32.870> and

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
thing tragic as tight as possible and

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.690 
thing tragic as tight as possible and
then<00:00:35.030> take<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.210> length<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.660> string<00:00:37.520> if<00:00:38.520> you're

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
then take the length of string if you're

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.520 
then take the length of string if you're
not<00:00:38.790> going<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.210> tie<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.780> around<00:00:39.930> your<00:00:40.170> leg<00:00:40.320> like

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
not going to tie it around your leg like

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.460 
not going to tie it around your leg like
i<00:00:40.680> just<00:00:40.710> did

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.980 

laughs

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:51.990 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:01:00.740 

eat<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:53.180> under<00:00:55.070> over<00:00:56.070> under<00:00:56.150> over<00:00:59.750> this

eat it under over under over this

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.390 
eat it under over under over this
suppose<00:01:01.020> T<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.440> part<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.770> stringing<00:01:02.130> rocket

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
suppose T is part of stringing rocket

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.830 
suppose T is part of stringing rocket
just<00:01:05.400> watch<00:01:05.580> closely<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:06.150> make<00:01:06.270> sure<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.720> you

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
just watch closely to make sure that you

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.260 
just watch closely to make sure that you
get<00:01:06.960> your<00:01:07.020> unders<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.770> overs<00:01:08.210> properly<00:01:09.210> you

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
get your unders and overs properly you

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.240 
get your unders and overs properly you
never<00:01:09.420> want<00:01:09.660> to<00:01:09.690> pull<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.020> string<00:01:10.320> straight

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
never want to pull the string straight

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.190 
never want to pull the string straight
across<00:01:11.490> because<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.120> can<00:01:12.300> cause<00:01:12.330> grooves<00:01:12.960> and

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
across because it can cause grooves and

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.170 
across because it can cause grooves and
frictionally<00:01:14.600> impact<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:16.940> lifespan<00:01:17.940> of<00:01:18.090> the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
frictionally impact the lifespan of the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.840 
frictionally impact the lifespan of the
string<00:01:18.510> so<00:01:18.950> just<00:01:19.950> kind<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.130> keep<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.430> moving<00:01:20.730> up

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
string so just kind of keep it moving up

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.130 
string so just kind of keep it moving up
and<00:01:21.000> down<00:01:21.120> the<00:01:21.330> means<00:01:21.540> as<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.840> pull<00:01:22.020> it

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
and down the means as you pull it

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
and down the means as you pull it
through<00:01:24.350> that<00:01:25.350> sort<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.740> thing<00:01:27.920> okay<00:01:28.920> here's

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
through that sort of thing okay here's

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.990 
through that sort of thing okay here's
ago<00:01:29.400> with<00:01:29.550> the<00:01:29.840> crosses<00:01:31.250> and<00:01:34.760> still<00:01:35.760> kind<00:01:35.970> of

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
ago with the crosses and still kind of

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.030 
ago with the crosses and still kind of
rushing<00:01:36.390> here<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:38.520> whole<00:01:38.720> wonder<00:01:39.720> over<00:01:40.530> there

rushing here the whole wonder over there
are<00:01:41.160> fancy<00:01:41.550> ways<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.880> threading<00:01:42.330> the<00:01:42.510> string

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
are fancy ways of threading the string

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.630 
are fancy ways of threading the string
and<00:01:43.410> you<00:01:43.860> can<00:01:44.010> see<00:01:44.220> other<00:01:44.580> dudes<00:01:44.970> on<00:01:45.270> YouTube

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
flying through the string job process

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.219 
flying through the string job process
but<00:01:49.440> I<00:01:50.869> thought<00:01:51.869> fancy<00:01:52.350> yet<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:53.720> as<00:01:54.720> long<00:01:55.020> as<00:01:55.140> I

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
but I thought fancy yet and as long as I

but I thought fancy yet and as long as I
don't<00:01:56.869> need<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.050> keep<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.350> string<00:01:58.619> up<00:01:58.830> in<00:01:59.160> that

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
don't need to keep the string up in that

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.240 
don't need to keep the string up in that
area<00:02:00.320> this<00:02:01.320> watch<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.679> doesn't<00:02:01.920> get<00:02:02.009> caught

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.320 
I keep a record of the particular rocket
that<00:03:03.690> I'm<00:03:03.840> stringing<00:03:04.260> so<00:03:04.830> that<00:03:05.100> I<00:03:05.280> don't<00:03:06.210> have

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
that I'm stringing so that I don't have
