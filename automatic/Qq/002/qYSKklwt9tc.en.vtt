00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.880

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.580

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.130

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.320

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.740
 choose what gif they want if the 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.630
 book depository or the Amazon or the 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.100
 Gandhi, you are free to choose what 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.310
 what I 'm going to ask you is that it's just a 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.259
 comment to avoid my stress of seeing 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.170
 repeated comments because my draw 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.670
 of ghosn grabs like four people who 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.369
 they had put like five comments 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.800
 every time and the truth is not loose 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.690
 no case of coss see I could not even 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.369
 finish the contest because people 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.229
 who won the first time is never 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.210
 agreement with me the second person who 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.429
 won he reported to me and he made me very 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.200
 good questions that first if I could 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.300
 go and collect yes and where are you going 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.640
 send and a lot of people's problems 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.210
 I pose for the end to tell me 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.950
 that they had given it to him 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:25.210
 already for his birthday then he does not 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:29.740
 I could accept the book but suddenly 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:32.770
 make the lot so difficult that I no longer 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.840
 has to draw with the third time but 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.300
 well let's hope that this new draw 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.070
 that is already international work of 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.900
 wonder then I ask you to be a 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.670
 just comment to leave in want 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.500

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.570
 facebook page and follow me on twitter 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.120
 this is giving mobility to get away 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.430
 Tura because I do not like how it 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.260
 has been developing my life on twitter 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.890
 then but still if they want to continue 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.720

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.510

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.030
 mobile then yes yes and if that is 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.370

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.280
