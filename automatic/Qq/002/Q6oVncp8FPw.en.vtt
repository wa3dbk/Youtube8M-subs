00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.260
 I state that it has nothing against the 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.210
 committed 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.309
 But here's their job is to 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.840
 make you buy as much stuff as possible as 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.970
 you can trust them when you see them 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.740
 arrive they ask you need help and you 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.309
 would you like to I would like the thing that 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.990
 It costs less 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.760
 I have to do a future cock but something 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.410
 all over a thousand euros and when you 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.630
 they say I recommend this because of 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.100
 high quality hybridized are telling you 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.539
 I recommend this because it costs a fuck 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.490
 every time I go shopping 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.690
 as an unconditional reflex I try to 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.410
 avoid the salesmen around the 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.060
 supermarket 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.859
 even though I know they don't want to tell me anything 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.659
 it was simply putting it right 

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:36.190
 to the stuff or I'm starting to behave 

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:38.019
 like a thief when I look for eggs with 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.609
 the most recent expiration date I am 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:41.319
 punctually at the end some time ago 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:42.460
 he had gone to buy me a pair of jeans 

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:44.499
 because the ones I had were me 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.699
 tight as soon as I enter my shop 

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:47.229
 look meets that of all 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.030
 committed and I know what they were 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:50.769
 thinking it was to whom it touches on such and the 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.600
 wallets today so I approach towards 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:54.249
 the men's trouser department and the clerk 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.469
 gets closer to the fa serves help the 

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:58.120
 obviously no no I'm watching and he is 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:59.799
 away so he just sees a couple that 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.449
 I like to try to control the price 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:02.979
 but with crap labels we had 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:04.449
 obviously they had the price 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:06.010
 hidden because I could not 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.540
 find it and so desperate to start at 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.130
 check and recheck until a 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.440
 another saleswoman approaches me making circles 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.000
 thai a henoko i nor circle price is 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.280
 what I thought of saying what 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.020
 I said it was yes the size so I 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.850
 indicates the size and smiles at me and stays 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.980
 half a meter away to stare at me 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.480
 then I try to say how much it costs 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.010
 but evidently I didn't say it high 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.460
 voice because he is approaching me again 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.380
 does 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.480
 I need more help than I was in now 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.490
 shy idiot mode I replied no no 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.080
 now I try it this summer I went to 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.850
 to buy me a shirt I had to buy 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.350
 one shirt I do not remember why 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.670
 the fact is that the order starts at 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.320
 propose clothes to everyone 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.400
 accessories that can be combined with the 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.900
 color of the shirt I was wearing 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.000
 buying with the shape of my body and 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.440
 I tried to eric and I wouldn't have much 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.030
 bought nothing of the rubbish that I had 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.560
 he was proposing but anyway she is 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.120
 managed to keep me in stores for more than 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.620
 half an hour but when I left I am 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.270
 came out victorious I had bought 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.250
 just a shirt and nothing else 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.990
 I know they probably are 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.760
 just paranoia they do nothing but 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.260
 doing their job saying need 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.240
 help but this time is different 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.159
 when I was younger I and the rest 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.870
 of the family we had gone mcdonald 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.460
 while my mother the other two brothers 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.379
 my father and I were at the table 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.660
 we lost food so the first thing that 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:11.040
 we ordered was a 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.600
 for simple without sauce for mine 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.100
 younger brother so my father 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.420
 asked if that sandwich could carry it 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.400
 immediately without waiting for it to arrive 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.900
 all pointing to my brother I know that 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.460
 he had asked because this was how he started 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.170
 eat immediately since five years a 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.880
 however, eating took so long to 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.620
 the shop assistant answers him no if not then 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.660
 he takes the sandwich and runs away without paying 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.370
 now I know that what he said makes sense but 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.200
 cabbage a guy with glasses a 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.060
 13 year old child will definitely be 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.310
 the fearsome criminal burger thieves 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.720
 and I know we could look a little 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.640
 unkempt since we were returning 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.440
 from the summer holidays but then if we wanted 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.010
 to steal for food because it is only one 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.240
 Hamburger 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.950
 fact is that he gave him a euro and then 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.020
 brought the burger to my brother e 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.340
 then ordered the rest is in 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.740
 treat cases when the clerk will 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.220
 need I know you don't find something him 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.220
 it's never there
