five from last-man-standing today it's a

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:13.330 
five from last-man-standing today it's a
very<00:00:10.910> very<00:00:11.210> simple<00:00:11.480> product<00:00:11.719> to<00:00:11.900> use<00:00:12.190> tear<00:00:13.190> of

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
very very simple product to use tear of

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.170 
very very simple product to use tear of
a<00:00:13.430> heat<00:00:13.639> sealed<00:00:13.879> bag<00:00:15.400> and<00:00:16.400> we<00:00:16.460> open<00:00:16.760> the<00:00:16.820> bag<00:00:16.940> of

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
a heat sealed bag and we open the bag of

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.080 
a heat sealed bag and we open the bag of
two<00:00:17.360> chemicals<00:00:18.039> the<00:00:19.039> main<00:00:19.250> chemical<00:00:19.730> the<00:00:19.910> the

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
two chemicals the main chemical the the

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.380 
two chemicals the main chemical the the
that's<00:00:20.600> mostly<00:00:21.080> in<00:00:21.259> there<00:00:21.410> is<00:00:21.619> white<00:00:22.039> thrilled

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
that's mostly in there is white thrilled

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.720 
that's mostly in there is white thrilled
it's<00:00:23.750> the<00:00:23.990> oxidizer<00:00:24.800> and<00:00:25.130> this<00:00:25.310> little<00:00:25.550> baggie

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
it's the oxidizer and this little baggie

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.939 
it's the oxidizer and this little baggie
is<00:00:25.939> the<00:00:26.060> catalyst<00:00:26.630> it's<00:00:27.410> very<00:00:27.589> simple<00:00:27.829> you

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
is the catalyst it's very simple you

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.779 
is the catalyst it's very simple you
just<00:00:27.980> open<00:00:29.410> baggie<00:00:30.410> and<00:00:30.710> then<00:00:31.400> jump<00:00:31.609> a<00:00:31.699> little

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
just open baggie and then jump a little

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:45.700 
just open baggie and then jump a little
baggie<00:00:33.400> into<00:00:34.400> the<00:00:34.850> oxidizer<00:00:41.860> and<00:00:44.110> the<00:00:45.110> goal<00:00:45.380> is

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
baggie into the oxidizer and the goal is

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.000 
baggie into the oxidizer and the goal is
to<00:00:45.740> get<00:00:46.100> all<00:00:46.700> of<00:00:47.060> the<00:00:47.270> white<00:00:47.750> oxidizer<00:00:48.350> coated

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
to get all of the white oxidizer coated

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.100 
to get all of the white oxidizer coated
with<00:00:49.250> the<00:00:49.400> catalyst<00:00:49.910> so<00:00:50.420> it<00:00:50.540> should<00:00:50.690> be<00:00:50.810> black

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
with the catalyst so it should be black

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.730 
with the catalyst so it should be black
when<00:00:51.500> you're<00:00:51.650> done<00:00:51.860> and<00:00:53.080> you<00:00:54.080> got<00:00:54.200> a<00:00:54.230> shake<00:00:54.500> for

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:54.740 
when you're done and you got a shake for

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:00.280 
when you're done and you got a shake for
I<00:00:54.800> recommend<00:00:55.540> 45<00:00:56.540> seconds<00:00:56.960> to<00:00:57.080> a<00:00:57.140> minute<00:00:59.290> take

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
I recommend 45 seconds to a minute take

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.539 
I recommend 45 seconds to a minute take
really<00:01:00.920> really<00:01:01.160> well<00:01:03.100> and<00:01:04.100> once<00:01:04.369> the

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
really really well and once the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.850 
really really well and once the
chemicals<00:01:05.030> are<00:01:05.239> thoroughly<00:01:05.659> mixed<00:01:05.860> should

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
chemicals are thoroughly mixed should

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.279 
chemicals are thoroughly mixed should
look<00:01:07.070> a<00:01:07.159> lot<00:01:07.310> like<00:01:07.460> this<00:01:08.109> you<00:01:09.109> see<00:01:09.320> in<00:01:09.409> there

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:11.289 
look a lot like this you see in there

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:14.770 
look a lot like this you see in there
like<00:01:12.289> I<00:01:12.350> said<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.619> objective<00:01:12.740> is<00:01:13.219> to<00:01:13.249> have<00:01:13.780> all

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
like I said the objective is to have all

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.349 
like I said the objective is to have all
of<00:01:14.840> the<00:01:15.579> oxidizer<00:01:16.579> covered<00:01:17.119> with<00:01:17.270> the

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:17.359 
of the oxidizer covered with the

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:18.550 
of the oxidizer covered with the
catalyst<00:01:17.780> so<00:01:17.899> everything<00:01:18.140> should<00:01:18.259> be<00:01:18.350> black

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
catalyst so everything should be black

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:35.280 
catalyst so everything should be black
inside<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:18.979> bag<00:01:19.130> where<00:01:19.310> I<00:01:19.340> set<00:01:19.579> it<00:01:19.640> up<00:01:19.729> here

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:02:09.030 

I'll<00:01:35.770> show<00:01:36.010> you<00:01:36.100> what<00:01:36.220> this<00:01:36.310> looks<00:01:36.550> like

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.530 

as<00:02:10.040> you<00:02:10.220> see<00:02:10.369> it's<00:02:10.520> a<00:02:10.640> it's<00:02:10.850> a<00:02:10.910> very<00:02:10.940> powerful

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
as you see it's a it's a very powerful

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.870 
as you see it's a it's a very powerful
explosive<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:12.770> big<00:02:12.920> thing<00:02:13.130> is<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.550> get<00:02:13.670> it<00:02:13.790> to

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
explosive the big thing is to get it to

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.700 
explosive the big thing is to get it to
go<00:02:13.970> off<00:02:14.150> is<00:02:14.420> you<00:02:14.540> have<00:02:14.660> to<00:02:14.780> use<00:02:14.900> a<00:02:15.140> round<00:02:15.440> going

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
go off is you have to use a round going

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.280 
go off is you have to use a round going
above<00:02:15.920> 2,000<00:02:16.580> feet<00:02:16.700> per<00:02:16.940> second<00:02:17.360> so<00:02:18.020> most<00:02:18.230> of

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
above 2,000 feet per second so most of

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.600 
above 2,000 feet per second so most of
your<00:02:18.410> handgun<00:02:18.770> rounds<00:02:19.070> aren't<00:02:19.250> going<00:02:19.430> to<00:02:19.490> set

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
your handgun rounds aren't going to set

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.540 
your handgun rounds aren't going to set
it<00:02:19.700> off<00:02:19.850> should<00:02:20.660> recommend<00:02:20.900> an<00:02:21.080> ar-15<00:02:21.740> or<00:02:22.220> to<00:02:22.520> a

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
it off should recommend an ar-15 or to a

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.360 
it off should recommend an ar-15 or to a
308<00:02:23.000> or<00:02:23.420> something<00:02:23.750> of<00:02:24.200> that<00:02:24.260> magnitude<00:02:24.530> it

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
308 or something of that magnitude it

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.160 
308 or something of that magnitude it
does<00:02:25.520> create<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:26.120> pretty<00:02:26.720> good<00:02:26.870> amount<00:02:27.110> of

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
does create a pretty good amount of

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.810 
does create a pretty good amount of
damage<00:02:27.320> like<00:02:28.190> I<00:02:28.280> said<00:02:28.460> before<00:02:28.550> it's<00:02:28.760> a<00:02:28.790> very

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
damage like I said before it's a very

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.490 
damage like I said before it's a very
powerful<00:02:29.390> explosive<00:02:29.600> so<00:02:29.960> be<00:02:30.110> sure<00:02:30.260> that<00:02:30.410> you

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
powerful explosive so be sure that you

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.240 
powerful explosive so be sure that you
are<00:02:30.530> practicing<00:02:31.310> safe<00:02:31.850> in<00:02:32.110> maybe<00:02:33.110> 50<00:02:33.470> 60<00:02:33.860> 70

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
are practicing safe in maybe 50 60 70

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.840 
are practicing safe in maybe 50 60 70
plus<00:02:34.490> yards<00:02:34.700> away<00:02:34.960> so<00:02:35.960> that<00:02:36.110> no<00:02:36.230> one<00:02:36.320> gets<00:02:36.470> hurt

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
plus yards away so that no one gets hurt

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.070 
plus yards away so that no one gets hurt
