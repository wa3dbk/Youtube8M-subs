 Mandela dressed in black desire 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.440
 the visions of the world 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.440
 without any central vision 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.960
 I do not know the group 7 the rank and it makes noise 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.700
 still racing in the ditch the new prototype 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.700

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.430
 those who first appear to validate 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.820
 for sure people buy from us 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:05.930
 the only one to pay 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.220

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.260
 the singer has myself 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.080
 the first number 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.280
 after 36 months and in the genre 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.280
 in general satisfied with our players 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.350

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.620
 the tourism trip 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.670
 a way to lyon 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.430
 they hailed co2 emissions 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.530
 Saturday to the spread of boys 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.010
 to note that the average 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.010
 that's how it's played with a big month 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.960
 all the people who pastry in the sport bild 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.550

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.830

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.290
 only the fields 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.940
 on our side here we are at what's the point 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.940
 in montreal the places were already sold 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.519
 the strongest moment 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.459
 gold is not beautiful 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.109

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.159

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.669
