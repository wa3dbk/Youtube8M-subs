00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 He never asks anyone to promise me 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.899
 nothing because the promises are for 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.540
 always and forever is the span of 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.809
 very long time more when one is in 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.809
 a cage 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.790
 how many people welcome from the 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.650
 story a week i am víctor houses 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.860
 and today I will talk about a single 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.510
 incomparable iván by catherine apple 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.180
 this book from the ocean editorial and that 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.890
 counting with only 314 pages we 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.930
 remember the humans that can reach 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.640
 be the literary characters but of 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.290
 what is this story this book we 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.140
 tells the story of a gorilla called 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.970
 Ivan but things are not so simple 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.040
 as they seem since there are thousands of reasons 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.720
 for which Ivan is a very 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.370
 special because he is an artist of 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.110
 birth of a being with a 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.940
 questioning and reasoning quite 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.040
 big or just because it's from the 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.840
 more pure and human characters than one 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.850
 you can find Ivan is the narrator 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.829
 of this story and tells us what they have 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.670
 been in the last years of his life to 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.829
 put in context 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.110
 Ivan is something like the attraction of a 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.360
 place called the shopping center the 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.100
 great circus and as you would expect is a 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.690
 be that he has spent much of his life 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.550
 locked and with the passage of the pages 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.680
 it is realizing babies skin 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.570
 accompanied loners there is and is 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.550
 that Ivan is not alone as such 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.810
 since it is not the only attraction in this 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.880
 place since within the same 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.670
 we will find creatures that like Ivan 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.780
 The only thing that can be said is that this 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.970
 extraordinary so they teach us two 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.620
 things the first is that although many what 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.080
 doubt the animals have their own 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.000
 thoughts feelings and above all 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.620
 his own dreams and the second thing that 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.840
 teaches us what is the true 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.970
 meaning of a home and vaughn was not 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.680
 unhappy but this does not mean that you 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.390
 he will like the life he had 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.220
 but over time it is made 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.690
 used to it but all this 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.670
 was about to change when a 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.440
 new animal comes to the big center now 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.150
 Ivan is going to have to question what 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.250
 would be willing to do with another month 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.930
 with this last event Ivan will be given 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.270
 account that many aspects of his past 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.830
 that he thought he had forgotten maybe 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.270
 I had them a little more present than 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.310
 that they have thought and that is a story 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.110
 that holds a lot of meaning for the 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.880
 messages and for the deep issues 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.140
 that covers in addition to the way so 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.479
 extraordinary in that our 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.190
 protagonist responds to the events that 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.320
 he has prepared him the life is the typical 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.690
 book that the more you read it and March 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.970
 try to analyze more you can lose 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.040
 in the link very quickly opened from 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.440
 my favorites but if we consider 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.000
 the end I gave him four of five 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.830
 stars because even though the final 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.780
 it's very good it made me a little bit 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.330
 precipitate and one as a reader sometimes 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.250
 like losing the thread of what is 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.750
 but this again I will keep 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.790
 I recommend this book because it is 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.470
 simply the unique incomparable Ivan 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.390
 it's one of those books that never ever 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.920
 you should stop talking for the 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.540
 such extraordinary characters that he has 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.700
 for the deep messages that it has 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.250
 and especially for having a lot 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.810
 meaning in all its 314 pages 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.040
 but well I think it would be all that 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.780
 he has to tell you this time 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.520
 I hope you can help us by giving you a 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.660
 like this video and well you know that 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.740
 all social networks so that 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.970
 we are in contact will be 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.430
 appearing in the bottom 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.790
 I am from Victor Casa and very good 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.790
