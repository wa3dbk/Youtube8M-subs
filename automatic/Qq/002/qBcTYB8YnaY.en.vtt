00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:11.389
 Then I would like to make shaved ice with origami 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.389
 Finished go like this 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.000
 That 's right 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.000
 Doing 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:28.640
 Origami uses hockey stuff today but why is it 15 cm origami 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:35.980
 Usual 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.980
 It is a square shape guy do I'll use to cut it in half 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:48.150
 Let's suffered immediately because they can be there in one piece It is this 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.150
 First of all I will make a crease 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.239
 At first we make a crease on the side 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.830
 It is And then Te now freshly also a Gosatokiri 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.490
 Well, I don't mind if I don't care about the child 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.649
 For now 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.649
 I mean the place of my sister and half 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.929
 It is And then Te door 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.159
 Also I hear 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:37.100
 To fit the fold 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.100
 Potte get commensurate cage It is here 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.060
 How is it right now I feel like I have a crease 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.060
 Yes 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.830
 Then I will 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:04.680
 This is the fold I just made 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.680
 It was about 5 mm and I will be behind you 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.660
 It looks like this is a bit more There is this fold 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.660
 I understand 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.110
 If you remember so far this time 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.110
 I feel like this now 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.040
 I agree 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.959
 Well N many in about that that is divided into three equal parts 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.959
 I will keep going 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:56.409
 From here to here 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:56.409
 This is about half of the half 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.659
 Available at the semi-hardy in the same way 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.050
 It feels like 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.840
 The other looks And then 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.840
 From near the bottom 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:23.120
 There is a fold here but it is up there 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.120
 We will think 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:39.650
 And then it is even more 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.650
 I'm also at the same place, but this time below 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:48.480
 I will go 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:48.480
 In just a guide Please step-by-step to the point where the white origami is visible 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:04.030
 It's like this now This is like a hen 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:09.450
 If it breaks up here, turn it over 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.450
 It is Honda It is a place that is in this stage Well 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.750
 Nanami 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.750
 I agree 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.750
 Here is creased 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.390
 At the opposite turtle I think like this 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.420
 If you make a crease like this 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.320
 Next time 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:41.650
 It's a little difficult here, but there is this moat 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.650
 At that time I feel like putting in this 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.760
 It is strange 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.760
 Put in 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:57.870
 You are here 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.870
 When you flip one 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.630
 in this way 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.270
 Something like this 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.270
 This 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:16.700
 It is part of that bowl of shaved ice 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.950
 First of all I think 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:24.729
 If you make a crease in the back 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:26.940
 I'll open and come, I'll put in a crease 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:29.530
 And once 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.330
 Return 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.110
 Turn over 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.110
 I feel say 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.300
 It may not come for a while, but it may be hard to do that Sasha 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.470
 Please try doing a good look at the line moving a little 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.680
 Previously another after Once you have their in the 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.680
 8 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:56.439
 This white part 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.620
 Slightly inwards 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:11.580
 Well, it will be in the form of this shaved ice 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:13.300
 I decided to decide where I feel from somewhere 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.520
 It's not one and 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:19.530
 It hurts again 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:25.610
 Well , I think it would be better if I got a little rounder 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:25.610
 In it Moreover you are more Once depending on It is a once a little wave 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:32.560
 You can make a smooth scraped ice 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:39.420
 I think this is good 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.289
 The rest is the lower part 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:45.539
 this 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:45.539
 I will open a little below 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:48.779
 Sideways 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:52.180
 There is also the other side 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:07:03.480
 It is by raising slightly above it is was this it is it is after Te 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:03.480
 This is the completion of the vessel 

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:11.849
 It is feeling 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.849
 Turn over and liked in this way in 

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:22.199
 After that other origami to make a part of this white 

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:23.139
 And its good to write in is also good care and magic pasted I love from the top subordinates 

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:24.910
 Do you think 

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:29.610
 Yo i am 

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:33.020
 It 's like I was stuck with the topping Orian 

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:38.500
 Well , put on your favorite syrup 

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:38.500
 Please decorate nicely Thank you for watching
