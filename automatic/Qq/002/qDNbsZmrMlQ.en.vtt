00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.090 

let's<00:02:27.480> first<00:02:27.720> placing<00:02:28.110> these<00:02:28.200> caches<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.920> was

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
let's first placing these caches I was

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.250 
let's first placing these caches I was
thinking<00:02:29.550> yeah<00:02:30.210> the<00:02:30.510> river<00:02:30.660> might<00:02:30.900> get<00:02:31.230> a

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
thinking yeah the river might get a

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.710 
thinking yeah the river might get a
little<00:02:31.440> bit<00:02:31.620> high<00:02:31.890> but<00:02:32.310> chances<00:02:33.150> are<00:02:33.480> the

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
little bit high but chances are the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.230 
little bit high but chances are the
cache<00:02:33.960> isn't<00:02:34.500> going<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.740> be<00:02:34.860> washed<00:02:35.670> away<00:02:35.910> I

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
cache isn't going to be washed away I

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.390 
cache isn't going to be washed away I
mean<00:02:36.390> I<00:02:36.510> was<00:02:36.630> hiding<00:02:36.840> caches<00:02:37.410> hundreds<00:02:38.280> of

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
mean I was hiding caches hundreds of

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.730 
mean I was hiding caches hundreds of
hundreds<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:38.790> feet<00:02:38.940> away<00:02:39.060> from<00:02:39.210> the<00:02:39.450> river

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
hundreds of feet away from the river

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.350 
hundreds of feet away from the river

out like the majority of mine did Conan

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.070 
out like the majority of mine did Conan
I<00:03:00.990> made<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.850> cache<00:03:02.850> location<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:03.960> one

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
I made it to the cache location the one

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.360 
I made it to the cache location the one
that<00:03:04.230> we<00:03:04.290> have<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.530> replace<00:03:04.830> and<00:03:06.110> here<00:03:07.110> we<00:03:07.230> are
