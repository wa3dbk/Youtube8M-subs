00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
you're going to start out with three

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.229 
you're going to start out with three
cups<00:00:40.130> of<00:00:40.430> warm<00:00:41.390> water<00:00:41.780> and<00:00:42.879> then<00:00:43.879> you're<00:00:44.030> going

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
cups of warm water and then you're going

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.759 
cups of warm water and then you're going
to<00:00:44.480> add<00:00:45.129> six<00:00:46.129> tablespoons<00:00:46.460> of<00:00:47.120> sugar<00:00:47.739> to<00:00:48.739> that

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:55.540 
to add six tablespoons of sugar to that
water<00:00:49.719> there<00:00:50.719> is<00:00:51.050> six<00:00:52.239> okay<00:00:53.739> um<00:00:54.739> and<00:00:55.010> the

water there is six okay um and the

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.729 
water there is six okay um and the
reason<00:00:55.789> why<00:00:55.909> I'm<00:00:56.149> doing<00:00:56.179> this<00:00:56.629> I'm<00:00:57.230> using<00:00:57.409> the

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
reason why I'm doing this I'm using the

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.369 
reason why I'm doing this I'm using the
typical<00:00:57.980> measurements<00:00:58.789> and<00:00:58.909> not<00:00:59.149> the<00:00:59.569> metric

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
typical measurements and not the metric

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.259 
typical measurements and not the metric
system<00:01:00.530> for<00:01:00.949> this<00:01:01.460> one<00:01:01.670> is<00:01:01.789> because<00:01:02.059> that's

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
system for this one is because that's

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.140 
system for this one is because that's
the<00:01:02.480> way<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:02.749> truss<00:01:02.929> became<00:01:03.289> so<00:01:03.589> for<00:01:04.150> easiness

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
the way the truss became so for easiness

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.090 
the way the truss became so for easiness
and<00:01:05.330> for<00:01:05.600> your<00:01:05.750> easiness<00:01:06.170> I'm<00:01:06.380> doing<00:01:06.710> it<00:01:06.860> with

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
and for your easiness I'm doing it with

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.370 
and for your easiness I'm doing it with

turn<00:02:29.850> it<00:02:30.030> on<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.510> just<00:02:30.540> keep<00:02:30.900> adding<00:02:31.140> flour

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
turn it on and just keep adding flour

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.170 
turn it on and just keep adding flour
until<00:02:32.100> it's<00:02:33.060> meeting<00:02:33.570> properly<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:35.150> none<00:02:36.150> of

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
until it's meeting properly and none of

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.900 
until it's meeting properly and none of
the<00:02:36.630> dough<00:02:36.980> sticks<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.400> side<00:02:38.550> of<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.730> bowl

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
the dough sticks to the side of the bowl

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.250 
the dough sticks to the side of the bowl
anymore<00:02:39.300> it<00:02:39.390> has<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.750> be<00:02:39.840> like<00:02:40.019> a<00:02:40.050> good

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
anymore it has to be like a good

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.330 
anymore it has to be like a good
consistency<00:02:40.980> for<00:02:41.910> shaping<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.220> handling<00:02:44.220> it

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
consistency for shaping and handling it

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.890 
consistency for shaping and handling it
that<00:02:44.459> kind<00:02:44.700> of<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.850> thing<00:02:45.030> so<00:02:45.239> we're<00:02:45.720> going<00:02:45.810> to

let this rise until it's double in size
which<00:04:16.669> usually<00:04:16.880> takes<00:04:17.269> about<00:04:17.419> half<00:04:17.539> an<00:04:17.870> hour

so so you're going to put a damp cloth
over<00:05:34.300> these<00:05:34.719> and<00:05:35.339> let<00:05:36.339> them<00:05:36.490> double<00:05:36.819> in<00:05:36.879> size

00:05:37.049 --> 00:05:37.059

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
again so if that's anywhere from 15

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.189 
again so if that's anywhere from 15
minutes<00:05:39.610> to<00:05:40.089> half<00:05:40.330> an<00:05:40.449> hour<00:05:40.629> when<00:05:40.929> they're<00:05:41.050> in
