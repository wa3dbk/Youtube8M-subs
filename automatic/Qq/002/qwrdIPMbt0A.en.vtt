 good friends for this first of all 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.670
 we have to have to log in to a 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.860
 Microsoft account in windows 10 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.470
 we will go to the start menu we will give 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.900
 click on the user and then change the 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.430
 configuration of the account here we 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.380
 we will connect to our account 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.490
 microsoft or a common email 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.670
 that we use 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:41.280
 well - after that we will introduce 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.060
 the application of the store in my case already 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.060
 I have it open 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.940
 and in the top part is that 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.789
 we will look for word 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.739
 and send us to what would be this 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.320
 these results of our 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.450
 we will find the applications of 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.630
 windows forgiveness of 2015 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.520
 but before they can install it they have 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.940
 you installed an office version 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:10.190
 I recommend you to uninstall the 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.440
 since if they have it installed they will not be able to 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.380
 open the applications 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.560
 good friends once you are 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.780
 uninstalled now if we proceed to the 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.159
 installation we are going to click on the 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.259
 application 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.009
 and we will install it in a normal way 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.929
 we simply click on free and with 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.439
 that friends will be installing what 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:36.320
 it would be the new applications for 2000 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.659
 2015 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.680
 good friends work great at 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.680
 to be a sample 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.080
 now here is working well 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:55.100
 and good friends, that's practically everything 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.100
 what we have to do this 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.350
 already to finalize those that imitate a 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.350
 group that I have facebook 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.430
 which is called youtubers football and good 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.240
 I invite you to go through this group and 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.660
 join 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.990
 and thus promote your YouTube channel 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.050
 with your videos and good friends that's 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.480
 practically everything 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.000
 so base is simply installed in the 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.510
 store and we install it does not take long in 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.580
 to install itself takes a few minutes 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.890
 and once installed it will appear 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.170
 this side the application in my case of 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.840
 I already have the excel and the 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.819
