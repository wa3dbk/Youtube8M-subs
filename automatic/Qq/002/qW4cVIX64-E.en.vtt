00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
that there are no Penguins in the

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.120 
that there are no Penguins in the
Penguins<00:03:36.290> world<00:03:36.560> today<00:03:37.750> we<00:03:38.750> were<00:03:39.110> cheated<00:03:39.890> out

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130

of<00:03:40.250> witnessing<00:03:40.910> some<00:03:41.120> very<00:03:41.300> cute<00:03:41.570> penguins

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
of witnessing some very cute penguins

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.850 
of witnessing some very cute penguins
it's<00:03:44.240> about<00:03:44.450> 30<00:03:44.750> degrees<00:03:45.170> outside<00:03:45.380> so<00:03:45.590> they

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
it's about 30 degrees outside so they

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.010 
it's about 30 degrees outside so they
probably<00:03:46.010> can't<00:03:46.340> handle<00:03:46.670> the<00:03:46.760> heat<00:03:49.900> right<00:03:50.900> so

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
you come to the zoo don't come in the

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.980 
you come to the zoo don't come in the
middle<00:06:46.850> of<00:06:47.060> the<00:06:47.120> day<00:06:47.270> like<00:06:47.300> that<00:06:47.600> one<00:06:47.810> o'clock

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:47.990 
middle of the day like that one o'clock

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.540 
middle of the day like that one o'clock
in<00:06:48.080> the<00:06:48.200> afternoon<00:06:48.260> like<00:06:48.560> we<00:06:48.770> did<00:06:48.950> because<00:06:49.520> I

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.550 
in the afternoon like we did because I

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:50.560 
in the afternoon like we did because I
think<00:06:49.760> that's<00:06:49.910> the<00:06:50.000> time<00:06:50.120> when<00:06:50.300> mostly

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:50.570 
think that's the time when mostly

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.660 
think that's the time when mostly
animals<00:06:50.840> actually<00:06:50.930> sleeping<00:06:51.500> yeah<00:06:51.920> sure<00:06:52.310> yeah

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:52.670 
animals actually sleeping yeah sure yeah

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.190 
animals actually sleeping yeah sure yeah
I<00:06:52.700> think<00:06:53.000> he<00:06:53.060> comes<00:06:53.210> into<00:06:53.360> if<00:06:53.600> you<00:06:53.690> can<00:06:53.900> come

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:54.200 
I think he comes into if you can come

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.900 
I think he comes into if you can come
early<00:06:54.230> in<00:06:54.470> the<00:06:54.500> morning<00:06:54.830> or<00:06:55.010> later<00:06:55.580> on<00:06:55.730> in<00:06:55.850> the

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:55.910 
early in the morning or later on in the

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:57.040 
early in the morning or later on in the
day<00:06:56.060> but<00:06:56.120> probably<00:06:56.570> best<00:06:56.720> early<00:06:56.870> in<00:06:56.990> the

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.050 
day but probably best early in the

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.300 
day but probably best early in the
morning<00:06:57.320> that's<00:06:57.530> when<00:06:57.650> the<00:06:57.770> annals<00:06:58.160> a<00:06:58.190> bit

another<00:07:19.250> animal

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:27.620 

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.070 

I<00:07:27.710> think<00:07:28.580> he<00:07:28.699> dug<00:07:28.970> himself<00:07:29.090> a<00:07:29.419> little<00:07:29.630> hole<00:07:29.990> in

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 
I think he dug himself a little hole in

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.740 
I think he dug himself a little hole in
the<00:07:30.169> ground<00:07:30.350> so<00:07:30.770> you<00:07:30.830> could<00:07:31.100> cool<00:07:31.430> down<00:07:31.750> and

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:32.750 
the ground so you could cool down and

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.469 
the ground so you could cool down and
dig<00:07:32.930> up<00:07:33.080> the<00:07:33.229> cool<00:07:33.410> earth<00:07:33.650> underneath<00:07:34.330> so<00:07:35.330> you

00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:35.479 
dig up the cool earth underneath so you

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:38.590 
dig up the cool earth underneath so you
could<00:07:35.630> lay<00:07:35.810> in<00:07:35.870> and<00:07:36.080> cool<00:07:36.320> down
