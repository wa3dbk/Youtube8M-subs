00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.160 
actually 1500 million power battery
cells<00:02:12.540> pop<00:02:12.900> it

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
cells pop it

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.500 
cells pop it
there<00:02:13.349> tell<00:02:14.310> it's<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.520> global<00:02:14.910> device<00:02:15.180> with<00:02:15.420> the

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
there tell it's a global device with the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.000 
there tell it's a global device with the
