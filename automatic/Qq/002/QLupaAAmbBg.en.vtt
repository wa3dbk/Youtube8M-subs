00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.290
 also connected here on the channel on youtube 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.389
 beauty people here talking in the open 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.210
 bringing another video guys here 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.859
 to talk about the formula-1 2015 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.109
 finally we have information about 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.029
 the game after either season of formula 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.609
 1 started there in real life , right? 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.279
 and we have information straight from the 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.260
 codemasters galeras posted in the blog 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.789
 he's talking about the game and 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.380
 finally speak on a date of 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.290
 launch is because they knew that they 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.660
 that there is the famous 2015 in the 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.850
 playstation 4 box ipc will be released 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.590
 when the actual Formula 1 90 started more 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.050
 It was not what happened and he 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.969
 they said there was a date of 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.890
 launch at least the same because it 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.039
 do not talk there is no exact date and they said 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.260
 that the game will be released in June to 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:55.110
 xbox the year playstation 4 ipc not talking 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.030
 no date would be day 10 and it would be day 12 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.030
 on many websites saying it's going to be day 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.949
 12 and it will be day 14 but nothing was 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.120
 confirmed by pole but they still they 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.949
 just said that the game will be 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.409
 released in June 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.729
 beauty, it's obviously from here to 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.380
 when you leave some date 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.549
 release on the game I'll tell 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.040
 you are beauty 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.869
 but in addition they spoke one more 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.420
 little about the game of the galley then 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.009
 I said that what they said and the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.890
 news that we will finally have 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.240
 in this forum 2015 beauty first 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.400
 one thing that we already know is going 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.560
 have changed they said there that the new 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.409
 indjai new graphics engine will offer 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.110
 both graphical improvements but obviously 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.890
 it is also in the mechanics of the cars they 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.570
 said that 20 areas of cars will have 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.490
 the line in question of the new 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.340
 India in the new graphics engine including 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.200
 the engine to the aerodynamic 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.810
 car fuel tank force 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.409
 feedback suspension and the most notable 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.170
 that the physical force of the tires is 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.880
 tires they will take a greater action in the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.329
 while you have to drive again 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.259
 you have is with all the help of the 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:06.509
 car then disabled tire aaf 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.530
 is much more realistic and should be 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.530
 to mind is a new beauty graphic engine 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.300
 and ah they also said that 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.730
 have managed to recreate feature of 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.590
 car drive this ideal breath 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.390
 I think and believe it to be a matter of 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.030
 the car's suspension swung and when 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.890
 happens to see the signal when the force 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.420
 a curve I do not know but they said that 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.220
 This is much more real. 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.290
 obviously not very nice 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.750
 that if you have a playstation camera 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.750
 or some headset on playstation 4 you 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.989
 will be able to communicate with your team 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.430
 request information via headset or 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.280
 playstation camera that is much of 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.690
 What time are you playing and what is she talking about? 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.880
 with the team as if it were really 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.500
 a Formula 1 car there is information 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.019
 About the car, how's the car there? 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.580
 gave the tire of tap explode too 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.739
 It's going to be really cool, that's what they said. 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.470
 that this will have also informs 2015 and 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.790
 interested in testing is maybe I use 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.590
 This during the event I do not know anymore. 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.209
 let's see how it will work I 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.890
 I'm excited to see how it goes. 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.550
 this issue of the command of 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.620
 voice 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.930
 another very interesting thing is that 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.540
 finally will have there in the formula-1 2015 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.250
 is the issue of temporary because they 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.110
 were more than temporary that the 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.760
 We already know about the game. 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.100
 new molds even then it will have the 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.480
 I think a lot of player championship 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.030
 Decision also a new mode is called 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.000
 which will bring a new style 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.820
 and narrative for the pilot as well as 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.459
 the podium galley exactly this new way 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.380
 prognosis will add the podium ie 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.780
 besides the podium since they are not things 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.760
 that the player will have the 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.859
 line for example of sines before 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.109
 start the race is casino 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:43.989
 interview that their team is there 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:46.329
 entering his room to know there 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.560
 I finally faced the podium in the 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.530
 Formula 1 Carlos is something that people 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.750
 I asked a lot since 2010 when pictures 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.820
 I did not put do not know why because 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.220
 playstation 2 games had I do not know why 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.440
 that she did not raise the issue 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.030
 of interview having a 2011 I was mistaken 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.859
 very cool and hit the chat here 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.600
 already end up liking more or 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:06.519
 not you depends on what you say 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.500
 they took it later but it all goes 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.510
 come back now in this new model this new 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.859
 way there in the call of procession then 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.109
 It's going to be a good thing. 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:15.609
 finally, in which none can leave the 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.959
 Formula 1 game will be very exciting 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.590
 it is also their use to see how it goes 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.750
 to be 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.590
 that this question of sequence and 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.790
 no internet 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.169
 We're going to have the game, and it 's okay. 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.780
 interesting and lastly he closed 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.430
 here saying here is a ball game but 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.440
 I think they are most in need. 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.060
 There is the new chapter of the formula franchise 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.520
