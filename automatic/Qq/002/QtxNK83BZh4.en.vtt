Jude<00:00:11.340> last<00:00:11.490> week<00:00:11.670> what<00:00:11.820> do<00:00:11.969> you<00:00:12.059> think<00:00:12.300> what<00:00:12.599> do

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
Jude last week what do you think what do

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.749 
Jude last week what do you think what do
you<00:00:12.690> do<00:00:12.960> in<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.469> off<00:00:13.620> week<00:00:13.860> or<00:00:14.099> in<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.460> split

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
you do in the off week or in the split

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.670 
you do in the off week or in the split
you<00:00:14.849> had<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.360> prepare<00:00:15.660> for<00:00:15.960> this<00:00:16.049> mesh<00:00:16.230> I<00:00:16.440> think

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
you had to prepare for this mesh I think

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.230 
you had to prepare for this mesh I think
we<00:00:16.800> actually<00:00:16.980> managed<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.580> figure<00:00:17.850> out<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.060> way

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
we actually managed to figure out a way

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.120 
we actually managed to figure out a way
to<00:00:18.300> make<00:00:18.510> our<00:00:18.630> practice<00:00:19.109> be<00:00:19.320> meaningful<00:00:19.949> so

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
to make our practice be meaningful so

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.120 
to make our practice be meaningful so
we're<00:00:20.279> actually<00:00:20.430> getting<00:00:21.020> good<00:00:22.130> improving

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
we're actually getting good improving

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.170 
we're actually getting good improving
our<00:00:23.279> practice<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:23.760> we're<00:00:23.850> thinking<00:00:23.939> about

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
our practice that we're thinking about

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.150 
our practice that we're thinking about
our<00:00:24.359> shock<00:00:24.600> calling<00:00:24.960> our<00:00:25.080> warding<00:00:25.560> are<00:00:25.710> our

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
our shock calling our warding are our

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.130 
our shock calling our warding are our
picks<00:00:26.460> pretty<00:00:26.820> much<00:00:26.970> really<00:00:27.480> focusing<00:00:28.050> on

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
picks pretty much really focusing on

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.230 
picks pretty much really focusing on
making<00:00:28.320> our<00:00:28.560> LCS<00:00:29.070> play<00:00:29.340> be<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.789> same<00:00:29.970> as<00:00:30.119> our

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
making our LCS play be the same as our

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.460 
making our LCS play be the same as our
practice<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.810> that's<00:00:30.960> been<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.170> focus

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
practice and that's been the focus

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.200 
practice and that's been the focus
throughout<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:32.130> last<00:00:32.309> weekend<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:33.000> shown

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
throughout the last weekend is shown

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.389 
throughout the last weekend is shown
yeah<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.380> mean<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.710> another<00:00:35.010> time<00:00:35.280> you

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
yeah and I mean this is another time you

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.970 
yeah and I mean this is another time you
guys<00:00:35.489> have<00:00:35.670> beaten<00:00:35.880> lmq<00:00:36.410> fairly<00:00:37.410> handily<00:00:37.800> what

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
guys have beaten lmq fairly handily what

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.139 
guys have beaten lmq fairly handily what
has<00:00:38.100> been<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.430> key<00:00:38.579> for<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.850> guys<00:00:38.969> to

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
has been the key for you guys to

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.940 
has been the key for you guys to
actually<00:00:39.270> defeat<00:00:39.719> these<00:00:39.840> guys<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:40.590> well<00:00:40.770> both

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
actually defeat these guys so well both

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.680 
actually defeat these guys so well both
times<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.489> know<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.090> think<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.390> game<00:00:42.570> was

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
times you know I think the game was

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.330 
times you know I think the game was
going<00:00:42.840> pretty<00:00:43.140> slow<00:00:43.379> at<00:00:43.590> first<00:00:43.620> until<00:00:44.129> we<00:00:44.250> got

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
going pretty slow at first until we got

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.549 
going pretty slow at first until we got
the<00:00:44.460> first<00:00:44.610> dragon<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.270> we<00:00:45.570> saw<00:00:45.960> them<00:00:46.230> in

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
the first dragon so we saw them in

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.959 
the first dragon so we saw them in
another<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:47.190> another<00:00:47.250> place<00:00:47.640> we<00:00:47.789> got<00:00:47.910> the

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
another in another place we got the

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.250 
another in another place we got the
early<00:00:48.090> dragon<00:00:48.480> get<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> little<00:00:48.840> bit<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.079> lead

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
early dragon get a little bit of a lead

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.560 
early dragon get a little bit of a lead
and<00:00:49.440> then<00:00:49.980> they<00:00:50.219> pretty<00:00:50.489> much<00:00:50.579> since<00:00:51.329> they<00:00:51.449> had

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
and then they pretty much since they had

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.689 
and then they pretty much since they had
two<00:00:51.750> people<00:00:52.110> top<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.800> was<00:00:52.920> kind<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.340> safe<00:00:53.550> to

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
two people top it was kind of safe to

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.279 
two people top it was kind of safe to
assume<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:54.030> they<00:00:54.239> would<00:00:54.420> kind<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.899> invade

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
assume that they would kind of invade

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.869 
assume that they would kind of invade
the<00:00:55.559> invader<00:00:55.980> blue<00:00:56.219> set<00:00:56.430> because<00:00:56.520> we<00:00:56.730> know

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
the invader blue set because we know

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.389 
the invader blue set because we know
they<00:00:57.030> started<00:00:57.360> blue<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.770> typically<00:00:59.219> want

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
they started blue so you typically want

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.770 
they started blue so you typically want
to<00:00:59.520> invade<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.789> blue<00:01:00.000> when<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.210> have<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.359> form<00:01:00.660> an

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
to invade a blue when you have a form an

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.420 
to invade a blue when you have a form an
advantage<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.410> then<00:01:01.530> we<00:01:01.710> double<00:01:02.100> ward<00:01:02.309> at

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
advantage and then we double ward at

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.100 
advantage and then we double ward at
that<00:01:02.579> with<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.789> lot<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.210> pink<00:01:03.390> secrete<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.719> lot<00:01:03.989> of

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
that with a lot of pink secrete a lot of

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.299 
that with a lot of pink secrete a lot of
focus<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.530> then<00:01:04.769> they<00:01:04.860> just<00:01:05.040> walk<00:01:05.280> right

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
focus in that then they just walk right

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.490 
focus in that then they just walk right
straight<00:01:05.850> into<00:01:06.119> us<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.479> we<00:01:07.080> kill<00:01:07.229> them<00:01:07.320> there

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
straight into us and we kill them there

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.080 
straight into us and we kill them there
and<00:01:07.680> from<00:01:07.860> then<00:01:08.040> on<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.189> just<00:01:08.250> snowballed<00:01:08.760> out

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
and from then on I just snowballed out

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.300 
and from then on I just snowballed out
of<00:01:09.150> control<00:01:09.270> for<00:01:09.570> them<00:01:09.860> with<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:11.010> win<00:01:11.189> as

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
of control for them with this win as

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.730 
of control for them with this win as
well<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.640> guys<00:01:11.810> gain<00:01:12.810> sole<00:01:13.200> possession<00:01:13.530> of

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
well you guys gain sole possession of

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.460 
well you guys gain sole possession of
first<00:01:13.890> place<00:01:14.040> actually<00:01:14.430> yet<00:01:15.090> complexity<00:01:15.720> one

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
first place actually yet complexity one

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.870 
first place actually yet complexity one
against<00:01:16.799> cloud<00:01:16.950> nine<00:01:17.130> as<00:01:17.250> well<00:01:17.400> what<00:01:17.759> do<00:01:17.820> you

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
against cloud nine as well what do you

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.550 
against cloud nine as well what do you
think<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.360> contributing<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.049> all<00:01:19.380> these

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
think is contributing to all these

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.710 
think is contributing to all these
topsy-turvy<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.400> amount<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.240> upsets<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
topsy-turvy and amount of upsets in the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.350 
topsy-turvy and amount of upsets in the
North<00:01:21.869> American<00:01:22.170> LCS<00:01:22.470> well<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.700> think<00:01:24.090> it's<00:01:24.270> his

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
North American LCS well I think it's his

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.520 
North American LCS well I think it's his
team's<00:01:24.540> improvement<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.049> be<00:01:25.140> honest<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.409> know

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
team's improvement to be honest you know

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.660 
team's improvement to be honest you know
at<00:01:25.590> first<00:01:25.650> you'd<00:01:26.040> be<00:01:26.159> able<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.400> say<00:01:26.549> all

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
at first you'd be able to say all

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.100 
at first you'd be able to say all
complexity<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.240> not<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> good<00:01:27.630> team<00:01:27.780> but<00:01:27.930> now

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
complexity is not a good team but now

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.960 
complexity is not a good team but now
you<00:01:28.170> can<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.619> their<00:01:28.920> play<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.400> could<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.850> can

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
you can in their play you could you can

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.520 
you can in their play you could you can
see<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.240> they<00:01:30.329> actually<00:01:30.450> have<00:01:30.780> their<00:01:31.229> pick

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
see that they actually have their pick

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.440 
see that they actually have their pick
solidified<00:01:32.189> their<00:01:32.369> strategy<00:01:32.909> seems<00:01:33.180> really

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
solidified their strategy seems really

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.030 
solidified their strategy seems really
solid<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.140> think<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.590> they're<00:01:34.710> no<00:01:34.829> longer

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
solid so I think that they're no longer

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.830 
solid so I think that they're no longer
it<00:01:35.280> seemed<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.549> be<00:01:35.640> taking<00:01:35.729> lightly<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.600> same

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
it seemed to be taking lightly and same

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.420 
it seemed to be taking lightly and same
with<00:01:36.869> pretty<00:01:37.259> much<00:01:37.380> all<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.829> other<00:01:37.979> teams<00:01:38.250> so

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
with pretty much all the other teams so

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.830 
with pretty much all the other teams so
far<00:01:38.640> they've<00:01:38.820> really<00:01:39.060> been<00:01:39.150> able<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.450> step<00:01:39.689> it

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
far they've really been able to step it

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.999 
far they've really been able to step it
up<00:01:39.930> because<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.439> don't<00:01:40.590> want<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.799> be<00:01:40.860> left

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
up because you don't want to be left

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.170 
up because you don't want to be left
behind<00:01:41.070> right<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.670> don't<00:01:41.790> want<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.000> be<00:01:42.060> the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
behind right you don't want to be the

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.490 
behind right you don't want to be the
team<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.360> everyone's<00:01:42.780> trash<00:01:42.990> talking<00:01:43.350> all

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
team that everyone's trash talking all

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.690 
team that everyone's trash talking all
that<00:01:43.590> stuff<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:43.860> everyone<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.399> just<00:01:44.520> really

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
had a rough week of scrim so they may be

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.300 
had a rough week of scrim so they may be
struggling<00:02:10.259> right<00:02:10.560> now<00:02:10.590> but<00:02:10.950> or<00:02:11.129> there's

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
struggling right now but or there's

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.650 
struggling right now but or there's
still<00:02:11.550> no<00:02:11.730> one<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:12.000> take<00:02:12.150> lightly<00:02:12.420> because

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
still no one to take lightly because

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.580 
still no one to take lightly because
they<00:02:12.900> were<00:02:12.959> in

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
they were in

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.800 
they were in
first<00:02:14.340> place<00:02:14.640> basically<00:02:14.910> tied<00:02:15.300> for<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.599> past

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
first place basically tied for the past

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.509 
first place basically tied for the past
two<00:02:16.110> week<00:02:16.290> two<00:02:16.440> or<00:02:16.530> three<00:02:16.680> weeks<00:02:16.800> so<00:02:17.040> there's

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
two week two or three weeks so there's

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.400 
two week two or three weeks so there's
really<00:02:17.670> really<00:02:18.030> good<00:02:18.150> contender<00:02:18.599> but<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:19.019> think

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
really really good contender but I think

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.750 
really really good contender but I think
that<00:02:19.440> our<00:02:19.620> performance<00:02:20.129> today<00:02:20.250> really

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
that our performance today really

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.930 
that our performance today really
outshined<00:02:21.720> there's<00:02:22.069> even<00:02:23.069> so<00:02:23.250> though<00:02:23.519> you

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
outshined there's even so though you

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.610 
outshined there's even so though you
can't<00:02:24.239> say<00:02:24.540> like<00:02:24.750> one<00:02:24.930> poor<00:02:25.140> performance<00:02:25.530> from

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
can't say like one poor performance from

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.900 
can't say like one poor performance from
a<00:02:25.680> team<00:02:25.830> is<00:02:25.950> going<00:02:26.069> to<00:02:26.160> determine<00:02:26.370> how<00:02:26.790> they

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
a team is going to determine how they

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.140
