Intermatic<00:00:09.929> sprinkler<00:00:10.830> timer<00:00:12.440> first<00:00:13.440> thing

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
Intermatic sprinkler timer first thing

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.040 
Intermatic sprinkler timer first thing
you<00:00:13.799> got<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.070> do<00:00:14.280> is<00:00:14.670> make<00:00:15.179> sure<00:00:17.449> shut<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.539> main

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
you got to do is make sure shut the main

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:29.270 
you got to do is make sure shut the main
breaker<00:00:19.320> off<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.039> sprinkler<00:00:20.520> and

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:29.280 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.940 

there<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.150> aromatic<00:00:31.040> two-week<00:00:32.040> timer<00:00:33.950> so

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
there it is aromatic two-week timer so

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.360 
there it is aromatic two-week timer so
basically<00:00:36.080> the<00:00:37.080> first<00:00:37.110> thing<00:00:37.470> you<00:00:37.800> need<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.040> do

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
basically the first thing you need to do

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
is there's a well actually first thing

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.640 
is there's a well actually first thing
is<00:00:45.000> I'm<00:00:45.239> just<00:00:45.270> going<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.660> double<00:00:45.900> check<00:00:46.050> with

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
is I'm just going to double check with

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.750 
is I'm just going to double check with
my<00:00:47.660> trusty<00:00:48.660> fluke<00:00:48.930> meter<00:00:49.170> here<00:00:49.620> make<00:00:50.550> sure

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
my trusty fluke meter here make sure

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.590 
my trusty fluke meter here make sure
there's<00:00:51.030> no<00:00:51.210> voltage<00:00:51.629> running<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.559> here<00:00:53.600> which

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
there's no voltage running in here which

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.619 
there's no voltage running in here which
I<00:00:55.550> sort<00:00:56.550> it's<00:00:57.090> good<00:00:58.220> all<00:00:59.220> right

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
I sort it's good all right

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.380 
I sort it's good all right
up<00:01:00.629> here<00:01:00.930> there's<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.260> like<00:01:01.950> a<00:01:01.980> metal<00:01:02.430> you

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
up here there's a like a metal you

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.749 
up here there's a like a metal you
really<00:01:03.630> can't<00:01:03.840> see<00:01:04.050> it<00:01:04.080> can<00:01:04.410> you<00:01:04.440> can<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:05.700> see

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
really can't see it can you can you see

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:08.420 
really can't see it can you can you see
it<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.330> gets<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.950> positive<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.250> basically

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
it it gets it positive you basically

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.880 
it it gets it positive you basically
just<00:01:08.910> push<00:01:09.570> up<00:01:09.869> on<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.619> pin<00:01:12.619> let<00:01:13.619> me<00:01:13.710> just

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
just push up on this pin let me just

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.680 
just push up on this pin let me just
explain<00:01:14.160> first<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.940> first<00:01:15.210> thing<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.600> was

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
explain first the first thing that was

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.609 
explain first the first thing that was
happening<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.170> my<00:01:16.550> timer<00:01:17.550> the<00:01:17.910> clock<00:01:18.149> wasn't

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
happening is my timer the clock wasn't

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.550 
happening is my timer the clock wasn't
rotating<00:01:20.119> and<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.509> checked<00:01:21.780> all<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:21.960> voltages

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
rotating and I checked all the voltages

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.529 
rotating and I checked all the voltages
and<00:01:22.770> everything<00:01:23.160> was<00:01:23.340> there<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.940> it<00:01:24.240> still

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
and everything was there and it still

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:26.450 
and everything was there and it still
was<00:01:24.720> turning<00:01:25.110> on<00:01:25.229> manually<00:01:25.800> the<00:01:26.009> sprinkler

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
was turning on manually the sprinkler

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.260 
was turning on manually the sprinkler
pump<00:01:26.729> was<00:01:26.880> still<00:01:27.119> turned<00:01:27.360> on<00:01:27.450> manually<00:01:29.270> so

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
pump was still turned on manually so

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.139 
pump was still turned on manually so
anyway<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:31.050> went<00:01:31.860> online<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.430> was<00:01:32.759> doing<00:01:32.970> some

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
anyway I went online and was doing some

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:38.800 
anyway I went online and was doing some
searches<00:01:34.880> for<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.000> internet<00:01:36.439> timer<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.860> I

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
searches for the internet timer and I

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.960 
searches for the internet timer and I
realize<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:40.049> all<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.470> need<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.799> do<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.760> you

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
realize it all you need to do is you

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.850 
realize it all you need to do is you
push<00:01:42.510> up<00:01:42.689> on<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:42.960> thing<00:01:43.200> up<00:01:43.350> here<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.770> this

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
push up on this thing up here and this

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.920 
push up on this thing up here and this
whole<00:01:44.070> thing<00:01:44.340> comes<00:01:44.700> out<00:01:47.360> and<00:01:48.360> then<00:01:48.600> what<00:01:48.750> you

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
whole thing comes out and then what you

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.830 
whole thing comes out and then what you
need<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.110> do<00:01:49.409> here's<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.330> clock<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.600> timer

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
need to do here's the clock the timer

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.859 
need to do here's the clock the timer
motor<00:01:52.250> you<00:01:53.250> basically<00:01:53.700> get<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.210> number<00:01:54.689> off

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
motor you basically get the number off

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.510 
motor you basically get the number off
of<00:01:54.900> here<00:01:55.259> it's<00:01:55.470> probably<00:01:55.590> going<00:01:55.830> to<00:01:55.890> be<00:01:55.950> WG

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
of here it's probably going to be WG

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.810 
of here it's probably going to be WG
something<00:01:57.060> it'll<00:01:57.720> probably<00:01:57.900> WG<00:01:58.560> 733<00:01:59.549> -

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
something it'll probably WG 733 -

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.999 
something it'll probably WG 733 -
something<00:02:00.420> but<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.170> -<00:02:01.380> something<00:02:01.890> is

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
something but the - something is

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.850 
something but the - something is
irrelevant<00:02:02.310> that's<00:02:02.729> just<00:02:02.970> the<00:02:03.860> revision

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
irrelevant that's just the revision

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.660 
irrelevant that's just the revision
number<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.850> just<00:02:06.090> really<00:02:06.240> if<00:02:06.450> it's<00:02:06.710> WG<00:02:07.710> 733

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
number so it just really if it's WG 733

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.850 
number so it just really if it's WG 733
that's<00:02:09.570> what<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.840> need<00:02:10.019> just<00:02:10.290> do<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.470> google

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
that's what you need just do a google

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.000 
that's what you need just do a google
search<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.459> then<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.640> can<00:02:11.880> just<00:02:12.030> buy<00:02:12.209> this

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
search and then you can just buy this

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.900 
search and then you can just buy this
and<00:02:15.079> there's<00:02:16.079> there's<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.799> screw<00:02:17.040> here<00:02:17.310> are

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
and there's there's a screw here are

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.280 
and there's there's a screw here are
using<00:02:18.299> -<00:02:18.450> in<00:02:18.540> here<00:02:18.750> huh<00:02:20.030> yeah<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.480> then

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
using - in here huh yeah and then

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.740 
using - in here huh yeah and then
there's<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.650> screw<00:02:22.890> here<00:02:23.070> on<00:02:23.579> both<00:02:23.880> sides<00:02:24.150> one

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
there's a screw here on both sides one

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.640 
there's a screw here on both sides one
up<00:02:24.900> here<00:02:25.140> one<00:02:25.470> here<00:02:25.709> and<00:02:26.299> it's<00:02:27.299> not<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.900> regular

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
up here one here and it's not a regular

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.289 
up here one here and it's not a regular
Phillips<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.940> probably<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.420> Torx<00:02:32.120> which<00:02:33.120> I

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
Phillips and probably a Torx which I

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.220 
Phillips and probably a Torx which I
have<00:02:33.480> right<00:02:33.720> here

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
have right here

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.809 
have right here
you<00:02:36.230> get<00:02:36.590> this<00:02:36.739> like<00:02:37.010> a<00:02:37.040> Home<00:02:37.280> Depot<00:02:37.310> or<00:02:37.790> Lowe's

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
you get this like a Home Depot or Lowe's

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.940 
you get this like a Home Depot or Lowe's
or<00:02:38.239> whatever<00:02:40.150> anyway<00:02:41.379> just<00:02:42.379> take<00:02:42.620> out<00:02:42.769> these

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950
