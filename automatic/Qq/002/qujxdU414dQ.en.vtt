00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.350
 very good everyone is equally welcome from 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.089
 I play a couple of skydiving games 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.859
 with some subscribers to test the 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.020
 new parachutes the new one so you see 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.760
 exclusive of these races their these 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.770
 Parachutists I think are also 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.330
 new so to prove it in little and 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:19.169
 it does a bit of skydiving that few 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.970
 Sometimes, so we go there as you see 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:22.829
 it looks like jaime flyer in the backpack 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.960
 with the beautiful marijuana is 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:26.460
 handsome i am going to try 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.429
 I do not care if I stay first, I'm going to 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.529
 be the whole game falling like that or 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.239
 maybe until I'm about to kill myself already 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.829
 you understand me but I'm going to try 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.370
 complete the race if they do not come for 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.030
 behind 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.770
 and also not being few points so to 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.320
 see how you are doing 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:48.930
 let's go to remove 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.030
 as an equal as I have told me 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.510
 pela is the first one so we're going to 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.510
 keep doing 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.760
 no no because I suddenly feel like I'm 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.900
 losing my squirrel skills 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.100
 to plan the media as a neo matrix 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.500
 we go 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.090
 I really is a great fall or be it 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.960
 in a parachute should be in half an hour 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.880
 I will come to you 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.010
 and that they have to have no parachute 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.600
 so it will have to fall or when it comes out 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.400
 a little red circle they ask you to let go 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.650
 the parachute to fall down there and 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.240
 apply the secondary and is handsome 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.330
 because so also do something more in 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.390
 Finally we are going to catch this 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:33.640
 alright we go ole and open the parachute and 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.860
 We want lay for their white houses 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.720
 and there you have the first game of 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.890
 skydiving will not simply have lasted 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.690
 but let's make one more 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.400
 for boys we are already in the second 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.150
 Clear race to land me 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.200
 it seems that it is also a new career 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.550
 in short we are with a few 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.090
 subscribers it seems to me that there have been 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.090
 someone else 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.060
 to see other super falls and is 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.530
 also the truth and planned like this is done 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.230
 a little more short and a little more 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.900
 entertaining do not know why because it has 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.910
 bet but it does not matter 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.190
 this climb, wait, I'm going to catch you 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.760
 this now I'm going to catch studying I'm going to 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.760
 release again 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.740
 while I'm planning 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.810
 let's stabilize 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:34.340
 I'm interested little by little like money 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.860
 like the magix to play the post not 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.280
 is live sometimes and neither do I 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.280
 says neither 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.260
 or 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.990
 control of the armpit as you see is possible 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.700
 to be ready when I'm good 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.470
 ah 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.260
 I'm so in the end I'm not 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.000
 getting the shit points to see 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.850
 fly to see if I can get at least 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.160
 there move please 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.160
 I will arrive direct 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.500
 well at the end of this race 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.270
 well guys we are already in the third 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.160
 skydiving to the gas jump I think 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.540
 that you are also new demonstrated has been 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.910
 tried that all the games are 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.770
 new ones and then we are with the 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.810
 subscribers this time I'm not going to screw it 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.820
 because in the second the street a lot 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.010
 originally nothing at all the first 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.540
 neither is it temporary or is it the first one 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.830
 it was very bad to end up staying the 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.560
 second and that is where all the 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.180
 amount planning but good in 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.290
 this game I will start planning a 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:43.010
 little because you can see what 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.010
 it's time to open the parachute please 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.569
 and olÃ© 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.970
 continue with this or it seems that this 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:58.349
 race is practically everything to go like this 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.670
 that is, eyes have opened because of open fear 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.700
 because of fear 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:06.930
 I can not fall I'm going to let go I'm going to 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:10.020
 letting me wait 15 points here yes that 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.150
 I jump or like I only have 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.590
 parachute will not let me loose it do not 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.590
 let loose the future 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.920
 If nothing happens nothing gets lost in about 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:24.270
 points but for now we're not going either 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.270
 we go for soccer 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.180
 I do not know if I think I'm going to 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.180
 win 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.320
 to see it seems to me that this is already about 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.060
 to end there is 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.849
 we have the at the beginning but the rest 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.800
 for maximum background 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:48.179
 in short guys studies that you like 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.159
