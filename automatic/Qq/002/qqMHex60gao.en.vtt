00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.380 
pieces and since they're such a small
piece<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.450> usually<00:01:30.930> just<00:01:31.110> use<00:01:31.200> my<00:01:31.500> finger<00:01:31.890> to

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
piece I usually just use my finger to

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.760 
piece I usually just use my finger to
just<00:01:33.390> get<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.900> know<00:01:33.930> just<00:01:34.320> an<00:01:34.409> ample<00:01:34.740> amount

just get you know just an ample amount
of<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.310> thinset<00:01:35.520> on<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.180> when<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.390> press

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
of the thinset on it so when you press

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.179 
of the thinset on it so when you press
it<00:01:36.810> down<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.229> squeezes<00:01:37.590> out<00:01:38.180> from<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.299> sites

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
it down it squeezes out from the sites

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.230 
it down it squeezes out from the sites
basically<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.250> just<00:01:41.280> want<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.640> fit<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:42.000> in

basically you just want to fit this in

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.289 
basically you just want to fit this in
there<00:01:42.649> give<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.829> tip<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.490> right<00:01:44.729> on<00:01:44.909> the

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
point eventually you're going to have to

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.260 
point eventually you're going to have to
cut<00:02:52.180> one<00:02:53.160> this<00:02:54.160> is<00:02:54.310> what<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:54.550> do<00:02:54.700> all<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:55.180> way

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
cut one this is what you do all the way

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.040

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
but as you're coming down your sink you

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.520 
but as you're coming down your sink you

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
would be good too but if it's on a small

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.770 
would be good too but if it's on a small
job<00:03:38.730> just<00:03:39.730> a<00:03:39.820> diamond<00:03:40.150> blade<00:03:40.270> would<00:03:40.420> be<00:03:40.510> find

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
job just a diamond blade would be find

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.660 
job just a diamond blade would be find
on<00:03:40.930> a<00:03:40.960> grinder<00:03:41.380> alright<00:03:42.160> now<00:03:42.310> that<00:03:42.370> we've<00:03:42.640> got

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
on a grinder alright now that we've got

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.650 
on a grinder alright now that we've got
your<00:03:43.210> surrounding<00:03:44.110> the<00:03:44.430> sink<00:03:45.430> all<00:03:45.610> done

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
your surrounding the sink all done

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.360 
your surrounding the sink all done
the<00:03:46.990> next<00:03:47.260> step<00:03:47.410> would<00:03:47.530> be<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.710> front<00:03:48.070> and

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
the next step would be the front and

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.150 
the next step would be the front and
these<00:03:49.030> tiles<00:03:49.420> are<00:03:49.600> called<00:03:49.810> a<00:03:49.900> V<00:03:50.110> cap<00:03:50.380> it's<00:03:51.040> a

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
these tiles are called a V cap it's a

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.650 
these tiles are called a V cap it's a
special<00:03:51.490> tile<00:03:51.700> that<00:03:51.940> just<00:03:52.180> specifically

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
special tile that just specifically

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.050 
special tile that just specifically
designed<00:03:53.140> for<00:03:53.380> the<00:03:54.070> front<00:03:54.490> edge<00:03:54.670> of<00:03:54.910> a

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
designed for the front edge of a

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.840 
designed for the front edge of a
countertop<00:03:55.570> and<00:03:56.610> basically<00:03:57.610> it's<00:03:57.730> pretty

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
countertop and basically it's pretty

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.580 
countertop and basically it's pretty
much<00:03:58.060> the<00:03:58.180> same<00:03:58.360> application<00:03:58.570> except<00:03:59.440> that

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
much the same application except that

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.020 
much the same application except that
you're<00:03:59.710> going<00:03:59.980> to<00:04:00.040> be<00:04:02.520> just<00:04:03.520> doing<00:04:03.670> the<00:04:03.880> one

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
you're going to be just doing the one

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.690 
you're going to be just doing the one
