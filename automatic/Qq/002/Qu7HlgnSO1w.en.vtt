00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.580
 to the pens are gentlemen who 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.720
 used for fishing this is a 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.450
 lure cause again has been used 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.320
 Traditionally for 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.940
 can catch fish and have been very 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.620
 effective have been proven very effective 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.330
 in fact for the second world war 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.310
 still the military 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.010
 that they were going to be in contact 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.840
 with the water they were always provided with 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.989
 miles for them to fish 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.860
 This consists of a leaded fishhook 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.220
 it is on the floor 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:48.090
 with a lead and then in this case they are 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:51.990
 feathers hairs degree of servant can 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.210
 be feathers that are used to 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.340
 then give it more lumps and it seems 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.560
 a small fish in this case it is a 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.270
 orange fish you can put a 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.880
 additional attraction like this which is a 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.380
 little shine and this is very 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.810
 these can be used very well 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.400
 to fish tucunarÃ© are also used in 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.010
 fishing in fresh water from stealing or 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.540
 they also use it and sometimes you can 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.880
 catch some sabadito some kind of 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.750
 water with them 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.340
 ah 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.750
 to the pen construction is very 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.400
 interesting first because there is the 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.320
 immediate fun of one being 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.229
 building their pens but in 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.700
 addition the benefits are many a 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.410
 pen like this for example this is going to 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.470
 get in the market costs you 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.729
 very much more expensive three four or five 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.450
 times more expensive than if you 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.560
 builds therefore saves 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.510
 in you to be able to build the pens 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.970
 has many benefits especially if 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.140
 you want to try new techniques 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.479
 you have the ability to do the 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.720
 lures that you understand to experience 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.060
 with colors 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.330
 is to seek the greatest satisfaction of the 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.460
 fishing and that you can create and try 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.200
 alternatives and experiment with 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.360
 pens that you make to see how 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.340
 effective are the different species and 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.020
 in essence it is a hobby that we 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.550
 prolonga lengthens the activity of 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.950
 fishing while we are in our house 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.490
 it is an extension of enjoyment 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.490
 fishing 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.909
 food construction can be used 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.889
 many materials we have is for 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:22.530
 example here we have some pens that is 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:25.859
 of payment although it is painted we would have 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.150
 these are from the neck of a rooster and 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:30.180
 so you can use any type 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.739
 of feathers that you find pruning 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.769
 incorporates the construction of pens 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.409
 in fact the name fundamentally 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.019
 comes for pens pens also 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:42.000
 can use from the dog grade 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.389
 yours but of any any features 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.980
 fiber type preferably some 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.629
 proteins that not only much water will go 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.239
 to decompose after you can 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:53.730
 use there are people who have used this 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.889
 pieces of fabric to make pens or 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.680
 imitations pens and are effective 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:01.199
 simply there are several factors 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.590
 colors like how you work like you 

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:06.720
 to the operas and if they are effective and between 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.810
 more effective 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.810
 ah 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.300
 these workshops originated on the basis of 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.220
 new proposals submitted department 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.040
 of natural resources through the 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.170
 fishing and wildlife service for 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.050
 teach sports fishermen how 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.820
 build them this job consisted of 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.170
 two phases a first phase where 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.690
 we teach to build the pens 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.569
 simple one-color two and three 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:37.910
 colors and a second phase where 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:41.000
 we teach construction practices 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.530
 applicable primarily to flies 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.080
 that are built for fishing with seek 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.390
 those techniques we incorporate it 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.340
 the construction of pens as per 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.760
 example in this case this is a 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.340
 quill a close syrup that is used 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.140
 for fly fishing simply you 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.670
 we add lead inside to make it 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.140
 heavy enough and power 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:06.180
 use it in spinning fishing this 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.970
 first phase already covered others 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.830
 programs all dates this 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.540
 scheduled and now we are moving to the 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.430
 second stage of construction that is the 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.990
 street mentions using more techniques 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.209
 advanced and applicable plus the 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.760
 music construction the next 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.630
 workshops will be offered in the attacks the 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.520
 silver in it 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.890
 gurabo fishing club and also in 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.650
 chestnuts with this as the bases 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:33.500
 programmed would be finished and any 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.320
 type of arrangement you want or 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:40.280
 information can you contact me at 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.740

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.560
 and we will help you in everything you can if 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.170
 my name is not released this fisherman 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.880
 a whole life from fresh water water 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.280
 salty has been my hobby and 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.740
 full entertainment and in fact I had 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.100
 the joy of studying marine sciences 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.540
 to complement my sporting life and 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.760
 professional I have lived a life 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.770
 fantastic doing both working and 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.370
 fishing 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.370
 7 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.360
 as we know it will be suddenly and the 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.360
 parents worked details 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:31.300
 that you made him give you question 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.020
 like
