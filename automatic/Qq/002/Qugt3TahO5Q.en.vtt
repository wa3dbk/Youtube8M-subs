00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.759
 in order to determine your 

00:00:01.759 --> 00:00:04.789
 attitude suddenly the profession did not have to 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.050
 have a good dinner 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.780
 one and a half hundred kilometers painfully 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.399
 an unusual task stood 

00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:12.460
 unusual 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.460
 design and engineering solutions are great 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:18.650
 Pavel Burlakov 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.220
 you can run at all 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.750
 whether this construction rules 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:24.949
 technological 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.949
 or just another batch of 4 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.149
 first chapters 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:33.149
 about chips 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.590
 despite 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.990
 everything is unusual 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.740
 plastic constructions 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.350
 in the office 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.410
 Works letters to effectively address 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.330
 the main expert task of all 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.660
 constructors talking about 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.440
 protect but the trouble 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.330
 roughness and stiffness 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.020
 the surfaces here are biomechanical 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.720
 the distortion of the production became the clip 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.200
 and wherein 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.340
 save as naturally as possible 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.500
 I work for three years 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.840
 in my opinion 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.500
 by the engineers of the jingle pro 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.640
 can 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.229
 closer solution of this problem is no dawn zone 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.640
 calls the pros all the answer 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.800
 on the water and at the highly dubious trojan 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.460
 she is minimalism which now stands 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.080
 moves 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.080
 true gaming experience 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.300
 what is he 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.300
 characteristic feature 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.180
 incredible 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.090
 whom I have not met him 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.010
 native 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.090
 other models of running shoes 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.480
 just under this edge 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.480
 makes work 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.030
 everywhere in general your muscles 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.370
 starting from the buttocks 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.920
 then in the back of the thigh 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.400
 then gastrocnemius 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.379
 and practically no thumb 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.829
 Here is such a cemetery 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:12.849
 push 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.849
 as much as possible could 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.629
 running and in the pros remembered myself 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.219
 their runs literally iconic and 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:26.669
 football fields of europe 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:29.209
 when i did after working in the grid 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.359
 after those runs 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.809
 spike seemed just salvation 

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:35.299
 exactly the same feeling i 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:36.150
 felt 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.489
 and the easiest way 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.229
 but with one exception 

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:41.890
 that was not a hard purchase 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:42.799
 hitting 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.019
 how resorted to seconds even by most 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.529
 good tight grass 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:48.949
 I tested 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:52.049
 but about always different speeds and in different 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.849
 modes I would not make them long cross 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.389
 leonid whites and and searched acceleration 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:58.609
 even jump 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:02.079
 and everywhere the pros of all work 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.379
 the office does not provide you 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:05.410
 softness 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.739
 they go cup 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:08.939
 in the bone bones 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:10.539
 but at the same time 

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:13.599
 you can even run on tiles 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.169
 I am still in communication 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:18.310
 normal when you write on the tile 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.470
 even in soft sneakers you 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.119
 you feel 

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:23.789
 lack of return 

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:27.149
 I am a very big question malice after 

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:29.919
 it is not 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:31.479
 there were fears 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:33.329
 so pro 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.999
 will not be stable that is its high 

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:37.359
 pillow 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.769
 and that will fall 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.479
 n these holes 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:45.859
 i just put steep turns they 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.459
 very stable 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.390
 because 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.309
 important to his wife heel height 

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:52.099
 the important thing is the relationship between 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.289
 heel socks 

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:56.599
 such excess heel manas who do not 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.339
 they are a storchak letter 

00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:00.249
 and never fell 

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:01.980
 no pebbles come out 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.249
 for these beglaryan rockets and and under 

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:05.770
 a serious margin kats 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.679
 track 

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:10.549
 my concerns were still connected with what they could 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.039
 are sold 

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:13.979
 here are these pk saws 

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:15.289
 idea 

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:18.239
 will move 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.229
 let's say so seeks balance 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:21.459
 sneakers 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.389
 and many companies have already done it seems the United States 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.080
 on others but outwardly similar construction 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.240
 with slots spu life us 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.970
 and almost all of them suffered the same 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:32.730
 so what 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:33.699
 after 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:37.099
 nor in the show run broker stained glass 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:38.929
 they began to be forced on 

00:04:38.929 --> 00:04:40.979
 heels and already your posing was 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:42.330
 twisted 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.180
 the zoom engineers have calculated everything exactly 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.180
 happened again say after 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:49.580
 almost a hundred and sixty 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.250
 kilometers with my weight no kilogram 72 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.729
 a cop 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.139
 at fast work no 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.539
 Changes in geometry Jan 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:02.589
 I will try to summarize 

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:03.460
 however 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.229
 most likely fit all run ladies 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:08.059
 over 60 

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:09.259
 kilogram 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:11.419
 no matter what you have 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:12.699
 staging 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:14.759
 externally store on domestic sales 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:16.620
 your approbation 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.650
 against all 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.300
 will help you 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.870
 it is stable to hold 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:21.700
 Volga 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.850
 on course but only if you are already quite 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.430
 more but also there are choices of foot and 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.330
 maybe 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.479
 check 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:32.389
 about all the same will not work 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:33.900
 Secondly 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.180
 but you have to get used 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.319
 because 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:39.600
 voltage 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.400
 I studied skanevskogo 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.120
 accreditation 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.870
 through the back of the thigh and 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.589
 when needed and by the way 

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:49.300
 may first 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.770
 i would say 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.960
 not that not usual percentage 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.270
 too serious so you need 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.210
 pay attention yes stretching and 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.979
 ruling kc after that 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:01.919
 after these victories 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:05.150
 but if he is accepted by these professions 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.690
 then dad, you will not be afraid to pull 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:10.919
 because 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:13.169
 so way block further 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:16.099
 this area is how convenient the exhibition to become 

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:17.669
 first 3 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.320
 and sneakers so 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.119
 nice naturally like that 

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:25.189
 there will probably be even difficulties to come off 

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:28.789
 Well, girls who are so eager to cube 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:30.069
 arm muscles 

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:32.589
 will open the simple truth 

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:34.999
 pieces way 

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:36.419
 good society 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:38.199
 holiday 

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:40.599
 This is the correct answer in Prague and 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:41.330
 no
