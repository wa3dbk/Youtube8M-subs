00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 so the third lesson in this lesson we are with you 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.170
 complicate our rhythm 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:14.309
 the fact is that in this accompaniment 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:17.250
 which we first disassembled here 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.400
 playing filthy one-two-three-four-time 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:28.760
 two-three-four accompaniment similar here 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:32.369
 at such a rhythm there paton if you remember 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.460
 winnie the pooh tonks when he walked down the path he 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.820
 shouted tram-pa-pam on the right piggy bank 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.200
 Trump from the lamp Obama Sopilke and so on 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.390
 Now the same is 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:50.239
 we took as a basis in our our 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:54.420
 component and take our same triads and 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:59.239
 we insert the same notes only them 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.239
 we fit in this rhythm pan-pan dad 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:13.010
 it is clear yes probably it will be difficult with 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.140
 first time you do but try 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:19.070
 remember try yourself 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.600
 pronounce in the top 3 there or at least 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.550
 try to work one hand first 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.650
 because we have everything in our left hand 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:30.390
 the same thing persists 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:33.990
 once two times two times two 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:38.810
 and in the right hand only changes instead 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:42.720
 just to give so we play 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:47.030
 And the actor is doing this third but 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.030
 this is now the third fifth note chord 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:02:02.400
 try here if it was hard for you 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.200
 play the rhythm of pampas dads something like this 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.390
 try to work maybe so 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:12.950
 it will be easier and so we enter first 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.950
 play the main note 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.129
 Yes 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.970
 and that one 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.970
 this 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.970
 this 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.930
 here is such a next we will have a lesson 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.720
 we have figured out how to complicate or 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.910
 to make it more beautiful and more 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.470
 matched this style 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.470
