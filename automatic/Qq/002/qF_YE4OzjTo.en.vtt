in Inferno you could refine ranked 7
obviously<00:00:26.460> from<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.910> table<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:28.140> can<00:00:28.289> see

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
obviously from this table you can see

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.310 
obviously from this table you can see
that<00:00:28.849> that<00:00:29.849> isn't<00:00:30.060> necessarily<00:00:30.689> true<00:00:30.840> anymore

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
that that isn't necessarily true anymore

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.549 
a normal rank to as a nightmare rank 3
and<00:00:38.430> he'll<00:00:38.640> rank<00:00:39.390> for<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.780> inferno<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:40.410> that

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
and he'll rank for it inferno so that

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.040 
and he'll rank for it inferno so that
leaves<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.040> question<00:00:42.200> where<00:00:43.200> or<00:00:43.590> how<00:00:44.960> can<00:00:45.960> you

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
leaves the question where or how can you

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.430 
leaves the question where or how can you
find<00:00:46.350> rank<00:00:46.649> 5<00:00:46.890> 6<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.460> 7<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:48.320> there<00:00:49.320> have<00:00:49.410> been

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
find rank 5 6 and 7 and there have been

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.080 
find rank 5 6 and 7 and there have been
a<00:00:49.559> lot<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.770> theories<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.460> my<00:00:50.579> theory<00:00:50.879> goes

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
a lot of theories and my theory goes

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.619 
a lot of theories and my theory goes
like<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.800> there's<00:00:52.800> two<00:00:52.980> possibilities<00:00:53.629> that

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
like this there's two possibilities that

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.340 
like this there's two possibilities that
I<00:00:54.690> can<00:00:55.289> imagine<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:55.890> far<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.579> one<00:00:57.350> you

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
I can imagine so far and that is one you

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.160 
I can imagine so far and that is one you
can<00:00:58.530> craft<00:00:58.800> these<00:00:59.100> like<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.489> can<00:00:59.760> jewels<00:01:00.170> once

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
can craft these like you can jewels once

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.369 
can craft these like you can jewels once
you<00:01:01.320> get<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.590> rank<00:01:01.800> for<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.430> can<00:01:02.609> get

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
you get the rank for you can get

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.200 
you get the rank for you can get
multiple<00:01:04.379> rank<00:01:04.650> fours<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.129> some<00:01:05.580> type<00:01:05.909> and

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
multiple rank fours of some type and

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.080 
multiple rank fours of some type and
then<00:01:06.479> upgrade<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.290> rank<00:01:07.500> 5<00:01:08.090> multiple

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
then upgrade it to the rank 5 multiple

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.230 
then upgrade it to the rank 5 multiple
of<00:01:09.180> five<00:01:09.420> ranked<00:01:09.900> 6<00:01:10.229> etc<00:01:10.770> just<00:01:10.979> like<00:01:11.100> gems<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
of five ranked 6 etc just like gems the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.520 
of five ranked 6 etc just like gems the
other<00:01:12.360> possibility<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.290> can<00:01:13.409> just

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
other possibility is that you can just

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.550 
other possibility is that you can just
craft<00:01:13.860> them<00:01:14.360> using<00:01:15.360> some<00:01:15.630> unknown<00:01:16.110> method

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
craft them using some unknown method

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.740 
craft them using some unknown method
from<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.799> jeweler<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.400> that's<00:01:18.330> probably<00:01:18.509> the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
from the jeweler and that's probably the

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.539 
from the jeweler and that's probably the
most<00:01:18.900> likely<00:01:19.290> one<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:19.890> we'll<00:01:20.220> have<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.430> wait

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
most likely one so we'll have to wait

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.240 
most likely one so we'll have to wait
and<00:01:20.610> see<00:01:20.790> maybe<00:01:21.240> blizzcon<00:01:21.840> will<00:01:22.140> hold<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
and see maybe blizzcon will hold the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.200 
and see maybe blizzcon will hold the
answer<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.700> my<00:01:23.790> questions<00:01:24.390> our<00:01:24.750> questions

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
very interesting though very interesting

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.390 
very interesting though very interesting
change<00:02:18.600> see<00:02:19.110> if<00:02:19.260> we<00:02:19.800> can't<00:02:20.010> get<00:02:20.100> some<00:02:20.160> answers

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
change see if we can't get some answers

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.380 
change see if we can't get some answers
to<00:02:20.610> it<00:02:22.040> also<00:02:23.040> i<00:02:23.070> forgot<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.550> mention<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:24.360> fact

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
to it also i forgot to mention the fact

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.230 
to it also i forgot to mention the fact
that<00:02:24.810> there<00:02:25.140> are<00:02:25.170> now<00:02:25.920> in<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.310> data<00:02:26.550> there<00:02:27.000> are

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
that there are now in the data there are

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.510 
that there are now in the data there are
these<00:02:28.190> animas<00:02:29.990> which<00:02:30.990> are<00:02:31.280> obtained<00:02:32.280> by

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
these animas which are obtained by

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.940 
these animas which are obtained by
salvaging<00:02:33.240> their<00:02:33.570> respective<00:02:34.320> rune<00:02:34.650> stones

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
salvaging their respective rune stones

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.820 
salvaging their respective rune stones
so<00:02:35.280> for<00:02:35.520> example<00:02:35.580> if<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.180> for<00:02:36.810> this<00:02:36.900> one<00:02:37.140> you

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
so for example if you for this one you

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.320 
so for example if you for this one you
salvaged<00:02:38.220> alabaster<00:02:38.850> rune<00:02:39.000> stone<00:02:39.209> you're

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
salvaged alabaster rune stone you're

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.990 
salvaged alabaster rune stone you're
going<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.540> get<00:02:39.600> alabaster<00:02:40.140> anima<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.790> so<00:02:41.790> on

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
going to get alabaster anima and so on

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.520 
going to get alabaster anima and so on
for<00:02:42.180> all<00:02:42.330> of<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.660> other<00:02:42.810> rooms<00:02:43.050> you<00:02:43.260> can<00:02:43.290> see

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
for all of the other rooms you can see

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.160 
for all of the other rooms you can see
there's<00:02:43.709> also<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:44.010> golden<00:02:44.459> anima<00:02:44.959> which<00:02:45.959> is<00:02:46.140> a

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
there's also a golden anima which is a

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.660 
there's also a golden anima which is a
type<00:02:46.410> of<00:02:46.470> rune<00:02:46.800> stone<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:47.370> indigo<00:02:48.150> anima<00:02:48.540> etc

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
type of rune stone and indigo anima etc

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.449 
type of rune stone and indigo anima etc
so<00:02:50.670> that's<00:02:51.239> that<00:02:52.080> also<00:02:52.560> is<00:02:52.830> probably<00:02:53.280> the

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
so that's that also is probably the

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.250 
so that's that also is probably the
reason<00:02:53.640> why<00:02:53.940> you're<00:02:54.810> going<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:54.989> go<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.170> the

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
reason why you're going to go to the

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.640 
reason why you're going to go to the
jeweler<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.830> figure<00:02:56.160> out<00:02:56.310> how<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:56.459> get<00:02:56.640> thee

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
jeweler to figure out how to get thee

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.900 
jeweler to figure out how to get thee
that's<00:02:58.650> just<00:02:58.769> a<00:02:58.920> guess<00:02:59.100> I<00:02:59.370> mean<00:02:59.489> we<00:02:59.640> don't<00:02:59.730> know

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
that's just a guess I mean we don't know

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.330 
that's just a guess I mean we don't know
for<00:03:00.090> sure<00:03:00.150> but<00:03:00.720> that's<00:03:01.620> probably<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.070> way<00:03:02.100> to

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
for sure but that's probably the way to

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.920 
for sure but that's probably the way to
to<00:03:03.269> get<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:04.500> higher-level<00:03:05.600> rune<00:03:06.600> stones

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
to get the the higher-level rune stones

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.060 
to get the the higher-level rune stones
so<00:03:07.340> yep<00:03:08.340> interesting<00:03:08.880> stuff
