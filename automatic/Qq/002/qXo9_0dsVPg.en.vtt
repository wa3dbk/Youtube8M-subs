00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello friends youtube now I bring you 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.919
 another tutorial this tutorial will try 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.559
 how to convert your movie or your video 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.190
 in a file that can be played in 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:17.809
 the good dvd let's start with the tutorial 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.809
 I hope and they serve 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.390
 the night 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.270
 well this is the program that we are going to 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.160
 use 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:36.880
 good once having the program 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:40.510
 open we go to adjustments and in general 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.540
 if your program is but it has stayed here 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.670
 in updating it, we demarcate because if 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.580
 automatically updates is going to us 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.960
 remove the full program if I am 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.560
 unfortunate 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.990
 well here the issue we put default 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:59.980
 and we are going language the language is a language 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:04.270
 that you talk in chapters where each 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:08.140
 chapter of your video or your movie menu 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:10.540
 we leave it like this in video format this 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.230
 you have to investigate 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:19.110
 it depends on where it is in resolution of 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:21.390
 divide we put the first 720 points 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.680
 480 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.680
 and if your screen is long without leto 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.950
 or kind like that and it's long I recommend this 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.470
 option but it is normal TV you 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.880
 I recommend it but I'll give you this 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.430
 because of my long TV in coding 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:46.280
 modifying this insane messages if 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:49.800
 you have an error or things like that and it tells you 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:53.040
 so I recommend that the marques 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.770
 we leave this normal and this 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.859
 we leave like this in processing video 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.740
 I recommend that you put the third 

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:05.560
 option because it will leave you 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.360
 some small black Mayas but it's like 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.380
 the margin of the movie to have 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.370
 cancer to see all 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.440
 and that 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.250
 that depends on the nuclei 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.440
 you have to process the video 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.990
 Well I put one because if not 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.990
 I put two you work 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.330
 here in its nest in success so we leave it 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.470
 well recording 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:40.130
 we will see this as we have served 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:44.760
 and this we leave it like this we give ok 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:47.370
 well once having everything 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.090
 configured we give you in the little button 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.090
 green others 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.900
 and we choose in the movie well I'm 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:05.250
 expression I'm going to record the one in cube 2 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.250
 we wait for you to know 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.510
 This is going to be the most to see the 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.510
 movie without 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.650
 how quickly we put the one who does not 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.370
 we want lower 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.629
 and this is going to deactivate 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.569
 automatically this is the name that 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:28.180
 will have the disk if they want to change it 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:31.360
 we double click on it and change it and 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.329
 They give in the flechita vÃ©lez good as 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.120
 can see here it's already deactivated everything 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:39.209
 we closed this and opened 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.930
 This is good, it has nothing to do 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:45.310
 edit we only give in 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.709
 convert 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.510
 despairs and will not start 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:54.610
 convert good 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:57.940
 I pulse and came back to finish 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:01.090
 good friends once finished 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:04.210
 convert the video just touch them 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:07.330
 put the disc and it will start recording 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.470
 if it asks for speed of recording you 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.070
 they put for 8 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.370
 lagrava good that was all I hope them 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.370
 I have served
