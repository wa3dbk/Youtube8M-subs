00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.340
 hello how about youtube friends like 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.959
 stable the goal is missing 90 with a new 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.300
 video and good we saw on this occasion 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.650
 we bring a tweet laziness but I think that 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.050
 allow that tweet is to have the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.099
 applications in an easier way and 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.660
 to be able to access them in a 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.250
 alphabetical since good that will give us 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.140
 pretty easy to find the 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.520
 applications the tour is called install 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.230
 be and when we install him he creates us 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.600
 item the menu within settings to 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.980
 which we access and as you can see 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.510
 find this part of here the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.550
 actions we are like this this worries 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.960
 activated to be able to activate for that 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.370
 we have to select that your method of 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.550
 activation in this case but everything here 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.679
 anywhere while a double 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.690
 touch on my status parts the bar 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:51.179
 up here you are going to run 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.100
 can run has the jazz options 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:54.870
 the status will give on the start button 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.760
 of buttons one volume to volume city 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.440
 it depends on you and good some others 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.120
 options how can you hide 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.100
 applications that we do not want to be 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.929
 show there in the recent panel 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.300
 which we want to be shown and in what 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:07.710
 the panel of favorites and 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.820
 we want them to show what they are 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.220
 our favorite here we 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.530
 we select in this case I do not have those 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.940
 but for example if I want to put 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.580
 facebook also that you see there and 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.260
 foursquare other we see how this looks 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.090
 and the layout as we want it to be 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.650
 show the same whether we want to show or not 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.570
 the course in this case I'm going to put that 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.950
 yes so you can appreciate how it is like 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.680
 you remember the activations method 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.930
 double tap on the status bar and how can 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.850
 see here my favorites are shown 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.380
 application luck recently and here 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.810
 is what the cursor is 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.360
 if for example I want an application 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.950
 which continues improvement I will bring you only from 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.320
 fusion the air I can do this 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.700
 side and as you can see here are displayed 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.170
 all my applications 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.400
 same if you want that I only give a 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.050
 touch and as you can see he spoke to me another 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.150
 what my panel of favorites and 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.440
 parents of recent applications for 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.140
 execute any of them only 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.630
 we select it and nothing else we have to 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.740
 give a tap and that opens the 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.970
 truth is a very useful subject me 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.950
 like 2 before the show since we 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.479
 increases faster order 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.310
 Alphabetical in terms of applications 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.140
 which is pretty useful enough 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.970
 and good to install it as we are going to 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.530
 do we just enter like that already as 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.880
 always remember to wait for it to end 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.620
 of loading is very important to do 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.150
 that you use to fear being seen only 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.709
 before looking for the part 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.150
 lower right and they will look to install 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.430
 as it appears on the top 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.830
 this has a custom with 99 cents 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.600
 in the network we could be lazy and good 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.300
 advantage is that they work and night work 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.730
 iPhone and iPad and is compatible with aid 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.240
 of 5 and 6 also place less for 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.670
 let's start to be in a comment in the 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.040
 part of here below they seemed to auto 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.210
 I do not like it I hope I can support with live 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.830
 the videos to be able to upload more 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.690
 content to this channel and good of the 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.580
 moment that this video passes of 700 likes 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.870
 I bring you another video regarding 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.880
 this video reaches that amount of 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.340
 likes I wish you can support and remember 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.720
