 Goodbye dear viewers we also made it today 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.570
 in flanders temperatures of 25 degrees 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.160
 and more so today it became one 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.990
 summer day 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.400
 and there are also some in dependent 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.299
 there were many lofts but in the course of 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.820
 early in the afternoon 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.970
 they disappeared the rain and thunderstorms 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.230
 were then in the west of France 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.760
 those are in the afternoon 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.980
 come closer 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.930
 and meanwhile write that cloud of 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.740
 south to north over the west of us 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.960
 country 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.040
 so especially over the west there are and 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.020
 of showers 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.820
 there are also storms about it 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.070
 it will probably remain east 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.270
 stay dry and still there 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.219
 sunny spells 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.530
 so tonight left or right in it 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.960
 west of the country and at or a thunderstorm 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.210
 in the east dry weather and still 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.140
 Clearance temperatures that go on 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.510
 gradually 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.280
 but it doesn't get really cold and 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.879
 the chance of a thunderstorm is gradually increasing 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.340
 to disappear 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.930
 there may possibly be about the west of it 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.629
 fall a shower later in the night 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.219
 but it will then be drier but there 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.100
 the West will be still more 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.110
 clouds remain at minimums of 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.960
 11 to 14 degrees 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.119
 so that will be a soft night and too 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.189
 for tomorrow we get warm weather and 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.290
 there again in the air and 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.080
 depression here above the Gulf of Biscay 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.150
 still sends us that warm air and 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.830
 at the front of it gradually 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.700
 being to our clouds again like clouds 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.259
 direction 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.330
 During a day will go some 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.259
 stacking clouds can form and especially 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.750
 against 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.799
 late afternoon evening increases the chance 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.680
 on thunderstorms 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.720
 again that can be violent locally yes 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.970
 for tomorrow we had too dependent on 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.680
 left or right a shower over the west 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.840
 from the land over the east it remains 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.060
 probably are dry there too 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.829
 quite a few clearings 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.200
 but later when the temperatures go 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.860
 to 19 to 25 degrees and it is warmer 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.970

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.399
 gradually get some more 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.409
 stacking clouds and then enlarged 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.630
 the chance of a thunderstorm 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.820
 locally that can be a heavy storm that will 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.009
 say with a lot of precipitation in a short time 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.869
 with the chance of hail with strong gusts of wind 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.659
 in short with everything 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.879
 be careful in such weather and also 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.730

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.349
 with the even nice wide clearances 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:23.480
 but in the late afternoon and evening of 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.159

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.109
