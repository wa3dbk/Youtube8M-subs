part<00:01:35.490> three<00:01:35.939> here<00:01:36.180> which<00:01:37.140> gives<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:38.030> iron

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
part three here which gives you iron

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.800 
part three here which gives you iron
gloves<00:01:39.479> I'm<00:01:40.079> pretty<00:01:40.590> sure<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.540> but<00:01:42.540> anyway

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
gloves I'm pretty sure and but anyway

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.870 
gloves I'm pretty sure and but anyway
iron<00:01:43.350> gloves<00:01:43.619> are<00:01:43.829> pretty<00:01:44.159> useless<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.729> me

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
iron gloves are pretty useless to me

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.450 
iron gloves are pretty useless to me
soon<00:01:45.060> as<00:01:45.180> I'm<00:01:45.299> not<00:01:45.450> going<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.659> use<00:01:45.810> them<00:01:46.020> say<00:01:46.229> I

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
soon as I'm not going to use them say I

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.139 
soon as I'm not going to use them say I
just<00:01:47.460> dropped<00:01:47.939> him<00:01:48.180> after<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.540> bought<00:01:49.170> them<00:01:50.149> but

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
just dropped him after I bought them but

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.539 
just dropped him after I bought them but
anyway<00:01:51.299> after<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:52.860> don't<00:01:53.100> think<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.369> had<00:01:53.460> to

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
anyway after that I don't think I had to

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.670 
anyway after that I don't think I had to
do<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.670> quest<00:01:54.060> for<00:01:54.210> part<00:01:54.570> 4<00:01:54.840> because<00:01:55.140> I've<00:01:55.320> got
