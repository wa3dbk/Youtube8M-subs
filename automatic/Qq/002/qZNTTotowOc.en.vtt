I<00:00:55.130> do<00:00:55.190> have<00:00:55.460> the<00:00:55.640> fast<00:00:55.880> mag<00:00:56.060> is<00:00:56.180> of<00:00:56.300> course

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
I do have the fast mag is of course

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.600 
I do have the fast mag is of course
situational<00:00:57.320> basis<00:00:57.710> you<00:00:57.830> know<00:00:57.860> if<00:00:58.100> you're

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
situational basis you know if you're

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.010 
situational basis you know if you're
caught<00:00:58.940> in<00:00:59.150> a<00:00:59.240> gunfight<00:00:59.390> and<00:00:59.690> you<00:00:59.780> need<00:00:59.930> to

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
caught in a gunfight and you need to

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.990 
caught in a gunfight and you need to
reload<00:01:00.320> fast<00:01:00.590> get<00:01:00.920> undercover<00:01:01.160> to<00:01:01.610> do<00:01:01.760> so

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
reload fast get undercover to do so

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.420 
reload fast get undercover to do so
that'll<00:01:02.750> definitely<00:01:02.960> help<00:01:03.170> you<00:01:03.380> out<00:01:03.470> the

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
that'll definitely help you out the

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.680 
that'll definitely help you out the
ballistics<00:01:04.820> cpu<00:01:04.910> and<00:01:05.239> variable<00:01:05.570> zoom

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
ballistics cpu and variable zoom

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.600 
ballistics cpu and variable zoom
definitely<00:01:06.110> for<00:01:06.260> accuracy<00:01:06.890> one<00:01:07.430> of<00:01:07.550> the

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
definitely for accuracy one of the

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.300 
definitely for accuracy one of the
challenges<00:01:08.120> in<00:01:08.300> the<00:01:08.720> gold<00:01:09.080> gun<00:01:09.320> getting<00:01:10.070> for

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
challenges in the gold gun getting for

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.360 
challenges in the gold gun getting for
the<00:01:10.490> sniper<00:01:10.820> rifles<00:01:11.240> is<00:01:11.420> the<00:01:11.900> long<00:01:12.770> shots<00:01:13.130> and

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
the sniper rifles is the long shots and

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.550 
the sniper rifles is the long shots and
so<00:01:13.460> the<00:01:13.880> variable<00:01:14.600> zoom<00:01:14.750> definitely<00:01:15.290> helps

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
so the variable zoom definitely helps

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.680 
so the variable zoom definitely helps
with<00:01:15.680> that<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:16.460> ballistics<00:01:16.880> cpu<00:01:16.970> i<00:01:17.210> feel

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
with that the ballistics cpu i feel

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.410 
with that the ballistics cpu i feel
gives<00:01:18.110> you<00:01:18.230> a<00:01:18.260> little<00:01:18.470> bit<00:01:18.620> more<00:01:18.830> ability<00:01:19.420> to

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
gives you a little bit more ability to

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.120 
gives you a little bit more ability to
kind<00:01:20.600> of<00:01:20.720> not<00:01:21.080> necessarily<00:01:21.500> quick<00:01:21.710> scope<00:01:21.920> but

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
kind of not necessarily quick scope but

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.220 
kind of not necessarily quick scope but
you<00:01:22.790> know<00:01:22.880> definitely<00:01:23.090> get<00:01:23.570> in<00:01:23.720> there<00:01:23.930> quick

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230 
you know definitely get in there quick

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.170 
you know definitely get in there quick
and<00:01:24.620> get<00:01:25.280> those<00:01:25.400> targets<00:01:25.880> that<00:01:26.000> you're

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180

find<00:01:44.210> is<00:01:44.450> going<00:01:44.900> you<00:01:45.440> know<00:01:45.530> to<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.800> right-hand

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
find is going you know to the right-hand

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.550 
find is going you know to the right-hand
corner<00:01:46.610> of<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:46.760> crosshair<00:01:47.300> and<00:01:47.479> so<00:01:47.960> you<00:01:48.020> may

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
corner of the crosshair and so you may

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.110 
corner of the crosshair and so you may
be<00:01:48.620> able<00:01:48.860> to<00:01:49.040> compensate<00:01:49.370> a<00:01:49.580> little<00:01:49.640> bit<00:01:49.909> for

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
be able to compensate a little bit for

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.149 
be able to compensate a little bit for
it<00:01:50.240> but<00:01:50.420> other<00:01:50.690> than<00:01:50.810> that<00:01:50.930> I<00:01:51.020> mean<00:01:51.170> I<00:01:51.320> find<00:01:52.040> it

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
it but other than that I mean I find it

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.070 
it but other than that I mean I find it
a<00:01:52.190> little<00:01:52.280> difficult<00:01:52.490> so<00:01:53.390> what<00:01:53.690> I'm<00:01:53.780> doing

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
a little difficult so what I'm doing

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.660 
a little difficult so what I'm doing
here<00:01:54.350> with<00:01:54.650> the<00:01:54.860> ballistics<00:01:55.280> cpu<00:01:55.370> in<00:01:55.610> the

here with the ballistics cpu in the
variable<00:01:56.060> zoom<00:01:56.210> is<00:01:56.479> I'm<00:01:56.750> kind<00:01:57.380> of<00:01:57.500> taking<00:01:57.770> my

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
variable zoom is I'm kind of taking my

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.920 
variable zoom is I'm kind of taking my
time<00:01:58.460> with<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:58.820> shots<00:01:59.090> that<00:01:59.210> I<00:01:59.360> can<00:01:59.630> if<00:01:59.810> they

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
time with the shots that I can if they

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.450 
time with the shots that I can if they
are<00:02:00.110> enemies<00:02:00.500> that<00:02:00.590> are<00:02:00.650> further<00:02:00.950> away<00:02:01.130> of

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
are enemies that are further away of

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.280 
are enemies that are further away of
course<00:02:02.090> you<00:02:02.210> know<00:02:02.330> you<00:02:02.750> may<00:02:02.870> not<00:02:03.020> have<00:02:03.170> the

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
course you know you may not have the

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.719 
course you know you may not have the
time<00:02:03.500> to<00:02:03.680> do<00:02:03.799> so<00:02:03.830> if<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.280> enemies<00:02:04.580> are<00:02:04.700> close

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
time to do so if the enemies are close

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.640 
time to do so if the enemies are close
up<00:02:05.120> but<00:02:05.780> definitely<00:02:06.140> something<00:02:06.380> you<00:02:06.409> want<00:02:06.590> to

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
up but definitely something you want to

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.230 
up but definitely something you want to
try<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:06.799> do<00:02:07.010> especially<00:02:07.549> with<00:02:07.850> this<00:02:08.030> weapon

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
try to do especially with this weapon

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.120 
try to do especially with this weapon
because<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:08.899> strength<00:02:09.560> of<00:02:09.679> it<00:02:09.770> is<00:02:09.890> not<00:02:10.069> that

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
because the strength of it is not that

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.340 
because the strength of it is not that
good<00:02:10.580> so<00:02:11.209> you<00:02:11.300> will<00:02:11.569> be<00:02:11.630> getting<00:02:11.750> a<00:02:12.020> lot<00:02:12.140> of

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
good so you will be getting a lot of

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.870 
good so you will be getting a lot of
hit<00:02:12.440> markers<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:13.310> best<00:02:13.490> thing<00:02:13.610> that<00:02:13.730> I<00:02:13.760> can

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
hit markers the best thing that I can

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.120 
hit markers the best thing that I can
suggest<00:02:14.180> for<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:14.570> here<00:02:14.900> is<00:02:15.050> to<00:02:15.530> aim<00:02:15.650> for<00:02:15.680> the

suggest for you here is to aim for the

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.890

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
time for those shots that you get at a

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.660 
time for those shots that you get at a
long<00:02:20.080> range<00:02:21.190> otherwise<00:02:22.190> you<00:02:22.400> know<00:02:22.520> you're

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
long range otherwise you know you're

just going to end up with hit markers
another<00:02:25.130> thing<00:02:25.310> about<00:02:25.550> this<00:02:25.700> particular<00:02:26.030> gun

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
another thing about this particular gun

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.080 
another thing about this particular gun
you<00:02:26.990> know<00:02:27.400> aside<00:02:28.400> from<00:02:28.460> that<00:02:28.550> you<00:02:28.760> could<00:02:28.970> go

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
you know aside from that you could go

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.880 
you know aside from that you could go
play<00:02:29.300> hardcore<00:02:29.630> if<00:02:30.050> you<00:02:30.170> really<00:02:30.560> wanted<00:02:30.830> to

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
but I feel in hardcore it probably takes

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.290 
but I feel in hardcore it probably takes
just<00:02:33.920> about<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.220> same<00:02:34.400> time<00:02:34.460> unless<00:02:35.090> you're

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300

just about the same time unless you're
just<00:02:35.330> camping<00:02:36.020> because<00:02:36.650> you<00:02:36.950> can<00:02:37.100> die<00:02:37.310> just<00:02:37.610> as

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
just camping because you can die just as

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.140 
just camping because you can die just as
easily<00:02:38.060> as<00:02:38.390> you<00:02:38.420> can<00:02:38.750> kill<00:02:38.960> somebody<00:02:38.990> else<00:02:40.150> now

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150
