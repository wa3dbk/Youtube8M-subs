00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.150
 Earlier 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.410
 How many times 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.789
 This is the translation 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.789
 About 10 minutes in memory 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:27.550
 Yeah 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.550
 I can rice 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.050
 Have the whole 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.690
 I have a little more 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.740
 Condigi 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.740
 It's like I've been to Saita 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.100
 The batting average is about 10 percent 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.460
 If you can 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.390
 It's about 10,000 to five minutes to get here 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.630
 It is feeling 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.050
 Of course in the media Kono 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.900
 That analog 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.640
 It is felt even if this writing is appropriate 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.760
 In penang 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.760
 It is required to observe Kumoto 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.009
 That anxious 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.280
 I can not lose in such a time, though 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.280
 My wife says she can burn in Hanoi quite early 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.750
 Miyagi prefecture is 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.950
 I'm going to draw on you while I'm boka 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.570
 The important thing is 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.980
 It is characteristic of ram pastel that can do it 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.240
 It is more than this 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.560
 Look at that finished work 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:49.980
 Throwing 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.990
 What is this about Kansai being asked 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.990
 About Miura 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.960
 I often hear what I heard 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.990
 I can do it now and it really is pastel on this 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.090
 lose 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.900
 eh 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.699
 About that 

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:12.339
 manbo-ka somewhere is that interesting effect 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.289
 I know 

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:20.469
 This rain is watercolor and it is that relief 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.339
 It was on foot 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:28.589
 Oh that's that girl 

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:30.190
 Even something like Mr. Strength 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.469
 Time and effort 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:36.329
 There is a way to go ahead with a sense of speed 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:37.939
 Can 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:40.939
 That is the merit of 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:55.669
 From that point on the leaves of that art material results in color 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:57.220
 A man is also good about 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.499
 Though his 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:05.899
 Over 20 years ago, the writer other works more than 20 years ago 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.549
 The flock can not be seen anymore 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.509
 Recent one 

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:15.909
 This forgotten atelier also joins Yano 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:20.949
 I think that there are a lot of products that were firmly rumored 

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:23.969
 It is possible enough 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:27.150
 I think that I do not need to worry 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:34.749
 That kind of business that I ate a little about two years and a little less than seven months 

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:37.769
 I'm fine point a little scout is okay 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.769
 Ne 

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:44.459
 With that- 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.459
 It is said that power will be obtained later 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.139
 Also this year 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:52.539
 It is the biggest advantage 

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:54.199
 Usually come out 

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:57.199
 I want to say that Mr Kim 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.579
 Agreed wife agrees to here 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:03.019
 Of course 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.219
 Maybe a little bit 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:08.279
 It is about one hour to prepare 

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:10.439
 By all means challenge 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:11.979
