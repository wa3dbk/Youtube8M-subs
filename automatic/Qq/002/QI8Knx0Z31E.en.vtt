I could have look at my piece of paper

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.060 
I could have look at my piece of paper
after<00:02:21.150> mile<00:02:21.780> five<00:02:22.020> I<00:02:22.230> knew<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:22.560> taper<00:02:22.770> it<00:02:22.890> down

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
after mile five I knew to taper it down

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.130 
after mile five I knew to taper it down
a<00:02:23.100> little<00:02:23.250> bit<00:02:23.400> turn<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.420> corner<00:02:24.780> saw<00:02:25.110> the

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
a little bit turn the corner saw the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.640 
a little bit turn the corner saw the
hill

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
hill

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.630 
hill
I<00:02:25.680> had<00:02:26.040> air<00:02:26.430> in<00:02:26.700> my<00:02:26.820> lungs<00:02:26.850> in<00:02:27.360> order<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:27.810> to

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
I had air in my lungs in order to to

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.940 
I had air in my lungs in order to to
negotiate<00:02:29.640> my<00:02:29.670> way<00:02:29.820> up<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.150> hill<00:02:30.500> okay<00:02:31.500> so

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
negotiate my way up the hill okay so

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.920 
negotiate my way up the hill okay so
when<00:02:32.490> coming<00:02:32.730> up<00:02:32.790> with<00:02:32.850> patient<00:02:33.270> strategy<00:02:33.750> is

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
when coming up with patient strategy is

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.480 
when coming up with patient strategy is
really<00:02:34.230> important<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:34.950> know<00:02:35.070> your<00:02:35.250> course

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
really important to know your course

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.700 
really important to know your course
because<00:02:35.910> if<00:02:36.360> it's<00:02:36.660> a<00:02:36.750> hilly<00:02:36.930> course<00:02:37.170> you're

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
because if it's a hilly course you're

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.350 
because if it's a hilly course you're
not<00:02:37.830> going<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.010> be<00:02:38.100> maintaining<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.820> as<00:02:39.060> steady

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
not going to be maintaining it as steady

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.420 
not going to be maintaining it as steady
speed<00:02:39.600> all<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:39.930> way<00:02:39.990> round<00:02:40.260> you<00:02:40.770> need<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.100> you

need to know what what right pair what
pace<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.290> should<00:02:43.440> be<00:02:43.530> running<00:02:43.740> up<00:02:44.150> okay<00:02:45.150> now

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
pace you should be running up okay now

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.690 
pace you should be running up okay now

there's three different ways of running

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.750 
there's three different ways of running
you<00:02:54.750> can<00:02:54.900> either<00:02:55.100> you<00:02:56.100> can<00:02:56.220> either<00:02:56.400> be<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.670> guy

that just Sprint's off runs the fourth

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.300 
that just Sprint's off runs the fourth
fast<00:02:59.970> first<00:03:00.540> six<00:03:00.840> miles<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.470> then<00:03:01.920> just<00:03:02.130> tries

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
fast first six miles and then just tries

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.740 
fast first six miles and then just tries
to<00:03:02.340> maintain<00:03:02.610> that<00:03:03.030> that<00:03:03.330> speed<00:03:03.720> that

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
to maintain that that speed that

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.540 
to maintain that that speed that
advantage<00:03:04.470> that<00:03:04.650> they<00:03:04.740> built<00:03:05.010> from<00:03:05.160> that<00:03:05.340> from

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
advantage that they built from that from

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
advantage that they built from that from
the<00:03:05.670> first<00:03:05.880> six<00:03:06.060> miles

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
the first six miles

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.780 
the first six miles
you<00:03:07.230> can<00:03:07.470> try<00:03:08.070> and<00:03:08.160> run<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.460> other<00:03:08.580> way<00:03:08.730> so

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
you can try and run it the other way so

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.520 
you can try and run it the other way so
you<00:03:09.000> run<00:03:09.210> a<00:03:09.240> little<00:03:09.420> bit<00:03:09.540> slower<00:03:09.720> keep<00:03:10.380> your

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.660 
own you long to the first six and a half
and<00:03:13.110> then<00:03:13.410> for<00:03:13.770> the<00:03:13.830> second<00:03:14.190> half<00:03:14.280> you<00:03:14.310> trying

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
and then for the second half you trying

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.480 
and then for the second half you trying
one<00:03:14.820> negative<00:03:15.060> split<00:03:15.480> or<00:03:16.350> you<00:03:17.070> can<00:03:17.220> try<00:03:17.430> and

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
one negative split or you can try and

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.610 
one negative split or you can try and
run<00:03:17.670> like<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.270> Terminator<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:19.020> just<00:03:19.410> run<00:03:19.590> the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
run like the Terminator and just run the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.300 
run like the Terminator and just run the
same<00:03:19.860> pace

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
same pace

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.820 
same pace
all<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.610> way<00:03:20.730> through<00:03:20.970> okay<00:03:21.360> so<00:03:22.140> for<00:03:22.380> me<00:03:22.500> I'm<00:03:22.770> a

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
all the way through okay so for me I'm a

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.860 
all the way through okay so for me I'm a
little<00:03:23.190> bit<00:03:23.310> guilty<00:03:23.580> of<00:03:23.940> just<00:03:24.300> sprinting<00:03:24.750> off

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
little bit guilty of just sprinting off

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.560 
little bit guilty of just sprinting off
at<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.680> start<00:03:25.980> as<00:03:26.100> fast<00:03:26.370> as<00:03:26.520> I<00:03:26.610> can<00:03:26.670> but<00:03:27.390> my

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
at the start as fast as I can but my

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.740 
at the start as fast as I can but my
mentality<00:03:27.900> is<00:03:28.380> that<00:03:28.920> after<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.910> six<00:03:30.150> seven

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
mentality is that after the six seven

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.500 
mentality is that after the six seven
miles<00:03:30.960> I'm<00:03:31.770> feeling<00:03:32.340> I'm<00:03:32.520> feeling<00:03:33.150> but

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
miles I'm feeling I'm feeling but

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.210 
miles I'm feeling I'm feeling but
I'm<00:03:33.600> looking<00:03:33.840> up<00:03:33.930> I<00:03:34.050> watch<00:03:34.260> there's<00:03:34.830> no<00:03:34.980> better

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
I'm looking up I watch there's no better

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.160 
I'm looking up I watch there's no better
incentive<00:03:35.760> to<00:03:35.940> see<00:03:36.090> that<00:03:36.240> you're<00:03:36.450> a<00:03:36.750> PV

rocket I always do and I I knew where
the<00:04:16.799> hills<00:04:16.950> were<00:04:17.160> so<00:04:17.370> I<00:04:17.430> pulled<00:04:17.970> back<00:04:18.030> a<00:04:18.180> little

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
the hills were so I pulled back a little

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.659 
the hills were so I pulled back a little
bit<00:04:18.510> just<00:04:18.570> for<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:18.989> hills<00:04:19.170> and<00:04:19.520> maintained<00:04:20.520> a

bit just for the hills and maintained a
respectable<00:04:21.390> speed<00:04:21.630> but<00:04:21.900> didn't<00:04:22.140> want<00:04:22.260> to

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
respectable speed but didn't want to

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.360 
respectable speed but didn't want to
overheat<00:04:23.430> on<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.850> hills

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
overheat on the hills

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.490 
through sprint finish wasn't as strong
as<00:04:31.150> a<00:04:31.180> lot<00:04:31.270> of<00:04:31.360> light<00:04:31.570> I<00:04:31.780> can<00:04:32.080> learn<00:04:32.169> that<00:04:32.350> for

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
as a lot of light I can learn that for

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.129 
as a lot of light I can learn that for
next<00:04:32.620> year<00:04:32.919> and<00:04:33.070> but<00:04:33.910> for<00:04:34.030> me<00:04:34.210> my<00:04:34.750> place<00:04:34.990> is

next year and but for me my place is

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:36.990 
next year and but for me my place is
strategy<00:04:35.470> because<00:04:35.889> I<00:04:35.979> know<00:04:36.040> I've<00:04:36.430> got<00:04:36.699> mental

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
strategy because I know I've got mental

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.409 
strategy because I know I've got mental
toughness<00:04:37.180> I<00:04:37.600> will<00:04:37.960> just<00:04:38.139> go<00:04:38.620> for<00:04:38.860> it<00:04:38.919> and<00:04:39.040> just

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
toughness I will just go for it and just

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.580 
toughness I will just go for it and just
continue<00:04:40.419> to<00:04:40.449> push<00:04:40.810> through<00:04:41.290> the<00:04:41.440> pain
