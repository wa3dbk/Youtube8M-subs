00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 it's hard to know where to look 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.080
 this is the street of the luxury cars in sÃ£o 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.080
 Paulo 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.439
 come here is weekend walk 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:21.910
 I want to do here today Rodrigo lion the 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:24.009
 cars on camera he collects photos 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:28.570
 of sportsmen and women who want to 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:30.790
 day to have audi tt rs in collection the 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.890
 Rodrigo will have to wait until the car 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:38.350
 to reach the Brazilian windows 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:40.600
 for us it is in the hand and direct management of 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.110
 gasoline and a turbocharger 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:47.050
 so the 2.5 engine gains in performance 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:51.480
 and sport mode leaves the car even more 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.480
 aloofness changes until the exhaust snore 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.960
 340 model horses of that size and 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.960
 power for those who like it 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.190
 full plate with the word three times champion 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.290
 of Formula 1 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.560
 My life always lacked a kiss, I guess. 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.020
 that even old antique cars have already 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.650
 volkswagen ea and karmann guide everything ever 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.530
 has a stronger engine until this 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:25.190
 rarity that it restored and the greater 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:30.650
 fun with the mica 1927 run with the 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:34.930
 car and why would it be different with pt 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.930
 since we are on a track 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.540
 so that your complaint of theft 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.540
 Brazilian 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.390
 This is a car that was used in 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.420
 races and a 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.909
 advanced for urban use or for use 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:59.250
 normal that it is this version that we 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:01.470
 we are seeing and explaining how traction 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.030
 on the four wheels helps those who do not have 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.670
 intimacy with the clues 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.710
 It is a very safe car that I know 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.110
 practically can not make cars 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.780
 or cover behind it it always puts a 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.360
 little front and that for a pilot 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.810
 inexperienced is the best thing that has and 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.750
 outside this senna rain walking in the wet 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.330
 it's almost impossible to saw a pilot 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.959
 How are you, next business at four 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:31.140
 wheels is good not on the pilot who lived 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.989
 you always want attraction only behind 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.819
 And then you get to the best car you 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.480
 can point the best car in the 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.250
 curves 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.140
 Can you draw if you can 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:46.110
 amuse 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:49.740
 It's difficult now, the car can 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:53.260
 reach 280 per hour 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:56.200
 You drive a car with the barter. 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.290
 Do you think you're the first one? 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.989
 another or as I am from another date I 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.980
 I have this mechanical change in this car 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.980
 which I really like 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:14.150
 in the Brazilian market tt rs will have two 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.540
 competitors of respect 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.450
 the porsche cayman ro bmw series 1 m 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:24.950
 also bet on technology and strength 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.840
 engine in the dreams of any 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.150
 one of them fell very well 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.680
 You will please yourself and I only know you will. 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.340
 want to buy one of these cars and also 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.340
 purchase
