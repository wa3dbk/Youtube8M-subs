00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello girls welcome today I bring you 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.490
 this makeup is the first of 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.290
 spring is something colorful I hope that a 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.790
 all of you can please them this 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.360
 idea 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.360
 ah 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.029
 The first thing we will do is spend a 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.920
 fixer or shade base all 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.810
 our lower eyelid and the 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.090
 superior also I will immediately 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.310
 use this palette of the costal brand 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.050
 we're going to take the first color 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.750
 that will be a candy and we will put it 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.730
 in the shape of an arch throughout our basin 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.960
 and we are going to try to discriminate it with 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.960
 a very thick brush 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.820
 now let's take this color rose stick 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.590
 from the same palette is a pink color 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.780
 dark and we will put it in everything 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.390
 our eyelid mobile and slightly 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.340
 then we are going to go it up so 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.150
 combine it with the brown color that 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.150
 principle we put 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.680
 let's apply a matte vanilla shadow 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.540
 from the same palette below 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.070
 our eyebrows this will make our 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.290
 makeup look impeccable and that 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.810
 it is also believed to be great and perfect 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.240
 now we will go on to delineate our eyes 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.210
 today we are simply going to make a 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.670
 delineated very thin very finite 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.040
 classic style and then we started 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.610
 making a super thin hairline and then 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.500
 let's give a moose angular guy 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.650
 finalize in the external song of 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.659
 our eyes just something very 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.939
 simple but at the same time very nice 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.770
 also false eyelashes if you 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:49.009
 like I'm applying these that are 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.079
 very natural and after that we are going to 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.270
 move to align our water line 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:56.780
 using this bluish eyeliner from the 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:00.020
 jordan brand down we will use 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.209
 a green water color for our eyelid 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.060
 lower and well let's move on to 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:08.979
 blur little by little and then we're going to 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.979
 pass mascara too 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.950
 the inmates of our eyes is to say 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.190
 the lacrimal we are going to apply a pigment 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.840
 of the mix brand this is a baby 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.700
 vibrant 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.069
 ah 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.690
 after makeup our eyes we go 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.000
 to use a concealer so 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.849
 correct all our dark circles or excess 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.129
 of product that has fallen we are going to 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.110
 use a powder also to seal 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:42.340
 all this I'm using one of the 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.340
 brand simon 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.989
 finally I'm going to modify my lips 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.439
 using a matte eyeliner 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.930
 Maybelline tone very bun and on top of that 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:57.769
 I'm going to use this coral lipstick 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.750
 mark vision 117 and this is the result 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.609
