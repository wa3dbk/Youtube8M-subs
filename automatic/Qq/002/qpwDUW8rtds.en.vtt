00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:13.860

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.170
 are underway to giovanni antonio 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.810
 christophe perton yes I am I am 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.340
 aware of that it's a dream 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.070
 for a young player 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.620
 when I was little I watched the 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.450
 great interest on TV today I 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.610
 be part of it and so it's up to me 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.470
 the maximum to stay in this club the 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.180
 maximum possible squadra girl package 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.270
 black caviar with a lens in front of a secret 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.250
 show topo and spain civil monaco 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.780
 near Catherine des campsites 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.670
 different green Spanish schools 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.399
 frenchies different 80 unlike 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.070
 that I found in Spain is that we 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.180
 takes more risks and the game is a 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.720
 a bit more technical 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.540
 here we can find defenders who 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.540
 have more ease to aa has revived the 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.460
 the ball after France is true that 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.300
 very technical players but we 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.820
 limit the risk 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.490
 here we have a policy where we prefer 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.500
 take less risk we do not prefer 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.659
 take a goal rather than score 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.210
 the maximum and all that is Italian 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.909
 michele a penneteau piotta ti what 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.040
 yes yes I'm aware of that it's 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.619
 also why am I here because 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.330
 it's a thing where I have to 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.920
 progress 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.049
 so this is a championship that will me 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.340
 move forward I think so that's 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.330
 very strong it is very important for me 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.920
 to be here worse activities 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.710
 mandatory stuck everything is stalled 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:43.470
 talcahuano box to box that will bring him to 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:47.040
 quality but I think today 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.340
 I see there I have more facility to do 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.720
 the link between the defense and the attacked 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.310
 so I think that's my point 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.380
 strong after I have weak points well 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.420
 sure like just like any player but 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.439
 today I think my quality 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.869
 principal is the power is also 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.720
 this cult and to be able to combine the 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:10.560
 defense and and attac 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.620
 complex yet not given yet 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.180
 job 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.000
 forbid rival japan de espaÃ±a 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.880
 unmotivated by blow and what is it yes I 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.250
 know that when I was in Spain 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.470
 and he was following me so that proves 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.600
 it proves that today 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.030
 Interme makes me trust me 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.760
 so that's why I also opted 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.190
 for for inter because I have 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.610
 felt this great interest and this approach 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.310
 warm and tifosi wahyono is called 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.959
 announced father is authoritarian I am a 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.220
 very very open boy 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.640
 I am very sociable I open myself to everything 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.220
 the world 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.130
 here I am a young player I come 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.530
 to be from being daddy to there are two 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.930
 weeks pretty much so here it is and 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.250
 I hope I will be even closer 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.770
 tifosi in the days to come and the 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.440
 music music of all I am very 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.540
 open also musically and I listen to a 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.890
 little of everything rap jazz 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:16.019
 some rock obviously toubab 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:22.080
 voice on the perigord 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:23.940
 no but like everyone else I have my 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.080
 little ones my little dance moments too 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:30.360
 it's bullshit giovanni giovanni 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.209
 kiraitu rockhal castle on the outskirts 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.730
 but Japanese that I admired low like 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:39.000
 just like any young player it was 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:42.330
 it was england but we know 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.739
 also the qualities of the teams of 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.840
 from Italy because when I was young 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.299
 it was i think india is the 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.910
 highest championship 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:53.190
 today it's still in the process of 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.070
 find his place little by little so 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.360
 that's okay with my ma 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.820
 progression I think that's the good 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.950
 moment for to come play here in 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.360
 italy the leaders at jack atom francese 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.950
 molto strong of a pulpit of patrick 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.630
 vieira pointed out not even but patrick 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.610
 vieira is a great French player 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:15.930
 could we say even had a 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.519
 legend in France so I will try to 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.669
 at least to do like 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.860
 like him it will not be easy but I 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.330
 I will try to give everything for myself 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.129
 to do like him or even better 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:31.229
 why can not she have it all 

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:34.460
 in our jersey with the number 7 known 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:38.370
 marcel give the number 7 merengue 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.379
 why 07 because recently I have my 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.509
 who was born on June 7 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:45.210
 so that's a big meaning for 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.840
 me and my mother too who was born on the 7th 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.449
 November 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.229
 so that's a small sign for my mother 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:55.199
 and and for my son montauban then at 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.710
 cat the otan even deleterious name had 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:59.039
 been forged 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:02.310
 I want to thank all the fans 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:04.440
 of the hymn head of this welcome and 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.180
 I hope we will do great 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.830
 things 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.830
 as long as possible france inter
