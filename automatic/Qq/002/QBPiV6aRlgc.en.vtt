00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.250 
use less sheets paper or more more makes
it<00:01:02.039> stronger<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.730> harder<00:01:03.090> while<00:01:03.539> less<00:01:03.870> makes

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
it stronger and harder while less makes

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.730 
it stronger and harder while less makes
it<00:01:04.500> weaker<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.430> not<00:01:06.360> as<00:01:06.510> hard<00:01:06.780> um<00:01:09.320> more<00:01:10.320> papers

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
it weaker and not as hard um more papers

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.130 
it weaker and not as hard um more papers
does<00:01:11.040> work<00:01:11.310> better<00:01:11.670> but<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.479> have<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.810> fold

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
does work better but you have to fold

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.230 
does work better but you have to fold
the<00:01:13.320> first<00:01:13.590> one<00:01:13.860> smaller<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.580> small<00:01:14.970> with

much like half of a circle and fold over

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.870 
much like half of a circle and fold over
top

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
top

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.330 
top
fold<00:01:41.479> fold<00:01:42.479> over<00:01:42.829> basically<00:01:43.829> just<00:01:44.070> keep

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
fold fold over basically just keep

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.380 
fold fold over basically just keep
folding<00:01:45.030> do<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:46.140> every<00:01:46.560> time<00:01:47.060> all<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.329> way

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
folding do that every time all the way

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:59.890 
folding do that every time all the way
in<00:01:48.450> touch<00:01:48.720> all<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.350> way<00:01:49.520> rolled<00:01:50.520> up

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:14.470 

then<00:02:00.900> you<00:02:01.110> take<00:02:01.410> your<00:02:01.440> K<00:02:08.360> then<00:02:09.360> take<00:02:09.899> one<00:02:10.229> side

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.170 

now<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.540> other<00:02:15.930> side

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
now the other side

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.110 
now the other side
they<00:02:18.180> basically<00:02:18.480> got<00:02:18.960> this<00:02:19.670> then<00:02:20.670> check<00:02:20.970> it

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
they basically got this then check it

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.840 
they basically got this then check it
never<00:02:21.720> paper<00:02:22.020> I<00:02:25.040> usually<00:02:26.040> put<00:02:26.310> tape<00:02:26.640> on

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
never paper I usually put tape on

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.260 
never paper I usually put tape on
the<00:02:27.000> bottom<00:02:27.480> going<00:02:27.810> up<00:02:28.260> first<00:02:28.970> because<00:02:29.970> it

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
the bottom going up first because it

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.550 
the bottom going up first because it
makes<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.660> a<00:02:30.750> lot<00:02:30.930> easier<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:33.870> put<00:02:34.290> this

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
makes it a lot easier and you put this

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:47.030 
makes it a lot easier and you put this
on<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:37.820> right<00:02:38.990> put<00:02:39.990> this<00:02:40.350> on<00:02:40.709> it<00:02:44.900> make<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:46.040> even

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
on it right put this on it make it even

00:02:47.040 --> 00:03:33.890 
on it right put this on it make it even
and<00:02:47.580> just<00:02:50.239> fold<00:02:51.239> up

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.900 

then<00:03:34.900> taking<00:03:35.260> out<00:03:35.530> your<00:03:35.830> paper<00:03:36.130> and<00:03:36.370> basically

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910
