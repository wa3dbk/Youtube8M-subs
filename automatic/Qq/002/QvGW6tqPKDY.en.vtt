I got started with twenty nine or a
couple<00:00:03.000> years<00:00:03.240> ago<00:00:03.389> giant<00:00:04.170> first<00:00:04.380> started

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
couple years ago giant first started

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.849 
couple years ago giant first started
doing<00:00:04.859> their<00:00:05.220> hard<00:00:05.940> tail<00:00:06.150> 29er<00:00:06.859> prototyping

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
doing their hard tail 29er prototyping

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.459 
doing their hard tail 29er prototyping
and<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.910> be<00:00:09.030> honest<00:00:09.300> I<00:00:09.389> wasn't<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:09.750> big<00:00:10.110> fan<00:00:10.139> of

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
and to be honest I wasn't a big fan of

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.049 
and to be honest I wasn't a big fan of
the<00:00:10.679> breed<00:00:10.920> they're<00:00:11.250> really<00:00:11.460> noodly<00:00:11.880> the

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
the breed they're really noodly the

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.910 
the breed they're really noodly the
wheels<00:00:12.300> are<00:00:12.599> inherently<00:00:13.139> flexi<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:13.860> the

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
wheels are inherently flexi and the

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.330 
wheels are inherently flexi and the
front<00:00:14.190> ends<00:00:14.519> tall<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.420> awkward<00:00:16.010> but<00:00:17.010> when<00:00:17.279> I

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
front ends tall and awkward but when I

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.760 
front ends tall and awkward but when I
got<00:00:17.460> this<00:00:17.640> bike<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:18.090> knew<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:19.260> lot<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.680> those

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
got this bike I knew that a lot of those

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.349 
got this bike I knew that a lot of those
problems<00:00:20.100> were<00:00:20.189> rectified<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.090> had<00:00:21.330> a

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
problems were rectified and I had a

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.849 
problems were rectified and I had a
winner<00:00:21.600> on<00:00:21.689> my<00:00:21.869> hands<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.439> didn't<00:00:22.710> take<00:00:22.830> long

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
winner on my hands it didn't take long

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.009 
winner on my hands it didn't take long
for<00:00:23.039> me<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.490> prove<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:23.939> just<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.449> few<00:00:24.630> hours<00:00:24.779> I

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
for me to prove it just a few hours I

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:41.569 
for me to prove it just a few hours I
think<00:00:39.260> Dekker<00:00:40.260> gets<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.590> sea<00:00:40.800> otter<00:00:40.980> champagne

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579

was<00:01:27.030> pretty<00:01:27.720> awesome<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.530> all<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.770> sudden<00:01:28.799> I

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
was pretty awesome and all of a sudden I

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.399 
was pretty awesome and all of a sudden I
knew<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.030> needed<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.570> for<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.020> super<00:01:31.290> day

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
knew that I needed it for the super day

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.319 
knew that I needed it for the super day
the<00:01:31.530> next<00:01:31.650> day<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.670> certainly<00:01:32.939> wasn't<00:01:33.180> the

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
the next day and it certainly wasn't the

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.539 
the next day and it certainly wasn't the
intention<00:01:33.689> when<00:01:34.140> we<00:01:34.259> handed<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.710> bike<00:01:35.250> over

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
intention when we handed that bike over

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.969 
intention when we handed that bike over
it<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.630> wasn't<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.079> intention<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.650> Carl<00:01:37.829> was

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
it it wasn't the intention that Carl was

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.980 
it it wasn't the intention that Carl was
gonna<00:01:38.100> race<00:01:38.369> on<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.939> ended<00:01:39.299> up<00:01:39.360> racing<00:01:39.689> at<00:01:39.780> 12

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
gonna race on it I ended up racing at 12

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.920 
gonna race on it I ended up racing at 12
hours<00:01:40.079> later<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.770> won<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.040> Super<00:01:41.369> D<00:01:41.549> and

he<00:01:44.670> kind<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:44.970> was<00:01:45.110> not<00:01:46.110> really<00:01:46.409> willing<00:01:46.619> to

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
he kind of was not really willing to

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.399 
he kind of was not really willing to
give<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.250> bike<00:01:47.460> up<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.119> speak<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.689> Johnny

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
quiver this was my first year at down

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.140 
quiver this was my first year at down
evil<00:03:10.709> and<00:03:10.920> I<00:03:11.400> didn't<00:03:11.640> really<00:03:11.790> know<00:03:11.880> what<00:03:12.090> to

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
evil and I didn't really know what to

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.630 
evil and I didn't really know what to
expect<00:03:12.600> and<00:03:13.560> I<00:03:13.680> did<00:03:13.829> a<00:03:13.859> bunch<00:03:13.980> of<00:03:14.100> practice<00:03:14.489> on

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
expect and I did a bunch of practice on

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.270 
expect and I did a bunch of practice on
longer<00:03:14.970> travel<00:03:15.299> bikes<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.980> you<00:03:16.980> needed

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
longer travel bikes and you needed

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.670 
longer travel bikes and you needed
longer<00:03:17.609> travel<00:03:17.970> or<00:03:18.120> so<00:03:18.299> I<00:03:18.329> thought<00:03:18.600> but<00:03:18.900> I<00:03:19.260> did

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
longer travel or so I thought but I did

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.140 
longer travel or so I thought but I did
a<00:03:19.709> little<00:03:19.799> practice<00:03:20.190> on<00:03:20.310> this<00:03:20.400> bike<00:03:20.640> too<00:03:20.880> and

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
a little practice on this bike too and

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.050 
a little practice on this bike too and
with<00:03:21.269> four<00:03:21.480> inches<00:03:22.070> yeah<00:03:23.070> maybe<00:03:23.400> it<00:03:23.579> was<00:03:23.760> kind

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
with four inches yeah maybe it was kind

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.250 
with four inches yeah maybe it was kind
of<00:03:24.090> like<00:03:24.239> bringing<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.570> knife<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:24.780> a<00:03:24.989> gunfight

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
of like bringing a knife to a gunfight

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.770 
of like bringing a knife to a gunfight

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
but sometimes in the dark maybe a knife

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.530 
but sometimes in the dark maybe a knife
is<00:03:31.019> better<00:03:31.230> than<00:03:31.440> a<00:03:31.530> gun<00:03:31.880> it<00:03:32.880> was<00:03:33.060> great

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
is better than a gun it was great

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.630 
is better than a gun it was great
