00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:29.890
 XCOM on the move even opponents nobody to eliminate opponents 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.760
 and 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.260

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.110
 and make you happy 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.870
 Kley here you can see first 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.240
 you have to squash once on the screen promptly percent 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.389
 to jump anyone percent 

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:04.140
 Holds the higher the jumps around it 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.200
 and there you were once again working or attacking the opponent 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.590
 and then for the university sees Hiesinger once 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.410
 there are also boxes you just to taxes but can so easily 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.840
 Corso very short around that one has now 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.610
 against the opponents but got and change are com bot 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.520
 and later when other opponents come 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.920
 in Scorpio and Sweden 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.100
 and you can destroy them all in the same way 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.250
 on the left you can see percentages for meter-man already warned is above 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.530
 on the right you can see the number of 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.120
 for defeated opponents 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.570
 would have to fall already 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.940
 and yes on the way was still solid comes explode London 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.760
 Spethmann directly so I'm on automatically 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.040
 next block so you do not really have to jump anymore 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.330
 then Rochat comes past the man with another title 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.330
 important ignites and destroys the opponent on the other side 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.509
 around 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.859
 Here you can see now my as the warning the correct 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:16.639
 Distance Simone 16 meters which in the country 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:19.659
 Kehls a 30 times 1 b 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.569
 my record watch proves to prove it 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.419
 only briefly was breaks 770 by 46 percent 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:29.659
 and the Sigma 2 is better so today 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:30.860
 around 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.399
 one of the best running 

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:35.699
 Hausen now stands 76 and 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:39.449
 an example is the basket hunters down to the field on menu now too 

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:42.269
 plaintiffs 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.680
 yes the game now costs again 90 percent of the stock package in the way big 

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:52.789
 actually fun also good in between and I think that 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:55.879
 actually makes fun in the long run 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.879
 Man who would like to create more and more meters 

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:04.779
 at all 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:08.419
 Kiel changes without the weather, I believe after a while 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:11.409
 that will be dark later so the sun goes down 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.519
 you can see something now 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.260
 I think they are raining too and sister is not so sure 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
 it is dark 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:25.459
 after that exactly when you should not fall down now and also next 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.619
 Block is a fat man Cup twice on the screen 

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:30.709
 around sprinters 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.199
 nothing up high again and 

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:38.449
 yes even Marcel Goc turned to another mix but no opponent who then 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:40.599
 Reinforced concrete and 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.200
 The Robert Cooper it was difficult because then bye left is double it 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.200
 it is seen and i am rehearsing again 

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:52.089
 and can continue 

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:53.769
 it's getting dark 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.919
 Boxes residents liked and no opponent 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:58.709
 so not lost 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.889
 Kosice GAM is fun 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:04.739
 Stemmer nine seats is the SkiWorld is definitely worth it for 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.199
 in between brittle Super or for a long time looking 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:11.409
 Kreitz and around 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:14.409
 yes scope supports successes would like to collect 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.039
 cycling 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.040
 Unger 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.079
 Usually continue to clear tables 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.380
 If he wants something so would like to say and polish
