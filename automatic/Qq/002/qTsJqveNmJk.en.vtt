00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
that it's pretty sharp screen and it's a

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.850 
that it's pretty sharp screen and it's a
fairly<00:01:07.460> nice<00:01:08.810> viewing<00:01:09.810> angle<00:01:10.170> all<00:01:10.290> around<00:01:10.620> so

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
fairly nice viewing angle all around so

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.740 
fairly nice viewing angle all around so
that's<00:01:11.010> almost<00:01:11.250> sort<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.940> ips<00:01:12.270> quality

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
that's almost sort of ips quality

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.010 
that's almost sort of ips quality
display<00:01:13.620> which<00:01:13.980> is<00:01:14.100> really<00:01:14.340> nice<00:01:14.900> just<00:01:15.900> have<00:01:15.990> a

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
display which is really nice just have a

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.390 
display which is really nice just have a
quick<00:01:16.200> look<00:01:16.260> around<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.920> device<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
quick look around the device is the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.710 
quick look around the device is the
power<00:01:17.640> there's<00:01:18.480> a<00:01:18.980> micro<00:01:19.980> USB<00:01:20.010> here<00:01:20.760> and<00:01:21.360> we've

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
power there's a micro USB here and we've

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.190 
power there's a micro USB here and we've
got<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.870> micro<00:01:22.320> HDMI<00:01:23.330> there<00:01:24.330> as<00:01:24.750> well<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.020> think

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
got a micro HDMI there as well I think

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.600 
got a micro HDMI there as well I think
that's<00:01:25.380> pretty<00:01:25.590> much<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:26.070> for<00:01:26.250> around<00:01:26.430> the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
that's pretty much it for around the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.640 
that's pretty much it for around the
device<00:01:26.820> isn't<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.150> oh<00:01:27.270> we<00:01:27.510> got<00:01:27.660> is<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.380> sim

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
device isn't it oh we got is that a sim

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.270 
device isn't it oh we got is that a sim
card<00:01:28.920> slot<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.120> so<00:01:30.960> sim<00:01:31.170> card<00:01:31.380> slots<00:01:31.620> a<00:01:31.770> 3g

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
card slot it is so sim card slots a 3g

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.000 
card slot it is so sim card slots a 3g
capable<00:01:33.090> tablet<00:01:33.480> this<00:01:33.810> we're<00:01:34.230> smart<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.860> is

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
capable tablet this we're smart this is

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.920 
capable tablet this we're smart this is
18<00:01:35.430> this<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.000> an<00:01:36.090> SD<00:01:36.420> but<00:01:36.600> there's<00:01:36.720> another

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
18 this is an SD but there's another

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.960 
18 this is an SD but there's another
yeah<00:01:37.590> this<00:01:37.800> would<00:01:37.950> be<00:01:38.070> for<00:01:38.190> the<00:01:38.280> simpler<00:01:38.640> right

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
yeah this would be for the simpler right

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.880 
yeah this would be for the simpler right
so<00:01:39.210> there's<00:01:39.390> possibly<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.900> 3g<00:01:40.380> version<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.830> this

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
so there's possibly a 3g version of this

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.490 
so there's possibly a 3g version of this
coming<00:01:41.190> as<00:01:41.670> well<00:01:41.730> on<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.300> top<00:01:42.540> going<00:01:43.260> around

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
coming as well on the top going around

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.230 
coming as well on the top going around
there<00:01:43.770> we<00:01:43.860> can<00:01:43.980> see<00:01:44.100> volume<00:01:44.400> rocker<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.760> power

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
there we can see volume rocker and power

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.230 
there we can see volume rocker and power
switch<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.780> on<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.560> back<00:01:46.800> we<00:01:47.340> got<00:01:47.520> some<00:01:47.909> oh

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
switch and on the back we got some oh

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.670 
switch and on the back we got some oh
I'm<00:01:48.630> not<00:01:48.720> something<00:01:48.960> else<00:01:49.050> on<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.260> side<00:01:49.470> yeah

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
I'm not something else on this side yeah

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.300 
I'm not something else on this side yeah
as<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.400> headphone<00:01:50.729> port

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
as the headphone port

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.639 
as the headphone port
and<00:01:52.700> probably<00:01:53.149> one<00:01:53.360> of<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.509> speaker<00:01:53.930> outputs

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
and probably one of the speaker outputs

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.230 
and probably one of the speaker outputs
there<00:01:54.860> I<00:01:54.890> guess<00:01:55.130> you<00:01:55.430> wanted<00:01:55.610> the<00:01:55.729> back<00:01:55.880> and

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
there I guess you wanted the back and

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.310 
there I guess you wanted the back and
the<00:01:56.390> back<00:01:56.570> we've<00:01:56.840> got<00:01:56.960> a<00:01:56.990> camera<00:01:57.820> with<00:01:58.820> an<00:01:58.939> LED

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
rubberized finish I'm not sure if this

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.830 
rubberized finish I'm not sure if this
will<00:02:03.829> be<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.039> final<00:02:04.220> design<00:02:05.090> possibly

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
will be the final design possibly

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.810 
will be the final design possibly
changed<00:02:06.110> a<00:02:06.170> little<00:02:06.289> bit<00:02:06.500> possibly<00:02:07.280> not<00:02:07.490> yeah

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
you can look at skeletons so this is

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.070 
you can look at skeletons so this is
just<00:03:23.400> a<00:03:23.610> taste<00:03:23.940> of<00:03:24.150> what's<00:03:24.390> to<00:03:24.480> come<00:03:24.750> you<00:03:24.990> know

taking what you'd expect in terms of
performance<00:03:46.920> from<00:03:47.400> into<00:03:47.760> hell<00:03:47.880> packing<00:03:48.690> that

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
performance from into hell packing that
