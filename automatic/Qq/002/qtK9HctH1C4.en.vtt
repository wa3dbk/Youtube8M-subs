00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.220
 Google introduces together with the stands of the Google Nexus S which is the successor of 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.120
 the dome with the hose 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.730
 and it also looks a bit like a van der lecq 6 in terms of specifications 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.259
 But the Google Nexus S is the first and by phone with an honor it fell 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:17.220
 committee is integrated 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.769
 and it is also the first phone to the new version of and drive version 2 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.229
 points installed on and various is called sims huppert 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.679
 in terms of specifications, the components are six right 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:35.480
 I call for extra death after large screen 16 gigabytes of internal memory 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.570
 expandable 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.020
 has a 5 megapixel camera with auto focus and LED flash and a camera on 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.550
 the front with a low resolution 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.890
 It has a built-in four hotspot feature that lets you use your laptop too 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.870
 can use the mobile internet feed the phone 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.140
 of course the device has a GPS 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.410
 and because an extra competition has a solid processor, it immediately responds quickly 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.570
 device feels this issue to me is very nice in the hand 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.200
 and the screen that is slightly curved 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.530
 the front is completely glossy black 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.640
 he came to his invisible position in the tuning pass and therefore it is 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.400
 seven orient what is up and down when your device was out of your pocket 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.360
 the screen responds very well parakhina and it is so sensitive that you sometimes 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.440
 show off we can make a choice while keeping your finger just above the screen 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.860
 plays 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.470
 at the bottom of the irish still flat roof 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.510
 and also a soft touch is sufficient to operate them 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.630
 the screen has a clear delay 4 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.460
 this is a great quality 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.210
 we just don't find it as good as that of the iphone 4 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.000
 but blamed color areas zutendaal good easter and lowercase letters are not 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.710
 as sharp as on the iphone 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.650
 it is possible that the google nexus s that will be introduced in the netherlands 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.080
 get a different type of screen 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.420
 we talk well and also flash content is shown 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.790
 the iphone still offers the points display pretty cool and this ommen 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.770
 He knows how to add several in ham cheese to an extra s 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.540
 I can view the inboxes of the various opportunities both separately and mixed 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.799
 can easily delete and move multiple emails at once 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.370
 or read some but turn around 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.610
 Google Nexus S can indulge chips remotely that's called an honor 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.039
 seconds 

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:15.169
 chips can contain links to information on the internet and also 

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:18.429
 payment problem technically possible 

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:21.539
 the applications are still very limited but Google hopes that through the 

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:25.100
 introduction of the nfc chip on this and door device 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.210
 thereby no longer be used and that way chicken egg story 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.950
 breakthrough can be talked about a departure in the signal very much 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.900
 the changes compared to the previous versions 6 kilos but very bad 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.039
 successful 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:38.589
 keyboard has been improved 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:42.009
 for example, a child just like on a regular keyboard with a finish in it 

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:44.999
 State affairs and with the other types of capital letters 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:47.999
 and also numbers and punctuation marks that are more easily accessible 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:52.009
 the ek selection and cut and paste easier 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:55.539
 ankle has now also added a download in which you can easily find all 

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:57.749
 manage downloads 

00:02:57.749 --> 00:03:01.419
 manufacturers adjust the operation of and often become a bit and used to be one 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:02.819
 number of extras 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.049
 this version of their turn does not have mvk days of relief 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:10.340
 To this it really happened as it is meant to be simply stylish 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.209
 and for livable 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.689
 to adjust your own taste 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:17.099
 conclusion the google nexus s is a super fast device with much lighter 10 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:18.939
 sometimes that's not right 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:22.150
 nfc chip to be a nice addition but for now you have it 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.419
 unfortunately little on 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:28.389
 na points can be adjusted more to your own taste than just file scenarios 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:33.159
 14 very nice mobile operating system and that comes in good in the collections and juice 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.019
 to his right therefore look forward to more devices with couples version 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:37.489
