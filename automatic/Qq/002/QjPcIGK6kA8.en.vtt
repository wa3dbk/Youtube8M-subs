00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
out a little tip about this screw you're

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.670 
out a little tip about this screw you're
going<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.190> magnetize<00:01:02.840> your<00:01:03.840> screwdriver<00:01:04.409> for

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
going to magnetize your screwdriver for

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.859 
going to magnetize your screwdriver for
a<00:01:04.739> minute<00:01:05.070> or<00:01:05.159> two<00:01:05.369> because<00:01:06.090> if<00:01:06.510> that's<00:01:06.720> not

a minute or two because if that's not

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.570 
a minute or two because if that's not
magnetized<00:01:07.530> you'll<00:01:07.830> probably<00:01:08.040> drop<00:01:08.369> that

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
magnetized you'll probably drop that

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.539 
magnetized you'll probably drop that
