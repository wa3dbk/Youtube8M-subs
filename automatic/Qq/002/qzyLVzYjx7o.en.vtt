00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.210
 hello then at fiona of the anti blog 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.070
 cocotte and I discovered bio headdress ya 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.690
 not long 

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.010
 following a small misadventure that is me 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.060
 arrived with the hair then it will be 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.680
 not immediately because of course 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.820
 all's well That ends well 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.710
 I had the fad to make me a tie and 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.839
 dye who comes to their other already he 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.460
 it took me body hair 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:27.189
 and in addition I asked that it be pink 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.460
 so for that I called a salon 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:32.140
 quite known for some colorations a little 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.440
 wacky who come america a lot 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.180
 of chains all over you to know from 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.720
 who it was calais on my blog 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.720
 and then you will see 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.270
 after that I went there and that 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.180
 did not order well and 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.600
 colored once twice three times the 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.110
 friends 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.160
 until it becomes orange then 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.150
 why it became orange all 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.640
 simply because they put me in 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.640
 pink on dumas round and colorful which 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.260
 made a fluo orange but then worthy 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.350
 the biggest disco parties of the years 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.430
 70 I just lit up the whole living room the 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.560
 worry is that the hairdresser does not have 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.150
 really saw the problem and continued to 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.659
 bleach my hair until I get 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.530
 to a white 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:17.030
 gray on my friends so here it is at 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.740
 from the moment I started to 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.159
 touch to see the texture because 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.490
 the bag 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.979
 finally I was burnt so I slightly 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.299
 pinball and when I took my hair 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.310
 and who had some who fell 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.409
 like that by wick in my hands I 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.270
 started asking because the manager 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.560
 come to see what's going on and in 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.349
 effect he asked his hairdresser 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.710
 to stop right away squatted at 

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:40.450
 my level and my miss diva 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.830
 with you with your hair it's not 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.850
 possible to arrive at the color you 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.710
 wish without damaging them 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.690
 too bad it's too late 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.040
 so we will make you a nice chocolate 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.240
 and then you go back home 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.830
 with the color that you had in 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.770
 except that I read the hair 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.510
 for five months damaged to do so I 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.210
 do not really know what to do 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.590
 used shea butter I put some 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.390
 argan wolf morning and evening on my 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.340
 hair more sense to have the hair 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.050
 oily but ultimately it 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.780
 it was the second the least of my worries 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.039
 so I put everything that could 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.250
 make the rehydrate drink 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.980
 in the end I had a tie and dye 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.750
 was pulling yellow because in fact the 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.120
 brown part is obviously over the 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.530
 shampoos and I ended up with 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.030
 hair pulling to the yellow the game 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.100
 the game until I get 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.130
 contacted by biocoop who tell me bah 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.380
 listen we saw your story and we think 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.910
 that we can repair your hair so I have 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.180
 tempted the adventurous I told myself that's it 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.800
 can not be worse anyway so 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.060
 horse advantage is that it's true that 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.680
 I said to myself I hold a cross on 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.180
 all that is coloring because of 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.160
 anyway it was me bieber hair 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.459
 and then there was bio in the headdress 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.110
 so I told myself frankly we're going 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.560
 nothing removed we're just going to added 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.880
 add plant pigments so 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.070
 let's try so here 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.380
 I'm coming out of my second bio session 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.030
 headdresses and I'm delighted I have a smile 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.930
 until then I do not hold back what I 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.550
 could run everywhere in fact the 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.170
 first time I did them I had 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.150
 the dark hair he had well 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.260
 quickly you are my skin they have me 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.290
 explained a little bit how they have 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.450
 used that so he loses it was really 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.400
 interesting to learn how how the 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.930
 hair wood color but especially 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.340
 when I went home after 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.960
 of three days I washed them 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.920
 hair the first thing is that I 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.910
 washed my hair because he has 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.410
 I had to wash my hair 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.820
 but I could have left them like that 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.040
 for maybe seven days since he did not 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.670
 I did not regret where I was thrilled banks 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.200
 and oily hair and then 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.090
 the advantage is that they are and I 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.590
 felt them much stronger when I 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.450
 came back today at bio headdress 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.470
 I would have told him about that I never 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.570
 saw that I do not understand how my 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.830
 hair can be as strong and they 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.330
 explained to me that in fact only the hair 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.350
 and and sheathed and coated so it is 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.020
 a lot much stronger a lot 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.580
 brighter so that's what I can 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.360
 see today I was lucky 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.940
 to have a second break really for 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.280
 tweaking 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:00.890
 the color we will cut the tips and 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:03.990
 I end up with a color that is 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.090
 quite to my taste I feel and 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.610
 very light hair I smell 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.420
 nice because I do not feel any 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.810
 what is chemical 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.069
 it does not smell like shampoo 2 2 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.870
 that we used to go out straight 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:20.489
 other thing it's true it's vegetal 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:22.109
 feels good and I'm sure I'm going 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.370
 it's okay it's been a long time 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.169
 way it's not at all the same thing 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.419
 it's not the same the same concepts 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.919
 it takes longer and it lasts longer 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.449
 a long time so I'm thrilled thank you 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.400
 a lot better headdress it's really a 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:34.400
 beautiful story that ends 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.400
 Hi
