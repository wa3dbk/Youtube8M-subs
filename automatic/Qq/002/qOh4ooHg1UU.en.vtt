00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
directory then debug and we're going to

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.649 
directory then debug and we're going to
copy<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.390> wav<00:01:18.840> file<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:20.340> format<00:01:21.060> has<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.509> be

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
copy in a wav file the format has to be

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.960 
copy in a wav file the format has to be
wave<00:01:22.200> because<00:01:23.149> that's<00:01:24.149> the<00:01:25.140> only<00:01:25.590> file<00:01:26.580> type

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
wave because that's the only file type

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.039 
wave because that's the only file type
that<00:01:27.270> our<00:01:28.259> object<00:01:28.530> can<00:01:29.070> play<00:01:29.490> our<00:01:30.450> code<00:01:30.780> that

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
that our object can play our code that

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.149 
that our object can play our code that
we're<00:01:31.229> using<00:01:32.450> so<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:33.899> use<00:01:34.080> audacity<00:01:34.380> to

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
we're using so I just use audacity to

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.580 
we're using so I just use audacity to
convert<00:01:35.789> an<00:01:35.909> mp3<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.750> wave

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.420 

okay<00:01:40.430> so<00:01:40.490> I'm<00:01:40.970> going<00:01:41.119> to<00:01:41.180> double-click<00:01:41.540> on<00:01:41.840> the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
okay so I'm going to double-click on the

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.100 
okay so I'm going to double-click on the
play<00:01:43.430> button<00:01:43.610> to<00:01:43.759> generate<00:01:44.329> the<00:01:44.540> click<00:01:45.079> event

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
play button to generate the click event

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.490 
play button to generate the click event
handler<00:01:45.740> and<00:01:45.920> open<00:01:46.729> up<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:46.970> code<00:01:47.149> window<00:01:47.500> and

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
handler and open up the code window and

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.590 
handler and open up the code window and
up<00:01:48.649> top<00:01:48.890> before<00:01:49.280> we<00:01:49.340> start<00:01:49.759> writing<00:01:50.030> into<00:01:50.450> the

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.460 
up top before we start writing into the
event<00:01:51.409> handler<00:01:51.799> we're<00:01:52.549> going<00:01:52.820> to<00:01:53.000> add<00:01:53.750> a<00:01:53.810> using

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
event handler we're going to add a using

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.919 
event handler we're going to add a using
statement<00:01:55.210> we're<00:01:56.210> going<00:01:56.330> to<00:01:56.450> say<00:01:56.630> using

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
statement we're going to say using

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:02.260 
statement we're going to say using
system<00:01:58.240> media<00:02:00.310> and<00:02:01.310> then<00:02:01.429> we're<00:02:01.580> going<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:01.759> go

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
system media and then we're going to go

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.760 
system media and then we're going to go
and<00:02:02.479> declare<00:02:02.990> our<00:02:03.200> object<00:02:03.710> private<00:02:05.770> sound

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
and declare our object private sound

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.130 
and declare our object private sound
player<00:02:08.080> sound<00:02:09.080> player

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.490 

and<00:02:12.470> in<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:14.050> constructor<00:02:15.050> we're<00:02:15.290> going<00:02:15.440> to

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
and in the constructor we're going to

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.490 
and in the constructor we're going to
construct<00:02:15.770> our<00:02:16.070> object<00:02:16.930> some<00:02:17.930> player<00:02:18.230> is

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
construct our object some player is

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.790 
construct our object some player is
equal<00:02:18.740> to<00:02:18.860> new<00:02:19.100> sound<00:02:19.520> player<00:02:19.850> and<00:02:20.680> here<00:02:21.680> we

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
equal to new sound player and here we

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.170 
equal to new sound player and here we
have<00:02:21.980> a<00:02:22.990> constructor<00:02:23.990> overload<00:02:24.970> us<00:02:25.970> to

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
have a constructor overload us to

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.480 
have a constructor overload us to
specify<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:26.840> location<00:02:27.140> of<00:02:27.710> our<00:02:27.830> file<00:02:28.160> which

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
is in the startup directory so we don't

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.560 
is in the startup directory so we don't
need<00:02:31.820> to<00:02:32.770> specify<00:02:33.770> any<00:02:34.250> path<00:02:34.580> we<00:02:34.940> just<00:02:35.270> have<00:02:35.420> to

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
need to specify any path we just have to

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:43.540 
need to specify any path we just have to
say<00:02:35.750> all<00:02:36.410> on<00:02:37.090> me<00:02:38.200> don't<00:02:39.200> wave

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.190 

there's<00:02:44.180> our<00:02:44.360> wav<00:02:44.570> file<00:02:46.180> okay<00:02:47.180> and<00:02:47.390> here<00:02:47.930> we'll

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
there's our wav file okay and here we'll

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.710 
there's our wav file okay and here we'll
start<00:02:48.500> working<00:02:48.920> on<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.160> button<00:02:49.610> of<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.540> dual

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
state button click event handler so if

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:00.800 
state button click event handler so if
just<00:02:55.460> a<00:02:55.760> button<00:02:56.000> checked<00:02:57.700> then
