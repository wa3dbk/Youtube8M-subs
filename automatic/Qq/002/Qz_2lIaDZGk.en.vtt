you<00:03:49.080> should<00:03:49.110> have<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:49.560> pretty<00:03:49.890> good<00:03:50.629> hold<00:03:51.629> going

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
you should have a pretty good hold going

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.080 
you should have a pretty good hold going
on<00:03:52.500> in<00:03:52.799> your<00:03:53.010> mouth<00:03:53.099> with<00:03:53.370> your<00:03:53.519> dentures<00:03:53.849> and

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
down you know here and there I tack down

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.550 
down you know here and there I tack down
the<00:03:59.250> flanges<00:03:59.790> of<00:04:00.030> my<00:04:00.629> lower<00:04:00.870> so<00:04:01.379> that<00:04:01.409> I

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
the flanges of my lower so that I

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.229 
the flanges of my lower so that I
wouldn't<00:04:01.890> hit<00:04:01.980> my<00:04:02.159> extraction<00:04:02.489> sites<00:04:02.909> and<00:04:03.150> the

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
wouldn't hit my extraction sites and the

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.960 
wouldn't hit my extraction sites and the
roof<00:04:03.420> of<00:04:03.569> my<00:04:03.689> upper<00:04:04.129> and<00:04:05.129> that<00:04:05.580> helped

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
roof of my upper and that helped

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.790 
roof of my upper and that helped
enormous<00:04:06.720> Lee<00:04:06.930> with<00:04:07.470> both<00:04:07.890> eating

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
enormous Lee with both eating

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.980 
enormous Lee with both eating
and<00:04:08.890> speaking<00:04:09.340> but<00:04:10.210> I<00:04:10.390> was<00:04:10.630> more<00:04:10.840> concerned

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
and speaking but I was more concerned

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.610 
and speaking but I was more concerned
about<00:04:11.200> speaking<00:04:11.590> I<00:04:12.010> was<00:04:12.520> eating<00:04:13.500> so<00:04:14.500> that

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
about speaking I was eating so that

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.920 
about speaking I was eating so that
brings<00:04:14.770> us<00:04:15.010> to<00:04:15.040> question<00:04:15.640> number<00:04:15.730> two<00:04:16.150> that<00:04:16.780> is

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
brings us to question number two that is

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.170 
brings us to question number two that is
commonly<00:04:17.290> asked<00:04:17.590> and<00:04:17.980> that<00:04:18.010> is<00:04:18.550> when<00:04:18.790> can<00:04:18.940> I<00:04:19.030> go

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
commonly asked and that is when can I go

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.880 
commonly asked and that is when can I go
back<00:04:19.300> to<00:04:19.360> work

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
back to work

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.550 
back to work
again<00:04:21.310> this<00:04:21.520> was<00:04:21.670> a<00:04:21.700> huge<00:04:21.940> concern<00:04:22.210> of<00:04:22.360> mine

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
again this was a huge concern of mine

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.330 
again this was a huge concern of mine
and<00:04:23.580> I<00:04:24.580> would<00:04:24.820> say<00:04:25.180> just<00:04:25.540> to<00:04:26.290> play<00:04:26.470> a<00:04:26.500> loose<00:04:26.830> one

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
and I would say just to play a loose one

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.930 
and I would say just to play a loose one
week<00:04:27.690> I<00:04:28.690> think<00:04:29.110> that<00:04:29.320> a<00:04:29.350> lot<00:04:29.650> of<00:04:29.680> people<00:04:29.980> can<00:04:30.730> go

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
week I think that a lot of people can go

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.900 
week I think that a lot of people can go
back<00:04:31.090> earlier<00:04:32.040> but<00:04:33.040> if<00:04:33.190> you<00:04:33.280> work<00:04:33.490> closely

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
back earlier but if you work closely

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.530 
back earlier but if you work closely
with<00:04:34.180> you<00:04:34.870> know<00:04:34.990> clientele<00:04:35.620> or<00:04:35.650> it's<00:04:36.280> a

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
with you know clientele or it's a

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.600 
with you know clientele or it's a
sensitive<00:04:37.540> type<00:04:38.380> arena<00:04:38.770> that<00:04:39.040> you<00:04:39.190> work<00:04:39.400> in

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
sensitive type arena that you work in

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:40.980 
sensitive type arena that you work in
you<00:04:39.880> probably<00:04:40.030> want<00:04:40.450> to<00:04:40.480> take<00:04:40.630> that<00:04:40.780> whole

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
you probably want to take that whole

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.930 
you probably want to take that whole
week<00:04:41.170> because<00:04:41.770> you<00:04:42.400> know<00:04:42.490> you<00:04:42.550> don't<00:04:42.850> really

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
week because you know you don't really

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.850 
week because you know you don't really
want<00:04:43.150> to<00:04:43.210> have<00:04:43.300> paranoia<00:04:43.720> about<00:04:44.140> you<00:04:44.620> know<00:04:44.710> the

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
want to have paranoia about you know the

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.260 
want to have paranoia about you know the
next<00:04:45.040> time<00:04:45.190> I<00:04:45.220> over<00:04:45.430> my<00:04:45.580> mouth<00:04:45.730> of<00:04:45.970> on<00:04:46.090> got<00:04:46.240> a

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
next time I over my mouth of on got a

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.830 
next time I over my mouth of on got a
you<00:04:46.960> know<00:04:47.430> spit<00:04:48.430> or<00:04:48.850> say<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:49.150> wrong<00:04:49.180> word<00:04:49.540> I

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
you know spit or say the wrong word I

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.480 
you know spit or say the wrong word I
don't<00:04:50.110> think<00:04:50.260> I<00:04:50.350> ever<00:04:50.380> spit<00:04:50.800> by<00:04:51.010> the<00:04:51.070> way<00:04:51.220> so<00:04:51.280> I

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
don't think I ever spit by the way so I

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.280 
don't think I ever spit by the way so I
think<00:04:51.790> you<00:04:51.880> guys<00:04:52.000> are<00:04:52.060> good

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
think you guys are good

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.380 
think you guys are good
but<00:04:54.010> if<00:04:54.130> you<00:04:54.250> can<00:04:54.370> say<00:04:54.730> that<00:04:54.910> it<00:04:55.060> pronounced

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
but if you can say that it pronounced

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.470 
but if you can say that it pronounced
the<00:04:55.570> word<00:04:55.750> wrong<00:04:56.020> or<00:04:56.200> what<00:04:56.350> have<00:04:56.530> you<00:04:56.560> so<00:04:57.480> it's

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
the word wrong or what have you so it's

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.730 
the word wrong or what have you so it's
a<00:04:59.350> situation<00:04:59.770> where<00:05:00.810> one<00:05:01.810> week<00:05:02.050> should<00:05:02.440> do<00:05:02.590> it

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
a situation where one week should do it

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.220 
a situation where one week should do it
but<00:05:03.310> you<00:05:03.700> could<00:05:04.030> push<00:05:04.360> it<00:05:04.390> and<00:05:04.720> go<00:05:05.020> back

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
but you could push it and go back

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.020 
but you could push it and go back
earlier<00:05:05.620> I<00:05:05.830> would<00:05:06.130> definitely<00:05:06.760> not<00:05:06.970> recommend

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
earlier I would definitely not recommend

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.880 
earlier I would definitely not recommend
going<00:05:07.690> for<00:05:07.810> the<00:05:08.050> first<00:05:08.260> couple<00:05:08.530> days<00:05:08.560> though

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
going for the first couple days though

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:09.960 
going for the first couple days though
because<00:05:09.190> you're<00:05:09.340> going<00:05:09.430> to<00:05:09.490> have<00:05:09.640> swelling

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
because you're going to have swelling

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.450 
because you're going to have swelling
occurring<00:05:10.480> even<00:05:10.720> on<00:05:10.900> like<00:05:11.080> day<00:05:11.290> three<00:05:11.460> certain

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
occurring even on like day three certain

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.240 
occurring even on like day three certain
areas<00:05:12.850> of<00:05:13.060> your<00:05:13.390> cheeks<00:05:14.230> might<00:05:14.470> swell<00:05:14.770> or<00:05:15.100> your

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
areas of your cheeks might swell or your

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.680 
areas of your cheeks might swell or your
gums<00:05:16.950> but<00:05:17.950> I<00:05:18.160> think<00:05:18.460> that<00:05:18.670> if<00:05:19.000> you<00:05:19.390> give<00:05:19.540> it<00:05:19.630> a

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
gums but I think that if you give it a

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:20.940 
gums but I think that if you give it a
week<00:05:19.810> you'll<00:05:20.110> be<00:05:20.140> good<00:05:20.350> to<00:05:20.410> go<00:05:20.500> if<00:05:20.800> you<00:05:20.920> can

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
week you'll be good to go if you can

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.560 
week you'll be good to go if you can
take<00:05:21.280> a<00:05:21.310> week<00:05:21.520> take<00:05:22.060> it<00:05:22.210> and<00:05:24.240> you<00:05:25.240> know<00:05:25.360> let

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
take a week take it and you know let

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.570 
take a week take it and you know let
yourself<00:05:25.930> have<00:05:26.290> that<00:05:26.500> time<00:05:26.800> to<00:05:27.040> heal<00:05:27.340> and

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
yourself have that time to heal and

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.610 
yourself have that time to heal and
practice<00:05:28.060> with<00:05:28.330> your<00:05:28.600> new<00:05:28.930> teeth<00:05:29.170> and<00:05:29.500> your

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
practice with your new teeth and your

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.800 
practice with your new teeth and your
new<00:05:29.710> speech<00:05:30.070> and<00:05:30.460> oh<00:05:31.060> my<00:05:31.360> hair<00:05:31.510> looks<00:05:31.690> like

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
me and I could see it but those are my

me and I could see it but those are my
two<00:05:59.580> my<00:06:00.580> two<00:06:00.640> answers<00:06:00.940> -<00:06:01.750> when<00:06:02.350> can<00:06:02.530> I<00:06:02.560> go<00:06:02.740> back

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:02.890 
two my two answers - when can I go back

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.250 
two my two answers - when can I go back
to<00:06:03.010> work<00:06:03.130> and<00:06:03.340> when<00:06:04.090> can<00:06:04.419> I<00:06:04.570> speak<00:06:04.930> properly

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
to work and when can I speak properly

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.870 
to work and when can I speak properly
again<00:06:05.700> it's<00:06:06.700> not<00:06:06.940> nearly<00:06:07.240> as<00:06:08.580> troublesome<00:06:09.580> to

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
again it's not nearly as troublesome to

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.690 
again it's not nearly as troublesome to
speak<00:06:10.090> again<00:06:10.390> as<00:06:10.720> you<00:06:11.020> might<00:06:11.200> think

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:12.700 
speak again as you might think

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.820 
speak again as you might think
it<00:06:13.180> does<00:06:13.780> take<00:06:13.990> a<00:06:14.020> little<00:06:14.200> relearning<00:06:14.560> and<00:06:14.770> of

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
it does take a little relearning and of

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:15.810 
it does take a little relearning and of
course<00:06:15.040> some<00:06:15.220> people<00:06:15.250> are<00:06:15.520> going<00:06:15.610> to<00:06:15.700> have

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820 
course some people are going to have

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.730 
course some people are going to have
more<00:06:16.030> problems<00:06:16.180> than<00:06:16.540> others<00:06:16.990> because<00:06:17.200> they

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
more problems than others because they

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.930 
more problems than others because they
may<00:06:17.919> have<00:06:17.950> already<00:06:18.580> lost<00:06:18.820> a<00:06:19.030> lot<00:06:19.210> of<00:06:19.330> teeth

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
may have already lost a lot of teeth

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.220 
may have already lost a lot of teeth
and<00:06:20.030> be<00:06:20.870> used<00:06:21.140> to<00:06:21.260> speaking<00:06:22.990> differently<00:06:23.990> and

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.230 
and be used to speaking differently and

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:25.690 
and be used to speaking differently and
of<00:06:24.680> course<00:06:24.890> your<00:06:25.010> denture<00:06:25.250> is<00:06:25.340> not<00:06:25.460> going<00:06:25.640> to

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:25.700 
of course your denture is not going to

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.500 
of course your denture is not going to
fit<00:06:25.910> like<00:06:26.210> your<00:06:26.990> real<00:06:27.470> teeth<00:06:27.650> fit<00:06:28.010> so<00:06:28.400> you<00:06:28.880> will

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:29.510 
fit like your real teeth fit so you will

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.760 
fit like your real teeth fit so you will
have<00:06:29.750> a<00:06:29.780> little<00:06:29.960> trouble<00:06:30.320> with<00:06:30.350> your<00:06:30.560> tongue

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:30.770 
have a little trouble with your tongue

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.130 
have a little trouble with your tongue
but<00:06:31.340> overall<00:06:32.150> I<00:06:32.240> think<00:06:32.540> you<00:06:32.840> should<00:06:33.020> be

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:33.140 
but overall I think you should be

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.170 
but overall I think you should be
speaking<00:06:33.500> just<00:06:33.710> fine<00:06:33.950> almost<00:06:34.700> straight<00:06:35.000> out

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:35.180
