00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:49.980 
concealer on steroids it's like it's
crazy<00:01:48.759> this<00:01:49.149> has<00:01:49.389> more<00:01:49.569> of<00:01:49.630> a<00:01:49.749> runny

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
crazy this has more of a runny

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.539 
crazy this has more of a runny
consistency<00:01:50.200> but<00:01:50.920> it<00:01:50.979> has<00:01:51.099> a<00:01:51.130> really<00:01:51.310> nice

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
consistency but it has a really nice

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.459 
consistency but it has a really nice
coverage<00:01:52.090> and<00:01:52.329> then<00:01:52.479> this<00:01:52.749> one<00:01:52.810> is<00:01:52.990> more<00:01:53.289> of<00:01:53.409> a

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
coverage and then this one is more of a

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:55.559 
coverage and then this one is more of a
thick<00:01:53.709> consistency<00:01:53.889> and<00:01:54.609> the<00:01:54.670> coverage<00:01:55.299> on

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:55.569 
thick consistency and the coverage on

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:58.109 
thick consistency and the coverage on
this<00:01:55.869> is<00:01:56.139> like<00:01:56.439> in<00:01:56.649> 10<00:01:57.459> so<00:01:57.670> you<00:01:57.789> could<00:01:57.909> probably

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
this is like in 10 so you could probably

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.929 
this is like in 10 so you could probably
cover<00:01:58.479> up<00:01:58.689> tattoos<00:01:59.170> with<00:01:59.380> this<00:01:59.529> stuff<00:01:59.799> and<00:02:00.069> if

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
cover up tattoos with this stuff and if

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:02.459 
cover up tattoos with this stuff and if
i<00:02:01.090> use<00:02:01.299> this<00:02:01.450> by<00:02:01.630> itself<00:02:01.689> it<00:02:02.109> will<00:02:02.169> crease

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
i use this by itself it will crease

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:04.679 
i use this by itself it will crease
under<00:02:02.799> my<00:02:02.919> eyes<00:02:03.099> but<00:02:03.369> this<00:02:03.579> never<00:02:04.029> creases<00:02:04.569> on

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
under my eyes but this never creases on

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.899
