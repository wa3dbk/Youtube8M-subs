 find them pretty good after we have the 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.549
 lightning cable to connect charged 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.200

 now that I have you unpacking everything 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.719
 that I'm going to show you how that is 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.459
 pass during the first use 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:59.649
 so here I removed the films from 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:01.689
 protection I have no use and we 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.509
 will start it and with respect to the 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.619
 startup it's pretty fast but I 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.100
 still waiting for me an ignition a 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.100
 little bit faster 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.240
 here it is to him but we will 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.310
 unlock by doing a slide like 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.380
 this you will choose your language 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.660
 but first of all we will have to 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.970
 put our nano sim to activate your 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.740
 iphone you are obliged to have a 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.530
 anonymous to use this iphone 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.210
 you put it on and then you 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.340
 finally choose your language 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:49.630
 so I'll be French because I 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.840
 speak French after we will ask us 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:56.310
 to connect in wifi you go 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.310
 so choose your wifi 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:05.130
 afterwards we will join him and 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.090
 normally it should work 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.830
 this is our iphone is in the process of 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.050
 activate it takes a few seconds 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.520
 super fast after you can activate 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.680
 or disable localization 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.740
 I'm going to turn it off you can 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.709
 put a backup of your old 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.600
 iphone on this new iphone you 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.080
 can also identify you with your 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.690
 account 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.400
 apple me I will not do it you can 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.470
 well you are obliged to accept the 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.510
 general conditions and there you have to 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.220
 configure now touch heidi who 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.890
 is simply the new security 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.610
 on this new iphone then we do 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.470
 how it works 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.690
 we will simply put our finger 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.650
 on the button home we remove we put back 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.650
 step by step 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.860
 gold but the other or must over and over again 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.959
 we continue a little bit 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.290
 so basically it takes a few seconds 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.280
 a bridge configure child 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.410
 then we will be asked to 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:15.400
 put a code you will choose the one 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:16.329
 you want to be asked if 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.430
 you want to use siri 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.380
 then after if you send it 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.910
 diagnoses of your iphone and that's it 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.139

 but also in annotations every 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.020
 videos I would have done on the iphone 5 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.030
 is it so comparative tests 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.830

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.940

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.600
 fast as the iphone 5 is a whole 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.760
 new home button with a sensor 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.100
