00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.380
 at the beginning of the game many a book and that among the 18 or so soon 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.399
 Expression of astonishment 

00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:13.989
 Successful actions were obvious to the citizens in the dark 

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:17.400
 not trusted 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.439
 sometimes even the astonishment of the Gladbach followers changed 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.439
 provides 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.599
 very soon you do not have to worry about a 2 0 residue 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:32.319
 to do more 

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:35.319
 Borussia Mönchengladbach began 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.070
 was under continuous fire 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.820
 especially by Rainer Bonhof here with a lift 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.880
 a free kick by Bono 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.840
 and finally Brunotte with a shot in the short corner 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.229
 after ten minutes a turn 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.229
 we are a people led 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.220
 nice pass to play 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.220
 and Aland Simonsson 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.580
 half a year Munich remains 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.690
 to appease about shipping 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.440
 whose drove once again existed from another perspective 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.140
 Another Mönchengladbach player today is especially his five years 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.780
 limited 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.060
 but also Uli Stielike 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.840
 4 there the ball would have the 4 but then happened exactly in the angle 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.740
 this is back 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.400
 essential 

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:17.479
 After the change Funkel had the chance to hit the net 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:20.289
 here would have had to shoot 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:23.289
 he represents 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:31.659
 First leg 4 1 in Gladbach Kapsch and mouse with the creditors Stielike 

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:36.169
 Kuljic could have been substituted for this 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:38.309
 again Stielicke 

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:41.309
 Corner kick in the 60 minutes 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:43.899
 Stielike 

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:45.269
 Complain to Georgen 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.849
 at 13 o clock 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.849
 a shooting fair was actually turned on now 

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:53.489
 a beautiful flank from Wimmer 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.359
 for Geneva 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:57.169
 Free kick by Bohnhoff 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.449
 14 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:01.609
 the Uerdinger seemed exhausted 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:04.609
 offered almost no resistance 

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:09.810
 one minute later in the 73 minute 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.280
 Bono and wat cross Gampp scores his second goal 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.209
 unsustainable luck 

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:21.899
 second goal, on the other hand, must prevent profane today 

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:24.899
 the German champion for Vettel 6th 0th 

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:34.499
 the only goal for Uerdingen was three minutes before the game's end 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:36.319
 the shooter 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.319
 Leutner 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.200
 think about it again in the 1-6 defeat 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.699
 not his teammates before the comic 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:48.209
