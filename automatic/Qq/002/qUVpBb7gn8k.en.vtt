you know stuff like that so every day I

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.190 
you know stuff like that so every day I
wake<00:03:08.370> up<00:03:08.550> I<00:03:08.700> had<00:03:08.850> better<00:03:09.030> vision<00:03:09.300> then<00:03:09.600> I<00:03:09.810> did

two<00:03:10.350> years<00:03:10.500> ago<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:11.070> that<00:03:11.460> feeling<00:03:12.030> is<00:03:12.120> really

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
two years ago and that feeling is really

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.050
