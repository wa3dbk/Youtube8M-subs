00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:10.500
 Good morning today is the first day of the 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.000
 samsung fitnesscamp it is very early 16 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.139

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.380
 and how are we going about 46 for the first time? 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.840
 After that, go for yoga and then it will be today 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.180
 much more during the day 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.890
 Run and I'm very excited 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.830
 but now also very tired and happy 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.160
 Run me halfway down this whole way 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.800
 I do not mean a strong sport 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.140
 but I'm also curious and doing 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.260
 Now get ready and then it works 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.260
 Come on 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.670
 it is 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.250
 650 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.960
 56 very early and it rains 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.610
 but how do you say so beautiful there is no 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.989
 bad weather there are only bad ones 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:05.860
 clothes and the trade hopefully 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.860
 never go on and things are going so well here 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.990
 meanwhile it is 25 and after that 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.890
 have just warmed up a bit 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:34.920
 should go with these mountain ten times 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:39.710
 and also as fast as 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.710
 possible determines a great thing 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.110
 Washington 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.380
 O 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:25.500
 I am injured kilograms 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:31.620
 were also a company 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:37.450
 the last few years are over 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:42.960
 not least our winner Lukas Kawka 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:45.760
 will we be precise to the least, the 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.410
 then guilty with faith and we 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:56.650
 let it be very bad 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:57.280
 19 years equal to 20 wonderful too 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.550
 to decrease 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.430
 just such a beautiful landscape 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:06.820
 background clubs that was now the 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.640
 everyday the first half of samsung 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.880
 galaxy fitness ok we'll do it all 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.310
 really broken camp now we have to 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:20.380
 then we have to learn more 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:23.400
 run and then we look like it 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.500
 run home today 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.939
 if you do a lot of sports then you have to be good too 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.560
 eat and that's why we do now 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:34.290
 together the rocks 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.780
 together we all eat wonderfully 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.780
 for the next sports unit 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:48.239
 not necessarily and now 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.750
 that's enough 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.140
 on 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.050
 made 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.939
 and then if you have cured long enough 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:33.210
 then the whole thing is so 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:36.449
 GrÃ¼ner's movie is quite healthy with it 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:39.090
 then continue after this break 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:40.560
 can as i have mentioned and 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.310
 again between eight and ten 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.530
 kilometre 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.569
 Of course the people like me are the same 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.770
 not so much running in any case a 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:49.669
 quite a challenge though 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.669
 also here 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.120
 paul s 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.889
 and about the 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:41.030
 I would be official now 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:44.920
 exhausted with the program we are 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:49.730
 Now I'm finished today 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:55.270
 25,000 466 steps learned and gambled 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:57.800
 and ran at least according to the gfk and 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.340
 I have 24 kilometers behind me 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.240
 brought 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:04.010
 I cursed and cried 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.860
 not but I was already such a 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:09.080
 I have to say a little bit at my limit 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.050
 Run is not so mine but it 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.180
 was still a really great day we 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:17.150
 to be in nature in South Tyrol 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.280
 really good and I'm happy now 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.840
 at dinner the others here 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.950
 they are still doing that now 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.840
 a little bit of wellness that you can use the rems 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.440
 very good here's probably 13 or 16 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.300
 saunas 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.980
 I will, however, still one 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.900
 little work near there is something to 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.660
 eat and then I probably go 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:36.500
 very early in bed because tomorrow it is 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:38.690
 yes continue to do yoga and then 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.190
 At some point we go throwing 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.380
 I'm really looking forward to that 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:45.880
 I think I'm better than running that 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.880
 was the food of me good night
