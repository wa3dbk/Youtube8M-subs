some of the new features once it's blue
it<00:01:10.590> back<00:01:10.740> up<00:01:11.659> so<00:01:12.659> it's<00:01:12.869> gonna<00:01:13.049> do<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.320> thing

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
it back up so it's gonna do this thing

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:23.210 
it back up so it's gonna do this thing
and<00:01:14.000> restart<00:01:16.100> so<00:01:17.100> its<00:01:17.189> power<00:01:17.400> enough

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.390 

I<00:01:23.340> just<00:01:24.060> fast<00:01:24.330> food<00:01:24.570> from<00:01:24.980> frutos<00:01:25.980> if<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.220> takes

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
I just fast food from frutos if it takes

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:40.120 
I just fast food from frutos if it takes
long

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.740 

it's<00:01:40.729> taking<00:01:41.030> me<00:01:41.119> to<00:01:41.270> clockwork<00:01:41.509> recovery

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
it's taking me to clockwork recovery

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.660 
it's taking me to clockwork recovery
mode<00:01:42.229> I<00:01:42.380> think<00:01:42.649> that's<00:01:42.799> because<00:01:42.890> I'm<00:01:43.189> rude<00:01:43.399> i'm

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
mode I think that's because I'm rude i'm

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.819 
mode I think that's because I'm rude i'm
using<00:01:44.180> a<00:01:44.240> custom<00:01:44.420> recovery<00:01:44.960> that's<00:01:45.649> why<00:01:45.770> it

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
using a custom recovery that's why it

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:47.980 
using a custom recovery that's why it
looks<00:01:46.009> like<00:01:46.189> that<00:01:46.369> well<00:01:46.610> hopefully<00:01:47.450> should

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
looks like that well hopefully should

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.350 
looks like that well hopefully should
install<00:01:48.320> properly<00:01:48.680> I'm<00:01:49.130> hoping<00:01:52.270> should<00:01:53.270> have

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
install properly I'm hoping should have

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.690 
install properly I'm hoping should have
done<00:01:53.479> a<00:01:53.509> backup<00:01:53.899> I<00:01:54.049> did<00:01:54.259> of<00:01:54.380> God<00:01:54.590> oh<00:01:54.890> here<00:01:55.460> if<00:01:55.579> it

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
done a backup I did of God oh here if it

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.719 
done a backup I did of God oh here if it
runs<00:01:55.820> smoothly<00:01:56.950> this<00:01:57.950> process<00:01:58.220> is<00:01:58.579> a<00:01:58.610> little

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
runs smoothly this process is a little

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.850 
runs smoothly this process is a little
bit<00:01:59.060> different<00:01:59.420> from<00:01:59.569> if<00:01:59.990> you<00:02:00.140> have<00:02:00.289> unrooted

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
bit different from if you have unrooted

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.429 
bit different from if you have unrooted
nexus<00:02:01.189> 7<00:02:01.490> this<00:02:01.549> process<00:02:01.939> will<00:02:02.090> be<00:02:02.270> a<00:02:02.539> lot

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
nexus 7 this process will be a lot

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.139 
nexus 7 this process will be a lot
smoother<00:02:03.920> and<00:02:04.009> a<00:02:04.069> bit<00:02:04.220> different<00:02:04.579> cuz<00:02:04.850> im<00:02:04.970> rude

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
smoother and a bit different cuz im rude

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.589 
smoother and a bit different cuz im rude
i'm<00:02:05.450> using<00:02:05.780> a<00:02:05.899> custom<00:02:06.350> recovery<00:02:07.039> and<00:02:07.420> all<00:02:08.420> of

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
i'm using a custom recovery and all of

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.270 
i'm using a custom recovery and all of
that<00:02:08.630> stuff<00:02:08.840> is<00:02:09.170> gonna<00:02:09.349> be<00:02:09.590> slightly

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
that stuff is gonna be slightly

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.250 
that stuff is gonna be slightly
different<00:02:10.519> and<00:02:10.849> i'm<00:02:10.910> hoping<00:02:11.150> your<00:02:11.420> work<00:02:11.660> just

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
different and i'm hoping your work just

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.960 
different and i'm hoping your work just
right<00:02:14.709> and<00:02:15.709> if<00:02:15.860> i<00:02:15.980> do<00:02:16.040> is<00:02:16.250> lose<00:02:16.430> you<00:02:16.670> i<00:02:16.700> could

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970

new<00:03:16.040> features<00:03:17.000> in<00:03:17.450> their<00:03:18.130> first<00:03:19.130> one<00:03:19.310> we<00:03:19.549> take

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
new features in their first one we take

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.640 
new features in their first one we take
a<00:03:19.730> look<00:03:19.940> at<00:03:20.120> his<00:03:20.299> landscape<00:03:21.079> mode<00:03:21.260> which<00:03:21.500> has

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
a look at his landscape mode which has

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.809 
a look at his landscape mode which has
now<00:03:21.799> been<00:03:21.980> enabled<00:03:22.400> in<00:03:22.549> the<00:03:24.459> operating<00:03:25.459> system

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
now been enabled in the operating system

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:27.340 
now been enabled in the operating system
so<00:03:26.000> you<00:03:26.090> can<00:03:26.120> now<00:03:26.420> use<00:03:26.450> it<00:03:26.660> in<00:03:26.900> landscape<00:03:27.079> mode

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
so you can now use it in landscape mode

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.160 
so you can now use it in landscape mode
and<00:03:27.560> what<00:03:28.220> they've<00:03:28.370> done<00:03:28.639> is<00:03:28.970> it<00:03:29.540> for<00:03:29.780> google

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
and what they've done is it for google

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.930 
and what they've done is it for google
now<00:03:30.290> here<00:03:30.560> so<00:03:30.799> when<00:03:31.069> your<00:03:31.190> landscape<00:03:31.639> mode<00:03:31.790> is

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
now here so when your landscape mode is

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.569 
now here so when your landscape mode is
much<00:03:32.150> easier<00:03:32.180> to<00:03:32.630> access<00:03:33.500> google<00:03:34.160> now<00:03:34.250> just<00:03:34.459> by

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
much easier to access google now just by

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:35.979 
much easier to access google now just by
tapping<00:03:34.639> on<00:03:35.060> it<00:03:35.209> and<00:03:35.359> it<00:03:35.450> takes<00:03:35.660> you<00:03:35.780> straight

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
tapping on it and it takes you straight

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.229 
tapping on it and it takes you straight
into<00:03:36.200> it<00:03:36.380> but<00:03:36.950> unfortunately<00:03:37.310> Google<00:03:37.970> now

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
into it but unfortunately Google now

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.420 
into it but unfortunately Google now
doesn't<00:03:38.599> actually<00:03:38.720> go<00:03:38.989> in<00:03:39.139> landscape<00:03:40.099> mode<00:03:40.130> as

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
doesn't actually go in landscape mode as

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.240 
doesn't actually go in landscape mode as
well<00:03:40.459> so<00:03:40.819> yeah<00:03:41.720> that's<00:03:42.440> how<00:03:42.620> that's<00:03:42.889> how<00:03:43.040> I'm
