a<00:01:39.689> little<00:01:39.720> bit<00:01:39.960> deal<00:01:40.079> go<00:01:40.200> do<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.590> then<00:01:41.250> your

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
a little bit deal go do it and then your

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.609 
a little bit deal go do it and then your
body<00:01:41.700> can<00:01:41.759> adapt<00:01:42.180> more<00:01:42.479> give<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.229> stimulus

sugar ready to roll
so<00:01:47.340> here<00:01:47.490> enchanter<00:01:47.909> very<00:01:48.060> Thailand<00:01:48.570> and

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
so here enchanter very Thailand and

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.109 
so here enchanter very Thailand and
they're<00:01:50.310> doing<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.549> little<00:01:50.759> it's<00:01:50.909> called<00:01:51.060> the

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
they're doing a little it's called the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.990 
they're doing a little it's called the
lake<00:01:51.299> loop<00:01:51.979> run<00:01:52.979> along<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.310> lake<00:01:53.490> check<00:01:53.909> it

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
lake loop run along the lake check it

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.990 
lake loop run along the lake check it
out

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.230 

so<00:01:57.510> this<00:01:57.630> goes<00:01:57.810> around<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.140> lake<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:59.240> good

so this goes around the lake and good

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.040 
so this goes around the lake and good
