because<00:00:05.170> this<00:00:05.319> is<00:00:05.470> part<00:00:05.740> three<00:00:06.130> of<00:00:07.000> oxidative

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:07.630 
because this is part three of oxidative

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.539 
because this is part three of oxidative
phosphorylation<00:00:07.870> so<00:00:08.830> you<00:00:08.889> need<00:00:09.070> to<00:00:09.190> watch<00:00:09.370> the

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:09.549 
phosphorylation so you need to watch the

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:11.970 
phosphorylation so you need to watch the
first<00:00:09.730> two<00:00:10.030> of<00:00:10.330> these<00:00:10.660> videos<00:00:11.020> really<00:00:11.289> so<00:00:11.860> we

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:11.980 
first two of these videos really so we

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.180 
first two of these videos really so we
got<00:00:12.250> to<00:00:12.369> this<00:00:12.459> point<00:00:12.700> where<00:00:12.969> we<00:00:13.059> said<00:00:13.270> that

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
got to this point where we said that

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.279 
got to this point where we said that
hydrogen<00:00:15.190> ions<00:00:15.850> protons<00:00:16.750> are<00:00:17.020> being<00:00:17.080> pumped

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:17.289 
hydrogen ions protons are being pumped

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.490 
hydrogen ions protons are being pumped
through<00:00:17.650> from<00:00:18.280> the<00:00:18.990> where<00:00:19.990> it's<00:00:20.109> been<00:00:20.230> picture

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
through from the where it's been picture

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.470 
through from the where it's been picture
for<00:00:20.619> the<00:00:20.679> reduced<00:00:20.980> nad<00:00:21.160> you<00:00:21.730> get<00:00:21.939> split<00:00:22.269> and

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
for the reduced nad you get split and

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.570 
for the reduced nad you get split and
it's<00:00:22.599> pumped<00:00:23.349> through<00:00:23.619> into<00:00:24.070> this<00:00:24.160> inter

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
it's pumped through into this inter

it's pumped through into this inter
membrane<00:00:24.970> space<00:00:25.000> how<00:00:25.869> do<00:00:25.929> we<00:00:26.080> pump<00:00:26.320> it<00:00:26.470> through

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
membrane space how do we pump it through

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.550 
membrane space how do we pump it through
we<00:00:27.279> use<00:00:27.519> electrons<00:00:28.300> or<00:00:28.810> the<00:00:29.019> energy<00:00:29.169> from

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
we use electrons or the energy from

Morris<00:00:43.480> is<00:00:43.660> so<00:00:43.750> effective<00:00:44.550> we've<00:00:45.550> got<00:00:45.850> to

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
Morris is so effective we've got to

Morris is so effective we've got to
build<00:00:46.150> up<00:00:46.330> a<00:00:46.450> nice<00:00:46.690> big<00:00:47.020> supply<00:00:47.230> of<00:00:47.470> hydrogens

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
build up a nice big supply of hydrogens

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.370 
build up a nice big supply of hydrogens
on<00:00:48.220> one<00:00:48.400> side<00:00:48.640> in<00:00:48.790> the<00:00:48.880> intermembrane<00:00:49.180> space

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.380 
on one side in the intermembrane space

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.470 
on one side in the intermembrane space
which<00:00:50.380> is<00:00:50.740> building<00:00:51.610> up<00:00:51.760> a<00:00:51.850> concentration

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
which is building up a concentration

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.120 
which is building up a concentration
gradient<00:00:52.660> there's<00:00:53.080> more<00:00:53.230> hydrogen<00:00:53.710> here<00:00:53.950> than

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
gradient there's more hydrogen here than

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.120 
gradient there's more hydrogen here than
there<00:00:54.250> is<00:00:54.280> on<00:00:54.460> this<00:00:54.580> side<00:00:54.820> so<00:00:55.360> by<00:00:55.540> diffusion<00:00:56.130> we

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.130 
there is on this side so by diffusion we

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.650 
there is on this side so by diffusion we
would<00:00:57.280> expect<00:00:57.520> the<00:00:57.670> hydrogens<00:00:58.030> to<00:00:58.150> be<00:00:58.240> mover

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
would expect the hydrogens to be mover

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.590 
would expect the hydrogens to be mover
to<00:00:59.140> move<00:00:59.320> that<00:00:59.500> way<00:00:59.650> back<00:00:59.890> through<00:01:00.450> it's<00:01:01.450> also

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
to move that way back through it's also

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.960 
to move that way back through it's also
building<00:01:01.900> up<00:01:02.050> an<00:01:02.260> electro<00:01:02.800> chemical<00:01:02.830> at<00:01:03.700> that

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
building up an electro chemical at that

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.840 
building up an electro chemical at that
sorry<00:01:04.299> electrical<00:01:04.989> potential<00:01:05.799> there's<00:01:06.520> a<00:01:06.610> lot

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
sorry electrical potential there's a lot

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.350 
sorry electrical potential there's a lot
of<00:01:07.030> charged<00:01:07.450> particles<00:01:08.110> here<00:01:08.580> okay<00:01:09.610> lots<00:01:10.270> and

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
of charged particles here okay lots and

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.990 
of charged particles here okay lots and
lots<00:01:10.450> of<00:01:10.600> charged<00:01:10.840> particles<00:01:11.020> and<00:01:11.940> you<00:01:12.940> know

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
lots of charged particles and you know

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.310 
lots of charged particles and you know
think<00:01:13.240> of<00:01:13.300> it<00:01:13.390> think<00:01:13.600> of<00:01:13.750> like<00:01:13.870> lightning

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
think of it think of like lightning

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.930 
think of it think of like lightning
lightning<00:01:14.620> works<00:01:15.040> by<00:01:15.280> having<00:01:15.400> a<00:01:15.550> buildup<00:01:15.850> of

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
lightning works by having a buildup of

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.149 
lightning works by having a buildup of
charged<00:01:16.270> particles<00:01:16.450> in<00:01:16.870> a<00:01:17.170> cloud<00:01:17.410> and<00:01:17.860> when<00:01:18.100> it

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
charged particles in a cloud and when it

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.370 
charged particles in a cloud and when it
builds<00:01:18.460> up<00:01:18.550> high<00:01:18.760> enough<00:01:19.000> that<00:01:19.060> energy<00:01:19.720> is

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
builds up high enough that energy is

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.710 
builds up high enough that energy is
released<00:01:20.670> comes<00:01:21.670> to<00:01:21.760> the<00:01:21.820> ground<00:01:22.030> what<00:01:22.510> doing

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
released comes to the ground what doing

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.300 
released comes to the ground what doing
the<00:01:22.810> same<00:01:23.050> thing<00:01:23.260> here<00:01:23.470> it's<00:01:23.650> not<00:01:23.800> lightning

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
the same thing here it's not lightning

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.710 
the same thing here it's not lightning
strike<00:01:24.580> but<00:01:24.790> we're<00:01:25.150> using<00:01:25.300> the<00:01:25.450> same

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
strike but we're using the same

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.780 
strike but we're using the same
principle<00:01:26.650> that<00:01:26.770> we're<00:01:27.159> building<00:01:27.580> up<00:01:27.640> a<00:01:27.760> lot

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
principle that we're building up a lot

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.330 
principle that we're building up a lot
of<00:01:27.909> charges<00:01:28.330> here<00:01:28.750> as<00:01:28.870> well<00:01:29.050> so<00:01:29.680> there's<00:01:30.250> the

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
of charges here as well so there's the

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.800 
of charges here as well so there's the
two<00:01:30.520> things<00:01:30.790> and<00:01:30.909> we<00:01:31.030> in<00:01:31.150> fact<00:01:31.330> we<00:01:31.420> call<00:01:31.600> it<00:01:31.750> an

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
two things and we in fact we call it an

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.510 
two things and we in fact we call it an
electrochemical<00:01:32.500> gradient<00:01:33.159> because<00:01:33.370> it's

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
electrochemical gradient because it's

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.190 
electrochemical gradient because it's
electrical<00:01:34.420> gradient<00:01:34.750> and<00:01:34.870> a<00:01:34.930> chemical

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
electrical gradient and a chemical

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.490 
electrical gradient and a chemical
gradient<00:01:35.590> now<00:01:36.310> come<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.270> hydrogen<00:01:37.870> ions<00:01:38.260> come

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
gradient now come the hydrogen ions come

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.780 
gradient now come the hydrogen ions come
the<00:01:38.560> proteins<00:01:38.950> get<00:01:39.130> through<00:01:39.340> the<00:01:39.460> membrane

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
the proteins get through the membrane

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.649 
the proteins get through the membrane
now<00:01:40.390> they<00:01:40.510> can<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.850> know<00:01:42.940> the<00:01:43.060> membrane<00:01:43.570> is

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
now they can you know the membrane is

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.840 
now they can you know the membrane is
pretty<00:01:43.990> much<00:01:44.140> impermeable<00:01:44.770> some<00:01:45.159> does<00:01:45.549> leak

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
pretty much impermeable some does leak

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.539 
pretty much impermeable some does leak
through<00:01:46.150> little<00:01:47.049> bits<00:01:47.260> of<00:01:47.440> hydrogen<00:01:47.950> leak

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
through little bits of hydrogen leak

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.240 
through little bits of hydrogen leak
back<00:01:48.790> through<00:01:49.350> sorry<00:01:50.350> little<00:01:50.650> hydrogen<00:01:50.979> bits

back through sorry little hydrogen bits

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.800 
back through sorry little hydrogen bits
which<00:01:51.610> are<00:01:51.729> generally<00:01:52.210> factor<00:01:52.600> and<00:01:52.720> that's

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
which are generally factor and that's

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.830 
which are generally factor and that's
one<00:01:53.020> of<00:01:53.049> the<00:01:53.170> reasons<00:01:53.530> why<00:01:54.840> oxidative

put<00:03:59.480> it<00:03:59.570> like<00:03:59.890> this

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.949 

okay<00:04:06.400> and<00:04:07.000> if<00:04:07.120> you<00:04:07.209> think<00:04:07.420> about<00:04:07.510> well<00:04:07.840> it

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
okay and if you think about well it

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.569 
okay and if you think about well it
doesn't<00:04:08.140> particularly<00:04:08.680> balance<00:04:09.189> out<00:04:09.370> down

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
doesn't particularly balance out down

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.280 
doesn't particularly balance out down
here<00:04:09.760> don't<00:04:10.450> worry<00:04:10.659> about<00:04:10.780> it

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
here don't worry about it

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.020 
here don't worry about it
there's<00:04:11.560> lots<00:04:11.739> of<00:04:11.890> hydrogens<00:04:12.370> appear<00:04:12.730> there's

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
there's lots of hydrogens appear there's

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.970 
there's lots of hydrogens appear there's
lots<00:04:13.209> of<00:04:13.329> hydrogens<00:04:13.719> here<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:14.500> whole<00:04:14.709> thing

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
lots of hydrogens here the whole thing

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:15.780 
lots of hydrogens here the whole thing
is<00:04:15.099> moving<00:04:15.219> along

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
is moving along

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.120 
is moving along
it<00:04:16.030> doesn't<00:04:16.479> need<00:04:16.690> you<00:04:17.530> don't<00:04:17.650> need<00:04:17.769> to

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
it doesn't need you don't need to

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.610 
it doesn't need you don't need to
balance<00:04:18.370> it<00:04:18.789> in<00:04:19.120> these<00:04:19.930> kind<00:04:20.199> of<00:04:20.229> drawings

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
balance it in these kind of drawings

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.810 
balance it in these kind of drawings
okay<00:04:20.979> if<00:04:21.070> you<00:04:21.190> want<00:04:21.340> to<00:04:21.400> balance<00:04:21.549> your

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
okay if you want to balance your

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.460 
okay if you want to balance your
equations<00:04:22.240> there<00:04:22.360> you<00:04:22.449> come<00:04:22.600> so<00:04:23.050> the<00:04:23.169> option

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
equations there you come so the option

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.189 
equations there you come so the option
is<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:23.680> final<00:04:24.070> hydrogen<00:04:24.490> acceptor<00:04:24.759> a<00:04:25.570> little

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:26.199 
is the final hydrogen acceptor a little

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.890 
is the final hydrogen acceptor a little
point<00:04:26.410> hearing<00:04:26.889> in<00:04:27.130> your<00:04:27.280> textbook<00:04:27.720> not<00:04:28.720> since

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.400 
point hearing in your textbook not since
again<00:04:29.050> a<00:04:29.169> very<00:04:29.350> messy<00:04:29.590> bit<00:04:29.830> but<00:04:30.720> on<00:04:31.720> page<00:04:31.960> 90

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
again a very messy bit but on page 90

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.020 
again a very messy bit but on page 90
there's<00:04:32.560> a<00:04:32.590> definition<00:04:33.039> it<00:04:33.310> says<00:04:33.340> oxidative

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
there's a definition it says oxidative

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.719 
there's a definition it says oxidative
phosphorylation<00:04:35.070> it's<00:04:36.070> about<00:04:36.220> the<00:04:36.370> formation

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
phosphorylation it's about the formation

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.290 
phosphorylation it's about the formation
of<00:04:36.970> ATP<00:04:37.440> yep<00:04:38.440> we'll<00:04:38.590> make<00:04:38.770> an<00:04:38.919> ATP<00:04:39.430> by<00:04:40.000> adding

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
of ATP yep we'll make an ATP by adding

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.230 
of ATP yep we'll make an ATP by adding
phosphate<00:04:40.720> to<00:04:41.259> ADP<00:04:41.289> yeah<00:04:41.860> and<00:04:42.550> it<00:04:42.849> says<00:04:42.970> in<00:04:43.150> the

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
phosphate to ADP yeah and it says in the

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.270 
phosphate to ADP yeah and it says in the
presence<00:04:43.660> of<00:04:43.750> oxygen<00:04:43.900> now<00:04:44.530> that's<00:04:44.860> fine

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
presence of oxygen now that's fine

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.070 
presence of oxygen now that's fine
because<00:04:45.639> the<00:04:46.090> option<00:04:46.389> has<00:04:46.660> to<00:04:46.780> be<00:04:46.870> there<00:04:47.050> to

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
because the option has to be there to

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.170 
because the option has to be there to
pick<00:04:47.320> up<00:04:47.470> the<00:04:47.500> Hodgins<00:04:47.949> and<00:04:48.460> the<00:04:48.789> off<00:04:48.910> turns<00:04:49.120> at

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
pick up the Hodgins and the off turns at

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.029 
pick up the Hodgins and the off turns at
the<00:04:49.240> end<00:04:49.360> but<00:04:49.870> I<00:04:49.930> think<00:04:50.139> it<00:04:50.289> suggests<00:04:50.680> that<00:04:50.800> the

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
the end but I think it suggests that the

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.999 
the end but I think it suggests that the
oxygen<00:04:51.669> has<00:04:52.000> to<00:04:52.150> be<00:04:52.180> there<00:04:52.449> as<00:04:52.750> part<00:04:53.740> of<00:04:53.860> the

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:54.009 
oxygen has to be there as part of the

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:55.830 
oxygen has to be there as part of the
oxidative<00:04:54.580> phosphorylation<00:04:54.699> process<00:04:55.330> here

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
oxidative phosphorylation process here

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.469 
oxidative phosphorylation process here
and<00:04:56.259> it<00:04:56.380> doesn't<00:04:56.949> and<00:04:57.759> this<00:04:58.000> comes<00:04:58.240> back<00:04:58.330> to

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
and it doesn't and this comes back to

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.779 
and it doesn't and this comes back to
the<00:04:58.750> first<00:04:59.139> video<00:04:59.380> I<00:04:59.530> showed<00:04:59.740> you<00:04:59.789> remember

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
the first video I showed you remember

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:01.920 
the first video I showed you remember
these<00:05:00.940> electrons<00:05:01.539> as<00:05:01.690> they're<00:05:01.840> getting

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
these electrons as they're getting

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.680 
these electrons as they're getting
passed<00:05:02.289> along<00:05:02.530> if<00:05:02.770> you<00:05:02.800> gain<00:05:03.250> electrons

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
passed along if you gain electrons

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.390 
passed along if you gain electrons
you've<00:05:04.690> been<00:05:04.930> reduced<00:05:05.259> reduction<00:05:06.070> is<00:05:06.160> gain

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
you've been reduced reduction is gain

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.670 
you've been reduced reduction is gain
reductions<00:05:07.060> gain<00:05:07.300> reduction<00:05:07.449> again<00:05:07.810> but<00:05:08.560> as

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
reductions gain reduction again but as

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.230 
reductions gain reduction again but as
you<00:05:08.800> pass<00:05:09.039> them<00:05:09.220> on<00:05:09.370> that's<00:05:09.760> now<00:05:09.970> lost

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
you pass them on that's now lost

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.430 
you pass them on that's now lost
electrons<00:05:10.780> so<00:05:10.930> it's<00:05:11.050> become<00:05:11.490> oxidized<00:05:12.490> that

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
electrons so it's become oxidized that

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.570 
electrons so it's become oxidized that
becomes<00:05:14.440> reduced<00:05:14.680> that<00:05:14.919> becomes<00:05:15.190> oxidized

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
becomes reduced that becomes oxidized

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.860 
becomes reduced that becomes oxidized
that<00:05:15.880> becomes<00:05:16.180> reduced<00:05:16.389> that<00:05:16.630> becomes

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
that becomes reduced that becomes

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.899 
that becomes reduced that becomes
subside<00:05:17.199> reduced<00:05:17.560> oxidized<00:05:18.070> and<00:05:18.250> so<00:05:18.789> you've

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:18.909 
subside reduced oxidized and so you've

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:22.110 
subside reduced oxidized and so you've
got<00:05:19.030> a<00:05:19.060> continual<00:05:19.870> chain<00:05:20.199> of<00:05:20.470> these<00:05:21.120> complexes

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
got a continual chain of these complexes

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.870 
got a continual chain of these complexes
becoming<00:05:22.539> reduced<00:05:23.139> and<00:05:23.409> oxidized<00:05:24.070> and<00:05:24.400> it's

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
becoming reduced and oxidized and it's

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.240 
becoming reduced and oxidized and it's
that's<00:05:25.240> that's<00:05:26.139> your<00:05:26.409> like<00:05:26.530> where<00:05:26.800> the<00:05:26.919> energy

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
that's that's your like where the energy

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.500 
that's that's your like where the energy
is<00:05:27.280> coming<00:05:27.430> from<00:05:27.550> this<00:05:27.820> that's<00:05:28.120> why<00:05:28.360> it's

is coming from this that's why it's

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.240 
is coming from this that's why it's
called<00:05:28.690> oxidative<00:05:29.229> phosphorylation<00:05:29.560> and

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250

to<00:05:59.380> a<00:05:59.409> lower<00:05:59.680> electrochemical<00:06:00.580> concentration

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
to a lower electrochemical concentration

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.659 
to a lower electrochemical concentration
and<00:06:02.259> the<00:06:03.039> proton<00:06:03.520> motive<00:06:03.729> force

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:11.619 

which<00:06:07.669> is<00:06:08.259> really<00:06:09.259> the<00:06:09.499> idea<00:06:09.829> of<00:06:10.479> it's<00:06:11.479> the

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:11.629 
which is really the idea of it's the

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:14.469 
which is really the idea of it's the
force<00:06:11.929> provided<00:06:12.529> by<00:06:12.559> these<00:06:13.239> hydrogen<00:06:14.239> ions

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 
force provided by these hydrogen ions

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:15.939 
force provided by these hydrogen ions
coming<00:06:14.659> through<00:06:14.809> that's<00:06:15.109> where<00:06:15.439> the<00:06:15.559> energy

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:15.949 
coming through that's where the energy

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:20.469 
coming through that's where the energy
comes<00:06:16.189> from<00:06:18.039> rather<00:06:19.039> like<00:06:19.309> if<00:06:19.519> you<00:06:20.179> took<00:06:20.419> a

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 
comes from rather like if you took a

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:22.929 
comes from rather like if you took a
load<00:06:20.779> of<00:06:20.929> pails<00:06:21.319> of<00:06:21.499> water<00:06:21.939> like

00:06:22.929 --> 00:06:22.939 
load of pails of water like

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:24.759 
load of pails of water like
jack-and-jill<00:06:23.209> to<00:06:23.659> the<00:06:23.719> top<00:06:23.899> of<00:06:23.989> the<00:06:24.049> hill<00:06:24.229> and

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:24.769 
jack-and-jill to the top of the hill and

00:06:24.769 --> 00:06:27.699 
jack-and-jill to the top of the hill and
then<00:06:25.069> you<00:06:25.219> poured<00:06:25.489> them<00:06:25.669> down<00:06:26.379> there's<00:06:27.379> Jill

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:27.709 
then you poured them down there's Jill

00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:29.979 
then you poured them down there's Jill
or<00:06:27.859> Jack<00:06:28.099> isn't<00:06:28.309> man<00:06:28.519> whom<00:06:28.729> it<00:06:29.599> requires

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:29.989 
or Jack isn't man whom it requires

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:31.719 
or Jack isn't man whom it requires
energy<00:06:30.169> to<00:06:30.409> get<00:06:30.679> them<00:06:30.799> up<00:06:30.919> there<00:06:31.129> you<00:06:31.369> get<00:06:31.669> your

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:31.729 
energy to get them up there you get your

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:33.399 
energy to get them up there you get your
water<00:06:31.909> up<00:06:32.119> there<00:06:32.269> but<00:06:32.479> then<00:06:32.629> you<00:06:32.809> can<00:06:33.019> make<00:06:33.229> use

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:33.409 
water up there but then you can make use

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:34.809 
water up there but then you can make use
that<00:06:33.589> energy<00:06:33.739> by<00:06:33.979> pouring<00:06:34.339> it<00:06:34.429> down<00:06:34.579> perhaps

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:34.819 
that energy by pouring it down perhaps

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:36.519 
that energy by pouring it down perhaps
onto<00:06:35.239> some<00:06:35.419> kind<00:06:35.449> of<00:06:35.689> water<00:06:35.899> wheel

00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:36.529 
onto some kind of water wheel

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:38.709 
onto some kind of water wheel
there<00:06:37.069> we<00:06:37.159> go<00:06:37.339> that<00:06:37.519> spin<00:06:37.789> drowns<00:06:38.059> you'd<00:06:38.299> pour

00:06:38.709 --> 00:06:38.719 
there we go that spin drowns you'd pour

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:40.419 
there we go that spin drowns you'd pour
it<00:06:38.869> down<00:06:38.989> which<00:06:39.559> I've<00:06:39.709> just<00:06:39.859> realized<00:06:40.219> sorry

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:40.429 
it down which I've just realized sorry

00:06:40.429 --> 00:06:41.499 
it down which I've just realized sorry
you<00:06:40.519> can't<00:06:40.699> see<00:06:40.849> what<00:06:40.999> you're<00:06:41.119> covering

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:41.509 
you can't see what you're covering

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:43.359 
you can't see what you're covering
epsilon<00:06:41.959> will<00:06:42.169> destroy<00:06:42.469> there<00:06:43.039> we<00:06:43.099> go

00:06:43.359 --> 00:06:43.369 
epsilon will destroy there we go

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:45.879 
epsilon will destroy there we go
there's<00:06:43.699> jack<00:06:43.909> or<00:06:44.089> Jill<00:06:44.439> using<00:06:45.439> energy<00:06:45.679> to<00:06:45.769> go

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:45.889 
there's jack or Jill using energy to go

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:47.649 
there's jack or Jill using energy to go
to<00:06:45.949> the<00:06:46.039> top<00:06:46.189> of<00:06:46.279> the<00:06:46.339> hill<00:06:46.489> pouring<00:06:47.419> the<00:06:47.509> water

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:47.659 
to the top of the hill pouring the water

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:50.259 
to the top of the hill pouring the water
back<00:06:47.989> down<00:06:48.199> and<00:06:49.189> it's<00:06:49.549> the<00:06:49.669> same<00:06:49.909> idea<00:06:50.059> it's

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:50.269 
back down and it's the same idea it's

00:06:50.269 --> 00:06:52.209 
back down and it's the same idea it's
the<00:06:50.329> same<00:06:50.539> principle<00:06:51.109> here<00:06:51.349> it's<00:06:51.979> about

00:06:52.209 --> 00:06:52.219 
the same principle here it's about

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:54.699 
the same principle here it's about
taking<00:06:52.879> energy<00:06:53.449> potential<00:06:54.109> energy<00:06:54.169> from<00:06:54.529> one

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:54.709 
taking energy potential energy from one

00:06:54.709 --> 00:06:56.229 
taking energy potential energy from one
place<00:06:54.739> putting<00:06:55.369> it<00:06:55.549> somewhere<00:06:55.609> else<00:06:55.879> so<00:06:56.209> you

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:56.239 
place putting it somewhere else so you

00:06:56.239 --> 00:07:00.069 
place putting it somewhere else so you
can<00:06:56.419> use<00:06:56.689> it<00:06:57.999> to<00:06:58.999> do<00:06:59.209> what<00:06:59.389> you<00:06:59.539> want<00:06:59.749> it<00:06:59.899> to<00:06:59.989> do

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:00.079 
can use it to do what you want it to do

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:03.789 
can use it to do what you want it to do
which<00:07:00.259> in<00:07:00.409> this<00:07:00.529> case<00:07:00.769> is<00:07:01.309> to<00:07:01.489> make<00:07:01.669> ATP<00:07:02.799> yeah

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:03.799 
which in this case is to make ATP yeah

00:07:03.799 --> 00:07:06.069 
which in this case is to make ATP yeah
I'm<00:07:04.729> not<00:07:04.969> sure<00:07:04.999> if<00:07:05.269> particularly

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:06.079 
I'm not sure if particularly

00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:07.929 
I'm not sure if particularly
made<00:07:06.949> things<00:07:07.219> clear<00:07:07.399> with<00:07:07.609> these<00:07:07.729> three

00:07:07.929 --> 00:07:07.939 
made things clear with these three

00:07:07.939 --> 00:07:09.159 
made things clear with these three
videos<00:07:08.029> but<00:07:08.359> we'll<00:07:08.479> see<00:07:08.599> how<00:07:08.749> with<00:07:08.869> this<00:07:08.929> girl

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:09.169 
videos but we'll see how with this girl

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:12.999 
videos but we'll see how with this girl
Seifer<00:07:09.559> see<00:07:10.219> if<00:07:10.279> it<00:07:10.369> makes<00:07:10.549> sense<00:07:10.610> to<00:07:10.879> people
