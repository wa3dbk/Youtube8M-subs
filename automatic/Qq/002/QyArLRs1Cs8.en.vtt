00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.420
 hello girls I find you in 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.090
 a new video so it will be for 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:26.519
 so show you a tutorial so for 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:29.429
 make a Christmas bonnet so the 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.529
 Santa's hat or whatever so 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:39.530
 For this you will need not to 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:42.059
 fimo soft paste number 24 red Indian 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:50.489
 you're going to need some nice pat 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:55.730
 soft white zero number of what you 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:58.050
 you serve knife knife scalpel etc 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.850
 this is needed so I say I'm going 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.140
 use that with a pointed toe 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.640
 but with a toothpick it works too 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.129
 good because I have 7 years of work 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.650
 but if you have if you do not have a 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.040
 toothpick will be fine and if you 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:16.430
 want to go up as you then 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.810
 so take either a python or a tv or 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.200
 a flat-headed nail that you form the 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.580
 loop as you want so in a 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.460
 first time you will come take 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.950
 your little piece of dough 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.810
 red you have come to form a ball 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:39.810
 giant and flatten this in fact you 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:41.280
 have trained as akon in fact right now 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.020
 that the code typed very loudly but you 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.369
 come on take it so you go the side 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.570
 flat and so you're going to come rolled it 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:51.720
 like this has been sacked the camera 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:55.290
 you have to ride for precisely 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.290
 given this form so you attend 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.860
 of course the tip what will give the 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.100
 shape of the cap no we try 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.850
 to equalize and received touzet and come 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.890
 shoot like this so the beautiful here is you 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.010
 pull the little end and in fact you 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.160
 come on hop the curvet like these 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.470
 so stupid so if you think that the 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.880
 end is too thin where you come their 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.010
 do like these and you come on 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.890
 curvature simply 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.640
 so here is the sequel you come 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.799
 work the code simply 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.560
 so you put it to one side 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:40.650
 then you take your white that you 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.030
 come and form a sausage so regular 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.880
 so be you the format the hand on 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.530
 you put it in your game more 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.060
 what's it called but it's a number 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.410
 I do not have any then so you take 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.350
 your creation 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:59.489
 you come to flatten a little bit the 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.230
 edges of your body you can come 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:07.230
 what I'm doing is that I'm from 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:09.329
 to pass that's how this is so you 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.299
 let's alert take your blood sausage and you 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:15.410
 will come the meter around your 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.410
 red code 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.640
 here you cut off then mandeure 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.720
 wish I hurry because I 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.950
 see that I have a lot of batteries 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:29.519
 and I'm afraid his cut 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:33.420
 so that's so that gives you that so 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:35.930
 you try two closed for easter 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:42.260
 we see the junction of the mill 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:43.879
 and so with your road vote actually 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.939
 you will come scrape to do this 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:49.400
 effect you see on lot of you buying 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:51.620
 this sparkling effect actually like the 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.569
 like cotton actually on the real 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.500
 one and so I do it and I you 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:04:02.180
 found immediately after that so me 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:06.109
 here I am again texture and white 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.670
 to make the facts a little cotton the 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.379
 south track where came to take a ball 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.439
 of white that you come to do exactly 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:15.699
 the same thing and ouzzine has everything 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:18.849
 simply position it at the top or 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:21.380
 so it does not stick right away 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:23.030
 so even if you deform a little bit 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:28.610
 ball is not serious it is enough 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:30.110
 simply to reform a 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.360
 advice that I just gave everything to 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.430
 the time when you come to do your 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:39.130
 flange 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:41.840
 always work leblanc before 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:47.660
 because the red is gnawing the task the 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:52.820
 fingers so here and so then you 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:56.060
 come and put your spades on your python 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.810
 or so you want less the occurrence 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:07.460
 I will put it as on the other 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:09.020
 just on the side that's right there so 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.490
 So here I hope that this tutorial 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.250
 will have pleased after you are not obliged to 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.300
 make it fall like that you 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.260
 can make him fall 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:20.560
 as you like like those after 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.880
 it's your choice 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.680
 so that's so I hope this little 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.000
 tutorial you will have liked I did not hesitate to 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.190
 leave me comments below 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.290
 of the video and I tell you to very 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.290
 soon for new lease videos
