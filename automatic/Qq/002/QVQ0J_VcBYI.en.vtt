then<00:01:23.790> for<00:01:24.119> torques<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.860> picked<00:01:25.860> these<00:01:26.040> because

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
then for torques I picked these because

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.350

almost all the different fasteners on my
pocket<00:01:34.860> knives<00:01:35.420> so<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.450> can<00:01:36.720> work<00:01:36.869> on<00:01:37.049> them<00:01:41.329> very

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
pocket knives so I can work on them very

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.940 
pocket knives so I can work on them very
conveniently<00:01:42.899> because<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.350> often<00:01:43.530> have<00:01:43.710> the

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
conveniently because I often have the

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.460 
conveniently because I often have the
super<00:01:44.399> tool<00:01:44.960> even<00:01:45.960> if<00:01:46.049> I'm<00:01:46.170> not<00:01:46.200> actually

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
super tool even if I'm not actually

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.850 
super tool even if I'm not actually
carrying<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.130> in<00:01:47.250> your<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.579> hand<00:01:48.560> so<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.590> thought

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
carrying it in your in hand so I thought

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.920 
carrying it in your in hand so I thought
that<00:01:50.009> was<00:01:50.070> really<00:01:50.310> cool<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.790> mean<00:01:53.780> it<00:01:54.780> says

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
that was really cool I mean it says

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.740 
that was really cool I mean it says
Pittsburgh<00:01:55.350> I'm<00:01:56.070> actually<00:01:56.219> Taiwan<00:01:56.820> that's

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
Pittsburgh I'm actually Taiwan that's

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:05.600 
Pittsburgh I'm actually Taiwan that's
neat<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:59.210> think<00:02:02.329> it<00:02:03.329> actually<00:02:03.689> came<00:02:03.920> with<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:05.310> set

neat I think it actually came with a set

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.069 
neat I think it actually came with a set
of<00:02:05.670> bits<00:02:06.000> but<00:02:06.270> they<00:02:06.390> were<00:02:06.450> mostly<00:02:06.659> standard

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
of bits but they were mostly standard

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.460

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
screwdrivers I think the driver and the
