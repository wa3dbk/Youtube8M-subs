00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
basically it's got up I'm tracing one

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.770 
basically it's got up I'm tracing one
group<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.759> two<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.150> another<00:01:36.270> group<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.630> to

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
group of two and another group of to

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.440 
group of two and another group of to
chasing<00:01:37.229> me<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:37.939> gotta<00:01:38.939> be<00:01:39.030> on<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.180> lookout

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
chasing me so gotta be on the lookout

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.730 
chasing me so gotta be on the lookout
for<00:01:39.509> them<00:01:39.720> as<00:01:39.869> well<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.350> do<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.500> think<00:01:40.530> it's<00:01:40.680> a

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
for them as well so do you think it's a

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.800 
for them as well so do you think it's a
bit<00:01:40.860> harder<00:01:41.159> than<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.460> free<00:01:42.030> full<00:01:42.240> version<00:01:42.270> I

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
bit harder than the free full version I

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.389 
bit harder than the free full version I
think<00:01:43.079> it's<00:01:43.200> actually<00:01:43.320> easier<00:01:43.860> because<00:01:44.040> you

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
think it's actually easier because you

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.980 
think it's actually easier because you
know<00:01:44.579> who's<00:01:44.909> chasing<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.390> like<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.840> know

situation<00:02:44.380> really<00:02:44.920> yeah<00:02:45.250> we're<00:02:45.459> badass<00:02:45.819> we

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
situation really yeah we're badass we

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.140 
situation really yeah we're badass we
can<00:02:46.239> handle<00:02:46.360> this<00:02:46.510> kind<00:02:46.780> of<00:02:46.840> stuff<00:02:46.989> oh<00:02:47.200> yeah<00:02:48.150> so

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.370 
can handle this kind of stuff oh yeah so
I<00:02:49.569> think<00:02:50.380> it's<00:02:50.680> better<00:02:50.829> to<00:02:51.040> run<00:02:51.610> away<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:52.870> to

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
I think it's better to run away and to

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.960 
I think it's better to run away and to
get<00:02:53.890> your<00:02:54.010> target<00:02:54.430> because<00:02:54.549> you<00:02:54.670> just<00:02:54.819> get

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
get your target because you just get

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.330 
get your target because you just get
killed<00:02:55.209> there's<00:02:55.709> better<00:02:56.709> to<00:02:56.799> play<00:02:56.920> safer

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
killed there's better to play safer

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.490 
killed there's better to play safer
guess<00:02:57.519> so<00:02:58.180> this<00:02:58.329> map<00:02:58.660> is<00:02:58.870> this<00:02:59.079> one<00:02:59.230> of<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.379> new
