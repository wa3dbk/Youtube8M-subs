00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.650
 up to 10 eu neighborhood 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:12.170
 and against the maxim of the vengerov city of noginsk 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.170
 I recruit maxim 51 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.910
 celebration 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.750
 weather do not forget the method 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.230
 this is the second fighter from the republic 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.450
 the team I think they scared 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.830
 to mecca as correctly 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.560
 do not know the inhabitants of Moscow and the inhabitants of Moscow 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.450
 and suburbs because Oleg kulik if 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.250
 for example, right now the face will show 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.970
 same level as per box or in 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.060
 first battle 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.610
 then I think the winner can even be said 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:03.480
 not only here here he immediately change 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:06.229
 places and cities accepted because 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.229
 nowhere to go 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.450
 So Maxim Kotlyarov representing 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.110
 Noginsk city 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.890
 5 1 liter maxim of Moscow region 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.890
 service here 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.820
 and there is a beautiful banner ball 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.530
 the representatives 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.210
 each city you'd like 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:45.150
 here is not in Moscow yes how here 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:54.240
 beautifully tie it develops they 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:57.390
 Exalted from Russia to ask us 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.140
 look and how good banner and because 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.090
 that at least attract the eye and 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.250
 so we predictions on here again will be 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.240
 dragoons make it hard then she 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.700
 start the fight at least see the start of the fight 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.700
 the athletes from seems very famous in 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:30.070
 only one person who had a fight 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:30.070
 Rector 51 but back 3 to 5 to remind 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.870
 so I understand that the work is not for us 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.870
 Yegorova 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:51.360
 started the fight intelligence is about the map 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.440
 look friends guys and so for those who 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.900
 still 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.240
 distinguish for fighters say worn ass 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.240
 in black shorts and copiers hit 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.970
 started gifts hands overseeing 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:22.300
 hour , let's see who does not commit 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:22.300
 error very well done andrew on on services 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:40.630
 avoids Andrey fight prefers 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:43.720
 shock technique was such a good one 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.350
 pink already from which maxim 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.350
 hit 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.280
 but agree Eldar that is not always 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.430
 just watch go light heavyweight 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.850
 posts how easy the scales fought hard she 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.710
 completely loses 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:14.910
 Andrew went to the ground floor now 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:16.770
 Andrew goes to the floor andrew 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.930
 it appears on top but the question will hold or 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:20.640
 No, no, well, as I understand it all, yes, he 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.540
 still how do you blow the wedges anymore 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.820
 looked at him yes i will check the fragments 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:31.340
 beta dark here they grappled with his physics 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:34.500
 work more in Migar disc 2 not a fighter 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.120
 more up to 2 more drummer yes but every 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.830
 owns 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.680
 she flies fly on all roads 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.830
 but because maxim tapirs in andreytank 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.290
 Seledtsov Rob tournament's second overtime 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.680
 tournament and you look a little practical 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.180
 now takes kotlyarov you can 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.040
 hand protection before arrival overcome 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.370
 the topography sat down very well secured 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.370
 OK 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.820
 broke away and killed more home here 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.500
 probably already refining honor 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.890
 It turns out Moscow under 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.440
 Moscow region school and we are my revenge 11 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:14.090
 taking arrived yes and 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.890
 Komi Republic although we are certainly not for 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.470
 who do not cheer before the mountain cheer for 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:21.220
 justice for 1 managed 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.220
 winner up 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.680
 and already is behind Maxim 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.870
 Kotlyarov it looks like the situation is like an ending 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.689
 first duel when Oleg 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.869
 it is the same one 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:43.369
 but just the opposite, see Ildar Taurus 

00:05:38.869 --> 00:05:45.439
 I also agree along with and face you what 

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:47.239
 the fight could still lingering 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:50.209
 they looked normal 

00:05:47.239 --> 00:05:54.679
 just rbu forces a lot of punches but the referee 

00:05:50.209 --> 00:05:57.729
 I made the decision on his behavior 

00:05:54.679 --> 00:05:57.729
 see better and
