00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.910
 hi everyone knows stardust and we 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.520
 is found for a new video tutorial 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.859
 cana en masse so this video is going to be 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.900
 unwind in two parts first part 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.539
 live I will present you the 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.949
 technical and part two I'm going 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.260
 show you a little clip of about 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.070
 four minutes or sheep this technique 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.719
 and is so to see you really 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.190
 how she walks there I'll go 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.860
 introduce to technique then you the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.940
 will see you see it doing it 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.860
 so we start right away 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.710
 technique is the technique of 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.690
 catching bandits so catching the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.290
 bandits to do it you need to 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:58.330
 return to the astrub prison in less 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:59.710
 - 4 18 which seems to me in 7 - 18 sorry 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.460
 so dating years is less 18 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.239
 astrub prisons and there you will see 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.880
 Signs 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.470
 it will have to go somehow 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.670
 talk to the panels you click 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.420
 on each panel and you will have 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.090
 search notices from bandits who are from 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.590
 everywhere in the world of 15 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.479
 so you clicked to search 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.770
 for each bandits me it's already done 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.320
 know you're starting a quest you do that 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.930
 for all the bandits so they are 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.150
 there and then the goal will be to search 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.090
 these bandits each bandits to a zone 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.090
 so I'm going to show you a clip where 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.710
 I captured 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:41.850
 that was what I'm going to 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:44.590
 so show seven bandits it was a 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.040
 rogue I think that was my 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:52.330
 scenario it was at Ermine Braquo 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:55.570
 scalped brief arras so this bandit so 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.490
 you capture him you win 73 1500 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.540
 kama then I do not understand a thing 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.180
 because I catch them and I have 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.930
 won 94 kama miles short so you 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.000
 go find yourself a d after you 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.940
 find the areas are on the internet in 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.730
 I know that the one I found 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.030
 she is she is in time 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.030
 dallas 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:22.780
 the zap I found here so during 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.750
 there do not tremble by here in fact I was 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.519
 I was quietly in the process of 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.280
 play two way normal and I did 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.709
 a recruitment message looking for 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.320
 looking for a level character around 100 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.790
 for to capture a bandit so I 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.650
 got there I joined a cra 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.810
 level 120 you'll see it in the in the 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.590
 clip is so we went to panda there and 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.170
 we were captured each was was 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.610
 captured this bandit so you're in 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.950
 how much does any name in 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.540
 the group of the moment you win the 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.680
 fight you will have the bandit who you 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.150
 follows behind no need to capture him 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.190
 in fact with captur stones you 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.510
 just have to kill the bandit and he will 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.190
 follows so after following the bands he 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.510
 need to be more at scales they are more 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.560
 in addition to hard is good after that there you 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.110
 reports more than 15 months 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.580
 so once upon a time you have 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.950
 capture the find and capture the 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:13.090
 bandit you go to this 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.470
 prison and you talk to the guardian so 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.590
 you will see in the clip that I was 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.569
 not yet an expert in the matter so 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.680
 it was mostly the cra that goes a little 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.790
 helped me explain how it works and 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.530
 I was already aware but I 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.660
 do not use these two techniques so 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:30.730
 here I tell you right now to 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:32.950
 the capture clip back the world is 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.260
 welcome in the second part of this 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.120
 mass kama tutorial quickly 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.709
 so we see that we launch the fight 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.209
 with a tie and 121 earth so I the 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.890
 join him he told me the break they 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.360
 had found there the band had there 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.670
 need someone to help him so 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.069
 I jumped at the opportunity to 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.360
 you do a khama tutorial that frankly 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.130
 that works well but hey I use 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.790
 not too much this technique but I know 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.910
 that it works well 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.170
 after if we fail to be patient and then 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.810
 and then you have to know a little 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.250
 the places what so me I start I 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.590
 boosts me and I put a putsch on the 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.940
 snake thinking to attack him 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.900
 but in fact she was very visible 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.850
 because I'm not used to 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.930
 fight this kind of monster so you 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.070
 see for those who know 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.959
 not that the snake at least 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.280
 ash everywhere seems to me so that's 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.919
 really funny at the tap and she types 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.539
 we tape it, it's me 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.859
 I do not remember you will see after 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:22.600
 but with some spells that type 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.800
 above 200-300 I type but really 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.169
 a lot more and it's great fun 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.440
 so I'll start this round there I 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:32.979
 still not bad brooks and I play a 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:37.150
 pink claw - 500 and then I continue 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:39.820
 with 303 times pretty much so more 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.490
 a lot of vita for ribbons says I 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.200
 find that this woman if I dare 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.450
 say 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.539
 rox a lot really a lot she is 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.280
 powerful so fortunately that has cracked 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.600
 but to side with his big these 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.419
 big punitive that was hurting 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.789
 but otherwise yeah that's right I think 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.210
 not that I will have solo so here I try to 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:01.990
 save me 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.430
 and then and then and I see that my 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.080
 my way and block so here is a 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.420
 snake so I type in the 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.890
 concentration - 726 who was typing 300 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.390
 just now so see it's really 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.190
 funny 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:15.790
 so the cra I think he can nothing 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.560
 do so he'll boost one to the passage 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.030
 it made me laugh because he 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.020
 ask my boards so that's ok 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.040
 well pleased he found that I 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.280
 believe it's not bad it's going well 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.680
 pleasure that dedicates to you so here we are 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:32.650
 will end this fight I have had fun 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:33.400
 rock it is this snake with the sword 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.140
 from yop 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:40.540
 I think I'll put him a little 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:42.850
 hat trick here is my friend with a 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.760
 sword diop it's not nothing what it is 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.020
 So there really excellent one ends 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.460
 the fight I did not have time to see 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.950
 how do I explain king it was 70000 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.990
 something like that so here we go 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.969
 did I ever have I ever seen that 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.279
 in fact 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:57.599
 because I did not do that I see 

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:59.039
 we know what bandit I was thrown 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:01.319
 people were not good actually it's not 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:02.519
 if a body is that why why does it 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:04.049
 just kill him loot the bandit who 

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:07.949
 follows you and then just the 

00:06:04.049 --> 00:06:09.989
 bring him back to adeline who poses to 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:13.949
 five was getting wet but why so 

00:06:09.989 --> 00:06:14.879
 just bring him back to jail so 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:15.719
 it is not there that I have you 

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:17.969
 shown at the beginning of the video 

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:21.029
 so I go there so voice game 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:22.319
 of errors once I remove this zapped by 

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:24.269
 defect because I'm going I'm going over 

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:28.189
 is funny in this blur finally brief 

00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:35.459
 do not care so I go to the prison 

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:40.049
 to bring the prisoner to custody 

00:06:35.459 --> 00:06:46.649
 so I head over I call him back 

00:06:40.049 --> 00:06:53.909
 it's above the pandawa statue and 

00:06:46.649 --> 00:06:55.199
 I bring back and bring back the bandit 

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:56.610
 so here I did not know how that was 

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:57.539
 walk and which I talked to the modem on 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:01.279
 do not care it's not serious 

00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:04.139
 so here I go back braquo and I win 

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:05.759
 94000 kama so you see when ten 

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:08.219
 minutes about ten minutes not even 

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:10.559
 I just won 94000 frame so is 

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:12.089
 finally good of course usually have to 

00:07:10.559 --> 00:07:13.709
 look for it but if you have a little bit of 

00:07:12.089 --> 00:07:16.979
 luck and you are patient you in 

00:07:13.709 --> 00:07:18.569
 find a fake fake you find the 

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:20.369
 area and after that goes fast 

00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:22.469
 so here I hope this little tutorial 

00:07:20.369 --> 00:07:25.759
 you will have liked if you liked secular and
