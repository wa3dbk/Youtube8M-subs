 our u23 team in the finger on 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.490
 last sunday in the bg stadium the 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.650
 table penultimate of victoria hamburg 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.469
 and the team of coach sÃ¶ren osterland 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.560
 and co-director Steven Cherundolo showed 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.859
 from the beginning who was the lord in the house 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:22.289
 sixth minute throw 96 pass on roman 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.150
 Prokop who claimed the ball well and 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.160
 played in the course of sebastian ahrens 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.160
 the 1 0 for 96 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.420
 just seven minutes later this scene 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.640
 quickly executed corner robert herrmann 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.190
 with the flank the kevin behrens in the 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:52.890
 middle two to zero for our u23 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:55.670
 and it went on cheerfully 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.340
 hannover was only played 18 minutes ago 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.649
 96 that's the name of a group 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.019
 failed but the extra was in it 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.570
 this time it was just grandpa thermann 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.610
 still preparing himself now ice cold 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.600
 The Gate of Victor Keeper Tobias 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.580
 group group should be shortly after 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.770
 the half-time in scene 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.840
 serious after a foul on sebastian 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.500
 showed the umpire caught up with him 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.020
 Responsibility was the key to Prokop 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.439
 but failed to group in the 47 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.270
 minute two minutes later this scene 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.490
 biting fight between niklas 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.340
 pond graves and his opponent and 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.140
 What happened then at ugly 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.720
 action of hamburgers vincent castle 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.720
 and victoria had to manage to 10 too 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.280
 play the end 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.009
 96 kept pushing and was special 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.930
 dangerous by standards 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.549
 71 minute here screwed again 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.649
 kevin behrens already to 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.530
 interim 2 0 had met 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.920
 highest and hit the 4 0 with the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.380
 head then finally made the bag 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.630
 the substitute tobias window and 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.939
 a quarter of an hour before the end 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.780
 like the corner 96 and again it was one 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.200
 nice header for the 5th 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.200
 to 0 a class part of ours ended 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.010
