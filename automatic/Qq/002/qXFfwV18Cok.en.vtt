00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
make a funnel to where you funnel them

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.770 
make a funnel to where you funnel them
into<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.869> trap<00:01:55.909> the<00:01:56.909> animal<00:01:56.939> will<00:01:57.360> come<00:01:57.570> in

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
into the trap the animal will come in

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.469 
into the trap the animal will come in
you'll<00:01:58.140> hit<00:01:58.290> these<00:01:58.500> trigger<00:01:58.799> wires<00:01:59.270> the<00:02:00.270> door

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
you'll hit these trigger wires the door

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.840 
you'll hit these trigger wires the door
will<00:02:00.600> come<00:02:00.780> down<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.409> then<00:02:02.399> it's<00:02:02.610> just<00:02:02.700> a

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
will come down and then it's just a

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.310 
will come down and then it's just a
matter<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.119> time<00:02:03.360> if<00:02:03.600> another<00:02:03.780> one<00:02:03.960> comes<00:02:04.170> in

if you've got a hole that the armadillo

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.380 
if you've got a hole that the armadillo
is<00:02:08.200> coming<00:02:08.560> out<00:02:08.679> of<00:02:08.890> you<00:02:09.670> just<00:02:09.880> set<00:02:10.060> this<00:02:10.210> in

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
is coming out of you just set this in

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.420 
is coming out of you just set this in
front<00:02:10.600> of<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.720> hole<00:02:10.929> maybe<00:02:11.650> line<00:02:11.980> your<00:02:12.160> boards

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
front of the hole maybe line your boards

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.710 
front of the hole maybe line your boards
up<00:02:12.610> so<00:02:12.820> where<00:02:12.970> he'll<00:02:13.120> come<00:02:13.330> in<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.600> we'll

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
up so where he'll come in and we'll

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.790 
up so where he'll come in and we'll
funnel<00:02:14.050> him<00:02:14.140> into<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.560> trap<00:02:14.940> if<00:02:15.940> you<00:02:16.590> if<00:02:17.590> you

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
funnel him into the trap if you if you

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.710 
funnel him into the trap if you if you
use<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.040> single<00:02:18.520> door<00:02:18.700> trap<00:02:18.970> it's<00:02:19.240> not<00:02:19.390> near<00:02:19.630> as

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
use a single door trap it's not near as

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.130 
use a single door trap it's not near as
effective<00:02:20.100> or<00:02:21.100> as<00:02:21.130> a<00:02:21.670> single<00:02:22.390> catch<00:02:22.570> trap<00:02:22.930> as

effective or as a single catch trap as

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.400 
effective or as a single catch trap as
the<00:02:24.100> double<00:02:24.400> catch<00:02:24.850> trap<00:02:25.150> would<00:02:25.360> be<00:02:25.510> one<00:02:25.780> the

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
the double catch trap would be one the

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.170 
the double catch trap would be one the
main<00:02:26.620> reason<00:02:27.040> is<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:27.220> because<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.850> animal

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
main reason is that because the animal

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.540 
main reason is that because the animal
acts<00:02:28.780> as<00:02:28.959> bait<00:02:29.170> for<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.470> other<00:02:29.620> one<00:02:29.860> you<00:02:30.520> can

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
acts as bait for the other one you can

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.730 
acts as bait for the other one you can
catch<00:02:30.910> a<00:02:31.060> second<00:02:31.450> animal<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:32.080> other<00:02:32.230> thing<00:02:32.530> is

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
catch a second animal the other thing is

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.730 
catch a second animal the other thing is
is<00:02:33.550> that<00:02:33.850> if<00:02:34.300> you<00:02:34.570> use<00:02:34.600> a<00:02:34.810> single<00:02:35.260> door<00:02:35.410> trap

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
is that if you use a single door trap

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.890 
is that if you use a single door trap
you<00:02:36.310> can<00:02:36.340> only<00:02:36.670> can<00:02:36.880> catch<00:02:37.300> him<00:02:37.480> coming<00:02:37.690> in

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
you can only can catch him coming in

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.250 
you can only can catch him coming in
from<00:02:38.140> one<00:02:38.170> direction<00:02:38.820> now<00:02:39.820> we<00:02:40.090> also<00:02:40.270> offer<00:02:40.840> a
