00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
I recommend putting a paper in the

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.660 
I recommend putting a paper in the
inside<00:02:31.470> when<00:02:31.620> your<00:02:31.739> spray<00:02:31.950> painting<00:02:32.190> so<00:02:32.459> that

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
inside when your spray painting so that

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.730 
inside when your spray painting so that
it's<00:02:32.760> clear<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.420> this<00:02:34.080> is<00:02:34.200> how<00:02:34.319> it<00:02:34.410> turned<00:02:34.620> out

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
it's clear and this is how it turned out

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.410 
it's clear and this is how it turned out
and<00:02:35.010> then<00:02:35.280> I<00:02:35.310> just<00:02:35.580> ended<00:02:35.819> up<00:02:35.910> filling<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.390> with

and then I just ended up filling it with

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.630 
and then I just ended up filling it with
some<00:02:36.720> rice<00:02:36.989> so<00:02:37.440> that<00:02:37.590> i<00:02:37.620> can<00:02:37.709> put<00:02:38.010> pencils<00:02:38.430> or
