00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.930 

and<00:00:01.290> I'm<00:00:01.410> here<00:00:01.620> to<00:00:01.710> show<00:00:01.889> you<00:00:01.920> how<00:00:02.190> to<00:00:02.250> fit<00:00:02.669> the

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:02.940 
and I'm here to show you how to fit the

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:18.890 
and I'm here to show you how to fit the
Monty<00:00:03.570> fixing<00:00:04.080> that<00:00:04.290> we<00:00:04.440> do<00:00:05.180> to<00:00:06.180> do<00:00:17.630> the<00:00:18.630> seal

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
Monty fixing that we do to do the seal

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.890 
Monty fixing that we do to do the seal
itself<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:20.180> printing<00:00:21.180> white<00:00:21.420> wall<00:00:21.630> cleaner

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
itself is printing white wall cleaner

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.430 
itself is printing white wall cleaner
and<00:00:22.830> basically<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.820> made<00:00:24.060> from<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.630> tin<00:00:24.870> section

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:25.440 
and basically is made from a tin section

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.160 
and basically is made from a tin section
your<00:00:26.100> idea<00:00:26.370> of<00:00:26.610> the<00:00:26.820> seal<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.570> will<00:00:27.720> fit<00:00:27.990> any

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
your idea of the seal is it will fit any

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.460 
your idea of the seal is it will fit any
thickness<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.430> glass<00:00:29.550> this<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.630> for<00:00:30.930> meal

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
thickness of glass this is for meal

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.610 
thickness of glass this is for meal
so<00:00:31.980> most<00:00:32.820> glass<00:00:33.179> is<00:00:33.600> for<00:00:33.780> twenty<00:00:34.109> six<00:00:34.379> and

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
so most glass is for twenty six and

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.639 
so most glass is for twenty six and
twelve<00:00:35.460> we<00:00:35.670> did<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:35.999> for<00:00:36.210> us<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.929> will<00:00:37.170> fit<00:00:37.469> up

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
twelve we did it for us this will fit up

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:44.899 
twelve we did it for us this will fit up
underneath<00:00:38.929> the<00:00:39.929> glass<00:00:43.339> the<00:00:44.339> ideal<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.819> the

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:44.909 
underneath the glass the ideal of the

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:47.869 
underneath the glass the ideal of the
seal<00:00:45.179> it<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:46.109> quite<00:00:46.679> simple<00:00:47.190> it's<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.579> good<00:00:47.789> one

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
seal it is quite simple it's a good one

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:48.410 
seal it is quite simple it's a good one
seal

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
seal

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.899 
seal
so<00:00:48.719> first<00:00:48.989> window<00:00:49.409> is<00:00:49.710> take<00:00:50.069> off<00:00:50.749> the<00:00:51.749> Coliseum

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:52.909 
so first window is take off the Coliseum

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:57.469 
so first window is take off the Coliseum
and<00:00:53.960> clean<00:00:54.960> up<00:00:55.229> the<00:00:55.710> glass<00:00:56.239> probably<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.329> most

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:57.479 
and clean up the glass probably the most

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:59.419 
and clean up the glass probably the most
important<00:00:57.989> job<00:00:58.019> making<00:00:58.799> sure<00:00:59.069> that<00:00:59.249> you've

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
important job making sure that you've

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:17.510 
important job making sure that you've
got<00:00:59.460> all<00:00:59.670> the<00:01:00.030> scale<00:01:02.809> so<00:01:15.920> we<00:01:16.920> suggest<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.430> you

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
got all the scale so we suggest that you

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.420 
got all the scale so we suggest that you
put<00:01:17.760> the<00:01:17.850> seal<00:01:18.060> on<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.270> outside<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.320> way<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
put the seal on the outside that way the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.340 
put the seal on the outside that way the
water<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.760> not<00:01:20.970> running<00:01:21.150> down<00:01:21.570> on<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.110> still

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
water is not running down on the still

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.620 
water is not running down on the still
all<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.620> time<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.190> will<00:01:23.700> help<00:01:23.850> they<00:01:24.060> will

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
all the time and will help they will

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.290 
all the time and will help they will
stay<00:01:24.900> cleaner<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.730> other<00:01:26.850> good<00:01:27.060> thing<00:01:27.240> about

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
stay cleaner the other good thing about

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.140 
stay cleaner the other good thing about
is<00:01:27.780> because<00:01:28.230> there<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.410> no<00:01:28.530> side<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.550> you're

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
is because there is no side and you're

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.610 
is because there is no side and you're
not<00:01:30.330> going<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.540> get<00:01:30.630> all<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.900> muck<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.380> dirt

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
not going to get all the muck and dirt

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.900 
not going to get all the muck and dirt
and<00:01:31.950> why<00:01:32.190> fill<00:01:33.030> up<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.870> seal<00:01:34.200> profile<00:01:34.950> so

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
and why fill up in the seal profile so

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.180 
and why fill up in the seal profile so
that's<00:01:36.420> quite<00:01:36.690> a<00:01:36.750> good<00:01:37.110> idea

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.510 

so<00:01:41.190> to<00:01:41.310> clean<00:01:41.550> up<00:01:41.730> on<00:01:41.910> the<00:01:41.940> glass<00:01:43.280> make<00:01:44.280> sure

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
so to clean up on the glass make sure

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.600 
so to clean up on the glass make sure
another<00:01:44.790> said<00:01:45.090> you've<00:01:45.240> got<00:01:45.390> all<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.720> dirt<00:01:45.960> off

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.870 

the<00:01:50.610> next<00:01:50.880> thing<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.150> do<00:01:51.330> is<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:52.410> find<00:01:53.190> out<00:01:53.520> what

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
the next thing to do is to find out what

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.580 
the next thing to do is to find out what
the<00:01:54.180> length<00:01:54.330> of<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.750> screen<00:01:55.050> is<00:01:55.230> then<00:01:55.470> this

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
the length of the screen is then this

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.590 
the length of the screen is then this
will<00:01:55.740> vary<00:01:56.010> in<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.490> entropy<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.060> seal<00:01:57.270> comes

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
will vary in the entropy the seal comes

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.590 
will vary in the entropy the seal comes
in<00:01:58.250> at<00:01:59.250> 1<00:01:59.460> meter<00:01:59.790> length<00:01:59.940> which<00:02:00.210> will<00:02:00.330> pretty

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
in at 1 meter length which will pretty

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.899 
in at 1 meter length which will pretty
much<00:02:00.750> do<00:02:01.020> most<00:02:01.350> bathrooms<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.250> mouth<00:02:02.430> doors

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
much do most bathrooms and mouth doors

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.670 
much do most bathrooms and mouth doors
although<00:02:03.180> we<00:02:03.300> do<00:02:03.510> set<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.840> longer<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.500> you

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
although we do set it longer and you

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.359 
although we do set it longer and you
need<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.010> first<00:02:05.490> talk<00:02:05.640> about

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.029 

so<00:02:08.819> we<00:02:08.940> take<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.270> seal<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:10.289> we<00:02:10.380> just<00:02:10.619> tuck<00:02:10.830> it

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
so we take the seal and we just tuck it

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.250 
so we take the seal and we just tuck it
up<00:02:11.130> I<00:02:11.400> hope<00:02:11.849> we're<00:02:12.030> going<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.270> do<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.630> get<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.930> lot

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
up I hope we're going to do is get a lot

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.010 
up I hope we're going to do is get a lot
of<00:02:13.349> measurements<00:02:14.010> off<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.580> my<00:02:14.849> hand<00:02:17.060> a<00:02:18.060> little

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
of measurements off of my hand a little

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:51.470 
of measurements off of my hand a little
bit<00:02:19.200> longer<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:47.840> so<00:02:48.840> there<00:02:49.019> is<00:02:49.730> so<00:02:50.730> this<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.209> in

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
bit longer and so there is so this is in

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:59.089 
bit longer and so there is so this is in
keep<00:02:52.080> me<00:02:52.170> cut<00:02:52.410> off<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.830> strain<00:02:57.709> but<00:02:58.709> that's<00:02:58.980> a

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
keep me cut off the strain but that's a

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.370 
keep me cut off the strain but that's a
steel<00:02:59.340> cut<00:02:59.610> that<00:02:59.849> you<00:03:00.090> know<00:03:00.299> now<00:03:00.720> that<00:03:00.750> fits

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
steel cut that you know now that fits

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.660 
steel cut that you know now that fits
straight<00:03:02.220> onto<00:03:02.549> the<00:03:02.700> glass<00:03:04.160> like<00:03:05.160> next<00:03:05.519> thing

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
straight onto the glass like next thing

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.970 
straight onto the glass like next thing
to<00:03:05.790> do<00:03:05.940> is<00:03:05.970> determine<00:03:06.290> what<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:09.480> drop<00:03:10.319> is<00:03:10.560> so

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
to do is determine what the drop is so

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.640 
to do is determine what the drop is so
from<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.310> bottom<00:03:11.430> of<00:03:11.609> the<00:03:11.700> glass<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.239> buff

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
from the bottom of the glass to the buff

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.690 
from the bottom of the glass to the buff
quite<00:03:13.650> simply<00:03:14.299> take<00:03:15.299> the<00:03:15.420> tape<00:03:15.660> measure<00:03:15.870> up

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
quite simply take the tape measure up

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.300 
quite simply take the tape measure up
move<00:03:17.700> it<00:03:17.880> down<00:03:17.940> this<00:03:18.510> one<00:03:18.780> is<00:03:18.900> 12<00:03:19.200> mil<00:03:19.560> which<00:03:20.070> if

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310

area

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:23.230 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.860 

I<00:06:23.260> push<00:06:24.190> the<00:06:24.340> screen<00:06:24.610> back<00:06:24.850> into<00:06:25.600> the<00:06:25.690> bath

I push the screen back into the bath

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.710 
I push the screen back into the bath
because<00:06:26.110> it<00:06:26.230> makes<00:06:26.530> a<00:06:26.680> little<00:06:26.830> bit<00:06:26.950> easier<00:06:27.130> and

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 
because it makes a little bit easier and

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.220 
because it makes a little bit easier and
then<00:06:28.720> neutral<00:06:29.200> in<00:06:29.320> just<00:06:29.620> work<00:06:29.860> you<00:06:30.070> seal<00:06:31.230> onto

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:32.230 
then neutral in just work you seal onto

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:36.330 
then neutral in just work you seal onto
the<00:06:32.770> glass<00:06:33.480> pushing<00:06:34.480> that<00:06:34.660> t-section<00:06:35.590> right

but<00:06:51.600> I'm<00:06:52.230> working<00:06:52.830> there<00:06:57.500> we<00:06:58.500> think<00:06:58.770> about<00:07:00.050> 30

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.050 
but I'm working there we think about 30

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.960 
but I'm working there we think about 30
seconds<00:07:01.500> which<00:07:01.860> is<00:07:01.889> Pedroia

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:02.970 
seconds which is Pedroia

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.840 
seconds which is Pedroia
we<00:07:03.510> suggest<00:07:03.960> when<00:07:04.080> you've<00:07:04.440> done<00:07:05.160> this<00:07:05.490> you

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:05.850 
we suggest when you've done this you

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.340 
we suggest when you've done this you
leave<00:07:06.030> it<00:07:06.240> for<00:07:06.270> now<00:07:06.630> or<00:07:06.870> just<00:07:07.050> to<00:07:07.139> make<00:07:07.320> sure

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:07.350 
leave it for now or just to make sure

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:17.240 
leave it for now or just to make sure
they<00:07:07.650> eat<00:07:07.730> 100%<00:07:08.730> dry<00:07:15.500> then<00:07:16.500> your<00:07:16.620> steel<00:07:16.889> is

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:17.250 
they eat 100% dry then your steel is

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.730 
they eat 100% dry then your steel is
complete
