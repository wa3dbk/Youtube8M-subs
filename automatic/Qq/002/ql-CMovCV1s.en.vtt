00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
are based on a chord progression similar

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.260 
are based on a chord progression similar
to<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.899> one<00:00:43.110> found<00:00:43.290> in<00:00:43.530> Mack<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.950> Knife<00:00:44.270> now

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
to the one found in Mack the Knife now

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.430 
to the one found in Mack the Knife now
we'll<00:00:45.780> begin<00:00:45.899> by<00:00:46.680> learning<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.579> arpeggios

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.990 

will<00:00:52.440> include<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.920> 7s<00:00:53.430> on<00:00:53.550> some<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
will include the 7s on some of the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:05.420 
will include the 7s on some of the
arpeggios

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.030 

we'll<00:01:06.430> also<00:01:06.640> learn<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:07.560> pentatonic<00:01:08.560> scales

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
we'll also learn the pentatonic scales

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:23.520 
we'll also learn the pentatonic scales
to<00:01:09.340> go<00:01:09.520> with<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:09.790> chords

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.190 

and<00:01:24.530> then<00:01:25.310> we'll<00:01:25.759> work<00:01:25.970> at<00:01:26.180> a<00:01:26.210> method<00:01:26.720> that

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
and then we'll work at a method that

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.830 
and then we'll work at a method that
helps<00:01:27.649> you<00:01:27.920> learn<00:01:28.070> how<00:01:28.280> to<00:01:28.310> improvise<00:01:28.840> using

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
helps you learn how to improvise using

00:01:29.840 --> 00:02:00.820 
helps you learn how to improvise using
this<00:01:30.259> vocabulary<00:01:58.899> now<00:01:59.899> since<00:02:00.619> our

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
this vocabulary now since our

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.859 
this vocabulary now since our
progression<00:02:01.670> is<00:02:01.819> similar<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:02.479> one<00:02:02.659> found

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
progression is similar to the one found

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.779 
progression is similar to the one found
in<00:02:03.080> Mack<00:02:03.319> the<00:02:03.470> Knife<00:02:03.500> you<00:02:04.159> might<00:02:04.369> want<00:02:04.549> to<00:02:04.610> take

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
in Mack the Knife you might want to take

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:06.190 
in Mack the Knife you might want to take
some<00:02:04.819> time<00:02:05.179> do<00:02:05.450> a<00:02:05.479> little<00:02:05.750> internet<00:02:06.170> research

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
some time do a little internet research

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.460 
some time do a little internet research
and<00:02:06.909> locate<00:02:07.909> some<00:02:08.420> instrumental<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:09.410> vocal

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
the chords once we begin improvising

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.830 
the chords once we begin improvising
I've<00:03:03.819> labeled<00:03:04.819> the<00:03:04.940> two<00:03:05.150> sections<00:03:05.510> as<00:03:06.019> a<00:03:06.530> and<00:03:06.829> B

I've labeled the two sections as a and B

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.780 
I've labeled the two sections as a and B
also<00:03:08.840> notice<00:03:09.590> that<00:03:09.620> the<00:03:09.950> key<00:03:10.190> of<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.579> tune

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
also notice that the key of the tune

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.720 
also notice that the key of the tune
appears<00:03:11.269> to<00:03:11.420> be<00:03:11.600> b-flat<00:03:12.170> you<00:03:13.160> can't<00:03:13.430> always

appears to be b-flat you can't always

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.520 
appears to be b-flat you can't always
determine<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.540> key<00:03:14.720> of<00:03:14.870> a<00:03:14.959> tune<00:03:15.200> by<00:03:15.470> the

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
the tune ends on a B flat chord we're

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.559 
the tune ends on a B flat chord we're
pretty<00:03:24.920> safe<00:03:25.250> and<00:03:25.609> saying<00:03:25.880> that<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.299> chord

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
pretty safe and saying that the chord

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.750 
pretty safe and saying that the chord
progression<00:03:27.139> is<00:03:27.319> in<00:03:27.470> the<00:03:27.590> key<00:03:27.769> of<00:03:27.799> B<00:03:27.920> flat<00:03:28.130> as

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
progression is in the key of B flat as

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.839 
progression is in the key of B flat as
the<00:03:29.359> saying<00:03:29.840> goes<00:03:30.170> if<00:03:30.530> it<00:03:31.069> looks<00:03:31.280> like<00:03:31.459> a<00:03:31.489> duck

the saying goes if it looks like a duck
and<00:03:32.060> quacks<00:03:32.540> like<00:03:32.810> a<00:03:32.870> duck

and quacks like a duck

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.960 
and quacks like a duck
it's<00:03:33.940> probably<00:03:34.390> a<00:03:34.720> duck<00:03:38.640> look<00:03:39.640> through<00:03:39.880> the

it's probably a duck look through the

it's probably a duck look through the
chord<00:03:40.240> progression<00:03:40.930> and<00:03:41.140> you'll<00:03:41.410> find<00:03:41.710> that

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
chord progression and you'll find that

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.030 
chord progression and you'll find that
it<00:03:42.070> includes<00:03:42.460> four<00:03:42.880> different<00:03:43.360> chords<00:03:43.780> B<00:03:44.710> flat

before we begin our practice let's take

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.260 
before we begin our practice let's take
a<00:03:56.050> moment<00:03:56.320> and<00:03:56.680> discuss<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.430> chord<00:03:57.700> symbols

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
a moment and discuss the chord symbols

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.990 
a moment and discuss the chord symbols
and<00:03:58.570> their<00:03:58.900> meanings<00:03:59.850> chords<00:04:00.850> are

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
and their meanings chords are

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.510 
and their meanings chords are
constructed<00:04:01.630> using<00:04:01.900> specific<00:04:02.710> tones<00:04:02.980> found

constructed using specific tones found
in<00:04:03.700> scales<00:04:04.060> so<00:04:04.750> it<00:04:04.840> is<00:04:04.960> common<00:04:05.380> to<00:04:05.410> think<00:04:05.620> of
