00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.110
 i 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.760
 do not 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.359
 everything feels 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.890
 on this occasion 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.040
 how to do a hard tooth reset 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.370
 is for a mobile and sony xperia 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.770
 but let's make a 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.610
 is to reset the and that nowadays 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.190
 as you know all the data 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.310
 and it is better that you make a copy of 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.310
 security 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.520
 and good on this occasion then look if the 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.739
 mobile fails or makes problems we have 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.660
 forgotten the pattern or something like that from 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.780
 this way we can recover the mobile to 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.150
 factory status to be able to do 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.870
 this process we have to install the 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:17.680
 ps ps I'm going to leave the link in 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.990
 in the article on my page and when I 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.280
 install is to connect the mobile 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.770
 correctly goes out so is 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.530
 connected 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.040
 and to make a garden we have to 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.110
 go here 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.159
 to put your portion 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.039
 and here we give you to start 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.229
 here you do not go out and if your mobile is 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:42.390
 updated comes crisis but not only 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.390
 we will give to repair the phone 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.350
 that all the data will be lost 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.350
 obviously 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.750
 all will be lost 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:02.160
 here he is unloading what he will be 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.160
 the salt software that will install 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.630
 and we can see state 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.220
 the truth is that it takes a while for 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.860
 download the software and prepare the 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.150
 computer so that the 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.480
 updating and restoring 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.480
 mobile 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.909
 Well I'll cut so that it is not 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.909
 long the video is cutting and 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.080
 because as you can see 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.080
 connecting with the phone 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.480
 they turn off mobiles go back to restart 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.310
 do not do not disconnect is the mobile when it is 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.300
 updating that can do a lot of damage 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.930
 to the device so it is recommended not 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.930
 do not 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.730
 and here as you can see and it has already been 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:19.010
 updated already been in our 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.280
 device here what we have to 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.459
 do is disconnect it and return it to 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.129
 turn on normally when you turn it on 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:31.720
 you can take a little longer but that's 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:35.020
 normal because things are installed like this is 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.770
