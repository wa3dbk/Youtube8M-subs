00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:22.970
 stage of the project buy his wood 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.820
 second step the ask the third 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.990
 step how to maintain it 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.329
 the first question we can 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.820
 ask how to keep the quality of sound 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.949
 wood your wood does not have to be treated 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.989
 to keep its quality receptions it 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:36.170
 will have its properties for the rest of his 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.079
 life 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.910
 it's a living matter only 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.840
 painters were class iv need 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.510
 a cutting product 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.489
 ap pc 91 abba lunch at 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.879
 the place of the cup for retirees 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.079
 anti fungus and anti termites 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.329
 that's when we oppose a second 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.120
 question but how will evolve the 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.829
 color of my wood while it's from 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.379
 1st price or high end as the ip 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.100
 and your wood goes naturally gray is 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:06.290
 due to inclement weather and especially to uv 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.580
 three solutions are available to you 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.680
 gray wood is naturally 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.600
 so I'm not doing anything it will age 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.210
 naturally only a karcher stroke 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.580
 low pressure at 50 cm from the wood you 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.080
 will remove impurities 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.090
 second solution and I like having 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.800
 a color quite close to the origin 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.230
 but I do not want to talk about it 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.240
 often then the disguisers helping you 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.040
 once every two years you 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.930
 involve net troll senses and your 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.420
 see will regain its original appearance 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.130
 you pass generously with the brush the 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.350
 produced after a shot of water 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.340
 on the wood you wait 15 20 minutes 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.990
 and voracious and voila 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.030
 third solution I want to keep the 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.800
 original color all the time then 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.350
 you pass a saturator one to two 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.660
 once a year for wood autoclave it 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.210
