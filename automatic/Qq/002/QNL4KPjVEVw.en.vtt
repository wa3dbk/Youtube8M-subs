00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hi friends from youtube I come with a 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.170
 new video that are curiosities of ito 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.090
 As every child knows that, so if 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.950
 getting in from maine before anything else 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.650
 I had some time that did not go up 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.269
 curiosities of horror movies well 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.779
 and before starting the video they 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.210
 I will explain on what basis that is based 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.980
 in john wayne gacy jrr known also 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.380
 how pogo was a serial killer 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:31.080
 American who raped and killed 33 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.940
 young men between 1972 and 1978 26 of 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.399
 his victims were buried in the 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.410
 basement of his own home three more 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.540
 in other places in the house and other 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.940
 four were thrown into a nearby river 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.950
 he called him the killer clown because 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.230
 did social services in parades and 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.660
 Children's parties dressed as a clown 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.360
 did call the whole clown character 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.890
 that he created himself during the 14 years 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.350
 what happened in prison 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.079
 here he used to paint with oil his theme 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.180
 favorite were the clowns he said he used 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.760
 his clown character as alter ego 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.040
 his paintings include images of 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.060
 Snow White and the murderer in series frei 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.149
 gamer 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.790
 now we move to the year 1990 where 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:15.630
 that premiered in theaters history 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.060
 begins in 1961 the action of tim 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.100
 curry as penny wish the clown was so 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.429
 chilling and real that the actors what 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.920
 they avoided in the filming 2 the actor that 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:28.049
 makes the clown appendix tim curry is the 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.850
 same actor that makes Dr. Frank n 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.759
 furter in the rocky horror picture show 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.950
 3 curiously the one of Ubeda takes a 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.530
 dubbing totally different to the version 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.390
 that they put on television was not included 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.920
 the scene where you see enrico uers 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.289
 in the psychiatric talking with 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.090
 pennywise and supposed flight instead in 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.360
 the TV version if you can see 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.670
 this scene 4 the famous movie of 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.009
 stephen king contains in some scenes 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.380
 with subliminal messages and references 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.149
 to pedophilia many focus their 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.280
 attention in the bathroom scene where 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.200
 supposedly such messages are more 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.599
 obvious phrases like this is very 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.459
 narrow for me down here I have something 

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:07.590
 for you that I call that earl and I'm going 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:09.720
 besides the simple fact of harassment in a 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.830
 bathroom they serve as sustenance for this 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.440
 theory 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.730
 5 in the movie the children make a 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.800
 dam that floods the city 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.500
 sthepen king in his autobiography 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.420
 titled as I write, I realize that with 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.280
 his brother built a small 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.790
 dam that flooded the city ​​in which 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.270
 6 john ritter the actor who made a 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.540
 20 large died in 2003 same year 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.640
 in which Billy boy committed suicide 7 in the 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.860
 bathroom scene when all the showers 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.100
 they light themselves is a reference to 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.020
 nightmare on elm street '28 on the scene 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.150
 where beverly hears the voices in the 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.220
 drainage a boy is identified as 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.900
 I killed with him this is the name of the 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.240
 production supervisor in this 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.520
 movie another girl in the drain says 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.820
 called vicki burroughs is the name of 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.740
 the one who made the casting for this film 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.810
 9 was thought of george a.romero for 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.850
 direct this movie but the 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.980
 producers thought that the result 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.260
 it could be too bloody for the 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.209
 television limits 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.799
 is the cover of this movie is 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.290
 exactly like the one in the movie 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:16.560
 'los tomic no kers other work by stephen 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.599
 king 11 the movie that the kids are 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.489
 watching when they drop the drinks and 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:25.829
 the popcorn is i was a werewolf 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:28.049
 Teen 1957 from Gene Fowler Jr 12 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.120
 curiously this book of that which 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.569
 It is very bizarre and it contains a lot of gore 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.700
 This pen king is dedicated to their children 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.950
 13 for the preparation of this series is 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.840
 They invested 12 million dollars , 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.849
 which was a very large amount for 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.420
 being a television series and not 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:47.519
 a movie 14 when the boys achieve 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.709
 beat that for the first time these 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.480
 they lose in the sewers because of 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.010
 everyone is afraid and they lose the union 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.019
 that kept them safe 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.090
 then beverly believes that to unite the 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.670
 trust of his six friends again 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.849
 you must give yourself to your friends and so 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.889
 he does it in the history of book 15 in 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.379
 the salem book the sellout story 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:10.769
 written also by stephen king is done 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:12.870
 reference to that in several sentences 16 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.620
 when that means that down there to 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.290
 where the 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:20.160
 they all float are really just 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.900
 suspended in the air x of 17 that was 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.240
 a being that could take the form that 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.770
 I would like in the movie most of 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.990
 of time we see him as the clown 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.850
 penguin but in the book he had many 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.610
 forms for example in the younger brother 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.220
 weak called George in a giant bird 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.260
 similar to a crow in a mummy a 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.810
 werewolf trying to attack ritchie 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:43.320
 even able to become the moon 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.810
 among many more 18 when bill is 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.639
 adult is very successful as a writer of 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.440
 genre of terror and for his book called 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:53.010
 the claw wing with reference to 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.690
 equal glow of sthepen kings 19 in 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.880
 the book called the Dreamcatcher 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.410
 there's a reference to penny guys in the 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.479
 which reveal that he did not die 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.699
 protagonist of this book called Gary 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.770
 Jones is possessed by an evil being and 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:06.810
 taken to a warehouse to propagate 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.940
 a deadly virus in the lid of the deposit 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.800
 the seven names of the 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.720
 team of losers those who 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.180
 they faced that and there is a stain 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.550
 painted with spray that says appendix is 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.630
 I live and that's where I say but what 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.420
 cone 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.310
 20 while filming the movie on 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.560
 main actor tim curry was reading 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.750
 another book by stephen king that four 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.120
 years later it would also be adapted in 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:33.060
 miniseries format the book is 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.220
 apocalypse 21 the movie in his 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.740
 totality lasts 4 hours which is a total 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:42.210
 240 minutes but in different countries 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:44.130
 has been reduced to 140 thousand or less 22 it 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.440
 loses a great importance on a 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.390
 character called the turtle that is something 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.040
 essential of the book and that there are very many 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:53.310
 details about her while who 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:55.380
 writes 23 a group of punk 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:59.280
 North American put himself as pen name 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:01.140
 guys 24 in the novel it is revealed that 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.450
 in its spider form it is a female in 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:07.020
 pregnancy status this is not mentioned 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:08.850
 in telefilme 25 all were omitted 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.680
 the elements of gore violence and 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:14.400
 explicit sexuality that are 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.800
 present in the novel 26 in the first 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.210
 number of the fourth story arc 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.490
 fallout gilead from the dark tower comic 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:23.220
 a box appears with the image of a 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:26.160
 clown almost identical to penny guys 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.110
 27 according to a psychological study the 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.840
 most people who saw her years more 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.640
 Later I felt rejection towards clowns and 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:36.360
 a smaller part of people 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:38.280
 terrorized the series that 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.710
 they are and his wife see before this one 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:44.070
 he committed suicide was the very famous in the 80s 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:45.900
 distant cousins 29 who came to the 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.670
 conclusion that his story is only 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.860
 could adapt decently for the 

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:52.950
 television divided into two chapters of 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:56.460
 100 minutes each the adaptation was 

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:58.500
 carried out in 1990 4 years after 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.690
 the publication of the novel ran to 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:04.020
 Director Tommy Lee Wallace's charge 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:05.880
 disciple of john carpenter 30 and by 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.670
 last there are many versions with three 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.320
 dubbing different one of them in a 

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:12.300
 reduced version in which the two 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:16.110
 parts of the film together they added 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:19.310
 180,000 well subscribe share and 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.310
