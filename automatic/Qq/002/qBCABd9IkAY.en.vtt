00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.930
 If you 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.930
 all right 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.920
 ah 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:40.579
 good morning, I am a virginia pastry chef today 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.329
 let's make a mandala 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.329
 First 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.960
 we have the material ready and we draw 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.960
 a circle 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.950
 more or less we will get better or worse 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.370
 we mark the part d 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.610
 the part of the paper that has to go 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.610
 upwards 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.539
 we breathe 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.500
 we found we closed our eyes 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.920
 and whatever comes to us we begin to 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.920
 to draw 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.980
 we let it flow 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.980
 let our ideas flow without censorship 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.200
 if required 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.960
 we will answer the pen and we will begin 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.960
 directly with the paintings 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:14.750
 good as we are doing mandalas 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.739
 we will realize that more series of 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.739
 elements 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.120
 colors of repeating shapes 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:37.360
 we remember to breathe trying 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.360
 always breathing with all the lung 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.850
 always a few seconds more than what 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:46.200
 generally we usually and we expel 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.200
 slowly the air 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.920
 preferably 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:55.300
 we breathe in through the nose 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.300
 we press through the mouth 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.560
 it is likely that while we are 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.650
 drawing, let's go looking for justification 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.920
 of the things we do justification 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.920
 rational 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.900
 especially if it's the first time 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.479
 we decided we we the people 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.660
 sit down for a while to draw what we 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:54.910
 come out, nothing happens, it's like 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.850
 as meditation in fact we 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:01.350
 another way of meditating that is leaving 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.300
 flow thoughts can come 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.080
 in fact the thoughts will come 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.080
 rational will come 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:14.580
 simply without judging we let them pass 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.690
 one thing that usually works a lot 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.909
 is to imagine ourselves as blocks of 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:27.949
 words for example very well the 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:27.949
 Repetitive rational thinking 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:34.330
 if those if they are repetitive is a signal 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.590
 that are false thoughts 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.669
 then I come for example the 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.669
 repetitive thought of 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.560
 we'll see 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.169
 I should not be doing anything else 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.520
 I should be worrying right now 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:52.050
 d 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:56.100
 I think, for example, visualized the 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:58.440
 word to occupy me but I think 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.840
 how 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.020
 as an entity is to say what the letters 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.020
 be an entity 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.020
 take care 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:15.090
 and I slip 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:17.650
 through the nooks 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.810
 of the letter 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.759
 when it ceases to be a concept and passes to 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.630
 being an object is much simpler is 

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:24.630
 catch on to it 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:29.889
 good 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.110
 when we believe that we have finished 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.590
 we see if we want to do something else 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:54.319
 Now that my daughters are more angry 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:54.319
 the mountains plus mountains plus mountains 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:00.830
 agree once we have decided 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.830
 let's 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:06.480
 go over it with ink
