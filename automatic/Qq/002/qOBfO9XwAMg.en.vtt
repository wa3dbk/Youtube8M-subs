00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.120
 hi how about youtube friends i am 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:06.220
 hungry july and today we are going to 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.200
 do the review of this bag 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.360
 protective against water for our 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.830
 Android device if you want to see how 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.660
 it works and if you want to see the tests 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.010
 what am I going to do with it then stay 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.010
 in this video that we already started 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.130
 and good friends of youtube like them 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.290
 I wanted to bring something different to the channel 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.630
 I bring you the revised of this little bag 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.550
 which is for our smartphone and this is 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.680
 water resistant you are going to 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.380
 can find in this presentation in 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.140
 any tea in stores steren if that 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.270
 you live in mexico and the article 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.640
 it costs approximately 5 dollars that are 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.770
 like 70 pesos in Mexican currency in the 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.050
 Sachet box tells us that it is 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.930
 compatible with devices like 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.629
 iphone 5 or galaxy s3 of alak 74 galaxy s 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.480
 4 mini and gives us other models of 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.130
 reference although I think that as well as 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.559
 As I told you before, this does not work 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.149
 reference but I feel that our 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.390
 Sachet could fit any phone 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:07.149
 maybe I have my doubts about whether a 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.280
 cable is like a galaxy note 3 a galaxy 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:12.130
 no 4 but for you to give yourself a 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.290
 idea of ​​the size of this so here I put 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.290
 my phone that is a galaxy s 4 mini 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.240
 next to the bag as you can see then 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.610
 It fits perfectly and still 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.430
 There's a little space left over. I think a 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.750
 device maybe about 5 inches 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.940
 that would have perfectly with 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.320
 to make the video longer and of 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.360
 try before the case before 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.280
 show it to you, I've done the 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.960
 unboxing unboxing behind 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.600
 cameras do not make you see it 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.340
 but this is what includes us since the 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.800
 funda is that we are 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.360
 showing us includes the sachet 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.869
 that is where we are going to put our 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.820
 phone 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.580
 the brooch that serves to close the bag 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.790
 and good this includes us as the 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.229
 plastic that is used to hang the strap 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.270
 that also includes a strap that 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.040
 is what you are seeing here this serves 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.720
 to hang not only the neck and then 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.360
 be able to transport it everywhere without 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.009
 need to bring in hand because 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.899
 this would be all that what we're going to 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.209
 can also find, then, the 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.340
 typical user manuals in which 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.170
 gives us instructions on how to put together 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.110
 our product and some warnings 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.180
 The brooch must be placed on the 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.980
 bag and good this serves to close it 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.290
 how can you see that we slide it from 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.820
 this way the bag and well done 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.860
 you can not see at this time 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.470
 but the bag is already open and with 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.570
 we pull it out because it's going to open 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.010
 and when we make the brooch 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.620
 to the right 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.470
 already locked the brooch is very 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.540
 important since it's going to allow this 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.970
 adhere to nothing with the other part of 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.290
 the bag and in this way 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.209
 completely to avoid the passage of 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.860
 water and good as I told them not to swim 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.569
 more and we're going to be reviewed of the cover 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.129
 but we were also going to try it 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.170
 now let's put our device 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:53.030
 in it to then submerge it in water 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.690
 the only thing that we should do 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.930
 it is to put it by the top 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.670
 once the sleeve is open and 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.959
 well with the brooch that is very 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.489
 important that we do it with care 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.769
 because if we can not stay without 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.959
 phone with the brooch the only thing 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.810
 we have to do is slide it and when 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.000
 click this will be ready once 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.440
 because there already clicked the cover it 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.140
 only thing that we should do is 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.530
 take the plastic 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.780
 and put it folding the bag of this 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.390
 This will also help us 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.400
 that the water does not pass 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.400
 and well now I can not put it 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.260
 and there and the phone would be 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.820
 prepared to submerge it in good water 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.500
 friends and youtube before going to try the 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.600
 I wanted to mention an aspect 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.730
 very important about it and is that 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.290
 when we do not have placed 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.330
 we will be able to move in a very 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.820
 normal with our device we are going to 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.890
 be able to make and receive calls and even 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.540
 taking pictures this seemed very 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.430
 interesting since the plastic that is 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.920
 about him is not an impediment for 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.600
 let's do it the time has come for the 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.490
 the time has come to put 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.070
 our phone the water as you can see 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.170
 here it is and well, it barely covers me 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.610
 the fingers and good our phone 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.770
 we will also put it to record 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.330
 while we put in the water because of 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.070
 this way, you will be able to see 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.140
 here on the small screen that I'm going 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.150
 to put how the recording looks under 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.310
 of the water with this good cover because it 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.040
 add a moment let's put the 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.790
 recording said and well then let's 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.790
 choose it 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.440
 emerging 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.980
 together 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:45.710
 because it is that if it is working 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.880
 ok well a contest is coming 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.900
 to do so the only thing that yes that the 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.590
 phone that is pressing is 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.960
 pressing the zoom button to the 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.870
 screen because due to the pressure of the 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.000
 water presses the device and then as 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.420
 It is very sensitive because that's why it 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.610
 they press the keys automatically 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.469
 how can you see the shelves 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.560
 It is not nothing going on water 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:15.169
 device you can see inside no 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.969
 there's absolutely good water friends 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.310
 of YouTube since we have already taken our 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:21.650
 water phone and as you can see it is 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.750
 fully functional and dry something yes 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.370
 It is very important to mention that for 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.110
 not if the purchase is not going to 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.389
 fail is that is when the agents 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.520
 they have to dry very well the cover 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:33.289
 from the device to the bag for 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.050
 that when you do this and take out the 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:38.090
 device does not get wet and has no 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.680
 type of contact with water do not forget 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.629
