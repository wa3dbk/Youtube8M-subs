the<00:00:27.449> thickness<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:28.199> pretty<00:00:28.920> thick<00:00:29.449> let's<00:00:30.449> get

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
the thickness is pretty thick let's get

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.020 
the thickness is pretty thick let's get
a<00:00:30.720> sort<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:33.590> an<00:00:34.590> idea<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.280> how<00:00:35.489> thick<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:35.940> is

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
a sort of an idea of how thick it is

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.600 
a sort of an idea of how thick it is
here's<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.630> USB<00:00:37.170> cable<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:38.070> know<00:00:38.250> pretty

here's the USB cable you know pretty

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.920 
here's the USB cable you know pretty
standard<00:00:39.270> now<00:00:40.079> let's<00:00:40.290> compared<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.920> phone

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
standard now let's compared to the phone
