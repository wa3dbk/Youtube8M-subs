have no problem at all with this mixed
you<00:03:19.510> it<00:03:20.020> would<00:03:20.140> taste<00:03:20.770> just<00:03:21.010> like<00:03:21.130> any<00:03:21.370> other

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459

gin<00:03:21.880> but<00:03:22.660> on<00:03:22.870> its<00:03:23.080> own<00:03:23.200> it<00:03:23.380> just<00:03:23.530> has<00:03:23.680> some<00:03:23.890> off

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
gin but on its own it just has some off

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.480 
gin but on its own it just has some off
flavors<00:03:24.610> and<00:03:24.790> it's<00:03:24.910> just<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:26.440> doesn't<00:03:27.010> taste

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 
flavors and it's just it doesn't taste
