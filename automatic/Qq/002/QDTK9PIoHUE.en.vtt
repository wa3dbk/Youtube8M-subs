00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:06.849
 good to all I am art and we are here 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:09.250
 in a new video as is another species 

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:11.080
 of blog as the special but good today 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.610
 it's not to do any kind of special 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.320
 of nothing is only for 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.630
 notify them as you will have seen in the 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.920
 title about the manga room of 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:23.470
 barcelona as you know then from the day 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.930
 Thursday I believe then not from the 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.000
 Wednesday I remember until Sunday 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.610
 There is a blanket lounge in Barcelona 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.250
 where then he has talked about things 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.809
 related to manga and anime and 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.699
 Well, I'll go through there, that's the 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.550
 news of this video I'm recording myself 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:41.519
 so as you can imagine because I 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.690
 I'm training to blog 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.210
 I will try to do some kind of blog 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.100
 some little thing to see yes 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.050
 well more or less the lighting is a 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.879
 little strange but good the question is 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.829
 that I will try to do some kind of blog 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.470
 of some little thing so I keep myself with 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.420
 the arm up to record well and 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.040
 I 'm getting used to it good as I say 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.769
 the point is that I'll be around and 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.199
 tomorrow Saturday I will arrive more or less towards 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:08.409
 10 o'clock in the morning and I'll be 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.390
 4 o'clock in the afternoon, approximately 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.890
 that you already know if you are out there 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.409
 you can leave a comment this video and 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.240
 so I'll know and if you see me then do not doubt 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.580
 in greeting me or telling me any kind 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.580
 of things we were hilarious if you go 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:25.650
 would be the first person to recognize 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.900
 the second or third I think you fix 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.000
 because in the institute someone someone 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.680
 has recognized me but not officially if 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.050
 is the first person we could say 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.110
 and well, that will happen to me there 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.050
 you know how I am and you see my face like that 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.430
 that you know how to recognize I guess 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.310
 I will try to go to the best with a T-shirt 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.729
 with and then over here that put the logo 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.280
 of the channel in the art of graft is worth 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.229
 the case with the blue color 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.270
 I will try then if I can do a 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.800
 shirt with me then and if not then nothing 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.040
 no matter what the face you know how I have it 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.330
 so you can recognize me from there and 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.890

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.130
