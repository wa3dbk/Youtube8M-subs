00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
heists now this is something that I

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.350 
heists now this is something that I
hadn't<00:00:13.440> really<00:00:13.650> considered<00:00:14.190> in<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.759> past<00:00:15.000> I

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
hadn't really considered in the past I

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.970 
hadn't really considered in the past I
always<00:00:15.540> assume<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.049> rock<00:00:16.199> star<00:00:16.410> was<00:00:16.560> just<00:00:16.830> you

always assume the rock star was just you
know<00:00:17.010> maybe<00:00:17.340> in<00:00:17.580> over<00:00:17.789> their<00:00:17.970> heads<00:00:18.180> or

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
know maybe in over their heads or

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.640 
know maybe in over their heads or
something<00:00:18.660> like<00:00:18.779> that<00:00:18.840> where<00:00:19.199> they<00:00:19.410> just

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
something like that where they just

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.140 
something like that where they just
didn't<00:00:19.920> realize<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.400> time<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.820> they<00:00:20.910> needed

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
didn't realize the time that they needed

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.820 
didn't realize the time that they needed
to<00:00:21.270> pull<00:00:21.570> off<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.900> heists<00:00:22.320> but<00:00:22.650> then<00:00:22.740> I

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
to pull off the heists but then I

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.259 
to pull off the heists but then I
started<00:00:23.039> thinking<00:00:23.519> about<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:23.730> what<00:00:24.150> if

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
started thinking about it what if

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.790 
started thinking about it what if
there's<00:00:24.449> something<00:00:24.720> more<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.350> what<00:00:25.680> if

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
there's something more to it what if

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.140 
there's something more to it what if
there's<00:00:25.949> almost<00:00:26.160> like<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.400> whole<00:00:26.789> conspiracy

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
there's almost like a whole conspiracy

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.910 
there's almost like a whole conspiracy
behind<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:28.050> because<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.500> might<00:00:28.650> think<00:00:28.800> to

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
behind it because you might think to

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.290 
behind it because you might think to
yourself<00:00:28.949> okay<00:00:29.550> why<00:00:29.820> would<00:00:30.000> they<00:00:30.119> ever

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
yourself okay why would they ever

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.269 
yourself okay why would they ever
intentionally<00:00:30.869> delay<00:00:31.380> heists<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:31.980> going<00:00:32.219> to

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
intentionally delay heists is going to

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.200 
intentionally delay heists is going to
be<00:00:32.340> one<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.610> biggest<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.940> grand<00:00:33.120> theft

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
auto updates ever definitely one of the

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.280 
auto updates ever definitely one of the
most<00:00:35.130> anticipated<00:00:35.370> updates<00:00:36.329> ever<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:37.110> why

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
most anticipated updates ever so why

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.600

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.229 
well I sat down I thought about it and I
came<00:00:40.890> up<00:00:41.040> with<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.219> theory<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.730> may<00:00:42.059> or<00:00:42.210> may

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
came up with a theory that may or may

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.729 
came up with a theory that may or may
not<00:00:42.360> be<00:00:42.570> true<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:43.110> know<00:00:43.230> we'll<00:00:43.410> never<00:00:43.590> really

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
not be true you know we'll never really

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.500 
not be true you know we'll never really
know<00:00:43.860> rock<00:00:44.160> stars<00:00:44.399> true<00:00:44.700> motives<00:00:45.059> behind<00:00:45.239> it

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
people would want to do but by not

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.590 
people would want to do but by not
telling<00:02:32.250> us<00:02:32.490> and<00:02:32.700> releasing<00:02:33.210> it<00:02:33.210> out<00:02:33.420> of

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
telling us and releasing it out of

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.300 
telling us and releasing it out of
nowhere<00:02:33.780> they're<00:02:34.410> completely<00:02:34.770> catching<00:02:35.190> us

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
nowhere they're completely catching us

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.920 
nowhere they're completely catching us
off<00:02:35.430> guard<00:02:35.490> I<00:02:35.910> mean<00:02:36.120> obviously<00:02:36.450> in<00:02:36.630> this<00:02:36.720> case

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
off guard I mean obviously in this case

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.750 
off guard I mean obviously in this case
the<00:02:37.140> hipster<00:02:37.440> update<00:02:37.710> did<00:02:37.980> leak<00:02:38.280> ahead<00:02:38.640> of

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
the hipster update did leak ahead of

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.340 
the hipster update did leak ahead of
time<00:02:38.970> but<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.660> know<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:40.020> weren't<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.320> case

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
time but you know that weren't the case

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.050 
time but you know that weren't the case
we<00:02:40.740> wouldn't<00:02:40.920> have<00:02:41.070> even<00:02:41.220> known<00:02:41.460> about<00:02:41.610> it<00:02:41.850> and

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
we wouldn't have even known about it and

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.460 
we wouldn't have even known about it and
then<00:02:42.180> that's<00:02:42.390> really<00:02:42.510> what<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:42.990> boils<00:02:43.020> down<00:02:43.320> to

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
then that's really what it boils down to

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.650 
then that's really what it boils down to
when<00:02:44.190> they<00:02:44.310> catch<00:02:44.460> us<00:02:44.640> off<00:02:44.820> guard<00:02:44.850> and<00:02:45.420> you

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
when they catch us off guard and you

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.000 
when they catch us off guard and you
know<00:02:45.780> we<00:02:45.930> expect<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.350> have<00:02:46.440> money<00:02:46.680> that<00:02:46.920> we

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
know we expect to have money that we

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.190 
know we expect to have money that we
just<00:02:47.190> don't<00:02:47.430> have<00:02:47.700> we<00:02:48.210> end<00:02:48.420> up<00:02:48.600> buying<00:02:48.810> shark

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
just don't have we end up buying shark

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.690 
just don't have we end up buying shark
cards<00:02:49.560> well<00:02:49.830> I<00:02:49.860> mean<00:02:50.040> personally<00:02:50.520> I've<00:02:50.670> never

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
cards well I mean personally I've never

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.370 
cards well I mean personally I've never
bought<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.180> shark<00:02:51.480> card<00:02:51.720> but<00:02:51.960> I<00:02:51.990> know<00:02:52.110> there's

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
bought a shark card but I know there's

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.350 
bought a shark card but I know there's
some<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.680> guys<00:02:52.830> that<00:02:53.070> do<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:53.790> I<00:02:53.820> think<00:02:54.210> that

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
some of you guys that do so I think that

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.790 
some of you guys that do so I think that
is<00:02:54.480> really<00:02:54.630> what<00:02:54.810> this<00:02:54.960> all<00:02:55.170> comes<00:02:55.200> down<00:02:55.590> to

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
is really what this all comes down to

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.920 
is really what this all comes down to
they<00:02:56.310> know<00:02:56.460> that<00:02:56.580> by<00:02:56.700> delaying<00:02:57.060> heists<00:02:57.570> money

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
they know that by delaying heists money

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.360 
they know that by delaying heists money
is<00:02:58.050> going<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.260> be<00:02:58.320> harder<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.650> come<00:02:58.920> by<00:02:58.950> and

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
is going to be harder to come by and

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.250 
is going to be harder to come by and
we're<00:02:59.910> more<00:03:00.120> likely<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.570> go<00:03:00.810> out<00:03:00.960> and<00:03:01.140> spend

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
we're more likely to go out and spend

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.170 
we're more likely to go out and spend
our<00:03:01.470> real-world<00:03:01.710> money<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:02.520> make<00:03:02.700> Rockstar

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
our real-world money and make Rockstar

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.030 
our real-world money and make Rockstar
Games<00:03:03.360> more<00:03:03.930> money<00:03:04.200> that's<00:03:04.560> that's<00:03:04.800> really

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
Games more money that's that's really

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.530 
Games more money that's that's really
what<00:03:05.160> it<00:03:05.250> comes<00:03:05.400> down<00:03:05.520> to<00:03:05.820> Rockstar<00:03:06.360> Games

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
what it comes down to Rockstar Games

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.750 
what it comes down to Rockstar Games
making<00:03:07.290> more<00:03:07.530> money<00:03:07.740> because<00:03:08.460> once<00:03:08.640> they

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
making more money because once they

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.310 
making more money because once they
released<00:03:09.060> heists<00:03:09.450> people<00:03:09.840> are<00:03:09.990> going<00:03:10.140> to<00:03:10.200> have

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
released heists people are going to have

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.810 
released heists people are going to have
more<00:03:10.470> money<00:03:10.680> it's<00:03:11.010> going<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.220> be<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.310> fun<00:03:11.610> way<00:03:11.790> to

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
more money it's going to be a fun way to

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.940 
more money it's going to be a fun way to
earn<00:03:12.270> you<00:03:12.570> know<00:03:12.690> forty<00:03:13.170> thousand<00:03:13.530> dollars<00:03:13.770> or

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
earn you know forty thousand dollars or

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.950 
earn you know forty thousand dollars or
whatever<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.370> payout<00:03:14.610> ends<00:03:14.910> up<00:03:15.030> being<00:03:15.240> so

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
whatever the payout ends up being so

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.600 
whatever the payout ends up being so
they<00:03:16.110> know<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.470> longer<00:03:16.680> they<00:03:16.920> delay<00:03:17.190> heists

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
they know the longer they delay heists

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.250 
they know the longer they delay heists
the<00:03:17.970> more<00:03:18.150> money<00:03:18.360> they'll<00:03:18.540> make<00:03:18.720> off<00:03:18.930> of<00:03:18.959> their

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
the more money they'll make off of their

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.960 
the more money they'll make off of their
shark<00:03:19.560> cards<00:03:19.890> and<00:03:20.220> like<00:03:20.550> I<00:03:20.670> said<00:03:20.730> their

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
shark cards and like I said their

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.400 
shark cards and like I said their
strategy<00:03:21.450> is<00:03:21.630> to<00:03:21.660> keep<00:03:21.780> telling<00:03:22.200> us<00:03:22.260> that

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
strategy is to keep telling us that

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.990 
strategy is to keep telling us that
heists<00:03:22.800> are<00:03:22.890> right<00:03:23.100> around<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.400> corner<00:03:23.430> that

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
heists are right around the corner that

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.280 
heists are right around the corner that
way<00:03:24.150> we<00:03:24.330> don't<00:03:24.450> think<00:03:24.720> that<00:03:24.840> we<00:03:24.900> have<00:03:25.020> to<00:03:25.110> grind

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
way we don't think that we have to grind

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.380 
way we don't think that we have to grind
missions<00:03:25.740> we<00:03:26.160> say<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.400> ourselves<00:03:26.550> oh<00:03:26.940> hi<00:03:27.150> still

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
missions we say to ourselves oh hi still

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.850 
missions we say to ourselves oh hi still
be<00:03:27.540> out<00:03:27.660> soon<00:03:27.900> I'll<00:03:28.170> just<00:03:28.320> play<00:03:28.470> those<00:03:28.680> when

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860

be out soon I'll just play those when
they<00:03:28.980> come<00:03:29.160> out<00:03:29.190> so<00:03:29.790> that<00:03:29.970> way<00:03:30.090> we<00:03:30.330> never<00:03:30.540> have

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
they come out so that way we never have

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.750 
they come out so that way we never have
mass<00:03:31.170> quantities<00:03:31.860> of<00:03:31.890> money<00:03:32.220> because<00:03:32.490> we're

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
mass quantities of money because we're

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.949 
mass quantities of money because we're
always<00:03:32.880> thinking<00:03:33.120> that<00:03:33.390> heist<00:03:33.540> will<00:03:33.720> be<00:03:33.840> out

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
always thinking that heist will be out

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.810 
always thinking that heist will be out
next<00:03:33.990> month<00:03:34.530> next<00:03:34.770> week<00:03:35.070> whatever<00:03:35.370> have<00:03:35.790> you

this<00:03:38.070> commentary<00:03:38.610> I<00:03:38.790> actually<00:03:39.090> convinced

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
this commentary I actually convinced

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.600 
this commentary I actually convinced
myself<00:03:39.810> that<00:03:40.320> this<00:03:40.530> is<00:03:40.680> what's<00:03:40.860> going<00:03:41.040> on<00:03:41.250> you

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
myself that this is what's going on you

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:42.500 
myself that this is what's going on you
know<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.850> beginning<00:03:42.120> of<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.270> video<00:03:42.450> I

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
know the beginning of the video I

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.880 
know the beginning of the video I
thought<00:03:42.750> to<00:03:42.900> myself<00:03:42.989> hey<00:03:43.320> it's<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.590> possibility

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
thought to myself hey it's a possibility

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.130 
thought to myself hey it's a possibility
but<00:03:44.640> now<00:03:44.760> after<00:03:44.940> talking<00:03:45.270> about<00:03:45.540> it<00:03:45.780> out<00:03:45.900> loud

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
but now after talking about it out loud

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.260 
but now after talking about it out loud
I<00:03:46.440> feel<00:03:46.920> like<00:03:47.130> this<00:03:47.370> is<00:03:47.520> truly<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.000> case

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
I feel like this is truly the case

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.090 
I feel like this is truly the case
because<00:03:48.630> heists<00:03:49.260> don't<00:03:49.620> seem<00:03:49.830> like<00:03:49.860> they

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
because heists don't seem like they

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.830 
because heists don't seem like they
should<00:03:50.340> be<00:03:50.430> this<00:03:50.580> complicated<00:03:50.820> I<00:03:51.390> mean<00:03:51.600> in<00:03:51.750> the

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
should be this complicated I mean in the

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.060 
should be this complicated I mean in the
time<00:03:52.020> that<00:03:52.050> rockstar<00:03:52.560> has<00:03:52.590> been<00:03:52.800> saying

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
time that rockstar has been saying

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.650 
time that rockstar has been saying
they're<00:03:53.280> going<00:03:53.459> to<00:03:53.520> put<00:03:53.640> out<00:03:53.730> heists<00:03:54.180> they've

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
they're going to put out heists they've

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.290 
they're going to put out heists they've
released<00:03:54.840> multiple<00:03:55.500> DLCs<00:03:56.010> tons<00:03:56.459> of<00:03:56.640> cars<00:03:56.880> new

missions<00:03:57.720> knew<00:03:57.930> everything<00:03:58.350> and<00:03:58.709> yet<00:03:59.160> they

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
missions knew everything and yet they

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.160 
missions knew everything and yet they
can't<00:03:59.640> do<00:03:59.820> this<00:03:59.970> little<00:04:00.239> game<00:04:00.660> mode<00:04:00.959> where

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
can't do this little game mode where

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.690 
can't do this little game mode where
you're<00:04:01.350> going<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:01.560> rob<00:04:01.800> some<00:04:02.130> place<00:04:02.370> with<00:04:02.550> your

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
you're going to rob some place with your

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.520 
you're going to rob some place with your
friends<00:04:03.120> I<00:04:03.300> mean<00:04:03.630> it<00:04:03.780> seems<00:04:03.989> like<00:04:04.080> something

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
friends I mean it seems like something

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.340 
friends I mean it seems like something
that<00:04:04.560> should<00:04:04.680> be<00:04:05.060> pretty<00:04:06.060> relatively<00:04:06.780> easy<00:04:07.200> to

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
that should be pretty relatively easy to

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.440 
that should be pretty relatively easy to
program<00:04:07.680> and<00:04:08.220> you<00:04:08.310> know<00:04:08.340> I<00:04:08.459> know<00:04:08.580> no<00:04:08.940> program

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
program and you know I know no program

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.820 
program and you know I know no program
or<00:04:09.600> anything<00:04:09.930> but<00:04:10.080> I<00:04:10.140> really<00:04:10.560> do<00:04:10.650> not<00:04:10.770> feel

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
or anything but I really do not feel

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.770 
or anything but I really do not feel
like<00:04:11.010> it<00:04:11.160> should<00:04:11.340> be<00:04:11.370> taking<00:04:11.760> this<00:04:11.880> long<00:04:11.940> and<00:04:12.690> I

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
like it should be taking this long and I

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:13.910 
like it should be taking this long and I
feel<00:04:12.930> like<00:04:13.050> this<00:04:13.170> is<00:04:13.290> all<00:04:13.380> just<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:13.770> big

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
feel like this is all just a big

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.710 
feel like this is all just a big

maybe<00:04:19.859> I'm<00:04:20.010> way<00:04:20.190> off<00:04:20.220> here<00:04:20.580> but<00:04:20.940> I<00:04:21.299> just<00:04:21.539> I

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
maybe I'm way off here but I just I

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.620 
maybe I'm way off here but I just I
truly<00:04:22.289> believe<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:23.160> it<00:04:23.729> just<00:04:24.180> makes<00:04:24.330> perfect

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
truly believe the it just makes perfect

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
sense you know this whole situation just

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
sense you know this whole situation just
seems<00:04:26.520> a<00:04:26.610> little<00:04:26.789> bit<00:04:27.000> too

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
seems a little bit too

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.909 
seems a little bit too
fishy<00:04:27.479> that<00:04:27.870> they<00:04:28.020> would<00:04:28.199> delay<00:04:28.440> a<00:04:28.470> single

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
nine months it didn't even take them

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.159 
nine months it didn't even take them
that<00:04:32.520> long<00:04:32.580> to<00:04:32.759> delay<00:04:33.210> grand<00:04:33.539> theft<00:04:33.690> out<00:04:33.840> of<00:04:33.990> 5

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
that long to delay grand theft out of 5

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.020 
that long to delay grand theft out of 5
