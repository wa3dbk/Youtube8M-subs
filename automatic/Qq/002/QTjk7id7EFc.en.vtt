 tasty ferrari every now and then 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.800
 These are all sorts of conscious phones and why they do that 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.140

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.369

 nor shore in your hand as far as she is concerned and that's it then 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.930

 and he turns on and then 2 2 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.920
 that says this phone has little surprising what is surprising is that 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.370
 He has really made an effort to make the interface something special 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.720
 You can see that the moment is now up 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.070
 you get an overview of the latest incidents 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.070
 missed more and have news items 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.900

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.410

 but other and never own music play a music player who has a race 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.900
 installed that no one has player and with that you can play music and photos and 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.470
 play videos 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.820
 there is a few spinlets application with which you can play music via internet 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.770
 streaming from various artists 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.190
 of course there is also a camera and a separate ken corner 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.520
 so that you can also take photos and record videos 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.520
 and the camera has no effect 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.500
 d 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.010

 party your own twitter application napoli is also just there 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:22.979
 the user experience the most experienced were five rooms 

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:26.689
 I find the menu to be pleasant which took a lot of getting used to 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:30.839
 scroll horizontally and then up and down again depending on 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:32.159
 what exactly you want to do 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.649
 but perhaps you can get used to it 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:38.489
 de and looking for a decent phone for a reasonable price 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.909
 then this phone with 249 euros is not a bad choice at all 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:47.279
 but note that the camera is really bad and that you will 

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:48.119
 have to get used to the menu
