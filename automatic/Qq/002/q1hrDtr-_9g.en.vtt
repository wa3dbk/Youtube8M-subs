00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.950
 to 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:13.600
 hello good friends here with another video 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:17.860
 complementary the review of iphone 5 of 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.869
 this way I want to show you this how 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.110
 use to send panoramic photos 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:25.990
 take panoramic photos in the other video 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.210
 We did not miss it because it was very long 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.430
 video and we could not cover everything but 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.070
 here I bring you a demonstration of how 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.530
 make ringtones for your iphone through 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.750
 from the garage perm I'm going to show you the 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.300
 graphics of games that the iphone 5 brings 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.190
 how they look now and will also show you 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.989
 how to take panoramic photos of a 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.329
 fast way because I've seen that many 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.610
 have complained that the photo does not come out 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.489
 very good but there is a little trick there 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.460
 what you have to do and go out perfect 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.380
 Remember if you like video please 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.290
 like your comments below 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.610
 ask and we want the thanks for 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.130
 all the comments that have left us 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.500
 we always read, we would like to respond 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.810
 everyone but it is difficult for us 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.090
 and good here the first thing I'm going to show is 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.399
 how to make ringtone 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.350
 for your phone through the garage 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:20.670
 band can buy it in the store by 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.520
 If I'm not wrong, I think it costs 499 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:28.130
 first thing they have to do is 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.130
 in this case to the little arrows here 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.440
 new song and you eat if you want 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.590
 be 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.280
 of drums or guitar piano in 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.540
 this case have used the piano 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.540
 and how do you see here 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.920
 reasoning that they can start recording 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.080
 you see that tac tac tac so it does not come out 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.890
 Recorded 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.650
 in your video 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.850
 or in their ringtones songs that they give to 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:04.250
 configurations 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.250
 go the songs and remove this 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.720
 metronome and counter 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.650
 they take it away 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.650
 and start here 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.830
 his sound 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:25.160
 what they want to give here to my 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.710
 songs 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.630
 let's have it and give it to edit in this 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.140
 plant selection is the reached that 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.050
 have done 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:38.610
 they will share and down in the option the 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:41.459
 salt and ringtone or tones there they save you 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.080
 they export as a song and there they 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.420
 is going to ask in Spanish what's going to come out 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.220
 how do you want to configure this sound that 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.690
 you just do you give him 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.880
 configure it as 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.190
 the normal corner of the phone as 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.040
 text message assign it in contact and 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.140
 There you have a ringtone that 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.270
 they just created you are your same music 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.880
 what you like 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.470
 and well now we 're going to the 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.590
 panoramic let's say back here 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.240
 briefly and show how the 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:15.250
 photo I took outside 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:18.340
 want options the panoramic 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:21.900
 they see here that little arrow 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.900
 how they think to take the photo 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.140
 the arrow and while tilting the 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.910
 phone the appetite goes up or down they have 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.670
 that try to keep the arrow in the 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.790
 line while they are moving if you 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.890
 move very fast he will tell you that you 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.280
 be a little slower 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.410
 but the 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.540
 As I tell you, the idea is to leave the 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.540
 flechita as much as I can in the middle 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.710
 tilting the phone up or 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.800
 down to come out a lot a lot 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:55.140
 better the panoramic and do not leave moved 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:59.850
 once they can end here or they can 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:01.530
 continue to complete almost 360 degrees but that 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:06.260
 is the trick that I wanted them 'yes and here 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.260
 I am going to leave you a sample photo 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.910
 another thing that they see that always begins to 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.380
 this left side to the right if 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.320
 they click on the arrows they can 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.100
 start from the other side 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:29.170
 but if the key is to leave the arrow 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.409
 more or less in the middle and do not avoid 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.479
 Quick 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:35.309
 tilting the phone up like 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.090
 more like it but leaving it in the 

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:39.660
 line 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.790
 and well, I leave you those tricks for 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.409
 panoramic and now let's show them a 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.719
 little bit of the graphs 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:49.599
 good this game that not all that 

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:52.059
 like configured by 26 although it 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:54.830
 can see the plants already complete in 

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:58.120
 this case yes 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.120
 to select here 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:06.430
 I think they see how the graphics look 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:09.220
 more or less three in a little 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.969
 we have in the graphs 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:15.439
 in this game the movements all 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:15.439
 when moving the phone 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.500
 I'm going to show another one 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:26.720
 this is also configured for 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.590
 see it in full screen with the 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.590
 Writer 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.010
 from like command 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:40.550
 to see 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:44.550
 when doing the movements 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:47.420
 the graphics do not stay frozen 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.420
 The overcoming 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.409
 I wanted to show you here and see how it looks 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:58.780
 in full screen they have to 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:06:01.720
 make sure the game is already 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:05.760
 for 6 that in this way 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.760
 can see on the whole screen 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.849
 I wanted to show you photographic and watching 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.179
 A) Yes 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:15.179
 of game 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:20.550
 Now I'm going to show you 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.420
 it's really the sport 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.700
 this an example that recreates you also see 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:31.060
 as 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:33.520
 the game does not look complete because this 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:37.870
 game is not yet configured for the 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:40.710
 mess is 6 and that way you see you do not see 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.710
 complete the game 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.870
 it's a little 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:49.580
 quick here the graphs can see me 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:52.340
 how the graphs look 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:56.440
 and a lot 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.440
 a little bit of everything a little 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.669
 super good 

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:04.369
