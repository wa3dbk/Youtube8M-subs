00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:14.070
 [Music] 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.740
 day 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.910
 roberto we had a very a presentation 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.470
 of the campus for the federal tournament 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.540
 we want to know how they are going through 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.100
 these weeks before the start of the 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.140
 championship and with the new expectations 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.380
 I imagine to be everything like 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.480
 presentation well the truth that well 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.360
 reaching the final instance of the 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.120
 very good preparation the anxiety that 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.250
 implies that I made a tournament of this 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.330
 magnitude that you can tell us about the 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.330
 new players who came 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.530
 before anything a very big commitment of 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.210
 them before the club 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.830
 and good some desire 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.270
 the tremendous desire to represent the 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.790
 club in this tournament if the time was 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.710
 very cute and they were edging the truth that 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.310
 it's something for those of us who want the club 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:22.140
 something very nice is something special that's why 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.580
 now represent it the shirt how 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.170
 they prepare for the federal tournament and 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.210
 what are the expectations of this 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.570
 team and training hard in very stretches 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.740
 hard all these weeks and the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.930
 expectations we have that the first 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.600
 to consolidate as yesterday the boys who 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.090
 they were in the past and the rest are 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:44.520
 the new ones in the club are giving us 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:47.820
 as a team we are very well very well 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.950
 I think we're ready to go little by little 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.679
 to go growing match by match for 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.100
 install them again in basketball 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.990
 national and good and the time to go to 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.300
 stop to see what we are for but 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.490
 we are working to be up 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.440
 also this team there are many guys 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.010
 young as we see them as captain 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.840
 as well 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.569
 we are also working with that 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.030
 it's difficult the tournament is very very hard very 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.250
 physical why the guys have to 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.410
 adapt quickly there is not much 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.510
 a lot of time to wait but they're 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.640
 We are also working with 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.519
 these programs also finally 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.900
 they are still missing a lot but to see the 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.459
 federal government gives them more and more 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.989
 to be able to continue to ascend and 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:34.340
 who tells you is actually national 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:36.260
 and logical the dream is renewed season to 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.150
 season the dream of the season 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.459
 last was to ascend to federal 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.799
 we changed the chip for our next 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.980
 dream is to take a little step and 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.900
 little bit to go carrying up duarte 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.599
 deserves and I think that is the goal 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.000
 ours and everyone in the club we follow 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.780
 playing adding player river tab and 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.579
 of course it is a premise that we are 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.950
 the truth that most fans of rivas 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.950
 and that we wear it with a lot of the shirt 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.640
 maybe the boy 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.750
 and you 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.750

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.470

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.750
