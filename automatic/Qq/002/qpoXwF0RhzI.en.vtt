00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
on the other side it slides right out

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.150 
on the other side it slides right out
once<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.930> get<00:01:25.140> once<00:01:25.440> you<00:01:25.560> have<00:01:25.680> some<00:01:25.890> slack

into the lever and then the lever back
onto<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.910> bike<00:02:00.119> you're<00:02:00.720> probably<00:02:00.930> gonna<00:02:01.110> need

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
onto the bike you're probably gonna need

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.290 
onto the bike you're probably gonna need
to<00:02:01.440> make<00:02:01.590> some<00:02:01.770> slack<00:02:02.040> up<00:02:02.280> on<00:02:02.430> on<00:02:02.700> both<00:02:03.000> sides

there<00:02:32.340> while<00:02:32.730> you<00:02:32.819> about<00:02:32.909> the<00:02:33.060> cap<00:02:33.239> off<00:02:36.890> well

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
there while you about the cap off well

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.069 
there while you about the cap off well
that's<00:02:38.159> a<00:02:38.250> pretty<00:02:38.370> simple<00:02:38.580> job<00:02:38.879> the<00:02:39.840> reason

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
that's a pretty simple job the reason

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.630 
that's a pretty simple job the reason
that<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.260> wanted<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.739> change<00:02:40.980> it<00:02:41.220> is<00:02:41.310> because

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
that I wanted to change it is because

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.199 
that I wanted to change it is because
when<00:02:41.940> my<00:02:42.150> bike<00:02:42.390> was<00:02:42.629> in<00:02:42.750> first<00:02:43.019> gear<00:02:43.349> and<00:02:44.209> with

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
when my bike was in first gear and with

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.850 
when my bike was in first gear and with
the<00:02:45.329> clutch<00:02:45.540> pulled<00:02:45.870> in<00:02:46.049> and<00:02:46.379> I<00:02:46.440> would<00:02:46.650> try<00:02:46.829> to

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
the clutch pulled in and I would try to

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.819 
the clutch pulled in and I would try to
start<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:48.000> would<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.450> would<00:02:48.569> act<00:02:48.810> like<00:02:49.110> it

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
start it you would it would act like it

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.819 
start it you would it would act like it
had<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.040> hard<00:02:50.280> time<00:02:50.579> doing<00:02:50.940> that<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:52.680> I<00:02:52.769> think

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
had a hard time doing that and I think

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.619 
had a hard time doing that and I think
it<00:02:53.040> was<00:02:53.159> because<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.970> cable<00:02:54.209> was<00:02:54.450> so

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
it was because the the cable was so

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:56.740 
it was because the the cable was so
stretched<00:02:55.019> out<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.470> loose<00:02:55.650> that<00:02:55.950> it<00:02:56.099> wasn't

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
stretched out and loose that it wasn't

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.330 
stretched out and loose that it wasn't
the<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.989> clutch<00:02:58.170> wasn't<00:02:58.560> disengaging<00:02:59.190> all

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
the the clutch wasn't disengaging all

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.059 
the the clutch wasn't disengaging all
the<00:02:59.430> way<00:02:59.579> so<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:00.959> kind<00:03:01.260> of<00:03:01.349> was<00:03:01.650> having<00:03:01.859> to

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
the way so it kind of was having to

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.180 
the way so it kind of was having to
force<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.670> gears<00:03:03.260> it<00:03:04.260> was<00:03:04.379> like<00:03:04.500> halfway<00:03:05.010> or

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
force the gears it was like halfway or

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.539 
force the gears it was like halfway or
three-quarters<00:03:05.819> of<00:03:05.849> the<00:03:06.000> way<00:03:06.090> in<00:03:06.329> or<00:03:06.569> whatever

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
three-quarters of the way in or whatever

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.099 
three-quarters of the way in or whatever
and<00:03:08.549> also<00:03:08.970> when<00:03:09.120> I<00:03:09.150> when<00:03:09.599> I<00:03:09.659> was<00:03:09.780> letting<00:03:10.049> the

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
and also when I when I was letting the

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.830 
and also when I when I was letting the
clutch<00:03:10.290> out<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.159> bike<00:03:11.340> wouldn't<00:03:11.840> engage

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
clutch out the the bike wouldn't engage

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.449 
clutch out the the bike wouldn't engage
you<00:03:13.200> know<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.379> water<00:03:13.590> wouldn't<00:03:13.829> engage<00:03:14.190> and

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
you know the water wouldn't engage and

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.300 
you know the water wouldn't engage and
tell<00:03:14.640> him<00:03:14.730> right<00:03:14.940> at<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.150> end<00:03:15.329> so<00:03:16.220> maybe<00:03:17.220> I

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
tell him right at the end so maybe I

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.280 
tell him right at the end so maybe I
could<00:03:17.430> have<00:03:17.549> adjusted<00:03:17.640> that<00:03:18.060> a<00:03:18.120> little<00:03:18.420> bit<00:03:18.569> on

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
could have adjusted that a little bit on

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.500 
could have adjusted that a little bit on
the<00:03:19.859> bottom<00:03:20.040> in<00:03:20.370> but<00:03:20.609> on<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.819> top<00:03:21.030> end<00:03:21.239> it<00:03:21.359> was

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
the bottom in but on the top end it was

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.949 
the bottom in but on the top end it was
maxed<00:03:21.930> out<00:03:22.049> and<00:03:22.290> so<00:03:22.879> figure<00:03:23.879> it's<00:03:24.540> good<00:03:24.810> a<00:03:24.840> new

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
maxed out and so figure it's good a new

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.419 
maxed out and so figure it's good a new
one<00:03:25.109> in<00:03:25.260> so<00:03:25.980> I<00:03:26.310> hope<00:03:26.519> that<00:03:26.700> helped<00:03:27.000> somebody
