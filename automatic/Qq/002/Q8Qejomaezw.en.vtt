Series<00:00:31.410> ice<00:00:31.590> machines<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.550> they're

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
Series ice machines is that they're

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.910 
Series ice machines is that they're
extremely<00:00:33.360> easy<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.750> clean<00:00:34.079> as<00:00:34.440> well<00:00:34.739> as

the<00:00:42.239> inside<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.660> ice<00:00:42.750> machine<00:00:43.160> we<00:00:44.160> like<00:00:44.340> to

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
the inside the ice machine we like to

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.830 
the inside the ice machine we like to
call<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.820> food<00:00:45.090> zone<00:00:45.329> because<00:00:45.629> ice<00:00:45.809> is

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
call this the food zone because ice is

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.540 
call this the food zone because ice is
food<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.500> very<00:00:46.710> important<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.250> obviously

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550

that<00:00:47.760> everyone<00:00:48.059> keeps<00:00:48.270> their<00:00:48.360> ice<00:00:48.510> machines

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
that everyone keeps their ice machines

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.200 
that everyone keeps their ice machines
clean<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:50.070> we've<00:00:50.250> made<00:00:50.370> all<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.730> corners

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
clean and so we've made all the corners

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.819 
clean and so we've made all the corners
inside<00:00:51.390> all<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.870> white<00:00:51.989> area<00:00:52.260> inside<00:00:52.530> very

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
and clean item E is actually pretty good

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.920 
and clean item E is actually pretty good
here<00:00:56.670> because<00:00:56.789> we're<00:00:57.000> about<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.180> harvest<00:00:57.600> a

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
here because we're about to harvest a

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.869 
here because we're about to harvest a
section<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.379> ice<00:00:58.559> an<00:00:58.980> actual<00:00:59.340> ice<00:00:59.430> machines<00:00:59.760> we

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
section of ice an actual ice machines we

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.310 
section of ice an actual ice machines we
set<00:01:00.090> on<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.329> field<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.690> won't<00:01:00.840> have<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.020> clear

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
set on the field you won't have a clear

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.810 
set on the field you won't have a clear

obviously for displayed today and you'll
see<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.100> ice<00:01:05.250> harvesting<00:01:05.460> here<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:05.909> a

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
see that the ice harvesting here in a

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.789 
see that the ice harvesting here in a
second<00:01:06.240> behind<00:01:06.510> me<00:01:06.659> but<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.409> neat<00:01:07.590> thing

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
second behind me but the neat thing

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.500 
second behind me but the neat thing
about<00:01:07.890> all<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.460> man<00:01:08.610> spark<00:01:08.850> ice<00:01:08.970> machines<00:01:09.360> is

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
about all the man spark ice machines is

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.240 
about all the man spark ice machines is
we<00:01:09.630> design<00:01:09.930> all<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.320> components<00:01:10.830> inside<00:01:10.950> to

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
we design all the components inside to

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.640 
we design all the components inside to
be<00:01:11.369> removed<00:01:11.670> without<00:01:12.000> any<00:01:12.330> tools<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.350> can

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
be removed without any tools so you can

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.679 
be removed without any tools so you can
really<00:01:14.040> send<00:01:14.369> anyone<00:01:14.640> out<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:15.030> your<00:01:15.180> operation

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
really send anyone out in your operation

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:16.969 
really send anyone out in your operation
to<00:01:15.810> clean<00:01:16.110> one<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.380> your<00:01:16.500> ice<00:01:16.560> machines

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
to clean one of your ice machines

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.190 
to clean one of your ice machines
without<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> lot<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.820> hassle<00:01:18.030> it's<00:01:18.810> very<00:01:19.020> quick

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
without a lot of hassle it's very quick

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.899 
without a lot of hassle it's very quick
probably<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.890> fastest<00:01:20.310> ice<00:01:20.460> machine<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:20.820> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
probably the fastest ice machine in the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.140 
probably the fastest ice machine in the
industry<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.330> clean<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:22.580> extremely<00:01:23.580> fast<00:01:23.939> to

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
industry to clean and extremely fast to

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.580 
industry to clean and extremely fast to
get<00:01:24.240> in<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.570> out<00:01:24.630> obviously<00:01:25.200> with<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.439> hinge

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590

the other thing I want to point out is
both<00:01:28.510> panels<00:01:28.810> are<00:01:29.050> removable<00:01:29.470> on<00:01:29.710> the<00:01:29.800> ice

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
both panels are removable on the ice

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.830 
both panels are removable on the ice
machine<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.730> small<00:01:31.000> panel<00:01:31.300> will<00:01:31.390> come<00:01:31.510> up<00:01:31.660> as

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
machine the small panel will come up as

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.970 
machine the small panel will come up as
well<00:01:32.020> that<00:01:32.230> gives<00:01:32.320> you<00:01:32.440> access<00:01:32.620> to<00:01:32.830> the
