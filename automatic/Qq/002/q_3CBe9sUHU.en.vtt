 Portuguese will push the menu and because 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.570
 he is without channel 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.350
 We'll have to do the channel search on the 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.360
 satellite we want c2 were 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:24.150

 Until you start searching, you 'll leave it here. 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.320
 Searching for a satellite will not 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.390
 move and just cut an ok will do more 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.110
 a question here even searches for network 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.880

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.899
 I'm teaching this video here I'm 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.190
 making this configuration video and ks 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.030
