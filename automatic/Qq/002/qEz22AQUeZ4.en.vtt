00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
and the way you make darkness like to

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.189 
and the way you make darkness like to
make<00:00:37.010> it<00:00:37.100> like<00:00:37.250> this<00:00:37.489> dark<00:00:37.969> is<00:00:38.210> you<00:00:38.870> have<00:00:39.050> to

just<00:00:43.579> took<00:00:43.670> me<00:00:43.789> a<00:00:43.820> little<00:00:43.879> while<00:00:44.059> to<00:00:44.269> figure

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
just took me a little while to figure

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.380 
just took me a little while to figure
out<00:00:44.660> but<00:00:44.769> use<00:00:45.769> that<00:00:46.039> and<00:00:46.339> what<00:00:46.760> it<00:00:46.850> does<00:00:47.059> is

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
out but use that and what it does is

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.939 
out but use that and what it does is
this<00:00:47.660> nicely<00:00:47.899> make<00:00:48.230> your<00:00:48.379> mouth<00:00:48.530> overall

doctor<00:00:49.370> but<00:00:49.879> it<00:00:49.969> makes<00:00:50.179> dynamic<00:00:50.719> lighting

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
doctor but it makes dynamic lighting

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.910 
doctor but it makes dynamic lighting
make<00:00:51.559> your<00:00:51.710> map<00:00:51.859> almost<00:00:52.219> pitch-black<00:00:52.510> so<00:00:53.920> you

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
make your map almost pitch-black so you

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.259 
make your map almost pitch-black so you
know<00:00:55.039> like<00:00:55.190> I<00:00:55.280> started<00:00:55.429> making<00:00:55.609> a<00:00:55.789> city<00:00:56.030> map

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
know like I started making a city map

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:58.239 
know like I started making a city map

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
towering skyscrapers and the dynamic

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.259 
towering skyscrapers and the dynamic
lighting<00:01:00.079> is<00:01:00.260> just<00:01:00.440> so<00:01:00.620> dark<00:01:00.949> and<00:01:01.159> it's<00:01:02.059> a

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
lighting is just so dark and it's a

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:03.819 
lighting is just so dark and it's a
really<00:01:02.449> interesting<00:01:02.839> field<00:01:03.229> for<00:01:03.409> infection

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
really interesting field for infection

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.550 
really interesting field for infection
or<00:01:04.220> flood<00:01:04.580> some<00:01:05.570> people<00:01:05.810> say<00:01:05.930> that's<00:01:06.050> too<00:01:06.380> dark

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.230 
but you know honestly I'm all about the

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.420 
but you know honestly I'm all about the

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
infection like anyone who knows my

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.660 
infection like anyone who knows my
forging<00:01:12.260> style<00:01:12.500> when<00:01:12.620> it<00:01:12.710> comes<00:01:12.860> to<00:01:13.040> flood

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
forging style when it comes to flood

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.850 
forging style when it comes to flood
mode<00:01:13.880> is<00:01:14.120> that<00:01:14.630> I<00:01:14.660> am<00:01:14.900> very<00:01:14.930> very<00:01:15.710> very

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
mode is that I am very very very

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.980 
mode is that I am very very very
aesthetically<00:01:16.580> oriented<00:01:17.150> like<00:01:17.720> if<00:01:17.870> the

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
aesthetically oriented like if the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.720 
aesthetically oriented like if the
aesthetics<00:01:18.380> are<00:01:18.500> not<00:01:18.740> good<00:01:19.010> to<00:01:19.280> me<00:01:19.400> on<00:01:19.580> an

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
aesthetics are not good to me on an

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.130 
aesthetics are not good to me on an
infection<00:01:20.150> map<00:01:20.180> then<00:01:20.480> is<00:01:20.660> not<00:01:20.870> a<00:01:20.900> good

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
infection map then is not a good

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.500 
infection map then is not a good
infection<00:01:21.620> map<00:01:21.820> so<00:01:22.820> this<00:01:22.940> mountain<00:01:23.210> I<00:01:23.300> think

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
infection map so this mountain I think

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.960 
infection map so this mountain I think
it<00:01:23.600> has<00:01:23.720> decent<00:01:24.230> us<00:01:24.410> that<00:01:24.560> exit<00:01:24.830> the<00:01:25.220> sexually

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
it has decent us that exit the sexually

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.530 
it has decent us that exit the sexually
mesh<00:01:26.180> well<00:01:26.390> with<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:27.190> with<00:01:28.190> the<00:01:28.270> you<00:01:29.270> know<00:01:29.360> the

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
mesh well with the with the you know the

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.330 
mesh well with the with the you know the
dynamic<00:01:29.930> lightning<00:01:30.290> in<00:01:30.410> a<00:01:30.680> darkness<00:01:30.980> of<00:01:31.280> the

dynamic lightning in a darkness of the
map<00:01:31.490> overall<00:01:31.940> pretty<00:01:32.870> sure<00:01:33.050> it's<00:01:33.200> a<00:01:33.230> remake<00:01:33.530> of

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
map overall pretty sure it's a remake of

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.440 
map overall pretty sure it's a remake of
the<00:01:33.830> abandoned<00:01:34.280> mill<00:01:34.430> but<00:01:34.700> this<00:01:34.850> time<00:01:35.030> in<00:01:35.210> soft

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
the abandoned mill but this time in soft

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.910 
the abandoned mill but this time in soft
free<00:01:35.660> room<00:01:35.900> rather<00:01:36.110> than<00:01:36.230> linear<00:01:36.500> style

infection<00:01:37.400> map<00:01:37.550> I<00:01:38.330> never<00:01:38.840> played<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:39.260> Phantom

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
infection map I never played the Phantom

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.690

L<00:01:39.680> before<00:01:39.950> although<00:01:40.070> I<00:01:40.190> heard<00:01:40.340> it<00:01:40.490> was<00:01:40.520> really

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
L before although I heard it was really

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.540 
L before although I heard it was really
good<00:01:40.970> I<00:01:41.240> would<00:01:41.840> just<00:01:41.870> reach<00:01:42.320> and<00:01:42.560> Emily<00:01:42.860> down

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
good I would just reach and Emily down

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.060 
good I would just reach and Emily down
house<00:01:43.670> I<00:01:43.970> really<00:01:44.840> only<00:01:44.960> played<00:01:45.260> my<00:01:45.470> maps<00:01:45.770> I

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070

house I really only played my maps I
don't<00:01:46.280> know<00:01:46.400> why<00:01:46.550> just<00:01:46.610> I<00:01:47.090> don't<00:01:47.570> know<00:01:47.720> I<00:01:48.020> liked

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
don't know why just I don't know I liked

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.140 
don't know why just I don't know I liked
forging<00:01:49.010> maps<00:01:49.190> and<00:01:49.460> then<00:01:49.550> playing<00:01:49.820> my<00:01:49.970> mouse

but I never would was into downloading

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.340 
but I never would was into downloading
and<00:01:52.250> testing<00:01:52.670> on<00:01:52.760> a<00:01:52.790> map<00:01:52.970> stuff<00:01:53.210> like<00:01:53.360> that<00:01:53.390> but

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
and testing on a map stuff like that but

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.980 
and testing on a map stuff like that but
yeah<00:01:54.860> anyways<00:01:55.220> um<00:01:55.640> nothing<00:01:56.390> i'm<00:01:56.570> starting<00:01:56.960> to

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
yeah anyways um nothing i'm starting to

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.350 
yeah anyways um nothing i'm starting to
like<00:01:57.140> custom<00:01:57.470> maps<00:01:57.650> bit<00:01:58.070> more<00:01:58.310> in<00:01:58.520> halo<00:01:58.910> 4<00:01:59.150> just

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
like custom maps bit more in halo 4 just

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.670 
like custom maps bit more in halo 4 just
because<00:01:59.600> i<00:01:59.840> think<00:02:00.140> it<00:02:00.320> take<00:02:00.440> a<00:02:00.470> little<00:02:00.560> bit

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
because i think it take a little bit

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.050 
because i think it take a little bit
more<00:02:00.800> skill<00:02:01.160> to<00:02:01.340> make<00:02:01.460> it's<00:02:01.700> kind<00:02:01.880> of<00:02:01.910> like<00:02:02.000> a

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
more skill to make it's kind of like a

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.330 
more skill to make it's kind of like a
halo<00:02:02.240> 3<00:02:02.630> like<00:02:03.290> i<00:02:03.500> used<00:02:03.650> to<00:02:03.680> download<00:02:03.830> maps<00:02:04.190> all

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
halo 3 like i used to download maps all

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.760 
halo 3 like i used to download maps all
time<00:02:04.520> in<00:02:04.640> halo<00:02:04.790> 3<00:02:05.030> because<00:02:05.330> like<00:02:05.630> a<00:02:05.930> map<00:02:06.440> to

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
time in halo 3 because like a map to

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.670 
time in halo 3 because like a map to
make<00:02:07.010> a<00:02:07.040> map<00:02:07.280> in<00:02:07.400> halo<00:02:07.550> 3<00:02:07.850> was<00:02:08.030> like<00:02:08.210> so<00:02:09.200> like

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:09.680 
make a map in halo 3 was like so like

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.500 
make a map in halo 3 was like so like
difficult<00:02:10.250> like<00:02:10.430> you<00:02:10.610> make<00:02:10.820> a<00:02:10.850> simple<00:02:11.210> flower

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
difficult like you make a simple flower

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.570 
difficult like you make a simple flower
mound<00:02:11.750> that<00:02:11.870> you<00:02:11.960> can<00:02:12.050> build<00:02:12.170> tale<00:02:12.440> for<00:02:12.800> like

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
mound that you can build tale for like

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.790 
mound that you can build tale for like
three<00:02:14.420> hours<00:02:14.450> it<00:02:14.960> will<00:02:15.080> take<00:02:15.230> you<00:02:15.350> maybe<00:02:15.500> like

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
three hours it will take you maybe like

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.310 
three hours it will take you maybe like
an<00:02:16.250> entire<00:02:16.580> day<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:16.940> forge<00:02:17.390> it<00:02:17.540> till<00:02:17.780> three<00:02:18.140> so

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
an entire day to forge it till three so

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.230 
an entire day to forge it till three so
i<00:02:18.800> don't<00:02:19.100> know<00:02:19.190> there<00:02:19.340> was<00:02:19.370> just<00:02:19.460> so<00:02:20.060> much<00:02:20.180> work

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
back to that table for four but this

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.740 
back to that table for four but this
takes<00:02:25.190> a<00:02:25.430> little<00:02:25.610> bit<00:02:25.790> more<00:02:26.060> to<00:02:26.120> actually<00:02:26.570> make

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
takes a little bit more to actually make

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.470 
takes a little bit more to actually make
a<00:02:26.780> good<00:02:27.080> map<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:27.730> but<00:02:28.730> yeah<00:02:28.850> I've<00:02:29.030> just<00:02:29.240> I<00:02:29.420> just

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
able to have like pitch black maps

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.780 
able to have like pitch black maps
anymore<00:02:36.770> which<00:02:37.100> is<00:02:37.130> kind<00:02:37.430> of<00:02:37.490> starting<00:02:37.610> to

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
anymore which is kind of starting to

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.610 
anymore which is kind of starting to
piss<00:02:38.540> me<00:02:38.570> off<00:02:38.720> because<00:02:39.050> i<00:02:39.260> always<00:02:39.380> loved

putting purple and next gen and let's

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.840 
putting purple and next gen and let's
face<00:02:41.900> it<00:02:42.170> three<00:02:42.470> for<00:02:42.650> three<00:02:42.680> you<00:02:43.130> butchered<00:02:43.430> or

I guess certain affinity consume it
Forge<00:02:45.290> you<00:02:45.740> butchered<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.340> next<00:02:46.580> gen

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
Forge you butchered the next gen

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.470 
Forge you butchered the next gen
filtered<00:02:47.150> like<00:02:47.690> no<00:02:48.110> end<00:02:48.380> it<00:02:48.770> was<00:02:49.010> just

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
filtered like no end it was just

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.970 
filtered like no end it was just
horrendous<00:02:50.480> what<00:02:50.989> they<00:02:51.080> did<00:02:51.290> with<00:02:51.739> the

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
horrendous what they did with the

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.000 
horrendous what they did with the
next-gen<00:02:52.880> filter<00:02:53.270> but<00:02:53.810> yeah<00:02:53.989> this<00:02:54.560> map<00:02:54.800> really

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
next-gen filter but yeah this map really

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.100 
next-gen filter but yeah this map really
spoke<00:02:55.250> to<00:02:55.280> me<00:02:55.430> in<00:02:55.489> aesthetics<00:02:56.120> and<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.930> game

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
spoke to me in aesthetics and the game

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.690 
spoke to me in aesthetics and the game
type<00:02:57.350> I<00:02:57.590> thought<00:02:57.709> was<00:02:57.860> kind<00:02:57.980> of<00:02:58.070> original<00:02:58.520> and

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
type I thought was kind of original and

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.130 
type I thought was kind of original and
it<00:02:58.820> was<00:02:58.940> really<00:02:59.090> fun<00:02:59.360> because<00:02:59.600> it's<00:02:59.930> almost

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
it was really fun because it's almost

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.590 
it was really fun because it's almost
like<00:03:00.380> you're<00:03:00.470> hurting<00:03:00.890> the<00:03:00.920> zombies<00:03:01.340> around

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
like you're hurting the zombies around

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.420 
like you're hurting the zombies around
it's<00:03:02.600> called<00:03:03.080> necrosis<00:03:03.380> it's<00:03:03.980> basically

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
it's called necrosis it's basically

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.150 
it's called necrosis it's basically
zombies<00:03:04.850> have<00:03:04.970> higher<00:03:05.150> health<00:03:05.420> but<00:03:05.890> they<00:03:06.890> have

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
zombies have higher health but they have

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.160 
zombies have higher health but they have
low<00:03:07.489> damn<00:03:07.730> it<00:03:07.880> I<00:03:08.000> mean<00:03:08.209> they<00:03:08.510> have<00:03:08.660> low<00:03:08.840> speed

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
low damn it I mean they have low speed

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.040 
low damn it I mean they have low speed
so<00:03:09.950> yeah<00:03:10.820> it's<00:03:11.090> kind<00:03:11.300> of<00:03:11.330> like<00:03:11.450> you<00:03:11.600> see<00:03:11.720> a<00:03:11.750> big

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
so yeah it's kind of like you see a big

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.620 
so yeah it's kind of like you see a big
zombie<00:03:12.350> horde<00:03:13.010> and<00:03:13.370> you<00:03:13.850> either<00:03:14.030> take<00:03:14.420> them

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
zombie horde and you either take them

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.870 
zombie horde and you either take them
down<00:03:14.780> as<00:03:14.930> a<00:03:14.989> team<00:03:15.230> or<00:03:15.500> you<00:03:15.709> run<00:03:15.950> and<00:03:16.250> the

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
down as a team or you run and the

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.580 
down as a team or you run and the
zombies<00:03:17.239> will<00:03:17.270> kind<00:03:17.600> of<00:03:17.690> like<00:03:17.930> push<00:03:18.200> in<00:03:18.440> from

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
zombies will kind of like push in from

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.290 
zombies will kind of like push in from
different<00:03:18.860> angles<00:03:19.430> and<00:03:19.580> different<00:03:19.730> areas<00:03:20.270> and

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
different angles and different areas and

first<00:03:25.810> but<00:03:26.260> believe<00:03:26.530> me<00:03:26.560> it's<00:03:26.830> a<00:03:26.860> lot<00:03:27.010> harder

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
first but believe me it's a lot harder

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.980 
first but believe me it's a lot harder

here<00:03:29.380> just<00:03:30.040> one<00:03:30.190> more<00:03:30.310> hit<00:03:30.520> jump<00:03:31.000> round<00:03:31.300> but

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
here just one more hit jump round but

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.740 
here just one more hit jump round but
still<00:03:31.900> gets<00:03:32.290> me<00:03:32.380> anyways<00:03:33.280> that's<00:03:33.730> 11<00:03:34.150> and<00:03:34.510> hope
