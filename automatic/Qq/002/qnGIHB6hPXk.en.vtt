problem with it well there's three

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.100 
problem with it well there's three
problems<00:01:35.130> firstly<00:01:36.000> just<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.600> terms<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.960> these

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
problems firstly just in terms of these

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.870 
problems firstly just in terms of these
guys<00:01:37.320> being<00:01:37.560> real<00:01:37.920> human<00:01:38.280> beings<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.579> breaks

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
guys being real human beings that breaks

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.270 
guys being real human beings that breaks
the<00:01:39.000> believability<00:01:39.920> because<00:01:40.920> they're

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
the believability because they're

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.289 
the believability because they're
working<00:01:41.579> with<00:01:41.610> information<00:01:42.150> they<00:01:42.240> could

did it like that I'd be happy with that
but<00:02:06.479> he<00:02:07.350> that's<00:02:07.799> not<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.009> human<00:02:08.280> trait<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.879> say

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
but he that's not a human trait to say

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.420 
but he that's not a human trait to say
where<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:09.929> think<00:02:10.170> he's<00:02:10.259> in<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.470> shop<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.860> then

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
where I think he's in the shop and then

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.759 
where I think he's in the shop and then
because<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.329> did<00:02:12.510> silently<00:02:13.109> leap<00:02:13.379> this<00:02:13.560> shot

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
because you did silently leap this shot

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.649 
because you did silently leap this shot
there's<00:02:14.340> no<00:02:14.459> way<00:02:14.640> he'd<00:02:14.879> say<00:02:15.090> one<00:02:15.359> let's<00:02:15.510> go

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
there's no way he'd say one let's go

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.240 
there's no way he'd say one let's go
outside<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.079> so<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.530> makes<00:02:16.680> him<00:02:16.890> seem<00:02:17.040> just

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
outside and so it makes him seem just

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.949 
outside and so it makes him seem just

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.110 
has a look around or whatever and you
could<00:02:46.439> take<00:02:46.560> them<00:02:46.739> out<00:02:46.859> but<00:02:47.040> but<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.909> think

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
could take them out but but to think

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.750 
could take them out but but to think
that<00:02:48.239> you<00:02:48.720> got<00:02:48.930> away<00:02:49.079> and<00:02:49.560> then<00:02:50.370> they<00:02:50.519> just

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
that you got away and then they just

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.879 
that you got away and then they just
walk<00:02:50.909> to<00:02:51.180> specifically<00:02:51.959> where<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.379> are<00:02:52.560> not

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:52.889 
walk to specifically where you are not

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:54.440 
walk to specifically where you are not
just<00:02:53.159> you<00:02:53.370> know<00:02:53.400> not<00:02:53.549> just<00:02:53.819> the<00:02:53.939> area<00:02:54.269> where

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
just you know not just the area where

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.059 
just you know not just the area where
you<00:02:54.480> are<00:02:54.659> specifically<00:02:55.260> where<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.620> are<00:02:55.769> start

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
you are specifically where you are start

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.159 
you are specifically where you are start
looking<00:02:56.310> around<00:02:56.430> that's<00:02:57.329> not<00:02:57.569> on<00:02:57.719> that's<00:02:57.989> not

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:58.169 
looking around that's not on that's not

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:00.349 
looking around that's not on that's not
right<00:02:58.379> it<00:02:58.950> ruins<00:02:59.430> your<00:02:59.459> satisfaction<00:03:00.000> of

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
right it ruins your satisfaction of

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.679 
right it ruins your satisfaction of
using<00:03:01.169> of<00:03:01.349> using<00:03:01.739> stealth<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.250> thirdly<00:03:02.909> it's

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
using of using stealth and thirdly it's

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:05.780 
using of using stealth and thirdly it's
it's<00:03:04.139> similar<00:03:04.530> point<00:03:04.859> is<00:03:05.010> that<00:03:05.189> it<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.609> game

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
it's similar point is that it the game

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.599 
it's similar point is that it the game
is<00:03:05.969> sort<00:03:06.269> of<00:03:06.359> pushing<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:06.989> towards<00:03:07.609> just

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
is sort of pushing you towards just

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:10.039 
is sort of pushing you towards just

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
going to blow in their heads off because

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.330 
going to blow in their heads off because
you<00:03:10.169> think<00:03:10.349> what<00:03:10.500> what's<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.709> Biff<00:03:10.950> I<00:03:11.099> use
