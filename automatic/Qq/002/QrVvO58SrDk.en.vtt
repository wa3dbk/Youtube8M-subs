you<00:02:20.610> can<00:02:20.790> see<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.660> what<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.820> spectral

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
you can see that the what the spectral

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.430 
you can see that the what the spectral
pocket<00:02:24.120> pets<00:02:24.239> with<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.480> blue<00:02:24.660> image<00:02:24.930> go<00:02:25.200> for<00:02:25.380> a

pocket pets with the blue image go for a

pocket pets with the blue image go for a
lot<00:02:25.769> more<00:02:26.130> money<00:02:26.190> than<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:27.030> ones<00:02:27.239> with<00:02:27.780> the

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
lot more money than the ones with the

lot more money than the ones with the
brown<00:02:28.140> image<00:02:28.440> another<00:02:29.250> perk<00:02:29.579> of<00:02:29.760> doing<00:02:30.090> this

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
brown image another perk of doing this

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.240 
brown image another perk of doing this
is<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.750> get<00:02:30.900> quite<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.500> lot<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.709> greens<00:02:32.040> I've

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
is you get quite a lot of greens I've

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.130 
is you get quite a lot of greens I've
already<00:02:32.459> sold<00:02:32.730> some<00:02:32.910> which<00:02:33.120> go<00:02:33.480> most<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:34.019> them

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
already sold some which go most of them

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.470 
already sold some which go most of them
go<00:02:34.290> around<00:02:34.590> hundred<00:02:34.980> G+<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.730> about<00:02:35.970> thousand

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
go around hundred G+ to about thousand

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.069 
go around hundred G+ to about thousand
most<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:36.930> them<00:02:37.579> and<00:02:38.579> you<00:02:39.030> also<00:02:39.209> have<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:39.690> chance

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
most of them and you also have a chance

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.650 
most of them and you also have a chance
of<00:02:40.500> getting<00:02:40.620> this<00:02:41.130> primal<00:02:41.670> egg<00:02:42.000> which<00:02:42.480> is<00:02:42.630> a

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
of getting this primal egg which is a

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.990 
of getting this primal egg which is a
soul<00:02:42.870> band<00:02:42.989> item<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.709> after<00:02:44.040> three<00:02:44.370> days<00:02:44.579> it

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
soul band item and after three days it

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.800 
soul band item and after three days it
gives<00:02:45.239> you<00:02:46.040> it<00:02:47.040> gives<00:02:47.070> you<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.310> random<00:02:47.459> amount

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
gives you it gives you a random amount

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.920 
gives you it gives you a random amount
and<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:48.959> think<00:02:49.140> there's<00:02:49.260> about<00:02:49.380> five<00:02:50.930> primal

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
and I think there's about five primal

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.840 
and I think there's about five primal
Raptors<00:02:52.650> that<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:52.950> can<00:02:53.100> get<00:02:53.280> you<00:02:53.489> can<00:02:53.640> either

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
Raptors that you can get you can either

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.590 
Raptors that you can get you can either
get<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.269> as<00:02:54.600> four<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:55.380> can<00:02:55.500> get<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.769> black

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
get the as four you can get the black

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.240 
get the as four you can get the black
you<00:02:57.600> can't<00:02:57.840> get<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.019> bone<00:02:58.140> white<00:02:58.380> does<00:02:58.859> three

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
you can't get the bone white does three

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.909 
you can't get the bone white does three
you<00:03:00.180> can<00:03:00.390> get<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.660> black<00:03:00.930> green<00:03:01.620> or<00:03:01.889> red

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:01.919 
you can get the black green or red

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:04.650 
you can get the black green or red
primal<00:03:02.519> Raptor<00:03:02.850> mounts<00:03:03.180> as<00:03:03.359> well

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
primal Raptor mounts as well

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.700 
primal Raptor mounts as well
well<00:03:05.660> that's<00:03:05.810> all<00:03:05.930> for<00:03:06.050> that<00:03:06.170> video<00:03:06.380> thanks
