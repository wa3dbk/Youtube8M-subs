you can create potions by using a
similar<00:03:16.020> system<00:03:16.380> to<00:03:16.590> might<00:03:16.830> and<00:03:17.010> magic

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
similar system to might and magic

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.890 
similar system to might and magic
although<00:03:17.670> here<00:03:18.030> it<00:03:18.120> is<00:03:18.209> probably<00:03:18.660> more

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
although here it is probably more

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.080 
although here it is probably more

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
simplistic than that you basically pick

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.210 
simplistic than that you basically pick
up<00:03:21.239> a<00:03:21.330> plant<00:03:21.600> shove<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.380> in<00:03:22.500> your<00:03:22.530> empty<00:03:22.890> flask

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
and you have yourself a potion so there

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.930 
and you have yourself a potion so there
are<00:03:25.620> a<00:03:25.680> lot<00:03:25.860> of<00:03:25.890> items<00:03:26.130> that<00:03:26.400> you<00:03:26.610> can<00:03:26.760> create

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
are a lot of items that you can create

path<00:04:52.660> which<00:04:53.410> means<00:04:53.680> i<00:04:53.860> would<00:04:54.070> have<00:04:54.250> free<00:04:54.580> rein

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
path which means i would have free rein

dudes<00:04:57.160> could<00:04:57.850> have<00:04:58.060> to<00:04:58.210> walk<00:04:58.389> all<00:04:58.660> the<00:04:58.870> way

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900

this<00:05:01.360> would<00:05:01.539> create<00:05:01.690> some<00:05:02.020> problems<00:05:02.050> as<00:05:02.620> well

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
this would create some problems as well

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:05.279 
this would create some problems as well
obviously<00:05:03.669> if<00:05:03.940> I<00:05:04.030> wanted<00:05:04.360> my<00:05:04.479> melodies<00:05:04.960> to<00:05:05.139> get

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
obviously if I wanted my melodies to get

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:07.650 
obviously if I wanted my melodies to get
to<00:05:05.410> them<00:05:05.590> they<00:05:05.800> wouldn't<00:05:06.310> be<00:05:06.430> able<00:05:06.580> to<00:05:06.910> without

to them they wouldn't be able to without
taking<00:05:08.080> significant<00:05:08.620> damage<00:05:08.949> but<00:05:09.699> sometimes

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
I wouldn't be able to use my ranged

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.240 
I wouldn't be able to use my ranged
attacks<00:05:12.039> because<00:05:12.669> of<00:05:12.789> these<00:05:12.910> oil<00:05:13.300> patches<00:05:13.810> and

just<00:05:16.930> a<00:05:17.080> bug<00:05:17.289> in<00:05:17.410> the<00:05:17.500> game<00:05:17.650> I<00:05:17.860> still<00:05:18.520> found<00:05:18.729> it

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
just a bug in the game I still found it

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.969 
just a bug in the game I still found it
fair<00:05:19.180> though<00:05:19.389> it<00:05:19.660> successfully<00:05:20.410> prevented<00:05:20.860> me

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 
fair though it successfully prevented me

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:23.070 
fair though it successfully prevented me
from<00:05:21.010> chasing<00:05:21.550> every<00:05:21.760> single<00:05:22.030> fight<00:05:22.180> during

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080

from chasing every single fight during
all<00:05:23.349> this<00:05:23.470> time<00:05:23.530> playing<00:05:23.979> I<00:05:24.220> have<00:05:24.430> been

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
all this time playing I have been

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.070 
all this time playing I have been
finding<00:05:24.940> it<00:05:25.060> difficult<00:05:25.240> to<00:05:25.570> put<00:05:25.810> the<00:05:25.900> game

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
finding it difficult to put the game

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.200 
finding it difficult to put the game
down<00:05:26.110> so<00:05:26.770> here's<00:05:27.009> hoping<00:05:27.190> it<00:05:27.490> lasts<00:05:27.820> until<00:05:27.940> the

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
down so here's hoping it lasts until the

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.450 
down so here's hoping it lasts until the
end<00:05:28.389> my<00:05:29.050> initial<00:05:29.229> verdict<00:05:29.770> on<00:05:29.889> the<00:05:30.009> game<00:05:30.220> is<00:05:30.430> a

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
end my initial verdict on the game is a

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.909 
end my initial verdict on the game is a
4<00:05:30.910> out<00:05:31.120> of<00:05:31.150> 5<00:05:31.479> and<00:05:31.750> i'm<00:05:31.990> waiting<00:05:32.380> for<00:05:32.410> the<00:05:32.650> story

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:35.349 
to develop and if it's good it will most

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:37.710 
to develop and if it's good it will most
