00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 niklas me the slumkinder check it is 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.620
 As you often wish for the 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.150
 avengers age of probably already what her from 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:16.109
 expect the film to experience the film 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:17.940
 now whoever is more worthy 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.199
 should the power be up to something you should do that 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.330
 is a carrier that is much more than 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:28.890
 that one asks if I can do it 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.130
 I'll be fair but I'm merciless 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.130
 be right back 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.559
 Do you see anything in my team? 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.760
 you just that was alright so let it 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.760
 just come 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.760
 the state has me inscribed each of the 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.120
 Sector fingerprints can do it 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:01.750
 really really interesting theory 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.750
 my simpler you are not worthy 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:15.890
 how can you be worthy 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:15.890
 you are caught puppets 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.920
 they would have to have one more time 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.600
 the avengers save the world yet this 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.079
 sometimes the enemy comes from their own 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.229
 string 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:30.210
 because toni start creating together with bruce 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.280
 banner an artificial intelligence 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.880
 called ultron for the sake of humanity 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.890
 protect 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.329
 However, this takes their task so 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.640
 Seriously, that's the complete one 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.349
 humanity wants to erase if you like that 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.729
 manages who the new players are 

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:43.920
 and what else happens 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.959
 you will find out in the cinema of the new winter 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.459
 stage of worldwide is not quite like that 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:49.740
 the first part during the first part 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:51.330
 the team finding the avengers and the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.799
 fight against the aliens in the foreground 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.750
 stand is the second part by far 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.759
 personally has in their individual venture 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.740
 must fight against his fears what that 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.789
 movie much more profound is because the 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.860
 fears logically in the 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.390
 past or can be found 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.409
 and we know so much more about that 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.520
 experienced characters 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.500
 So let's just stay over that 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.849
 characterize who the first avengers 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.590
 has seen and also some others 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.209
 marvel movie with recognizes the cast of 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.780
 avengers age though actually 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.880
 complete 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.250
 now, however, come to complicity 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.010
 together four completely new players 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.840
 into the marvel universe who that is exactly 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.060
 we do not want to spoil you here but 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.139
 it definitely did a good job for the movie and 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.269
 it's just a little bit more 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:29.280
 fresh wind otherwise remains to cast 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.260
 I have a lot to say because there are those 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.950
 Bank is not a bad thing for us 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.870
 of course happy 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.150
 and just with and already get the 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.709
 avengers such a powerful opponent that 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.480
 The story is very unpredictable 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.980
 and that's really fun 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.690
 for the people who are afraid that too 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.670
 many trailer too like videos too much 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.430
 material for this film is there 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.109
 We are reassured that the building law says so little 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.760
 that you are not afraid if you do that 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:52.500
 lucky that the movie is in the cinema 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.120
 as already mentioned is the film 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.500
 to be a bit different, though 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.180
 Predecessor here you have to now 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.680
 but do not worry about it 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.870
 a sentimental or over 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.790
 romantic avengers it was crashed 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.829
 still the same as in other marvin 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.019
 blockbuster also there is special 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.940
 effects until you drop and through the 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.069
 one or another slow motion is worthwhile 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.560
 the 3d finally again if he 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.500
 which then says you know to be a chore 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.520
 our 3d hasa 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.200
 generally it is loosened up in the matter 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.720
 see through many emotional and it 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.280
 There are also a lot of jokes in German 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.350
 that work very well 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.150
 This will keep the audience going 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.920
 well entertained but not consistent 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.800
 bombarded with action so he totally 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.930
 overload from the cinema runs only one 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.580
 Manko what we both, however 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.780
 have to note the one or 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.670
 others of you may not like that 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.970
 we already find that the one or 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.350
 others ex scene something again 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.270
 So crazy is if you still here 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.040
 a little bit on the brake 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.260
 Could it really be a through and through 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.210
 because of perfect film, therefore, become 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.130
 the movie gets nine out of ten in front of us 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.140
 Score is of course with this rating 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:59.400
 a cinema cinema movie for all marvel fans 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.880

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.280
 like this 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.570
 At the same time , it is really cool 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.370

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.380
