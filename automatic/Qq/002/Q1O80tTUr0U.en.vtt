architect<00:02:45.190> I'll<00:02:45.340> make<00:02:45.610> it<00:02:45.790> which<00:02:46.360> is<00:02:46.570> kind<00:02:46.810> of

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.350 

just<00:02:50.170> above<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.220> crease<00:02:51.460> and<00:02:51.910> both<00:02:52.180> those

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
just above the crease and both those

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.400 
just above the crease and both those
colors<00:02:53.430> just<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.580> give<00:02:54.730> something<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.630> it<00:02:56.170> so

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
colors just to give something to it so

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.460 
colors just to give something to it so
it's<00:02:56.560> not<00:02:56.710> too

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.080 

and<00:03:02.860> then<00:03:03.010> for<00:03:03.190> my<00:03:03.280> highlight<00:03:03.670> color<00:03:03.910> I'm

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
and then for my highlight color I'm

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.490 
and then for my highlight color I'm
going<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.240> use<00:03:04.360> a<00:03:04.390> center<00:03:04.780> color<00:03:05.020> this<00:03:05.140> one<00:03:05.320> is

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
going to use a center color this one is

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.640 
going to use a center color this one is
called<00:03:05.710> Nirvana<00:03:06.630> and<00:03:07.630> it's<00:03:07.870> kind<00:03:08.110> of<00:03:08.140> a<00:03:08.230> statin

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
called Nirvana and it's kind of a statin

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.830 
called Nirvana and it's kind of a statin
so<00:03:08.980> there's<00:03:09.130> a<00:03:09.190> math<00:03:09.400> but<00:03:09.610> it's<00:03:09.730> a<00:03:09.820> satyr<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:10.420> I

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
so there's a math but it's a satyr and I

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.640 
so there's a math but it's a satyr and I
just<00:03:10.990> thought<00:03:11.050> it<00:03:11.140> was<00:03:11.200> a<00:03:11.260> little<00:03:11.440> bit<00:03:11.560> more

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
just thought it was a little bit more

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.290 
just thought it was a little bit more
forgiving<00:03:12.100> than<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.550> highlight<00:03:12.910> color<00:03:12.940> in

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
forgiving than the highlight color in

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.580 
forgiving than the highlight color in
The<00:03:13.360> Naked<00:03:13.450> palette<00:03:13.630> which<00:03:14.080> is<00:03:14.110> a<00:03:14.260> little<00:03:14.470> bit

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
too shimmery for this like that from me

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.650
