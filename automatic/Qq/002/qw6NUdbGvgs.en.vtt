00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
so maybe the gourmet part of it is just

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.940 
so maybe the gourmet part of it is just
way<00:01:36.270> too<00:01:36.330> look<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.900> not<00:01:37.020> necessarily<00:01:37.290> their

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
way too look and not necessarily their

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.609

kind of crazy but the top it goes with

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.410 
kind of crazy but the top it goes with
and<00:03:39.320> these<00:03:39.470> are<00:03:39.620> just<00:03:39.650> little<00:03:40.070> like<00:03:41.060> silk
