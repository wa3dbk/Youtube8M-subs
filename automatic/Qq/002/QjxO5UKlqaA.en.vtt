What a beautiful day.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.200
Why do people catch fish? That's not nice.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.660

We're looking at art.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.920
This looks like a dolphin, right?

00:04:08.836 --> 00:04:11.156
This one is a reindeer in the water.

00:04:13.686 --> 00:04:14.966
This is a cool boat.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.780

Hanging loose!

00:04:57.392 --> 00:04:59.872
This surfer survived a shark attack.

00:05:09.791 --> 00:05:11.391
Time for frozen yogurt.

00:05:16.813 --> 00:05:18.413
My favorite is vanilla.

00:05:22.813 --> 00:05:24.173
It's time to go home.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.020
