into the elevator as quickly as you can
and<00:00:28.199> up<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.500> goes<00:00:28.949> now<00:00:29.910> these<00:00:30.060> laser<00:00:30.480> beams<00:00:30.630> off

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
and up it goes now these laser beams off

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.100 
and up it goes now these laser beams off
it's<00:00:32.040> just<00:00:32.099> frustrating<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:33.059> all<00:00:33.239> ends<00:00:34.550> the<00:00:35.550> I

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
it's just frustrating it all ends the I

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.600 
it's just frustrating it all ends the I

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
think the best time to go past me is

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.650 
think the best time to go past me is
when<00:00:38.790> they're<00:00:38.940> up<00:00:40.010> so<00:00:41.010> what<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.489> try<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.760> throw

still get him because this guy's an

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.160 
still get him because this guy's an
idiot<00:00:50.850> he's<00:00:51.239> like<00:00:51.480> oh<00:00:51.600> I'm<00:00:51.750> gonna<00:00:51.870> run<00:00:52.020> back

and<00:00:55.969> like<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.120> 30<00:00:57.360> shots<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.899> have<00:00:58.079> it

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
and like the 30 shots that I have it

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.240 
and like the 30 shots that I have it
becomes<00:00:58.559> sort<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.949> best<00:00:59.930> one<00:01:01.250> one

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
becomes sort of the best one one

electrocution<00:01:03.830> all<00:01:04.830> right<00:01:04.979> now<00:01:05.070> we've<00:01:05.220> got

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
electrocution all right now we've got

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.270 
electrocution all right now we've got
one<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.519> these<00:01:05.689> platforms<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.320> just<00:01:07.950> don't

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
one of these platforms that I just don't

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.039 
one of these platforms that I just don't
like<00:01:08.460> because<00:01:08.700> they're<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.090> random<00:01:09.420> like<00:01:09.869> why

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
like because they're so random like why

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:18.920 
like because they're so random like why
didn't<00:01:10.290> he<00:01:10.409> fly<00:01:10.979> up<00:01:11.130> there<00:01:12.860> but<00:01:16.640> all<00:01:17.640> right

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
didn't he fly up there but all right

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.220 
didn't he fly up there but all right
Russell<00:01:19.680> will<00:01:19.890> jump<00:01:20.220> up<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.750> flipy<00:01:21.750> if<00:01:22.080> he

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.230 
Russell will jump up and flipy if he

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.530 
Russell will jump up and flipy if he
decides<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.830> get<00:01:23.010> on<00:01:23.070> at<00:01:23.370> some<00:01:23.580> point<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.450> will

doors<00:01:43.230> you<00:01:44.270> know<00:01:45.270> just<00:01:45.690> get<00:01:45.870> them<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.050> run<00:01:46.440> as

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
doors you know just get them to run as

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.010 
doors you know just get them to run as
fast<00:01:47.010> as<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.370> can<00:01:50.180> leave<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.210> little<00:01:51.390> trail<00:01:51.690> of

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
fast as you can leave a little trail of

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.930 
fast as you can leave a little trail of
fire<00:01:52.500> foods<00:01:52.890> behind<00:01:53.280> them

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
fire foods behind them

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.450 
fire foods behind them
let's<00:01:54.750> take<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.050> onto<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:55.380> bottom<00:01:55.770> bit<00:01:55.920> you

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
let's take it onto this bottom bit you

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.940 
let's take it onto this bottom bit you
want<00:01:56.550> to<00:01:56.670> raise<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.630> we're<00:01:57.750> just<00:01:57.780> spam<00:01:58.200> that

this<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:08.910> part<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.390> slower<00:02:09.660> like<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:10.410> would

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
this is part of slower like you would

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.590 
this is part of slower like you would
have<00:02:10.770> seen<00:02:10.950> that<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.340> little<00:02:11.790> clock<00:02:12.270> time<00:02:12.570> I

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
have seen that the little clock time I

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.780 
have seen that the little clock time I
was<00:02:12.930> in<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.380> silver<00:02:13.800> when<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.340> go<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.640> end

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
was in the silver when I go to the end
