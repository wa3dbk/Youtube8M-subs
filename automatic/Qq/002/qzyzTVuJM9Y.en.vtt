 industrial or craft butchery 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.289
 Alsatian charcuterie is a sector 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.850
 abused right now the butchers 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.350
 butchers must be creative 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.920
 and be bold enough to 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.630
 go out 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.390
 in Alsace industrial sausages 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.869
 these nine companies 1500 employees at the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.670
 total 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.740
 every day we have to adapt to 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.960
 spectacular raw materials + 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.640
 40% in a few weeks big 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.649
 distribution or not impossible to 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.360
 pass on prices to get by 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.969
 daniel muller put on the brand image 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.890
 of Alsace in export in particular 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.960
 Alsatian has invested in Belgian markets 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.070
 and Danish export brings 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.010
 several advantages 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.950
 of course a quantitative outlet 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.000
 also a qualitative outlet because it 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.480
 forces us to adapt to 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.960
 local consumption 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.820
 the distribution mode of the target countries and 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.100
 so these ask for a number 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.850
 investments so for example here 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.489
 in this room 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.260
 we invested in news 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.659
 packaging lines for us 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.210
 allow to make adapted products 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.060
 to the size of the linear in the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.950
 stores of the target countries also 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.530
 reduce the weight of packaging 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.259
 that an absolute constraint requested by 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.970
 our customers the price rise is the 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.810
 main problematic also for 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.119
 butchers 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.659
 involved in quality meat that is 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.799
 rarefie favors milk meat 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.659
 of French origin 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:39.090
 so of course with the number of peasants 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.250
 in decline now in France the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.049
 market is becoming more restricted and 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:48.060
 in more recent times with the crisis 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.600
 lasagna and horse in the 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.420
 lasagna 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.299
 it turns out that even the industrialists 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.530
 want to buy French meat 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.270
 even though meat consumption has 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.700
 decreased artisan charcutier seems 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.590
 enjoy a favorable image after 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.259
 recent scandals related to meat 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.240
 in the industry of which 100 who has people 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.310
 returning the major surfaces 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.020
 are disappointed with what they find in 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.720
 large areas of lack of 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.940
 traceability of the products they eat 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.620
 we know our customers we know the 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.470
 pieces that they want 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.750
 there is certainly a connection that which which 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.489
 is created who is i7 information too 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.110
 is an important issue for 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.239
 the industrialists as for the craftsmen 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.250
 in haguenau jean luc hoffmann form 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.870
 currently three apprentices from 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.470
 additional resources are provided for in 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.470
 next time
