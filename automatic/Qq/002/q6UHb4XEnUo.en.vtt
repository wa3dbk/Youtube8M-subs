00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:08.050
 these are the sports you know we all hr 400 characters are I believe 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.870
 that the king rooney is the first race it is no different 3 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:17.929
 in the clear that he and other strangers 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.409
 I can't do that well 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:24.409
 to act for the whole of the Netherlands 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:32.129
 the foundation just home and provides home care in the municipality of roosendaal 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:34.070
 halderberge moerdijk 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.950
 the municipality of steenbergen and I expected a girl in a different way 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.040
 working it is not easy in my opinion the cases that is the intention that too 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.910
 that is going to change that his client just knows a lot about that 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.589
 it's just very close to them 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:50.300
 where I ask myself he can leak away and then it just won't be for me 

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:52.770
 money and it doesn't 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.880
 just as little dance can occur against a few times of calling before 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.830
 charts 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.040
 customers are blown or can ask questions 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.059
 I think we notice that in particular 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.310
 that's what the old neighborhood sister says 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.810
 that he is much more visible again, the district nurse the much more visible 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.180
 is in the neighborhoods in the neighborhoods and so are the people who come home to the hairdresser 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.330
 to be faster and more often and a small group of people 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.730
 in a small area a brute neighborhood and district and village that comes and 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.140
 therefore know all clients and all employees and all employees 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.020
 all customers and that is something we both customers and employees 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.630
 very, very, really, really want you to know who you are providing care to 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.360
 or 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.200
 whose care you receive whose house comes from 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.620
 and that you can build a bond with it 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.910
 well i think both women are going to notice that we are going in small teams 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:47.520
 to work 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.870
 that there will have fewer clients but the regular ones will come at 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.340
 the same people are worried hyve 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.330
 what skate clients of brands 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.850
 the client will hopefully notice that that 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.120
 will see many more of the same faces 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.120
 and that that and it is so many small teams already have that that regularly with 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.999
 her hair comes over the floor 

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:10.359
 they improve 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:11.589
 think so 

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:15.859
 yes anything smaller is I think an improvement is definitely on it anyway 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:17.589
 field of care 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:20.719
 This new system is that its expensive or cheap danced 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:25.679
 but we have fixed rates for healthcare 

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:29.809
 that is also enough of in the newspaper and but we think that by this way of 

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:32.999
 that we can offer much more service for the same money
