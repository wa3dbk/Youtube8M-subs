00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
expeditious this almost looks like a

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.190 
expeditious this almost looks like a
duckface<00:01:46.340> up<00:01:46.759> here<00:01:46.970> kinda<00:01:47.330> so<00:01:47.960> you're<00:01:48.110> gonna

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
duckface up here kinda so you're gonna

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.870 
duckface up here kinda so you're gonna
put<00:01:48.410> when<00:01:48.619> the<00:01:48.680> bar<00:01:48.890> goes<00:01:49.100> in<00:01:49.280> here<00:01:49.550> this<00:01:49.729> is

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
put when the bar goes in here this is

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.690 
put when the bar goes in here this is
weight<00:01:50.090> balance<00:01:50.570> based<00:01:50.840> on<00:01:51.050> the<00:01:51.170> ball<00:01:51.350> and

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
weight balance based on the ball and

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.760 
weight balance based on the ball and
then<00:01:52.700> as<00:01:53.000> it's<00:01:53.630> moving<00:01:53.960> down<00:01:54.110> little<00:01:54.530> things

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
then as it's moving down little things

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.880 
then as it's moving down little things
will<00:01:55.100> you<00:01:55.340> know<00:01:55.789> start<00:01:56.149> to<00:01:56.330> turn<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:57.110> change

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
will you know start to turn and change

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.100 
will you know start to turn and change
and<00:01:58.670> then<00:01:58.850> at<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.119> bottom<00:01:59.300> let<00:01:59.840> me<00:01:59.930> actually
