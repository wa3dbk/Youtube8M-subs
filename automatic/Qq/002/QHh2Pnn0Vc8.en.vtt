00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
season is coming fast I think we all

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.970 
season is coming fast I think we all
feel<00:00:03.149> like<00:00:03.210> ants<00:00:03.600> been<00:00:03.720> going<00:00:03.929> on<00:00:04.020> forever<00:00:04.230> but

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
feel like ants been going on forever but

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.639 
feel like ants been going on forever but
uh<00:00:05.009> you<00:00:06.000> know<00:00:06.060> a<00:00:06.270> few<00:00:06.720> days<00:00:06.930> now<00:00:06.960> another<00:00:07.410> week

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
uh you know a few days now another week

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:08.839 
uh you know a few days now another week
or<00:00:07.799> so<00:00:07.830> we're<00:00:08.010> going<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.189> switch<00:00:08.340> gears<00:00:08.370> start

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
or so we're going to switch gears start

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.730 
or so we're going to switch gears start
thinking<00:00:09.059> about<00:00:09.120> South<00:00:09.360> Carolina<00:00:09.750> but<00:00:10.620> it's

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
thinking about South Carolina but it's

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.470 
thinking about South Carolina but it's
going<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:10.920> get<00:00:10.980> out<00:00:11.130> here<00:00:11.250> i<00:00:11.280> think<00:00:11.550> i<00:00:11.759> think

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
going to get out here i think i think

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.789 
going to get out here i think i think
we've<00:00:12.599> been<00:00:12.750> more<00:00:13.080> consistent<00:00:13.440> in<00:00:13.710> making

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
we've been more consistent in making

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.490 
we've been more consistent in making
plays<00:00:14.269> but<00:00:15.269> our<00:00:15.389> consistency<00:00:15.929> overall<00:00:16.350> need

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
plays but our consistency overall need

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.160 
plays but our consistency overall need
to<00:00:16.560> get<00:00:16.680> better<00:00:16.859> just<00:00:17.070> in<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.310> short<00:00:17.460> game<00:00:18.170> not

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
to get better just in the short game not

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.480 
to get better just in the short game not
having<00:00:19.199> big<00:00:19.560> negative<00:00:19.920> plays<00:00:20.130> we've<00:00:20.369> had<00:00:20.460> a

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
having big negative plays we've had a

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.130 
having big negative plays we've had a
few<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.820> those<00:00:20.910> but<00:00:20.970> overall<00:00:21.750> we're<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:21.990> lot

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
few of those but overall we're a lot

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.330 
few of those but overall we're a lot
more<00:00:22.170> consistent<00:00:22.740> at<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:22.920> point<00:00:23.130> than<00:00:23.250> we

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
more consistent at this point than we

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.359 
more consistent at this point than we
were<00:00:23.519> last<00:00:23.820> year<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:24.900> it's<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.769> good<00:00:25.920> sign<00:00:26.160> but

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
were last year so it's a good sign but

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.920 
were last year so it's a good sign but
we<00:00:26.460> need<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.640> keep<00:00:26.760> improving<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.689> short

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
we need to keep improving the short

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.300 
we need to keep improving the short
passing<00:00:28.260> game<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.560> better<00:00:28.740> than<00:00:28.980> something

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
passing game is better than something

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.529 
passing game is better than something
yeah<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.580> think<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:30.029> think<00:00:30.060> it's<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.390> lot

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
yeah I think it I think it's a lot

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.569 
yeah I think it I think it's a lot
better<00:00:30.660> like<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.619> passing<00:00:31.949> game<00:00:32.040> overall<00:00:32.369> is

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
better like the passing game overall is

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.459 
better like the passing game overall is
a<00:00:32.640> lot<00:00:32.790> better<00:00:32.940> like<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.360> said<00:00:33.570> just<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.290> big

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
a lot better like I said just the big

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.410 
a lot better like I said just the big
mistakes<00:00:34.890> whether<00:00:35.100> it's<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.430> missing<00:00:36.360> a

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
mistakes whether it's a missing a

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.490 
mistakes whether it's a missing a
protection<00:00:36.750> call<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.170> gives<00:00:37.320> us<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.469> chance

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
protection call that gives us a chance

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.580 
protection call that gives us a chance
to<00:00:37.770> get<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.950> playoff<00:00:38.280> or<00:00:39.230> missing<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.290> throw

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
to get a playoff or missing a throw

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.650 
to get a playoff or missing a throw
whatever<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.059> we<00:00:42.239> need<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.420> be<00:00:42.480> more

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
whatever it is that we need to be more

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.650 
whatever it is that we need to be more
consistent<00:00:43.219> in<00:00:44.219> not<00:00:44.640> having<00:00:44.910> negative<00:00:45.420> place

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
consistent in not having negative place

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.110 
consistent in not having negative place
but<00:00:46.620> overall<00:00:46.920> we've<00:00:47.460> been<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> lot<00:00:47.820> better<00:00:47.850> in

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
but overall we've been a lot better in

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.610 
but overall we've been a lot better in
the<00:00:48.210> passing<00:00:48.510> game<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:49.079> we're<00:00:49.230> getting<00:00:49.350> into

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
the passing game and we're getting into

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.709 
the passing game and we're getting into
a<00:00:49.649> rhythm<00:00:50.000> there's<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.059> quarterback<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.570> use

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
a rhythm there's a quarterback to use

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.779 
a rhythm there's a quarterback to use
which<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.079> naturally<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:53.039> different<00:00:53.430> time<00:00:53.610> for

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
which you naturally a different time for

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.520 
which you naturally a different time for
other<00:00:53.879> people<00:00:54.210> yeah<00:00:54.780> but<00:00:54.960> start<00:00:55.170> gun<00:00:55.320> problem

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
more so than maybe a receiver does

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.060 
more so than maybe a receiver does
that's<00:02:27.780> not<00:02:27.959> in<00:02:28.110> mind<00:02:28.320> in<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.800> quarterback

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070
