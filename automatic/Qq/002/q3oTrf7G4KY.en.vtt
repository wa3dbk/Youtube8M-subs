00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
it for the Xbox 360 is because um I've

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.209

Batman<00:00:41.730> Arkham<00:00:41.910> City<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.480> beat<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.050> I've<00:00:43.290> gotten

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
Batman Arkham City I beat it I've gotten

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:44.959 
Batman Arkham City I beat it I've gotten
like<00:00:43.770> most<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.309> trophies

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
like most of the trophies

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.270 
like most of the trophies
so<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.690> just<00:00:46.200> figured<00:00:46.350> why<00:00:46.649> not<00:00:46.680> pick<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.100> up<00:00:47.160> for

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
so I just figured why not pick it up for

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.410 
so I just figured why not pick it up for
the<00:00:47.340> Xbox<00:00:47.700> 360

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
the Xbox 360

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.150 
the Xbox 360
get<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.840> achievements<00:00:49.320> also<00:00:49.649> it's<00:00:49.829> another

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
get the achievements also it's another

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.819 
get the achievements also it's another
game<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.760> my<00:00:50.850> xbox<00:00:51.270> 360<00:00:51.780> library<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.500> when<00:00:52.739> it

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
game in my xbox 360 library and when it

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.709 
game in my xbox 360 library and when it
comes<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.039> Batman<00:00:53.340> Arkham<00:00:53.520> City<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:54.030> think

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
comes to Batman Arkham City I think

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.330 
comes to Batman Arkham City I think
they're<00:00:55.199> pretty<00:00:55.379> evenly<00:00:55.739> matched<00:00:55.829> on<00:00:56.219> both

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
they're pretty evenly matched on both

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.189 
they're pretty evenly matched on both
consoles<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.820> don't<00:00:57.000> think<00:00:57.210> either<00:00:57.420> console<00:00:58.109> is

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
consoles I don't think either console is

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.930 
consoles I don't think either console is
really<00:00:58.410> superior<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.280> figured<00:00:59.579> why<00:00:59.760> not

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
really superior so I figured why not

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.209 
really superior so I figured why not
pick<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.180> up<00:01:00.239> for<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.420> Xbox<00:01:00.750> 360<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.440> game<00:01:01.920> was
