00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:12.700
 Today we are here in live motorcycles 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:15.010
 we are known that war chief of 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.550
 product of motorcycle brand sweets 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:22.390
 and we're going to meet a star that 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:26.260
 they have that is the euro 5 blue tech 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:29.050
 5 this body bus chassis also 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.750
 100% m but it really is spectacular and 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.519
 Cesc to steal us all the tips and 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.980
 all the scopes you have are 12 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:38.410
 years leading the market in the 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.250
 Bus sales segment is for buses 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.979
 things like they are 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.620
 hello ricardo and for me it is a pleasure in 

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:47.170
 truth come out in your program and here for 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:51.309
 present my our new product on 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.229
 chassis or efe 17 21 with euro 5 technology 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.269
 blue tech 5 mercedes benz la 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:57.129
 5 euro technology I think they are the 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:58.390
 only you in the market right now is 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.100
 right we do pioneers in this 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.770
 moment with that kind of technology 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.610
 you matter made six mercedes 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.980
 from Brazil 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.120
 and they do the rudeness 100% but it's 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.460
 correct we are representatives 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.130
 of the mercedes benz brand this brazil and 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.630
 they send us the product the chassis and 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.280
 here in Peru we have 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.800
 our suppliers in this case and the 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.990
 body is metal bus and we make the 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.150
 design of the 12 meter bus as 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.390
 we are good is 4 its little the 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.530
 characteristics of this chassis 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.810
 It's mainly about technology 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.620
 innovative by the vehicle this 1721 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.210
 euro5 has the main characteristic 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.940
 by motor technology this is a 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.830
 engine a highly efficient engine with 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.600
 a post-treatment system in the 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.880
 exit of exhaust gases and 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.410
 practically uses the component that 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.149
 is the urea to do the one to do the 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.570
 transformation of gas gases 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.759
 carbonic in what is nitrogen the 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.370
 5 euro issue with oil too 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.740
 you have a theme 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.390
 parallel that is that sometimes it rises 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.880
 and you can raise the emissions thanks 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.950
 how to do gas vision levels in 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.619
 this case as I told you that we have a 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.090
 efficient engine that is going to burn 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.150
 totally what is the material 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.610
 particulate as a result of the 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.500
 combustion of hydrocarbons 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.210
 in this case we reduce what 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.310
 are the material particles 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.020
 particulate but we're always going to have 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.440
 a counterpart is not going to elevate me 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:30.380
 the levels of gases in the oxide 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.760
 nitrous and carbon dioxide not in this 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.070
 case we have a system of 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.960
 Aftercare that is located 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.430
 in what is the part of the exhaust pipe 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:42.350
 and there we have a whole system in which 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.270
 we basically use a component that 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.450
 it's the ur since we have a tank 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.520
 special in which bout sweeps circular 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.660
 to straight tubing 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:56.180
 exhaust pipe and they will enter 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.460
 together they will come together 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.260
 towards the catalyst that is in 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.180
 how I already commented on the margin 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.730
 back later art gas 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.170
 escape theme escape and that's where it 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.090
 will form all that is the 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.630
 transformation in the metabolism of 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.850
 gases and gaseous pollutants by 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.560
 good nitrogen will come out there and it comes out 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.120
 after he goes through all that 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.220
 process comes out what is nitrogen and water 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.770
 converts to nitrogen and what comes out at 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.300
 nitro-phenos environment 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.010
 summing up you care about the 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.930
 preservation of the environment and 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.150
 also about the efficiency that is 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.310
 much more efficient the engine and against me 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.690
 consume less fuel also clear 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:38.330
 that 's right we do not try to conjugate 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.150
 the benefits of not having an engine 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.920
 efficient and at the same time that it contributes to 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.810
 the care of the environment what good 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.000
 that what all the brands in this 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.130
 moment of the legislations are 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.080
 pointing to your future that can more 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.300
 tell this good exercise here pink 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.250
 in this case but the good chassis 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.360
 basically dates and we have many and of 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.490
 12 meters in national 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.890
 this is cars or trujillo in the 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.830
 metal bus factory basically that is a 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.870
 12- meter vehicle is addressed 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.170
 for what is the service or the service 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.510
 urban basically the euro 5 legislation 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.860
 we have it here in Lima that's why 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.780
 we have our partner 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.209
 strategic that the metal bus is manufactured 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.310
 the complete bus is manufactured in 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.960
 trujillo and we bring it to kalimba 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.430
 basically we can do that 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.490
 only in the urban service but 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.170
 we have on the subject of caldh the 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.590
 body we can carve for 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:34.150
 tourism for staff and basically those 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.280
 are all the elements in which 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.780
 we participate with our brand 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.830
 with our motor brand a company 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.150
 who has a lot of time in Peru 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.790
 district now of brands like mercedes 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.760
 benz in this case where are you 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.500
 this located are in Lima have 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.780
 workshops in province also clear 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.910
 currently we have expanded all our 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.450
 dealer network we are located 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.910
 in almost almost all the Peru not in the zone 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.460
 north we have places where what 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.530
 is in trujillo in chiclayo in piura in 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.870
 the center area we have are located 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.090
 here on canada avenue 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.340
 we have locals in fobos &amp; we have a 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.560
 local in during we have a great center 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:15.010
 of distribution that is a warehouse that 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.400
 it helps us basically detoxify us 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.660
 little because we were before very 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.850
 stacked with spare parts with the 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.620
 buses with the units not basically 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.890
 we have that distribution center in the 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:30.730
 south we have what they are 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:32.140
 locals in arequipa in cusco in the area 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.050
 center also forget to mention that 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.890
 soon we are in huancayo 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.230
 right is a company that has a lot 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:40.210
 time here the important thing is always no 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.280
 only buy a this case of 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.940
 heavy transport vehicle a chassis of 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.860
 bus or truck 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.350
 good price I do not want you to have a good 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.940
 backrest with a technical backup and 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.380
 a guarantee company that can 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.360
 solve problems because here is your 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.920
 Silver is a bust that can luxury of 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.810
 seasonal and stop it for a spare that 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.040
 we have a month has to look for a 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.350
 company that has back in this 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.110
 motorcycle case we have in this 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:06.090
 case an adequate after-sales support in 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.280
 what are workshops in what they are 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.220
 spare parts stores we have a stock 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.650
 suitable for 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:15.500
 to be able to meet the demands of 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.300
 market in this case we do not have any 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.060
 problem we even manage the best 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:22.700
 prices because we handle what are 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.740
 alternative brands with equipment 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.240
 additional or attractive the guarantee 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.160
 of the case also practically for 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.660
 all the tastes of the client by 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.760
 then to the hill to add on 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.340
 all laws this super chassis that 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:37.389
 we have 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.889
 but 5 says bluetec 5 clear if in this 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:41.740
 case we have a very big expectation 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:44.320
 for this year in sales last year 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.479
 as as you know we do not end 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.400
 leaders in the market for years 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:50.560
 exactly market leaders and for him 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.780
 for this year we have the expectation of 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.060
 have a general level growth in 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.910
 buses 30% compared to Sunday 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:01.630
 12 years for m3 out there is telling me 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:03.040
 than 12 years because he previously has 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:06.400
 more than 20 years you came here in the 

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:08.729
 Peru there was not a measurement then but 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:13.270
 of my vision are two stamps that come 

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:16.030
 uninterrupted first if in this 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.680
 case we are market leaders in life 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.780
 of the devil we already show it even 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:23.050
 also in trucks we are now leaders 

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:24.850
 on buses and the expectation and ambition 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.860
 is always to have the tendency toward 

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.660
 up the container 30 percent in the 

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.490
 2003 have a growth with respect 

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.500
 to 30 percent with respect to the 

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:34.210
 2003 because now of the city ​​many 

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.430
 thanks for interview and we learned a 

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:39.760
 A little more of today 's chassis is 

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:41.440
 of buses bumped 100% m but that 

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.850
 it is also very important helping the 

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.889
 general labor work in our 

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:46.979
 country for another 100 day sequence by 

00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:46.979
 hour
