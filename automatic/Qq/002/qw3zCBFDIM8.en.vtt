once<00:00:01.290> you've<00:00:01.410> created<00:00:01.589> your<00:00:01.709> application

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
once you've created your application

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.309 
once you've created your application
using<00:00:02.700> blend<00:00:03.030> and<00:00:03.270> you've<00:00:03.990> gotten<00:00:04.260> everything

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
using blend and you've gotten everything

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.679 
using blend and you've gotten everything
laid<00:00:04.740> out<00:00:04.769> and<00:00:05.160> all<00:00:05.399> your<00:00:05.819> events<00:00:06.090> wired<00:00:06.450> up

00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:06.689 
laid out and all your events wired up

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:08.510 
laid out and all your events wired up
the<00:00:07.380> next<00:00:07.590> logical<00:00:07.740> thing<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.069> do<00:00:08.250> is<00:00:08.460> to

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:08.520 
the next logical thing to do is to

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.360 
the next logical thing to do is to
actually<00:00:09.090> try<00:00:09.390> the<00:00:09.450> application<00:00:10.050> out<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:10.620> we

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
actually try the application out and we

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.490 
actually try the application out and we
can<00:00:11.490> do<00:00:11.670> that<00:00:11.820> with<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.600> toolset<00:00:13.080> that<00:00:13.140> we've

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
can do that with the toolset that we've

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.120 
can do that with the toolset that we've
downloaded<00:00:13.880> by<00:00:14.880> running<00:00:15.720> the<00:00:15.840> project<00:00:16.019> in<00:00:16.439> the

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
downloaded by running the project in the

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.180 
downloaded by running the project in the
Windows<00:00:17.550> Phone<00:00:17.700> 7<00:00:18.210> emulator<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.100> the<00:00:20.100> way

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.190 
Windows Phone 7 emulator and the way

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.609 
Windows Phone 7 emulator and the way
that<00:00:20.310> we<00:00:20.400> do<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:21.050> up<00:00:22.050> here<00:00:22.320> under<00:00:22.560> the

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
that we do that is up here under the

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.529 
that we do that is up here under the
project<00:00:23.039> menu<00:00:23.190> there's<00:00:23.789> an<00:00:24.150> option<00:00:24.300> called

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
project menu there's an option called

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.050 
project menu there's an option called
run<00:00:25.350> project<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.520> can<00:00:26.640> see<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.760> when<00:00:27.029> I

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
run project and you can see that when I

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.920 
run project and you can see that when I
choose<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:28.260> run<00:00:28.440> the<00:00:28.560> project<00:00:28.770> I<00:00:29.100> get<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.240> dialog

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
choose to run the project I get a dialog

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.229 
choose to run the project I get a dialog
giving<00:00:31.260> me<00:00:31.350> an<00:00:31.410> option<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:32.009> what<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.640> do<00:00:32.789> I<00:00:32.999> can

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
giving me an option of what to do I can

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.599 
giving me an option of what to do I can
either<00:00:33.329> run<00:00:33.539> the<00:00:33.899> project<00:00:34.140> in<00:00:34.499> the<00:00:35.100> emulator

00:00:35.599 --> 00:00:35.609 
either run the project in the emulator

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:39.739 
either run the project in the emulator
or<00:00:35.850> on<00:00:36.780> an<00:00:37.260> actual<00:00:37.469> windows<00:00:38.460> phone<00:00:38.760> 7<00:00:39.329> device

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:39.749 
or on an actual windows phone 7 device

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:42.049 
or on an actual windows phone 7 device
that<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.019> have<00:00:40.199> attached<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.920> my<00:00:41.039> computer<00:00:41.429> now

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
that I have attached to my computer now

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.419 
that I have attached to my computer now
I<00:00:42.389> don't<00:00:42.839> have<00:00:43.019> a<00:00:43.079> windows<00:00:43.469> phone<00:00:43.499> 7<00:00:44.100> with<00:00:44.249> me

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:44.429 
I don't have a windows phone 7 with me

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:46.639 
I don't have a windows phone 7 with me
so<00:00:45.120> I'll<00:00:45.420> just<00:00:45.449> run<00:00:45.749> it<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.079> emulator<00:00:46.440> and

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
so I'll just run it in the emulator and

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.799 
so I'll just run it in the emulator and
i'll<00:00:46.889> leave<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.159> selection<00:00:47.850> highlighted

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
i'll leave that selection highlighted

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.709 
i'll leave that selection highlighted
and<00:00:48.899> click<00:00:49.409> ok<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.269> you<00:00:51.269> can<00:00:51.359> see<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
and click ok and you can see that the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.709 
and click ok and you can see that the
emulator<00:00:52.109> is<00:00:52.769> going<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.010> launch<00:00:53.510> so<00:00:54.510> let<00:00:54.659> me

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
emulator is going to launch so let me

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.539 
emulator is going to launch so let me
switch<00:00:54.839> over<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.199> emulator<00:00:55.499> so<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.519> is

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:56.549 
switch over to the emulator so this is

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:01.579 
switch over to the emulator so this is
the<00:00:56.789> windows<00:00:57.269> phone<00:00:57.920> 7<00:00:58.920> emulator<00:00:59.579> and<00:01:00.440> for<00:01:01.440> all

over here means to zoom and this button
down<00:01:34.710> here<00:01:34.740> means<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.460> minimize<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:37.140> we're

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
down here means to minimize so we're

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.380 
down here means to minimize so we're
gonna<00:01:38.070> leave<00:01:38.160> those<00:01:38.370> alone<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.090> can<00:01:39.210> see

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
gonna leave those alone so you can see

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.390 
gonna leave those alone so you can see
everything<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.290> now<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.010> application

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
everything so now that the application

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.100 
everything so now that the application
is<00:01:41.580> actually<00:01:41.820> running<00:01:41.910> in<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.150> emulator<00:01:42.450> we

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
is actually running in the emulator we

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.410 
is actually running in the emulator we
can<00:01:43.440> try<00:01:44.010> it<00:01:44.070> out<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.640> make<00:01:44.970> sure<00:01:45.030> it's<00:01:45.270> working

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
can try it out to make sure it's working

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.590 
can try it out to make sure it's working
so<00:01:46.260> remember<00:01:46.650> we<00:01:47.159> wired<00:01:47.850> up<00:01:48.030> event<00:01:48.270> handlers

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
so remember we wired up event handlers

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.020 
so remember we wired up event handlers
to<00:01:48.780> all<00:01:48.960> these<00:01:49.110> controls<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.340> when<00:01:50.880> the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
to all these controls so that when the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.760 
to all these controls so that when the
user<00:01:51.210> interacts<00:01:51.690> with<00:01:51.780> them<00:01:52.050> this<00:01:52.380> progress

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
user interacts with them this progress
