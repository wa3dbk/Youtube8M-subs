 then we give it to open 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:39.719
 and here it is and we follow the steps and now 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.630
 says to go to sources and see 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:44.549
 that I'm not going because I already 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.009
 delete the file that says here 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.560
 then you delete the file you give in 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.329
 this symbolic to save once the 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.509
 you have given, it will come out as a bar 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.709
 loading when it's loaded you give it 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.780
 a autorun to burn disk image 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:03.719
 select your pendrive here and 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.179
 You will record and you will record the image 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:09.509
 disk as such from a computer that 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:12.239
 is not the pti 2.0 with guadalinex that is 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.510
 one that uses windows does not matter what 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:19.470
 version then when I have done this 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:24.989
 I would take out your pendrive and put it in the 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:28.920
 tic 2.0 computer I would not put it in there and what 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:32.459
 you install as in my tutorial how 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.000
 install windows 7 in a 2.0 let's 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.000
 look for it 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.569
 I do it with a camera and it's very good 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:47.170
 explained to see 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.170
 how to install here in 10 games 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:57.150
 good i 'm going 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.080
 here with camera my laptop how it's done 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.680
 that this one to press and so on 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.450
 and here what we have to do then 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.750
 these two links or I'll leave it in the 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.310
 description is worth this to know how it 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.840
 install and this to know what there is to 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.670
 do if you do not feel like looking at my 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.500
 tutorial that it would be too late 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.750
 because you are already seeing it 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.820
 then when you put the pendrive of 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.320
 this way I get something different 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.470
 here because I was installing a last 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:28.130
 but by doing this we are going to 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.140
 get out this that puts install windows to 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.080
 me in this video I did not leave because no 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.420
 I had it done but this one did then 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.670
 when you have made me the aragüeños 7 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.550
 starter or I'm going like this and where I am 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.860
 you win it even if you still do not leave the 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:46.480
 junta de andalusia I recommend windows 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:49.599
 7 starter because very simple 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.870
 because it's made for your performance on 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:56.010
 it's made for a gig of ram and it's going to 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.980
 bundle the herd less 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.630
 I think it's better 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.240
 so then 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.240
 this has been all I have nothing more than 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.840
 explain but if you have any other questions 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.400
 or anything send me a message 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.110
 private but come on I think with these 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.300
 two things will not happen anything in the game 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.120
 If you have any questions, they sent a 

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:23.889
 private or anything and nothing comes a 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:26.550
 greeting subscribe that such come 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.550
 goodbye
