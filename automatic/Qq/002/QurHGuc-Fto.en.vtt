alright<00:05:09.649> here's<00:05:09.949> a<00:05:10.009> closer<00:05:10.339> look<00:05:10.729> at<00:05:10.909> the<00:05:11.059> mod

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
alright here's a closer look at the mod

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:17.129 
alright here's a closer look at the mod
the<00:05:11.330> finger<00:05:11.989> tapping<00:05:12.550> buttons<00:05:13.569> that<00:05:14.569> I<00:05:14.599> added

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:19.869 

what<00:05:18.139> they<00:05:18.259> do<00:05:18.319> there<00:05:18.830> you<00:05:19.249> can<00:05:19.399> see<00:05:19.639> they're

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:19.879 
what they do there you can see they're

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:23.559 
what they do there you can see they're
just<00:05:20.649> made<00:05:21.649> out<00:05:21.739> of<00:05:21.769> light<00:05:22.069> switches<00:05:22.399> and<00:05:23.269> so<00:05:23.539> I

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:23.569 
just made out of light switches and so I

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:27.219 
just made out of light switches and so I
had<00:05:23.989> lying<00:05:24.349> around<00:05:24.529> I<00:05:25.749> didn't<00:05:26.749> even<00:05:26.869> have<00:05:27.050> all

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
had lying around I didn't even have all

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:32.730 
had lying around I didn't even have all
the<00:05:27.379> same<00:05:27.589> color<00:05:27.979> so<00:05:28.669> I<00:05:29.679> basically<00:05:30.679> wanted<00:05:31.219> to

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
the same color so I basically wanted to

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.919 
the same color so I basically wanted to
make<00:05:33.740> it<00:05:33.889> so<00:05:34.039> that<00:05:34.069> each<00:05:34.279> switch<00:05:34.839> simulated<00:05:35.839> a

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:35.929 
make it so that each switch simulated a

00:05:35.929 --> 00:05:40.809 
make it so that each switch simulated a
fret<00:05:36.789> button<00:05:37.929> and<00:05:38.929> a<00:05:39.080> strum<00:05:39.439> at<00:05:40.159> the<00:05:40.369> same<00:05:40.550> time

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:40.819 
fret button and a strum at the same time

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:44.320 
fret button and a strum at the same time
so<00:05:41.809> each<00:05:42.019> one<00:05:42.259> of<00:05:42.379> these<00:05:42.499> if<00:05:43.459> you<00:05:43.669> hit<00:05:44.029> down

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
so each one of these if you hit down

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.619 
so each one of these if you hit down
you're<00:05:44.779> actually<00:05:45.379> simulating<00:05:46.099> a<00:05:46.279> strum<00:05:47.209> press

00:05:47.619 --> 00:05:47.629 
you're actually simulating a strum press

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:51.399 
you're actually simulating a strum press
and<00:05:48.580> fret<00:05:49.580> press<00:05:49.969> at<00:05:50.330> the<00:05:50.509> same<00:05:50.749> time<00:05:51.080> so<00:05:51.319> if

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:51.409 
and fret press at the same time so if

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:53.169 
and fret press at the same time so if
you<00:05:51.439> press<00:05:51.709> down<00:05:52.009> they're<00:05:52.399> both<00:05:52.610> held<00:05:52.939> down

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:53.179 
you press down they're both held down

00:05:53.179 --> 00:05:54.759 
you press down they're both held down
you<00:05:53.419> release<00:05:53.749> they're<00:05:53.990> both<00:05:54.139> released<00:05:54.499> and

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:54.769 
you release they're both released and

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:57.579 
you release they're both released and
this<00:05:55.519> is<00:05:55.610> kind<00:05:55.819> of<00:05:55.879> a<00:05:56.029> added<00:05:56.629> feature<00:05:57.110> where

00:05:57.579 --> 00:05:57.589 
this is kind of a added feature where

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:59.699 
this is kind of a added feature where
you<00:05:57.740> could<00:05:57.919> reach<00:05:58.129> around<00:05:58.309> behind<00:05:58.579> and<00:05:59.119> and

00:05:59.699 --> 00:05:59.709 
you could reach around behind and and

00:05:59.709 --> 00:06:04.269 
you could reach around behind and and
play<00:06:00.709> it<00:06:00.769> like<00:06:00.919> that<00:06:00.949> but<00:06:01.249> I<00:06:01.309> never<00:06:01.579> do<00:06:03.279> comes

00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:04.279 
play it like that but I never do comes

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:05.889 
play it like that but I never do comes
from<00:06:04.369> the<00:06:04.579> light<00:06:04.759> switches<00:06:05.059> kind<00:06:05.509> of<00:06:05.629> a<00:06:05.719> neat

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:05.899 
from the light switches kind of a neat

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:09.009 
from the light switches kind of a neat
little<00:06:06.019> bonus<00:06:06.469> but<00:06:06.800> anyway<00:06:07.789> I<00:06:08.089> made<00:06:08.839> the

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:09.019 
little bonus but anyway I made the

00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:11.529 
little bonus but anyway I made the
switches<00:06:09.499> by<00:06:09.679> hand<00:06:10.039> you<00:06:10.219> can<00:06:10.399> see<00:06:10.669> better

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:11.539 
switches by hand you can see better

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:14.559 
switches by hand you can see better
pictures<00:06:12.019> on<00:06:12.259> my<00:06:12.439> website<00:06:13.029> there's<00:06:14.029> a<00:06:14.149> link<00:06:14.179> in

pictures on my website there's a link in
the<00:06:14.659> description<00:06:14.809> but<00:06:15.619> underneath<00:06:16.339> each<00:06:16.879> one

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:17.179 
the description but underneath each one

00:06:17.179 --> 00:06:19.919 
the description but underneath each one
of<00:06:17.269> these<00:06:17.360> there's<00:06:17.779> two<00:06:18.740> little<00:06:19.069> homemade

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:19.929 
of these there's two little homemade

00:06:19.929 --> 00:06:22.839 
of these there's two little homemade
switches<00:06:20.929> I<00:06:21.079> guess<00:06:21.319> made<00:06:22.009> out<00:06:22.129> of<00:06:22.249> a<00:06:22.339> piece<00:06:22.789> of

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:22.849 
switches I guess made out of a piece of

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:27.489 
switches I guess made out of a piece of
aluminum<00:06:23.509> siding<00:06:23.839> and<00:06:24.819> some<00:06:26.019> breath<00:06:27.019> screws

00:06:27.489 --> 00:06:27.499 
aluminum siding and some breath screws

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:31.889 
aluminum siding and some breath screws
and<00:06:27.889> then<00:06:28.729> I<00:06:29.149> just<00:06:29.539> went<00:06:30.379> brute<00:06:30.649> force<00:06:30.979> and

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:31.899 
and then I just went brute force and

00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:38.379 
and then I just went brute force and
wired<00:06:32.899> it<00:06:33.169> in<00:06:34.749> so<00:06:35.749> each<00:06:36.050> switch<00:06:36.469> has<00:06:37.129> a<00:06:37.459> screw

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:38.389 
wired it in so each switch has a screw

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:40.480 
wired it in so each switch has a screw
here<00:06:38.659> a<00:06:38.719> screw<00:06:39.079> here<00:06:39.349> screw<00:06:39.709> here<00:06:39.919> screw<00:06:40.249> here

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.490 
here a screw here screw here screw here

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:50.169 
here a screw here screw here screw here
here<00:06:40.879> here<00:06:41.179> here<00:06:41.360> here<00:06:44.949> anyway<00:06:48.939> go<00:06:49.939> to<00:06:49.999> the

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:50.179 
here here here here anyway go to the
