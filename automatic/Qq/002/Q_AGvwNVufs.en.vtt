00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.469
 the authorities at second glance 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:12.910
 The Mercedes 130 is only from Warren connoisseurs of the Swedish brand as 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.239
 Recognize family member 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:19.309
 The small convertible sedan turns out to be real on closer inspection 

00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:22.899
 Nerd Intel over 100-year history of the Stuttgart carmaker 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.680
 why his brothers keep their typical grille in the wind 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.860
 you discover the 103 winner a closed hood without louvers 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.330
 that gives rise to suspicion 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.110
 the engine is in the rear 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.630
 properly the Mercedes 130 is a true representative of the specially rear-engined car 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.010
 the fashionable streamlined shape of the '30s set the trend for 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.090
 Electric car because except rumplagen Qatar Porsche and Skoda also the 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.090
 Mercedes engineers pursued 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.280
 our type 130 from the year 1935 is a force july she must be with me 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.280
 fixed firmer 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.040
 will want to hit the fabric top has to bring some time 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.630
 but with a little less exercise and routine the procedure then too 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.010
 quickly across the stage 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.650
 Nevertheless, a red light fans at the traffic light is not enough for this 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.560
 From today's perspective idiosyncratic roof construction was in the then 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.560
 Epoch quite common and popular with customers 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.510
 Wherever the eye looks the Mercedes small car attracts with many charming 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.510
 Details that are typical for the 30s 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.860
 At that time, the bumper could still be made of solid chrome-plated start 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.210
 just as typical of his time the crow leaf springs of the front axle 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:12.120
 the front part with the snub nose in the face of supercooled loose 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:15.119
 Hood shows unmistakably the engine sits 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:18.779
 So here must be shape of the trunk 

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:29.869
 where the viewer quickly realizes that everything is relative 

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:34.449
 a luggage compartment in the true sense of the Mercedes 130 has not 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:37.669
 Anyone who uses his bike and tool kit will take a lot of space away 

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:51.149
 the idiosyncratic proportions of the small convertible sedan are on 

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:54.149
 long since behind the rear axle arranged row four-cylinder 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:58.399
 over this prop he gets placed in front of the engine water cool draft 

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:01.399
 mandatory 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.790
 The once grief 3-liter engine mobilizes a gentle 26 hp which he over 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.499
 a 3-speed gearbox delivers to the rear wheels 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:17.399
 The car, which weighs around 1,000 kilograms, can easily reach a speed of 90 kilometers 

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:31.819
 Amazing the traction Aramark running under engine 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:41.159
 February 1934, the Mercedes 130 came as a normal sedan on the market 

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:49.449
 besides, there was the interesting type 150 Sport Roadster and the closed one 

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:52.449
 also two-seater sports sedan 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.949
 hor thanks to you and the very first Zündapp test car you can see clearly 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:01.339
 how the later vw beetle can get to its shape 

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:04.509
 Mercedes can undoubtedly be considered a pioneer 

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:09.909
 The first Volkswagen prototypes were completed in 1934, ie exactly in that 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:13.099
 Year when Mercedes already sold a small rear-engined car 

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:19.680
 but during the constructed by Ferdinand Porsche vw-beetle ultimately too 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.970
 Mass casserole from Sirte and is still produced today 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.970
 became the Mercedes 130 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.409
 built in small numbers for only two years 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:32.830
 The Stuttgart finally said goodbye to the rear engine in 1936 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.929
 Principle around itself with the successor 170 of the standard construction method with front engine 

00:04:37.929 --> 00:04:40.929
 turn 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.210
 so in our completely restored museum car is a true 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.809
 rare Mercedes 

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:56.079
 Globally, Type 130 is likely to have fewer than 100 vehicles left over 

00:04:56.079 --> 00:04:59.079
 are 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.030
 The four-meter-long car can accommodate four passengers 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:13.339
 the instrumentation is functional and not luxurious the 130 he was yes 

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:18.399
 Also conceived as an affordable small car for the people 1935 DiCaprio costs 

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:21.010
 Limousine 3900 Reichsmark 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.950
 what was not a lot of money for a Mercedes was this cheap was this 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.950
 Price but not then 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.759
 it's a man with the little pre-war Mercedes on the way he lies 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:35.430
 Although already its charm 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.139
 in a cozy country game on small side streets with open 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:42.539
 Hood Peter Stein Haug past the car 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.130
 Of course, the Mercedes 130 calls for a forward-looking and 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.969
 contemplative driving 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:58.469
 Steering and circuit want to be tackled in Märkisch 

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:01.860
 the thin tires and the deluge suspension technology 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.860
 make for a latent tendency to swing the tail 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.659
 Today, the rear engine car for Mercedes has long been no longer an issue only 

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:15.979
 Porsche has remained faithful to this principle, but that is a completely different one 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:16.059
 history
