00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
runs freely on the line so there's no

quick<00:01:24.999> change<00:01:25.329> bead<00:01:25.659> is<00:01:25.869> just<00:01:26.109> there<00:01:26.380> of<00:01:26.619> which

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
quick change bead is just there of which

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.090 
quick change bead is just there of which
the<00:01:27.310> hooklink<00:01:27.520> which<00:01:27.999> is<00:01:28.179> attached<00:01:28.450> to<00:01:28.719> there
