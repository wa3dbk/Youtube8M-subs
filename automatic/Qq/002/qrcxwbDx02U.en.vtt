00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
important thing for the ectomorph is

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.870 
important thing for the ectomorph is
enough<00:00:23.880> protein<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.920> the<00:00:25.920> nutrition<00:00:26.460> side<00:00:26.670> of

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
enough protein is the nutrition side of

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.380 
enough protein is the nutrition side of
it<00:00:27.029> right<00:00:27.170> the<00:00:28.170> most<00:00:28.670> important<00:00:29.670> nutrients

muscle<00:00:35.719> it's<00:00:36.719> not<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.050> protein<00:00:37.500> man<00:00:38.450> it's

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
muscle it's not the protein man it's

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.830 
muscle it's not the protein man it's
your<00:00:39.629> carbs<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.230> your<00:00:40.379> fats<00:00:41.149> ok<00:00:42.149> because<00:00:42.629> if

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
your carbs and your fats ok because if

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.750 
your carbs and your fats ok because if
you're<00:00:43.020> not<00:00:43.170> getting<00:00:43.410> enough<00:00:43.620> carbs<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.700> your

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
you're not getting enough carbs in your

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.540 
you're not getting enough carbs in your
diet<00:00:45.410> whatever<00:00:46.410> protein<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.039> eat<00:00:47.070> your

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
diet whatever protein you eat your

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.420 
diet whatever protein you eat your
body's<00:00:47.850> gonna<00:00:47.969> use<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.590> to<00:00:49.590> give<00:00:50.039> your<00:00:50.219> body

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
body's gonna use that to give your body

body's gonna use that to give your body
in<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.820> yeah<00:00:51.719> we're<00:00:52.170> not<00:00:52.320> saying<00:00:52.559> neglects

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
in it yeah we're not saying neglects

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.350 
in it yeah we're not saying neglects
your<00:00:53.190> fucking<00:00:53.489> protein<00:00:53.879> get<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> bunch<00:00:54.300> of

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
your fucking protein get a bunch of

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.660 
your fucking protein get a bunch of
column<00:00:54.690> protein<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.559> important<00:00:56.010> too<00:00:56.129> but<00:00:56.610> a

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
column protein is important too but a

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.580 
column protein is important too but a
lot<00:00:56.850> actor<00:00:57.210> must<00:00:57.390> go<00:00:57.539> wrong<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.989> if<00:00:58.020> they<00:00:58.379> focus

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
lot actor must go wrong is if they focus

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.709 
lot actor must go wrong is if they focus
too<00:00:58.829> much<00:00:59.010> on<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.460> protein<00:00:59.879> they<00:01:00.390> forget

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
too much on the protein they forget

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.630 
too much on the protein they forget
about<00:01:00.750> their<00:01:01.109> carbs<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.710> fats<00:01:02.129> man<00:01:02.430> yeah

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
about their carbs and fats man yeah

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.280 
about their carbs and fats man yeah
carbs<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.270> fats<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.750> most<00:01:03.930> important

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
carbs and fats is the most important

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.929 
carbs and fats is the most important
thing<00:01:04.439> if<00:01:04.650> your<00:01:04.830> person<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.369> hard<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.790> gain

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
thing if your person is hard to gain

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.340 
thing if your person is hard to gain
weight<00:01:06.150> yeah<00:01:06.299> if<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.540> get<00:01:06.689> enough<00:01:06.900> carbs<00:01:07.229> and

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
weight yeah if you get enough carbs and

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.740 
weight yeah if you get enough carbs and
fats<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.770> protein<00:01:08.159> your<00:01:08.340> body<00:01:08.580> gets<00:01:08.939> they<00:01:09.540> can

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
fats to protein your body gets they can

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.050 
fats to protein your body gets they can
use<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.619> know<00:01:10.770> for<00:01:11.100> work<00:01:11.369> somebody<00:01:11.760> uses

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
use that you know for work somebody uses

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.060 
use that you know for work somebody uses
proteins<00:01:12.510> for<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:13.110> know<00:01:13.229> which<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.920> build

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
proteins for you know which is to build

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.560 
proteins for you know which is to build
muscle<00:01:14.520> with<00:01:14.610> some<00:01:14.729> other<00:01:14.909> functions<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
muscle with some other functions of the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.080 
muscle with some other functions of the
by<00:01:15.689> like<00:01:15.869> your<00:01:16.020> immune<00:01:16.229> system<00:01:16.619> but<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.820> gotta

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
by like your immune system but you gotta

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.539 
by like your immune system but you gotta
get<00:01:18.360> your<00:01:18.659> fucking<00:01:19.439> fats<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.950> your<00:01:20.100> carbs<00:01:20.430> in

you calories and carbs and fats and
Geeks<00:01:25.740> your<00:01:25.890> protein<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.850> know<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.420> should

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
Geeks your protein you know you should

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.020 
Geeks your protein you know you should
aim<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:28.650> know<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.460> very<00:01:29.549> debate

aim to you know this is very debate
about<00:01:30.180> how<00:01:30.360> much<00:01:30.509> actual<00:01:31.200> protein<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.799> need<00:01:31.979> a

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
about how much actual protein you need a

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.330 
about how much actual protein you need a
day<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.400> live<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.630> build<00:01:33.900> more<00:01:34.110> muscle<00:01:34.340> I'm

day use I'm around 140 talking just six

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.780 
day use I'm around 140 talking just six
sometimes<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.439> little<00:01:49.530> bit<00:01:49.710> more<00:01:49.920> sometimes<00:01:50.520> a

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
sometimes a little bit more sometimes a

little bit less but I'm right around

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.050 
little bit less but I'm right around
that<00:01:52.079> range<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:53.040> know<00:01:53.130> if<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.369> cut<00:01:53.939> straight

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
that range you know if you cut straight

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.730 
that range you know if you cut straight
on<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:55.140> should<00:01:55.170> be<00:01:55.439> in<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.619> position
