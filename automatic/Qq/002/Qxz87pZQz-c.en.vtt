be unfortunate because maybe you only

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.080 
be unfortunate because maybe you only
have<00:00:40.920> one<00:00:41.129> device<00:00:41.399> so<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.760> might<00:00:41.910> have<00:00:42.000> to

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
have one device so you might have to

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.400 
have one device so you might have to
wait<00:00:42.329> till<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.540> friend<00:00:42.840> goes<00:00:43.020> over<00:00:43.290> or

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
wait till a friend goes over or

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.889 
wait till a friend goes over or
something<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:45.000> kind<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.480> old<00:00:45.629> so

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
something and this is kind of old so

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.840 
something and this is kind of old so
while<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.200> got<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.469> do<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.860> get<00:00:47.160> both<00:00:47.430> players

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
while you got to do is get both players

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.580 
while you got to do is get both players
in<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.239> same<00:00:48.539> chest<00:00:48.870> here<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.200> I'm<00:00:49.320> trying<00:00:49.469> to

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
in the same chest here so I'm trying to

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.479 
in the same chest here so I'm trying to
work<00:00:49.680> two<00:00:49.950> devices<00:00:50.850> at<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.360> same<00:00:51.449> time<00:00:51.870> and

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
work two devices at the same time and

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.340

basically all you have to do is on both
devices<00:00:55.850> take<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.059> out<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.390> chest<00:00:57.719> at<00:00:57.899> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
devices take it out of the chest at the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.619 
devices take it out of the chest at the
same<00:00:58.289> exact<00:00:58.680> time<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.730> didn't<00:01:00.420> actually

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629

this<00:01:18.330> by<00:01:18.900> simply<00:01:19.140> holding<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.040> at<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.310> same

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
this by simply holding on it at the same

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.429 
this by simply holding on it at the same
time<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:21.270> might<00:01:21.479> or<00:01:21.630> might<00:01:21.659> not<00:01:21.810> work<00:01:22.200> it

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
time this might or might not work it

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.219 
time this might or might not work it
might<00:01:22.619> take<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> couple<00:01:23.040> tries<00:01:23.549> but<00:01:24.390> it's<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:25.080> lot

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
might take a couple tries but it's a lot

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.340
