00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:12.609
 this crisis has only succeeded 

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:14.649
 too 

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:16.249
 so these are portraits of a passenger 

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:19.249
 car VAZ 2105 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:23.259
 deny that abortion 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:25.980
 surely the article was a daughter 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.609
 then just ordinary 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.609
 pharmacy business 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.380
 do not tell me like friends 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.330
 to these on coupons he explained torpedoes 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.750
 reported by afp 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.710
 then we look left hand 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.710
 if you count 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.190
 bye this time friends 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.900
 to assist 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.360
 before painting 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.360
 if you want a portrait vacation 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.850
 black color 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 everything is so departure 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.380
 but due to the result 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.880
 greatest losses 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.619
 yes you can 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.990
 patriotic 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.650
 a little bit 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.960
 what the operator is saying 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.250
 but then 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.050
 can practically 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.260
 how much is the company 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.390
 After all, there have since become one 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.710
 so before this first class drawn 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.950
 the main thing that it was something 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.220
 draw that question seems like motors 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.070
 except that first 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.570
 so how would 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.610
 second branch is important 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.610
 portrait to draw that eye 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.510
 widespread 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:42.950
 find application in this technique 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.050
 Moscow change 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.720
 on saturday is cut 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.180
 victory at the Olympiad 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.500
 you can wipe out the zinochka by the second 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.720
 place alpha bank 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.100
 ah no 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.460
 Perhaps help has not dried up the mask 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.210
 it is approximately 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.170
 once again in one and a half 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.430
 He is still as they say they can live 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.920
 use a rubber band like 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.280
 white light cleaning tool 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.280
 Levonyan possible places 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.259
 stage when she was arrested 

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:52.289
 about the same 2 plastic can 

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:53.709
 draw and wear 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.809
 according to the principle of acceptance we fall below 

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:59.159
 wide application in this technique besides 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:02:59.650
 show 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.609
 so to speak 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:03.039
 Muscovites them on the national spatula 

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:04.999
 they are easy 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:06.599
 protein of any party 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.059
 you are welcome 

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:09.429
 at cost 

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:11.949
 missing how to draw 

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:14.169
 hemchyk 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:15.279
 keep it up 

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:17.189
 so say gram 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:20.189
 kim got three got a t-shirt but 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.809
 large planes 

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:28.829
 still pounded 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.829
 what kind of donut cards 

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:35.679
 it is most convenient for them to do it 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.609
 for example a portrait is drawn 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:01.749
 in september by christians 

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:04.329
 which are called synthetics 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.329
 does not suit him 

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:10.529
 I repeat that the technique is very neat 

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:13.689
 hundreds suffer no errors 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:16.699
 Pomorie therefore extremely not attention 

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:20.869
 also end casco 

00:04:20.869 --> 00:04:23.330
 on the palette, we have nothing left 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.129
 take a tube 

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:27.249
 graze the cap 

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:30.249
 and squeeze the coloring again 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.860
 something like this needs to be done 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.219
 extremely neat 

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:40.569
 he will repeat brushes should be again 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:41.939
 for example such 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:44.029
 plushenko ethics 

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:47.009
 yes, please 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:48.689
 name is best to draw in such 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:50.039
 technology 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:51.610
 they and elastic 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.620
 same time 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.340
 Miass 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.290
 well played masses are well rubbed 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.290
 specially paper 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:05.319
 and there is the price for them 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:10.189
 while only finger 

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:13.289
 then when not away and these are such 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:14.870
 tassel shelves 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.870
 hardly something they can already draw 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:39.659
 don't forget about that 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:41.719
 what gum serves 

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:45.189
 in this technique a very important tool 

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:47.990
 sailors 0 6 m 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.229
 what does it yourself 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:53.129
 so just like before the eyes 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:56.129
 never forget the rubber 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:00.069
 never 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.300
 enter should be in a variety of sizes 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.270
 for example if you are drawing dollars 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.229
 she takes the money 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:33.819
 to work out small parts 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:35.159
 the same 

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:37.830
 Pushkin girls here is best draw 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.830
 fine tassels 

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:44.699
 for example on the decline 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:50.789
 first drawn 

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:53.759
 fine details 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:56.149
 but first, excluding VAT 

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:59.639
 they have brushes 

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:02.430
 and then the pain 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.860
 floor smith tassels 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.899
 You can draw Kovalchik 

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:10.899
 gaining points in this way volume 

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:12.929
 do deep
