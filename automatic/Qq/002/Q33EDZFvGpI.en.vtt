00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.130
 and good to all and welcome to a 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.400
 new video adrián f1 esp today I bring you 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:23.000
 a new commented video of motogp 13 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:26.330
 a few days ago upload a video too 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.910
 I've talked about the demo version in 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.210
 definitive general game this one that has 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.950
 left today 21 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.840
 simply that he was stuck at 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.750
 Catalonia circuit and I left you 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.820
 choose the pilots but as for 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.680
 physics and graphics the demo version is 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.710
 exactly the same as the final version 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.490
 that has been released and well you have 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.460
 could see that your video 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:52.420
 today three videos of the race of the 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.460
 moto 3 at the indianápolis circuit 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.730
 another moto2 race in the circuit 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.620
 assen and here the category reigns motogp 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.470
 in the circuit of le mans a race 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.710
 with jorge lorenzo that you have seen that 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:09.320
 I started from the last position as 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.610
 it is usual in mode in mode 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.830
 race where you select the pilot 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:19.250
 well first select the category and 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.390
 then the pilot and then select 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.450
 The circuit 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.860
 and you always come out in last position and 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.840
 well we also have another engine 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.960
 game as is the usual trajectory in 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.990
 all driving games 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.900
 and this style means in all 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.360
 the games 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.950
 formula 1the motors has its mode of 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.320
 trajectory since you have to start 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.380
 from below and according to your results in 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.290
 then you go up and then 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.350
 we also have the instantaneous mode that 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.700
 you select it and automatically 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.090
 that selected current enters the 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.750
 circuit 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:02.179
 a team and pilot and you start running 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:04.250
 and then we have the game menus that 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.590
 they are pretty simple it's nothing 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.099
 complicated are simple menus with sole 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.720
 jr in milestone and also some like 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:15.810
 the owl perform three I already found in 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.720
 this even too simple too 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.170
 but hey you have all the options for 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.090
 configure perfectly 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.370
 and a simple way 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.480
 and well here you are watching the race in 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.780
 which is today going back little by little 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.030
 and then I play from the camera from the 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.480
 helmet because I think it's a novelty 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.890
 quite interesting in this 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.620
 the cameras from the helmet 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.730
 the truth that brings a realism 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.080
 quite important to the games since 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.240
 is will play from the outer camera 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.020
 it would appear 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:55.400
 more unreal than what I intend 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:57.530
 that are the games that I upload to my channel 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.530
 I like to give them a touch of 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:04.870
 realism and that's why I always try in 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:07.510
 All games choose a time of day 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.030
 option is available and if not then 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.900
 also weather conditions 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.299
 that adapt and favor 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.340
 and in this case if I remember correctly I think 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.909
 that the races that he had him mans 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.069
 this year and as usual 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:27.129
 they were wet and in conditions of 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:30.549
 cloudy as it is in this video and so 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:33.250
 I think it's pretty favorable to 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.049
 environment of this circuit level of 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.450
 career that is usually usual 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.750
 rain 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.430
 and good in fourth position we are in the 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.709
 last lap 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.230
 and good the physics also other subjects 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:50.219
 which I already talked about but to highlight the 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.590
 a little more I'm liking is a 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:55.709
 I play that the truth entertains me 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.150
 Pretty much spends time 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.510
 fast when you're playing you can 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:03.120
 make a race of ten laps obliges 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.159
 to one hundred percent maybe you'll 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.590
 case a little but short races is going to 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:09.870
 be saying different categories and already 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.240
 that as each category has its 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:16.480
 particularities and 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:19.180
 quite remarkable because 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.820
 the motogp are much more nervous 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.700
 that the moto2 and moto3 esquerré created 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.980
 in the game not driving any of 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.850
 them so I do not know if they correspond 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.650
 with reality but I think that there the 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.080
 They have done well and as you can see 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.320
 in the previous videos the motorcycle 3 is 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:42.970
 a motorcycle that is obviously slower than 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.560
 the others but it is quite gray and in 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.080
 that aspect 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:51.550
 maybe you have too much later the moto2 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:53.260
 they are some motorcycles that have greater major 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.680
 displacement 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.840
 that the moto3 and therefore reach 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.690
 higher speeds and are more nervous 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.520
 at the exit of the curves and there's also 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:07.350
 have more control with the accelerator 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:10.300
 of the control or the keyboard since any 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.340
 clueless we can fall to the ground and 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.560
 then here the motorcycle gp are the most 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.320
 complicated to carry you have to do 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.780
 many corrections and it's an aspect that 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.240
 in the game it seemed to me that 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.850
 they are well elaborated for each 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.950
 category and so nothing here is going to 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.930
 finish the video so I hope that you 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.170
 have liked a greeting and even the 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.170
 next
