00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.350
 hello girls and boys here I bring you a 

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:11.270
 video of how I disinfected my 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:13.580
 utensils and what we are going to occupy is a 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:16.070
 common where to put the varnish zidane that 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.820
 is the disinfectant and we are going to occupy 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:23.560
 this barbie cida we have to 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.150
 dilute it in water and what we're going to do 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.460
 here tells us to do the 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.859
 disinfectant 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:36.340
 we need mixte to 2 ounces of barbies 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:39.930
 cida with 32 ounces of water ok 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:44.200
 I do not know if you can see then a 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.420
 of Boston is half an ounce 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.940
 so if it says two ounces they're going to be 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.030
 four tablespoons and the first thing that 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.360
 put in the cart is the bike bar that and 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.140
 Then you put the water on it, but only 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.140
 let's start 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.490
 and all 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.520
 so is 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:25.399
 4 and first you put this because it's very 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.310
 dangerous if it falls in your eyes so it's 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:30.010
 even if it falls on the skin you have to wash 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.370
 hands 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:36.340
 fast since we have this here we're going 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.740
 to put water and in this jug 32 ounces is 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.650
 more or less above the letters though 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.290
 then let me put water and another 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.510
 the things that we have to do before 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.750
 put the utensils there is we have to 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.990
 wash them well washed with soap 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.970
 It can be any antibacterial soap 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.830
 and we have to carve them to be 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.320
 remove all received from the nail to 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.510
 natural of people although that I'm going to 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.520
 wash my utensils with soap and already 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:07.119
 he came back 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.869
 because we are already back now 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.849
 water and here I already have my utensils 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.209
 Carve with this soap and with soap 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:19.180
 for the hands and now that they are clean 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:22.660
 that do not have any bit of any 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.500
 type of waste what we do is take 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.500
 the cover 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.540
 Y 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.110
 he wake up 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.969
 and they put the utensils and also 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.640
 even these brushes as they are from 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:46.620
 plastic can also be seen inside 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.250
 and now it has to be left there for 10 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.340
 minutes 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.350
 and when they take it out I do not know who the 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.250
 rinses you just have to 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.690
 dry solids so I hope you 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.280
 this video is useful if they have 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.710
 Any question please leave me at 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.710
 know and thanks for watching my videos
