00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.680 
AF picture it's actually on my
background<00:00:30.500> for<00:00:31.500> my<00:00:31.590> channel<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.759> was<00:00:33.540> just

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
background for my channel it was just

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.770 
background for my channel it was just
this<00:00:33.960> like<00:00:34.370> kid<00:00:35.370> dug<00:00:35.790> like<00:00:35.940> Goku<00:00:36.329> pretty<00:00:36.600> much

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
this like kid dug like Goku pretty much

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.110 
this like kid dug like Goku pretty much
in<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.079> weird<00:00:37.290> outfit<00:00:37.710> that's<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.489> son<00:00:38.700> Goshen

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
in a weird outfit that's it son Goshen

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.500 
in a weird outfit that's it son Goshen
so<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.780> guess<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.469> like<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.770> name<00:00:41.030> and<00:00:42.030> then<00:00:42.270> I

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
so I guess I like the name and then I

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.479 
so I guess I like the name and then I
started<00:00:42.989> using<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.530> normal<00:00:43.890> user<00:00:44.040> names<00:00:44.280> and

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
started using it normal user names and

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.180 
started using it normal user names and
that's<00:00:44.640> how<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.210> all<00:00:45.300> became<00:00:45.629> Goshen<00:00:46.140> but<00:00:46.950> I

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
that's how it all became Goshen but I

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.520 
that's how it all became Goshen but I
wanted<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.180> make<00:00:48.329> my<00:00:48.510> own<00:00:48.539> figure<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.110> Goshen

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
wanted to make my own figure of Goshen

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.639 
wanted to make my own figure of Goshen
so<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.489> made<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.120> Goshen<00:00:51.510> but<00:00:52.050> my<00:00:52.199> own<00:00:52.350> style

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
so I made a Goshen but my own style

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.790 
so I made a Goshen but my own style
because<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.219> Dragon<00:00:53.520> Ball<00:00:53.640> AF<00:00:54.079> picture<00:00:55.079> does

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
because the Dragon Ball AF picture does

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.979 
because the Dragon Ball AF picture does
not<00:00:56.010> look<00:00:56.160> like<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:56.579> cushion<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.329> just<00:00:57.750> made

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
not look like this cushion I just made

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.490 
not look like this cushion I just made
up<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.379> style<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.770> Goshen<00:00:59.160> so<00:01:00.030> yeah<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.440> is

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
up this style of Goshen so yeah this is

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.910 
up this style of Goshen so yeah this is
my

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
my

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.429 
my
Goshen<00:01:02.640> my<00:01:02.940> my<00:01:03.750> style<00:01:04.049> Goshen<00:01:04.470> okay<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.580> I

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
Goshen my my style Goshen okay so I

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.039 
Goshen my my style Goshen okay so I
decided<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.619> make<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> figure<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.549> how<00:01:08.850> I

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
decided to make a figure of how I

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.740 
decided to make a figure of how I
pictured<00:01:10.049> Goshen<00:01:10.439> myself<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.580> like<00:01:12.540> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
pictured Goshen myself so I like the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:20.480 
pictured Goshen myself so I like the
idea<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:14.299> Goku<00:01:15.299> looking<00:01:17.090> character<00:01:19.189> yeah<00:01:20.189> I

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
idea of Goku looking character yeah I

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.030 
idea of Goku looking character yeah I
guess<00:01:20.909> like<00:01:21.350> when<00:01:22.350> he<00:01:22.439> was<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.590> kid<00:01:22.770> he<00:01:22.890> looks

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
guess like when he was a kid he looks

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.130 
guess like when he was a kid he looks
like<00:01:23.130> go<00:01:23.280> tengoku<00:01:23.790> whatever<00:01:24.270> but<00:01:24.900> when<00:01:25.049> he

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
like go tengoku whatever but when he

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.370 
like go tengoku whatever but when he
turns<00:01:25.820> when<00:01:26.820> he's<00:01:26.939> an<00:01:27.090> adult<00:01:27.180> or<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.720> teen<00:01:28.140> or

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
turns when he's an adult or a teen or

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.399 
turns when he's an adult or a teen or
whatever<00:01:28.740> an<00:01:29.100> adult<00:01:29.460> he<00:01:30.000> looks<00:01:30.210> like<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:31.140> go

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
whatever an adult he looks like you go

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.760 
whatever an adult he looks like you go
on<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:32.659> yeah<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.320> really<00:01:34.619> like<00:01:34.799> like<00:01:36.770> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770
