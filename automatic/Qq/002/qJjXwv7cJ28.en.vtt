00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:52.910
 Hello everyone and today we are analyzing one 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:57.350
 unpretentious spanish body mup usually 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:01:04.010
 such music of this genre like everything 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:10.820
 so it makes sense to learn it and so 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:14.210
 Click here this court is the first 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.780
 string clamped on the fourth fret the third 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:21.340
 the country is clamped on the fourth fret and the fifth 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.340
 the string is clamped in the second year 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:34.210
 and just spend on all then on 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:37.180
 the first string we clamp the fifth fret 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:42.730
 seventh mode 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.730
 in the twelfth year we do vibrato 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:52.359
 then the first string in the eighth year 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.570
 7 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:57.060
 fifth 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.420
 four 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.280
 pen 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.280
 and open 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:22.370
 then we hold the chord and do not do it 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:25.290
 do this sorting over all the strings and 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.940
 then play the first and second country 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.940
 first on the first and then on the second 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:40.940
 so once then shifting mccartney 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:43.420
 in one way and play the same bust 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:47.760
 once 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:53.010
 then we shift back again we transfer 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.010
 transfer back again 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:15.550
 then again and brother on 12 country 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:20.800
 then do hamar on the first string 4 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.800
 fret to 5 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:35.940
 hamar is such a thing as 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:42.870
 pull the string and at this time 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.870
 hit the second finger on this year 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.689
 and immediately drop it 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.390
 then we clamp the first string on the first 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.140
 fret 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:03.920
 then open 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.580
 then open again then pinch on 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.300
 first fret 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.420
 on the fourth 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.530
 again at first 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.530
 and open again 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:19.480
 then fight 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:23.519
 mine goes on the same chords on 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.519
 which we did brute force
