 farm where also turkey during the competition 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.500

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.780
 just with your mind so it seems 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.810
 year 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.810
 at a time 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.570
 he is not rich in the ns though look especially at this one 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.070
 but how about dani fernandez is exactly the same as that 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.150
 no opponent in the neighborhood no none out of balance and because he wasn't either 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.090
 really out of balance and then still wrong unimaginable you see that 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.050
 Nowadays more and more market is an explanation for what may well be 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.890

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.290

 We now see the city as more television icon for the city turns out to be one

 or more but think we are there 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.320
 it is interesting because, for example, research is about measuring 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.330
 there is nothing we can do about that being human is explained for that by ourselves 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.190
 that it has to do with the intensity or 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.070
 may suggest that 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.710

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.240

 we have to go in now 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.650
 and I do not have so much veto a suggestion for someone from it 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.309
 land in the name but I hope you are not suitable because it is a man who is not 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:39.129
 always sit in my eyes 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.910

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:46.489
 Veerman is for Fortis that there was a lot of trouble in advance with VVV 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.060
 aerts is a team maybe nice 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.620
 is a more suitable candidate but it is no longer the man who is in top clubs 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.729
 drag through it 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:56.329
 as far as I am concerned it goes between the two
