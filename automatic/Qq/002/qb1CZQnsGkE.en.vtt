00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.820 

and<00:00:06.290> keep<00:00:06.620> panning<00:00:06.830> around<00:00:07.069> and<00:00:07.990> we<00:00:08.990> decided

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:09.830 
and keep panning around and we decided

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.600 
and keep panning around and we decided
to<00:00:10.040> get<00:00:10.160> out<00:00:10.219> on<00:00:10.340> a<00:00:11.590> cloudy<00:00:12.590> rainy<00:00:12.980> day<00:00:13.280> and

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 
to get out on a cloudy rainy day and

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.100 
to get out on a cloudy rainy day and
actually<00:00:14.120> I<00:00:14.360> think<00:00:14.389> this<00:00:14.690> is<00:00:14.780> going<00:00:14.900> to<00:00:14.960> be

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.110 
actually I think this is going to be

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.929 
actually I think this is going to be
better<00:00:15.290> because<00:00:15.559> it<00:00:15.950> adds<00:00:16.340> much<00:00:16.730> more

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:16.939 
better because it adds much more

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:28.170 
better because it adds much more
dramatic<00:00:17.420> atmosphere<00:00:17.660> to<00:00:18.259> the<00:00:18.349> mountains

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.370 

where<00:00:28.840> we<00:00:28.960> are<00:00:29.190> um<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:31.660> was<00:00:31.810> called<00:00:32.020> for

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:32.380 
where we are um that was called for

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.830 
where we are um that was called for
what's<00:00:33.280> big<00:00:33.490> for<00:00:33.730> mountain<00:00:34.210> morning<00:00:34.480> right

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
what's big for mountain morning right

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.910 
what's big for mountain morning right
and<00:00:35.560> apparently<00:00:36.430> there<00:00:36.760> used<00:00:36.910> to<00:00:37.000> be<00:00:37.060> a

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
and apparently there used to be a

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.500 
and apparently there used to be a
railway<00:00:38.920> along<00:00:39.280> here<00:00:39.640> that<00:00:39.880> took<00:00:40.090> people<00:00:40.360> up

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
railway along here that took people up

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.600 
railway along here that took people up

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
to the silver and gold mines and there

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.520 
to the silver and gold mines and there
was<00:00:42.730> a<00:00:42.760> hotel<00:00:43.090> that<00:00:43.300> was<00:00:43.600> built<00:00:43.900> in<00:00:44.050> that<00:00:44.170> spot

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
was a hotel that was built in that spot

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.130 
was a hotel that was built in that spot
where<00:00:45.160> people<00:00:45.400> could<00:00:45.550> stop<00:00:45.760> overnight<00:00:46.140> and

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
where people could stop overnight and

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.810 
where people could stop overnight and
that<00:00:47.320> fireplace<00:00:47.739> stone<00:00:48.100> fireplaces<00:00:48.550> all

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
that fireplace stone fireplaces all

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.360 
that fireplace stone fireplaces all
that's<00:00:49.000> left<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:50.320> burned<00:00:50.559> down<00:00:50.680> it<00:00:51.070> was<00:00:51.190> built

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
that's left it burned down it was built

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.670 
that's left it burned down it was built
in<00:00:51.460> nineteen<00:00:51.489> twenty<00:00:51.970> and<00:00:52.059> burned<00:00:52.239> down<00:00:52.390> in

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
in nineteen twenty and burned down in

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.700 
in nineteen twenty and burned down in
1949<00:00:56.309> that's<00:00:57.309> so<00:00:57.699> cool<00:00:58.440> did<00:00:59.440> say<00:00:59.680> anything

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
1949 that's so cool did say anything

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.940 
1949 that's so cool did say anything
more<00:01:00.100> about<00:01:00.129> the<00:01:00.340> mines<00:01:00.840> um<00:01:01.840> I<00:01:02.290> don't<00:01:02.560> I<00:01:02.710> read

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
more about the mines um I don't I read

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.450 
more about the mines um I don't I read
the<00:01:03.040> whole<00:01:03.160> thing<00:01:03.190> but<00:01:03.809> obviously<00:01:04.809> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
the whole thing but obviously the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:13.850 
the whole thing but obviously the
railway<00:01:06.460> doesn't<00:01:06.790> this<00:01:06.910> look<00:01:08.729> out<00:01:09.729> clearly

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.830 

so<00:01:14.460> we<00:01:14.730> are<00:01:14.910> still<00:01:15.450> on<00:01:15.510> the<00:01:15.780> ice<00:01:15.960> cave<00:01:16.260> trail

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
so we are still on the ice cave trail

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.400 
so we are still on the ice cave trail
about<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:19.110> don't<00:01:19.260> know<00:01:19.350> maybe<00:01:19.470> halfway<00:01:21.230> this<00:01:22.230> is

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:44.580 

this<00:03:36.510> is<00:03:36.840> where<00:03:37.620> we<00:03:37.770> live

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.729 

and<00:03:45.160> when<00:03:45.280> zoom<00:03:45.519> in<00:03:45.700> so<00:03:45.910> hopefully<00:03:46.540> the

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
and when zoom in so hopefully the

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.990 
and when zoom in so hopefully the
exposure<00:03:47.739> will<00:03:47.920> adjust<00:03:48.250> so<00:03:48.489> you<00:03:48.580> can<00:03:48.700> see<00:03:48.879> what

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
exposure will adjust so you can see what

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.860 
exposure will adjust so you can see what
we're<00:03:49.180> seeing<00:03:49.360> here<00:03:51.060> there's<00:03:52.060> snow<00:03:52.390> pack<00:03:52.629> up

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
we're seeing here there's snow pack up
