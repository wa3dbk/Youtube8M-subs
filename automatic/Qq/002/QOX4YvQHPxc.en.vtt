at<00:02:44.920> all<00:02:45.100> underneath<00:02:45.610> this<00:02:45.819> underneath<00:02:46.360> the

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
at all underneath this underneath the

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.830 
at all underneath this underneath the
protector<00:02:49.560> so<00:02:50.560> I<00:02:50.590> think<00:02:50.709> that's<00:02:50.920> going<00:02:51.130> to<00:02:51.190> dry

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
protector so I think that's going to dry

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.690 
protector so I think that's going to dry
a<00:02:52.950> little<00:02:53.950> faster<00:02:54.730> than<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.030> 12<00:02:55.390> to<00:02:55.600> 24<00:02:56.110> hours

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
a little faster than the 12 to 24 hours

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.250 
a little faster than the 12 to 24 hours
because<00:02:57.700> I'm<00:02:57.970> not<00:02:58.150> going<00:02:58.569> that<00:02:58.750> long<00:02:58.989> without

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
because I'm not going that long without

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.350 
because I'm not going that long without
using<00:02:59.650> my<00:02:59.890> brand<00:03:00.130> new<00:03:00.220> phone<00:03:00.600> sorry<00:03:03.360> alright

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
using my brand new phone sorry alright

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.360 
using my brand new phone sorry alright
so<00:03:04.750> learn<00:03:05.110> if<00:03:05.290> you<00:03:05.380> can<00:03:05.530> see<00:03:05.680> that<00:03:05.829> but<00:03:06.010> all<00:03:06.220> the

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
so learn if you can see that but all the

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.920 
so learn if you can see that but all the
holes<00:03:06.579> are<00:03:06.730> covered<00:03:07.150> you<00:03:07.299> can't<00:03:07.570> see<00:03:07.750> some

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
holes are covered you can't see some

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.080 
holes are covered you can't see some
residue<00:03:08.290> so<00:03:09.010> this<00:03:09.160> is<00:03:09.250> what<00:03:09.400> i<00:03:09.430> did<00:03:09.670> on<00:03:09.820> the

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
residue so this is what i did on the

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.759 
residue so this is what i did on the
screen<00:03:10.329> just<00:03:10.360> imagine<00:03:10.930> this<00:03:11.019> is<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.350> this<00:03:11.709> is

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
screen just imagine this is the this is

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.729 
screen just imagine this is the this is
the<00:03:11.920> screen<00:03:12.280> i<00:03:12.459> went<00:03:13.239> ahead<00:03:13.299> and<00:03:13.540> covered<00:03:14.470> one

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
the screen i went ahead and covered one

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.280 
the screen i went ahead and covered one
part<00:03:15.010> i<00:03:15.220> pushed<00:03:16.060> down<00:03:16.239> real<00:03:16.269> hard<00:03:16.540> on<00:03:16.870> one<00:03:17.079> side

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
part i pushed down real hard on one side

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.710 
part i pushed down real hard on one side
with<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.680> applicator<00:03:18.459> to<00:03:19.390> take<00:03:19.570> this

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
with the applicator to take this

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.890 
with the applicator to take this
microfiber<00:03:20.260> our<00:03:21.040> microfiber<00:03:21.489> cloth<00:03:22.120> kind<00:03:22.840> of

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
microfiber our microfiber cloth kind of

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.509 
microfiber our microfiber cloth kind of
wipe<00:03:23.079> it<00:03:23.230> down<00:03:23.380> you<00:03:23.980> want<00:03:24.010> to<00:03:24.190> hold<00:03:24.310> it<00:03:24.400> down

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
side then I just wiped clean just like

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:06.470 
side then I just wiped clean just like
that<00:03:54.970> and<00:03:55.590> wipe<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.769> other<00:03:56.890> side<00:03:57.160> off

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.430 

alright<00:04:07.480> and<00:04:08.320> that's<00:04:08.470> pretty<00:04:08.980> much<00:04:09.130> it<00:04:10.440> so

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
alright and that's pretty much it so

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.390 
alright and that's pretty much it so
i'll<00:04:11.740> just<00:04:13.050> get<00:04:14.050> anything<00:04:14.380> else<00:04:14.620> so<00:04:14.800> again<00:04:15.310> i'm

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
i'll just get anything else so again i'm

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.770 
i'll just get anything else so again i'm
not<00:04:15.460> doing<00:04:15.790> the<00:04:15.880> corners<00:04:16.209> I'm<00:04:16.329> not<00:04:16.359> doing<00:04:16.660> the

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
not doing the corners I'm not doing the

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.870 
not doing the corners I'm not doing the
round<00:04:16.989> edge<00:04:17.200> corners<00:04:17.680> I'll<00:04:18.160> probably<00:04:18.579> cut

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
round edge corners I'll probably cut

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.450 
round edge corners I'll probably cut
those<00:04:19.030> off<00:04:19.150> later<00:04:19.450> because<00:04:19.870> i<00:04:19.900> do<00:04:20.109> have<00:04:20.350> a

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.800 

another<00:04:25.140> case<00:04:26.140> actually<00:04:27.420> the<00:04:28.420> body<00:04:28.630> glove

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
another case actually the body glove

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.670 
another case actually the body glove
case<00:04:30.060> for<00:04:31.060> the<00:04:31.240> phone<00:04:31.270> so<00:04:31.840> I<00:04:32.110> don't<00:04:32.320> think<00:04:32.560> I'll

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
case for the phone so I don't think I'll

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.900 
case for the phone so I don't think I'll
need<00:04:32.710> that<00:04:32.890> i'll<00:04:33.100> just<00:04:33.310> play<00:04:33.460> cut<00:04:33.640> those<00:04:33.790> off

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
need that i'll just play cut those off

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.720 
need that i'll just play cut those off
later<00:04:34.230> but<00:04:35.230> i<00:04:35.500> don't<00:04:36.310> know<00:04:36.340> if<00:04:36.400> you<00:04:36.490> can<00:04:36.580> tell

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
later but i don't know if you can tell

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.360 
later but i don't know if you can tell
it's<00:04:36.970> a<00:04:37.060> lot<00:04:37.360> more<00:04:37.390> shinier<00:04:37.960> you<00:04:38.200> can<00:04:38.500> see<00:04:39.040> I

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
it's a lot more shinier you can see I

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.460 
it's a lot more shinier you can see I
don't<00:04:39.760> have<00:04:40.030> it<00:04:40.210> on<00:04:40.270> macro<00:04:40.690> so<00:04:40.900> you<00:04:40.960> can't<00:04:41.260> I

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
don't have it on macro so you can't I

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.780 
don't have it on macro so you can't I
don't<00:04:41.890> know<00:04:41.950> if<00:04:42.010> you<00:04:42.070> can<00:04:42.220> really<00:04:42.340> tell<00:04:42.580> but

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
don't know if you can really tell but

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.840 
don't know if you can really tell but
see<00:04:42.940> how<00:04:43.060> the<00:04:43.120> reflections<00:04:43.810> kind<00:04:43.990> of<00:04:44.050> blurry

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
see how the reflections kind of blurry

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.100 
see how the reflections kind of blurry
that's<00:04:45.850> because<00:04:46.120> the<00:04:46.690> of<00:04:46.930> the<00:04:47.080> residue

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
that's because the of the residue

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.530 
that's because the of the residue
underneath<00:04:50.110> the<00:04:50.290> skin<00:04:50.560> and<00:04:50.830> on<00:04:50.980> the<00:04:51.160> phone

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
underneath the skin and on the phone

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:59.210 
underneath the skin and on the phone
those<00:04:52.540> will<00:04:52.780> clear<00:04:52.990> up<00:04:54.690> again<00:04:55.690> so<00:04:55.990> uh<00:04:56.020> this<00:04:56.470> is

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.250 

this<00:05:00.220> is<00:05:00.370> my<00:05:00.550> first<00:05:00.820> time<00:05:01.000> doing<00:05:01.210> this<00:05:01.360> so<00:05:01.720> I

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.000 

will<00:05:05.260> hit<00:05:05.350> you<00:05:05.410> back<00:05:07.530> showing<00:05:08.530> you<00:05:08.650> that<00:05:08.800> this

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
will hit you back showing you that this
