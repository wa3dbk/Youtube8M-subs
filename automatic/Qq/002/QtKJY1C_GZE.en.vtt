00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
hey you guys what is up the new cubist

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.710 
hey you guys what is up the new cubist
here<00:00:02.399> and<00:00:02.639> today<00:00:02.939> I<00:00:02.970> have<00:00:03.179> a<00:00:03.210> video<00:00:03.540> tutorial

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
here and today I have a video tutorial

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.019 
here and today I have a video tutorial
for<00:00:04.140> you<00:00:04.200> guys<00:00:04.259> on<00:00:04.620> how<00:00:04.859> to<00:00:04.920> make<00:00:05.339> a<00:00:05.549> nuclear

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
for you guys on how to make a nuclear

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.500 
for you guys on how to make a nuclear
bunker<00:00:06.500> slash<00:00:07.500> base<00:00:07.859> so<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.849> first<00:00:09.090> step<00:00:09.330> is

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
bunker slash base so the first step is

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.450 
bunker slash base so the first step is
to<00:00:09.599> go<00:00:09.719> ahead<00:00:09.809> and<00:00:10.200> build<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.679> lip<00:00:10.889> around<00:00:11.130> to

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
to go ahead and build the lip around to

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.520 
to go ahead and build the lip around to
where<00:00:11.639> your<00:00:11.820> doors<00:00:12.059> will<00:00:12.300> be<00:00:12.480> so<00:00:12.870> go<00:00:13.170> ahead<00:00:13.320> and

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
where your doors will be so go ahead and

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.189 
where your doors will be so go ahead and
find<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:13.889> good<00:00:14.040> area<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.700> think<00:00:15.480> this<00:00:15.839> one<00:00:16.170> is

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
find a good area I think this one is

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.840 
find a good area I think this one is
pretty<00:00:16.740> good<00:00:16.859> for<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.279> job

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
pretty good for the job

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.720 
pretty good for the job
so<00:00:18.690> make<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.140> structure<00:00:19.529> sort<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.130> like<00:00:20.310> this

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.490 

and<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:24.029> can<00:00:24.269> extend<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.810> out<00:00:24.990> one<00:00:25.230> if<00:00:25.380> you'd

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
and you can extend that out one if you'd

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.410 
and you can extend that out one if you'd
like<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:26.070> go<00:00:26.340> ahead<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.789> place<00:00:27.060> your<00:00:27.090> iron

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
like and go ahead and place your iron

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.660 
like and go ahead and place your iron
doors<00:00:27.660> here<00:00:28.080> add<00:00:28.710> your<00:00:28.920> two<00:00:29.039> buttons<00:00:29.400> and

doors here add your two buttons and

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.420 
doors here add your two buttons and
let's<00:00:29.880> get<00:00:30.060> inside<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.830> next<00:00:32.009> step<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.369> to

ahead and start building a staircase
down<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:47.309> doesn't<00:00:47.610> matter<00:00:47.789> how<00:00:48.000> deep<00:00:48.239> although

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
down it doesn't matter how deep although

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.060 
down it doesn't matter how deep although

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
when you aren't a nuclear fallout you do

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.490 
when you aren't a nuclear fallout you do
not<00:00:52.500> want<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.920> be<00:00:53.090> you<00:00:54.090> know<00:00:54.239> near<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.780> surface

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
not want to be you know near the surface

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.130 
not want to be you know near the surface
so<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.160> speak<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:57.420> go<00:00:57.570> ahead<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.780> dig<00:00:57.989> out<00:00:58.109> your

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
so to speak so go ahead and dig out your

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.799 
so to speak so go ahead and dig out your
staircase<00:00:58.649> like<00:00:58.890> shown<00:00:59.250> and<00:01:00.059> I'm<00:01:00.420> gonna<00:01:00.629> go

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
staircase like shown and I'm gonna go

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.930 
staircase like shown and I'm gonna go
pretty<00:01:01.050> deep<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.559> come<00:01:01.920> right<00:01:02.070> back<00:01:02.250> okay<00:01:02.579> I

pretty deep and come right back okay I

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.369 
pretty deep and come right back okay I
think<00:01:03.180> that's<00:01:03.359> deep<00:01:03.600> enough<00:01:03.870> just<00:01:04.199> for

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
think that's deep enough just for

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.500 
think that's deep enough just for
demonstration<00:01:04.949> purposes<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:06.090> next<00:01:06.299> step

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
demonstration purposes so the next step

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.330 
demonstration purposes so the next step
is<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.750> go<00:01:06.840> ahead<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.110> replace<00:01:07.560> everything

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
that is visible all the smooth stone as

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.090

perfectly as you can see this is our

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000 
perfectly as you can see this is our
nuclear<00:05:36.390> shelter<00:05:36.900> everything<00:05:37.830> worked

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
nuclear shelter everything worked

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.690 
nuclear shelter everything worked
perfectly
