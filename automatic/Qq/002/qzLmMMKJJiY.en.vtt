wow<00:01:22.049> that's<00:01:22.310> word<00:01:23.310> sequence<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.880> used<00:01:24.060> too

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
wow that's word sequence is used too

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.640 
wow that's word sequence is used too
many<00:01:24.360> times<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.810> if<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.170> see<00:01:25.320> me<00:01:25.439> looking

many times and if you see me looking
over<00:01:25.920> here<00:01:26.220> it's<00:01:26.670> because<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.090> where<00:01:27.240> my

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
over here it's because this is where my

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.450 
over here it's because this is where my
monitor<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:28.979> where<00:01:29.130> my<00:01:29.220> camera

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
monitor is and this is where my camera

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.810 
monitor is and this is where my camera
is<00:01:31.430> so<00:01:33.170> here<00:01:34.170> we<00:01:34.320> have<00:01:34.530> each<00:01:35.070> frame<00:01:35.430> lasting

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
is so here we have each frame lasting

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.160 
is so here we have each frame lasting
one<00:01:35.970> second<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:38.299> with<00:01:39.299> some<00:01:39.509> exceptions<00:01:39.840> you

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
one second and with some exceptions you

see<00:01:40.350> I've<00:01:40.560> done<00:01:40.710> some<00:01:40.890> animation<00:01:41.430> here<00:01:41.610> I'll

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
see I've done some animation here I'll

see I've done some animation here I'll
show<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.000> more<00:01:42.180> about<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.540> but<00:01:42.720> each<00:01:42.869> frame

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
show you more about that but each frame

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.990

lasts one second and I'll show you why
this<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.270> important<00:01:45.720> later<00:01:45.960> but<00:01:46.320> we<00:01:46.409> come<00:01:46.619> in

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
up with this frame have a line but we're

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.420 
up with this frame have a line but we're
going<00:02:45.489> to<00:02:45.550> start<00:02:46.200> first<00:02:47.200> okay<00:02:47.620> here's<00:02:48.280> some

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
going to start first okay here's some

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.280 
going to start first okay here's some
important<00:02:48.850> keyboard<00:02:49.510> commands<00:02:49.840> I'm<00:02:50.050> working

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
important keyboard commands I'm working

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.530 
important keyboard commands I'm working
on<00:02:50.320> a<00:02:50.440> Mac<00:02:50.620> so<00:02:50.890> if<00:02:51.430> you're<00:02:51.670> on<00:02:51.730> a<00:02:51.760> PC<00:02:52.209> pretty

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
on a Mac so if you're on a PC pretty

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.060 
on a Mac so if you're on a PC pretty
much<00:02:52.690> you<00:02:52.780> can<00:02:52.870> just<00:02:53.019> switch<00:02:53.230> out<00:02:53.380> when<00:02:53.800> I<00:02:53.830> say

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
much you can just switch out when I say

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.120 
much you can just switch out when I say
option<00:02:54.519> use<00:02:54.730> alt<00:02:55.000> instead<00:02:55.690> I<00:02:55.900> think<00:02:56.890> that's

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
option use alt instead I think that's

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.250 
option use alt instead I think that's
the<00:02:57.250> only<00:02:57.280> difference<00:02:57.550> so<00:02:58.000> now<00:02:58.840> that<00:02:58.900> I'm<00:02:59.050> in

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
the only difference so now that I'm in

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.259 
the only difference so now that I'm in

then<00:03:48.970> go<00:03:49.329> over<00:03:49.630> a<00:03:49.870> little<00:03:50.170> bit<00:03:50.290> I<00:03:50.470> don't<00:03:50.739> care

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
then go over a little bit I don't care

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.470 
then go over a little bit I don't care
really<00:03:51.100> how<00:03:51.430> much<00:03:51.640> time<00:03:51.970> I'm<00:03:52.180> just<00:03:52.269> going<00:03:52.420> to

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
really how much time I'm just going to

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.479 
really how much time I'm just going to
leave<00:03:52.630> some<00:03:52.870> time<00:03:53.079> in<00:03:53.230> here<00:03:53.440> I'm<00:03:54.100> gonna<00:03:54.340> make<00:03:54.459> a

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
leave some time in here I'm gonna make a

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.990 
leave some time in here I'm gonna make a
key<00:03:54.820> also<00:03:55.500> so<00:03:56.500> that<00:03:56.530> I<00:03:56.709> know<00:03:56.799> that<00:03:56.950> at<00:03:57.640> least<00:03:57.820> in

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
key also so that I know that at least in

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.729 
key also so that I know that at least in
one<00:03:58.060> of<00:03:58.239> these<00:03:58.299> places<00:03:58.630> I<00:03:58.930> can<00:03:59.110> end<00:03:59.290> up<00:03:59.470> back<00:03:59.709> at

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
one of these places I can end up back at

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:05.550 
one of these places I can end up back at
the<00:04:00.010> original<00:04:00.519> size<00:04:04.019> so<00:04:05.019> let's<00:04:05.049> go<00:04:05.320> back<00:04:05.380> to

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
the original size so let's go back to

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.590 
the original size so let's go back to
frame<00:04:05.680> 1<00:04:05.739> here<00:04:06.010> now<00:04:06.190> here's<00:04:06.640> a<00:04:06.700> nifty<00:04:07.120> tool<00:04:07.390> too

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
frame 1 here now here's a nifty tool too

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.970 
frame 1 here now here's a nifty tool too
if<00:04:07.720> you're<00:04:07.840> scrubbing<00:04:08.170> on<00:04:08.410> your<00:04:08.530> time<00:04:08.709> slider

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
if you're scrubbing on your time slider

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.470 
if you're scrubbing on your time slider
and<00:04:09.100> you<00:04:09.190> want<00:04:09.340> to<00:04:09.400> snap<00:04:09.609> the<00:04:09.760> keyframes<00:04:10.180> just

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
and you want to snap the keyframes just

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.920 
and you want to snap the keyframes just
hold<00:04:10.660> down<00:04:10.690> shift<00:04:11.170> and<00:04:11.320> it'll<00:04:12.040> snap<00:04:12.340> to<00:04:12.549> keys

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
hold down shift and it'll snap to keys

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.289 
hold down shift and it'll snap to keys
if<00:04:13.930> I<00:04:14.079> had<00:04:14.200> taken<00:04:14.489> ten<00:04:15.489> minutes<00:04:15.820> to<00:04:15.970> look<00:04:16.120> up

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
if I had taken ten minutes to look up

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.690 
if I had taken ten minutes to look up
these<00:04:16.479> keyboard<00:04:17.380> shortcuts<00:04:17.799> years<00:04:18.430> ago<00:04:18.669> I

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
these keyboard shortcuts years ago I

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.270 
these keyboard shortcuts years ago I
would<00:04:18.940> have<00:04:18.970> saved<00:04:19.150> myself<00:04:19.390> hours<00:04:20.100> okay<00:04:21.100> and

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
would have saved myself hours okay and

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.110 
would have saved myself hours okay and
so<00:04:21.400> now<00:04:21.459> we're<00:04:21.640> going<00:04:21.729> to<00:04:21.789> do<00:04:21.880> is<00:04:21.940> we're<00:04:22.030> going

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
so now we're going to do is we're going

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.540 
so now we're going to do is we're going
to<00:04:22.180> scale<00:04:22.900> this<00:04:23.169> up<00:04:23.229> and<00:04:23.740> we're<00:04:24.130> going<00:04:24.250> to<00:04:24.280> move

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
to scale this up and we're going to move

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.150 
to scale this up and we're going to move
it<00:04:24.940> over<00:04:25.210> so<00:04:25.240> you<00:04:26.080> can<00:04:26.200> see<00:04:26.260> that<00:04:26.560> he's

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
it over so you can see that he's

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.010 
it over so you can see that he's
oops<00:04:28.620> so<00:04:29.620> we<00:04:29.770> can<00:04:29.950> scale<00:04:30.610> it<00:04:30.670> up<00:04:30.880> again<00:04:31.210> move<00:04:31.840> it

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
oops so we can scale it up again move it

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.130 
oops so we can scale it up again move it
over<00:04:32.260> again<00:04:32.380> so<00:04:32.710> so<00:04:33.220> we<00:04:33.340> can<00:04:33.460> see<00:04:33.640> that<00:04:34.140> he's

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
over again so so we can see that he's

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.590 
over again so so we can see that he's
going<00:04:35.410> to<00:04:35.470> be<00:04:35.560> looking<00:04:35.740> going<00:04:36.310> huh<00:04:36.760> looking<00:04:37.480> at

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
going to be looking going huh looking at

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.500 
going to be looking going huh looking at
what<00:04:38.790> I'm<00:04:39.790> not<00:04:39.940> going<00:04:40.060> to<00:04:40.150> follow<00:04:40.270> our

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
what I'm not going to follow our

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.180 
what I'm not going to follow our
guidelines<00:04:40.630> exactly<00:04:41.380> because<00:04:41.560> I'm<00:04:41.920> giving

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
guidelines exactly because I'm giving

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.140 
guidelines exactly because I'm giving
myself<00:04:42.310> some<00:04:42.610> artistic<00:04:43.390> interpretation

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
myself some artistic interpretation

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.250 
myself some artistic interpretation
we'll<00:04:46.150> see<00:04:46.300> if<00:04:46.390> I<00:04:46.480> get<00:04:46.540> yelled<00:04:46.840> at<00:04:46.990> later

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
we'll see if I get yelled at later

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.020 
we'll see if I get yelled at later
probably<00:04:48.010> not<00:04:48.360> maybe<00:04:49.360> I<00:04:49.630> don't<00:04:49.990> know<00:04:50.400> okay<00:04:51.400> and

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
probably not maybe I don't know okay and

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.170 
probably not maybe I don't know okay and
now<00:04:52.720> you<00:04:52.750> can<00:04:52.990> see<00:04:53.140> hmm<00:04:53.680> we<00:04:54.370> have<00:04:54.400> a<00:04:54.490> nice<00:04:54.730> truck

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
now you can see hmm we have a nice truck

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.800 
now you can see hmm we have a nice truck

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
Hank and you know maybe maybe I don't

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.170 
Hank and you know maybe maybe I don't
really<00:05:01.360> care<00:05:01.630> about<00:05:01.810> having<00:05:02.440> these<00:05:03.190> panels

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
really care about having these panels

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.440 
really care about having these panels
things<00:05:05.140> on<00:05:05.290> the<00:05:05.410> bottom<00:05:05.590> so<00:05:06.520> maybe<00:05:06.880> I'm<00:05:07.300> gonna

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
things on the bottom so maybe I'm gonna

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:14.370 
things on the bottom so maybe I'm gonna
leave<00:05:07.690> this<00:05:07.930> pulled<00:05:08.470> in<00:05:08.650> a<00:05:08.770> little<00:05:09.280> bit<00:05:13.320> so<00:05:14.320> you

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
leave this pulled in a little bit so you

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.900 
leave this pulled in a little bit so you
can<00:05:14.560> see<00:05:14.740> that<00:05:14.890> the<00:05:14.980> focus<00:05:15.190> is<00:05:15.520> on<00:05:15.550> the<00:05:15.790> machine

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
can see that the focus is on the machine

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:21.780 
can see that the focus is on the machine
there<00:05:19.590> yeah<00:05:20.590> yeah<00:05:21.130> something<00:05:21.340> like<00:05:21.580> that

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790 
there yeah yeah something like that

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.570 
there yeah yeah something like that
that's<00:05:22.510> looking<00:05:22.930> good<00:05:23.110> so<00:05:23.710> you<00:05:23.800> chuck<00:05:24.400> out<00:05:24.520> a

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
that's looking good so you chuck out a

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:30.870 
that's looking good so you chuck out a
little<00:05:24.820> bit<00:05:25.060> and<00:05:29.070> yeah<00:05:30.070> that's<00:05:30.520> like<00:05:30.760> hey

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
little bit and yeah that's like hey

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.210 
little bit and yeah that's like hey
machine<00:05:31.420> always<00:05:31.990> like<00:05:32.200> machine<00:05:34.650> fine<00:05:35.650> and

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
machine always like machine fine and

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.930 
machine always like machine fine and
what<00:05:37.210> we're<00:05:37.330> going<00:05:37.420> to<00:05:37.480> do<00:05:37.600> is<00:05:37.750> then<00:05:38.940> turn

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
what we're going to do is then turn

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.430 
what we're going to do is then turn
these<00:05:40.150> keyframes<00:05:40.360> select<00:05:40.900> them<00:05:41.020> right<00:05:41.260> click

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
these keyframes select them right click

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.690 
these keyframes select them right click
on<00:05:41.590> them<00:05:41.740> and<00:05:41.800> I'm<00:05:42.010> going<00:05:42.100> to<00:05:42.190> turn<00:05:42.340> them<00:05:42.490> into

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
on them and I'm going to turn them into

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.850 
on them and I'm going to turn them into
an<00:05:43.090> easy<00:05:43.450> ease<00:05:43.930> with<00:05:44.260> the<00:05:44.380> keyframe<00:05:44.710> assistant

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
an easy ease with the keyframe assistant

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.400 
an easy ease with the keyframe assistant
and<00:05:45.310> that'll<00:05:45.490> make<00:05:45.640> it<00:05:45.669> a<00:05:45.880> little<00:05:46.450> bit<00:05:46.630> easier

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
and that'll make it a little bit easier

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.990 
and that'll make it a little bit easier
in<00:05:47.800> its<00:05:47.919> motion<00:05:48.840> now<00:05:50.160> something<00:05:51.160> I<00:05:51.520> think<00:05:51.640> I

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
in its motion now something I think I

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.790 
in its motion now something I think I
might<00:05:52.180> do<00:05:52.419> also<00:05:52.600> is<00:05:52.930> move<00:05:53.140> these<00:05:53.320> keyframes

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
might do also is move these keyframes

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.560 
might do also is move these keyframes
over<00:05:54.280> a<00:05:54.310> little<00:05:54.490> bit<00:05:54.640> so<00:05:54.700> there's<00:05:54.970> a<00:05:55.210> little

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
over a little bit so there's a little

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.560 
over a little bit so there's a little
hesitation<00:05:56.020> before<00:05:56.410> this<00:05:56.770> plot<00:05:57.130> happens<00:05:57.570> yeah

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
hesitation before this plot happens yeah

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.890 
hesitation before this plot happens yeah
I<00:05:58.900> like<00:05:59.140> that<00:06:00.270> now<00:06:01.270> you<00:06:01.330> notice<00:06:01.660> that<00:06:01.690> this

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
I like that now you notice that this

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.200 
I like that now you notice that this
timing<00:06:02.290> is<00:06:02.380> really<00:06:02.650> fast<00:06:03.070> but<00:06:03.400> that's<00:06:03.610> because

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
timing is really fast but that's because

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.260 
timing is really fast but that's because
I<00:06:04.750> don't<00:06:05.710> care<00:06:06.010> that<00:06:06.280> it's<00:06:06.430> fast<00:06:06.700> because

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
I don't care that it's fast because

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.760 
I don't care that it's fast because
later<00:06:07.600> we're<00:06:07.810> going<00:06:07.900> to<00:06:07.960> retime<00:06:08.410> it<00:06:08.590> in

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
later we're going to retime it in

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.100 
later we're going to retime it in
another<00:06:09.220> composition<00:06:09.669> so<00:06:10.480> all<00:06:10.750> I<00:06:10.780> have<00:06:10.990> to

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
another composition so all I have to

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.020 
another composition so all I have to
worry<00:06:11.290> about<00:06:11.350> is<00:06:11.710> that<00:06:11.740> this<00:06:12.100> motion<00:06:12.520> happens

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
worry about is that this motion happens

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.150 
worry about is that this motion happens
correctly<00:06:13.210> not<00:06:13.810> about<00:06:14.110> the<00:06:14.290> timing<00:06:14.740> which<00:06:15.010> is

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 
correctly not about the timing which is

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.820 
correctly not about the timing which is
wonderful<00:06:15.520> I<00:06:16.030> save<00:06:16.780> my<00:06:16.930> project<00:06:17.140> so<00:06:17.440> I<00:06:17.560> don't

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
wonderful I save my project so I don't

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.960 
wonderful I save my project so I don't
lose<00:06:18.010> it<00:06:18.220> and<00:06:19.200> move<00:06:20.200> on<00:06:20.520> yeah<00:06:21.520> that<00:06:21.790> looks

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:21.970 
lose it and move on yeah that looks

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.130 
lose it and move on yeah that looks
pretty<00:06:22.120> good<00:06:22.330> so<00:06:24.300> what<00:06:25.300> I'll<00:06:25.390> do<00:06:25.570> now<00:06:25.720> is<00:06:25.900> stop

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:26.140 
pretty good so what I'll do now is stop

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.300 
pretty good so what I'll do now is stop
the<00:06:26.320> video<00:06:26.560> and<00:06:27.750> I<00:06:28.750> will<00:06:29.230> SH<00:06:29.260> I<00:06:29.620> will<00:06:29.950> later<00:06:30.160> on

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 
the video and I will SH I will later on

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.540 
the video and I will SH I will later on
make<00:06:30.700> a<00:06:30.730> new<00:06:30.910> video<00:06:31.120> about<00:06:31.390> starting<00:06:32.169> new<00:06:32.550> with

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 
make a new video about starting new with

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.730 
make a new video about starting new with
some<00:06:33.970> new<00:06:34.120> frames<00:06:34.419> dropping<00:06:34.900> them<00:06:34.990> in<00:06:35.110> and<00:06:35.289> the

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 
some new frames dropping them in and the

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.950 
some new frames dropping them in and the
whole<00:06:35.830> retiming<00:06:36.280> thing<00:06:36.610> so<00:06:36.910> you<00:06:36.970> can<00:06:37.180> see<00:06:37.419> how

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 
whole retiming thing so you can see how

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:38.570 
whole retiming thing so you can see how
that<00:06:38.169> works

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 
that works

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:43.220 
that works
okay<00:06:40.220> goodbye
