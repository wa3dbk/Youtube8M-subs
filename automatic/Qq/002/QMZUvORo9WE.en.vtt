if<00:00:10.469> you've<00:00:10.650> added<00:00:10.769> materials<00:00:11.309> you'll<00:00:11.490> be<00:00:11.639> on<00:00:11.759> a

if you've added materials you'll be on a

if you've added materials you'll be on a
regular<00:00:12.030> basis<00:00:12.750> you'll<00:00:12.960> probably<00:00:13.259> find<00:00:13.650> you

regular basis you'll probably find you

regular basis you'll probably find you
have<00:00:14.009> ready-made<00:00:14.400> compost<00:00:15.120> within<00:00:15.929> six<00:00:16.199> to

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
have ready-made compost within six to

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.240 
have ready-made compost within six to
twelve<00:00:16.650> months<00:00:18.410> although<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.740> material<00:00:19.890> at

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
the top of the heap may not look like it

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.019 
the top of the heap may not look like it
has<00:00:22.050> been<00:00:22.230> broken<00:00:22.380> down<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.890> compost<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.939> will

has been broken down to compost you will

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.490 
has been broken down to compost you will
probably<00:00:24.240> find<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.900> material<00:00:25.320> at<00:00:25.380> the

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
probably find that the material at the

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.659 
probably find that the material at the
bottom<00:00:25.650> looks<00:00:26.160> very<00:00:26.430> different<00:00:30.410> if<00:00:31.520> you<00:00:32.520> have

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
bottom looks very different if you have

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.910 
bottom looks very different if you have
a<00:00:32.700> hatch<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.300> your<00:00:33.690> bin<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.230> can<00:00:34.260> check<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.770> see

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
a hatch on your bin you can check to see

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.620 
a hatch on your bin you can check to see
what<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.219> looks<00:00:35.399> like<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:36.300> will<00:00:36.450> look<00:00:36.600> like

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
what it looks like it will look like

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.889 
what it looks like it will look like
rich<00:00:37.110> dark<00:00:37.590> soil<00:00:38.180> scoop<00:00:39.180> some<00:00:39.360> out<00:00:39.540> if<00:00:39.780> you

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
rich dark soil scoop some out if you

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.360 
rich dark soil scoop some out if you
just<00:00:40.110> want<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.379> small<00:00:40.680> quantity<00:00:42.890> if<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.160> want

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
just want to small quantity if you want

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.520 
just want to small quantity if you want
more<00:00:44.610> then<00:00:45.239> it's<00:00:45.420> probably<00:00:45.629> easier<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.260> lift

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
more then it's probably easier to lift

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.010 
more then it's probably easier to lift
the<00:00:46.680> bin<00:00:46.890> away<00:00:47.250> from<00:00:47.520> its<00:00:47.640> content<00:00:50.930> when<00:00:51.930> you

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
the bin away from its content when you

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.750 
the bin away from its content when you
remove<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.530> bin<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.920> will<00:00:53.010> see<00:00:53.190> layers<00:00:53.399> of

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
remove the bin you will see layers of

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.959 
remove the bin you will see layers of
different<00:00:54.090> levels<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.510> decomposition<00:00:55.969> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
different levels of decomposition the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.279 
different levels of decomposition the
finished<00:00:57.270> compost<00:00:57.449> will<00:00:57.840> be<00:00:57.960> at<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.170> bottom

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
finished compost will be at the bottom

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.319 
finished compost will be at the bottom
and<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.160> top<00:00:59.190> layer<00:00:59.579> will<00:00:59.879> be<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.090> fresh

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
and the top layer will be the fresh

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.240 
and the top layer will be the fresh
stuff<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:00.989> just<00:01:01.199> recently<00:01:01.440> put<00:01:01.890> in

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.620 

remove<00:01:05.250> all<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.549> unfinished<00:01:05.760> material<00:01:06.479> and

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
remove all the unfinished material and

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.330 
remove all the unfinished material and
put<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.960> one<00:01:07.080> side<00:01:07.140> or<00:01:07.740> into<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.040> wheelbarrow

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
put it to one side or into a wheelbarrow

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.580 
put it to one side or into a wheelbarrow
and<00:01:09.000> then<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.720> can<00:01:09.900> remove<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.409> ready

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
and then you can remove the ready

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:21.370 
and then you can remove the ready
compost<00:01:11.130> at<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.430> bottom<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.939> bin

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.170 

put<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.470> bin<00:01:22.650> back<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:23.040> place<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.580> then<00:01:23.970> put

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
put the bin back in place and then put

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.000 
put the bin back in place and then put
the<00:01:24.299> unfinished<00:01:24.600> material<00:01:25.320> back<00:01:25.590> into<00:01:25.619> the

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
the unfinished material back into the

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.700 
the unfinished material back into the
bin<00:01:26.270> now<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.479> good<00:01:27.690> time<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:28.140> check<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.619> you

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
bin now is a good time to check that you

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.289 
bin now is a good time to check that you
have<00:01:28.830> got<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.070> right<00:01:29.280> sort<00:01:29.580> of<00:01:29.700> mixture<00:01:30.030> of

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
have got the right sort of mixture of

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.810 
have got the right sort of mixture of
materials<00:01:30.990> if<00:01:31.259> it's<00:01:31.979> too<00:01:32.220> wet

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
materials if it's too wet

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.149 
materials if it's too wet
then<00:01:33.030> add<00:01:33.210> some<00:01:33.240> dry<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.020> if<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:34.619> too<00:01:34.830> dry

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
then add some dry and if it's too dry

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:53.220 
then add some dry and if it's too dry
then<00:01:35.580> add<00:01:35.640> some<00:01:35.970> more<00:01:36.210> moister<00:01:36.720> or<00:01:37.020> some<00:01:37.409> water

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.290 

so<00:01:54.230> what<00:01:54.740> does<00:01:54.920> compost<00:01:55.370> look<00:01:55.550> like<00:01:55.790> when<00:01:56.120> it's

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
so what does compost look like when it's

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.810 
so what does compost look like when it's
ready

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
ready

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.520 
ready
most<00:01:58.820> TV<00:01:59.180> programs<00:01:59.750> and<00:01:59.930> pictures<00:02:00.350> in<00:02:00.500> books

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
most TV programs and pictures in books

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.040 
most TV programs and pictures in books
show<00:02:01.130> compost<00:02:01.640> as<00:02:01.850> a<00:02:01.880> lovely<00:02:02.270> fine<00:02:02.480> material

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
show compost as a lovely fine material

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.580 
show compost as a lovely fine material
that<00:02:03.200> flows<00:02:03.410> nicely<00:02:03.920> through<00:02:04.100> your<00:02:04.280> fingers

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
that flows nicely through your fingers

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.620 
that flows nicely through your fingers
but<00:02:06.590> in<00:02:06.740> fact<00:02:06.950> homemade<00:02:07.730> compost<00:02:07.970> doesn't

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
but in fact homemade compost doesn't

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.300 
but in fact homemade compost doesn't
usually<00:02:08.780> look<00:02:09.110> like<00:02:09.320> this<00:02:09.590> when<00:02:09.830> it<00:02:09.920> comes<00:02:10.130> out

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
usually look like this when it comes out

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.980 
usually look like this when it comes out
of<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.640> bin<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.970> compost<00:02:14.420> doesn't<00:02:14.750> have<00:02:14.870> to

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
of the bin the compost doesn't have to

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.680 
of the bin the compost doesn't have to
be<00:02:15.110> fine<00:02:15.350> and<00:02:15.590> soft<00:02:15.890> to<00:02:16.160> be<00:02:16.280> valuable<00:02:16.640> it<00:02:17.240> is

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
be fine and soft to be valuable it is

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.720 
be fine and soft to be valuable it is
basically<00:02:18.080> ready<00:02:18.380> to<00:02:18.470> use<00:02:18.830> as<00:02:19.160> long<00:02:19.400> as<00:02:19.580> it's

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
basically ready to use as long as it's

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.760 
basically ready to use as long as it's
dark<00:02:19.970> in<00:02:20.210> color<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:20.780> you<00:02:20.930> can't<00:02:21.230> recognize

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
dark in color and you can't recognize

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.290 
dark in color and you can't recognize
the<00:02:22.040> original<00:02:22.430> ingredients<00:02:24.910> you<00:02:25.910> might<00:02:26.090> find

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
the original ingredients you might find

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.390 
the original ingredients you might find
the<00:02:26.510> odd<00:02:26.600> bit<00:02:26.810> of<00:02:26.840> eggshell<00:02:27.320> corncob<00:02:27.950> or<00:02:28.130> twig

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
the odd bit of eggshell corncob or twig

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.150 
the odd bit of eggshell corncob or twig
but<00:02:28.850> that's<00:02:29.060> okay<00:02:29.480> it<00:02:30.320> might<00:02:30.560> be<00:02:30.710> a<00:02:30.740> bit<00:02:30.920> sticky

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
but that's okay it might be a bit sticky

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.100 
but that's okay it might be a bit sticky
or<00:02:31.400> lumpy<00:02:31.820> but<00:02:32.150> it<00:02:32.180> will<00:02:32.330> still<00:02:32.630> be<00:02:32.660> good<00:02:32.930> to

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
or lumpy but it will still be good to
