00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:28.039
 In the preliminaries entering the final corner of the Hungaro Link, wide for the home straight 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.270
 To take a different approach 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:34.280
 Chan star that use the drs and Cars of this course the longest straight of at 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:39.900
 You can also aim for overfake 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:43.710
 Check the left brake marker and brake with a 100m board to third gear 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:48.480
 Serif of the accelerated early speed because the course is open 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:51.660
 Note from the downhill to the second corner as it is easily locked here 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.980
 Drop to 3rd speed and turn around the corner while keeping it to the left 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:59.699
 Keep to full throttle here to throw to the next right corner 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:03.059
 Go uphill and head to the 4th corner, which is a plane 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.730
 Beware of the curbing out of this corner in 4th speed 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.950
 5th corner 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:11.409
 Slow down to the corner and take a curb at the corner exit. Next is tricky from the right. 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.190
 To the left chicane sixth corner # 7 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:20.290
 It is easy to lose balance so as not to get over the curb at low speed 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:22.860
 Eighth corner is a large 10 schools name of accelerated left curve in the ninth corner that could spin small 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:27.000
 Keep speed 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:31.140
 Turn the 11th corner with minimum deceleration so as not to kill the speed 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.100
 It's a downhill from here where the intense g, which is a stepping ground, is light 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:40.180
 Don't get too curb on standing up to your prosthetic foot with a 100m board 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:45.520
 You have to prepare for the 13th corner of 180 degrees Caen by putting it to the right 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:50.740
 From the exit, accelerate using the pit lane entrance and enter the final corner 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:54.119
 If you get on the exit line where Hayashi 3 is still stuck , accelerate with full throttle 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.119
 That's the Hangaro Link
