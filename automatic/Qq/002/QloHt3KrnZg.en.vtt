to die i guess the strength to say but

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.970 
to die i guess the strength to say but
still<00:00:41.850> i<00:00:42.030> did<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.829> we're<00:00:43.829> obviously

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
still i did it and we're obviously

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.319 
still i did it and we're obviously
rushing<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.350> minimum<00:00:46.350> peak<00:00:46.940> you<00:00:47.940> should<00:00:48.239> have

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
rushing in minimum peak you should have

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.680 
rushing in minimum peak you should have
realized<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.170> but<00:00:50.000> it<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.149> done<00:00:51.329> olympic

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
realized that but it is done olympic

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.869 
realized that but it is done olympic
anyway<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.230> he<00:00:52.260> didn't<00:00:52.739> buy<00:00:52.949> them<00:00:53.250> some

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
anyway and he didn't buy them some

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.160 
anyway and he didn't buy them some
reason<00:00:56.149> there<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.180> someone<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.570> said<00:00:57.870> here's<00:00:58.079> a

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
reason there is someone I said here's a

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:06.950 
reason there is someone I said here's a
new<00:00:58.289> girlfriend<00:00:59.270> yeah<00:01:00.270> putting<00:01:00.660> mice

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.640 

lucky<00:01:08.190> reviving<00:01:09.190> I<00:01:09.960> have<00:01:10.960> this<00:01:11.170> coral<00:01:11.470> is

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
lucky reviving I have this coral is

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.880 
lucky reviving I have this coral is
pretty<00:01:11.860> good<00:01:12.010> it's<00:01:12.370> like<00:01:13.500> it's<00:01:14.500> very<00:01:14.650> accurate

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
pretty good it's like it's very accurate

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.550 
pretty good it's like it's very accurate
and<00:01:15.310> it<00:01:15.400> doesn't<00:01:15.670> shoot<00:01:15.880> that<00:01:16.300> fast<00:01:16.630> so<00:01:17.470> it's

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
and it doesn't shoot that fast so it's

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.320 
and it doesn't shoot that fast so it's
easier<00:01:17.830> to<00:01:17.920> control<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.430> bulletins<00:01:18.880> or<00:01:19.000> date

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
easier to control the bulletins or date

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.750 
easier to control the bulletins or date
what<00:01:21.480> what<00:01:22.480> did<00:01:22.600> it<00:01:22.750> okay<00:01:23.320> if<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:24.100> song<00:01:24.340> some

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
what what did it okay if the song some

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.150 
what what did it okay if the song some
reason<00:01:25.060> I<00:01:25.240> should<00:01:25.870> have<00:01:25.990> been<00:01:26.110> seen<00:01:26.320> we<00:01:26.710> did<00:01:27.070> it

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
reason I should have been seen we did it

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.600 
reason I should have been seen we did it
die<00:01:28.120> Alec<00:01:28.390> up<00:01:28.480> to<00:01:28.600> die<00:01:29.160> picking<00:01:30.160> a<00:01:30.250> free<00:01:30.430> cup<00:01:30.580> of

die Alec up to die picking a free cup of
times<00:01:30.940> but<00:01:31.180> it<00:01:31.510> wasn't<00:01:31.840> enough<00:01:31.990> and<00:01:32.320> also<00:01:33.250> runs

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
times but it wasn't enough and also runs

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.350 
times but it wasn't enough and also runs
away<00:01:33.930> let's<00:01:34.930> make<00:01:35.200> that<00:01:35.380> a<00:01:35.620> bond<00:01:36.370> just

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
away let's make that a bond just

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.570 
away let's make that a bond just
received<00:01:38.220> reminding<00:01:39.220> me<00:01:39.310> there<00:01:39.520> I<00:01:41.490> got<00:01:42.490> this

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
received reminding me there I got this

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.020 
received reminding me there I got this
pretty<00:01:42.760> bad<00:01:42.970> aim<00:01:43.150> but<00:01:43.390> still<00:01:43.600> a<00:01:43.690> go<00:01:43.750> team<00:01:45.030> and

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
pretty bad aim but still a go team and

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.080 
pretty bad aim but still a go team and
I'm<00:01:46.120> lucky<00:01:46.270> I<00:01:46.420> guess<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:48.670> is<00:01:48.820> shouldn't

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
I'm lucky I guess this is shouldn't

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.300 
I'm lucky I guess this is shouldn't
really<00:01:49.240> be<00:01:49.360> able<00:01:49.450> to<00:01:49.600> get<00:01:49.780> him

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.179 

anyway<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:55.170> method<00:01:55.500> can<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.710> crazy<00:01:55.950> in

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
anyway the this method can I crazy in

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.590 
anyway the this method can I crazy in
the<00:01:56.310> beginning<00:01:56.640> if<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.909> get<00:01:57.149> down<00:01:57.299> here<00:01:57.360> today

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
the beginning if you get down here today

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.410 
the beginning if you get down here today
it's<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:59.329> craziness<00:02:00.329> all<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:01.020> time<00:02:02.210> but<00:02:03.210> if

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
it's just craziness all the time but if

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.090 
it's just craziness all the time but if
your<00:02:03.570> are<00:02:03.810> down<00:02:04.049> here<00:02:04.320> then<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.799> probably

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
your are down here then you probably

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.130 
your are down here then you probably
pretty<00:02:05.399> much<00:02:05.549> have<00:02:05.759> gotten<00:02:06.210> because<00:02:06.450> it's

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
pretty much have gotten because it's

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.839 
pretty much have gotten because it's
very<00:02:07.320> difficult<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.799> defend<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.220> because

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
very difficult to defend it because

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.969 
very difficult to defend it because
people<00:02:09.270> come<00:02:09.420> from<00:02:09.539> everywhere<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.830> get
