alrighty<00:00:01.829> I've<00:00:02.340> moved<00:00:02.730> up<00:00:02.939> i'm<00:00:03.090> at<00:00:03.210> a<00:00:03.240> 24<00:00:03.840> volt

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
alrighty I've moved up i'm at a 24 volt

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.070 
alrighty I've moved up i'm at a 24 volt

10 amp power supply now also from light
objects<00:00:07.560> I<00:00:07.770> got<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.630> phased<00:00:09.630> off<00:00:09.840> my<00:00:10.019> 5<00:00:10.260> amp<00:00:10.530> one

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
objects I got a phased off my 5 amp one

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.440 
objects I got a phased off my 5 amp one
I<00:00:10.889> was<00:00:11.010> using<00:00:11.040> this<00:00:11.400> one<00:00:11.639> on<00:00:11.730> another<00:00:11.969> CNC

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
I was using this one on another CNC

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.470 
I was using this one on another CNC
machine<00:00:12.719> i<00:00:12.809> have<00:00:12.929> upstairs<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:14.179> there<00:00:15.179> is<00:00:15.450> the

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
machine i have upstairs and there is the

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.470 
machine i have upstairs and there is the
DSP<00:00:16.199> board<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:17.369> does<00:00:17.609> have<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.820> flashing<00:00:18.300> like

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
DSP board it does have a flashing like

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.630 
DSP board it does have a flashing like
the<00:00:18.660> instructions<00:00:19.170> say<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:19.470> that's<00:00:19.980> good<00:00:20.189> I

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
the instructions say so that's good I

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.670 
the instructions say so that's good I
found<00:00:21.359> out<00:00:21.539> what<00:00:21.720> happened<00:00:22.080> with<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.289> USB

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
found out what happened with the USB

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.040 
found out what happened with the USB
what<00:00:23.609> had<00:00:23.760> happened<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.449> my<00:00:24.600> grounding

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
what had happened is that my grounding

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.560 
what had happened is that my grounding
wire<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.590> running<00:00:26.430> separate<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.119> my<00:00:27.300> plug

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
wire is running separate to my plug

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.349 
wire is running separate to my plug
outlet<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.560> got<00:00:28.740> pinched<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.460> cut<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:30.060> as

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
outlet and it got pinched and cut so as

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.299 
outlet and it got pinched and cut so as
long<00:00:30.660> as<00:00:30.840> there's<00:00:31.050> if<00:00:31.439> there's<00:00:31.470> not<00:00:31.800> ground<00:00:32.130> to

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
long as there's if there's not ground to

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.830 
long as there's if there's not ground to
cause<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.700> breaker<00:00:32.910> trip<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.540> that's<00:00:33.600> what

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
cause the breaker trip and that's what

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.010 
cause the breaker trip and that's what
it<00:00:33.930> was<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.640> cuts<00:00:36.149> all<00:00:36.360> fixed<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:36.840> that's

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
it was so that cuts all fixed and that's

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.020 
it was so that cuts all fixed and that's
good<00:00:37.260> it's<00:00:38.160> always<00:00:38.370> been<00:00:38.489> blinking<00:00:38.850> the

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
good it's always been blinking the

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.069 
good it's always been blinking the
flashing<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:40.440> displayed<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.890> just<00:00:41.129> fine<00:00:41.399> and

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
flashing the displayed is just fine and

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.160 
flashing the displayed is just fine and
i<00:00:43.079> have<00:00:43.230> my<00:00:43.350> stepper<00:00:43.620> motor<00:00:43.920> here<00:00:45.140> except<00:00:46.140> for

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
i have my stepper motor here except for

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.869 
i have my stepper motor here except for
one<00:00:46.440> amp<00:00:46.620> i've<00:00:46.800> tried<00:00:47.010> for<00:00:47.219> four<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.579> all<00:00:47.670> that

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
one amp i've tried for four and all that

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.670 
one amp i've tried for four and all that
stuff<00:00:48.030> if<00:00:48.329> i<00:00:48.450> if<00:00:48.840> i<00:00:48.930> pull<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.289> all<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.410> way<00:00:49.500> up

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
stuff if i if i pull it all the way up

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.200 
stuff if i if i pull it all the way up
to<00:00:49.710> four<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.250> i've<00:00:50.340> got<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> bunch<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.940> stepper

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
to four and i've got a bunch of stepper

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.189 
to four and i've got a bunch of stepper
so<00:00:51.420> i<00:00:51.480> can<00:00:51.629> afford<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.140> risk<00:00:52.559> burning<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:53.160> is

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
so i can afford to a risk burning it is

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.689 
so i can afford to a risk burning it is
it<00:00:55.199> does<00:00:55.410> start<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.680> get<00:00:55.890> warm<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.460> i<00:00:56.489> do<00:00:56.579> feel

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
it does start to get warm so i do feel

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.500 
it does start to get warm so i do feel
like<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.949> parked<00:00:58.949> on<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.100> standby<00:00:59.640> mode<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.449> i

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
like it is parked on a standby mode so i

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.630 
like it is parked on a standby mode so i
do<00:01:00.600> feel<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.230> driver<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.800> actually

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
do feel that the driver is actually

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.390 
do feel that the driver is actually
functioning<00:01:03.239> as<00:01:03.510> by<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.470> light<00:01:04.890> on<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> side

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
functioning as by the light on the side

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.880 
functioning as by the light on the side
so<00:01:05.729> that's<00:01:05.909> pretty<00:01:06.150> good<00:01:06.330> i<00:01:06.680> bumped<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.770> back

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
so that's pretty good i bumped it back

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.890 
so that's pretty good i bumped it back
down<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.250> one<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.270> just<00:01:09.540> know<00:01:09.750> that

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
down to one so that I just know that

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.010 
down to one so that I just know that
it's<00:01:10.080> working<00:01:10.909> the<00:01:11.909> problem<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.659> seem<00:01:12.900> to

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
it's working the problem that I seem to

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.760 
it's working the problem that I seem to
be<00:01:13.080> having<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.460> I'm<00:01:15.090> running<00:01:15.330> me<00:01:16.320> I'm

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
be having is that I'm running me I'm

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.380 
be having is that I'm running me I'm
following<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.280> drawing<00:01:17.549> here<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.119> I've<00:01:18.210> got

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
following the drawing here and I've got

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.800 
following the drawing here and I've got
six<00:01:18.780> five<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.200> two<00:01:19.860> as<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.970> wires<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.570> need<00:01:21.720> to

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
six five and two as the wires I need to

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.789 
six five and two as the wires I need to
run<00:01:22.049> over<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.439> my<00:01:23.600> micro<00:01:24.600> stepper<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.650> only

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
run over to my micro stepper the only

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.710 
run over to my micro stepper the only
problem<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.220> it's<00:01:26.400> got<00:01:26.520> five<00:01:26.820> volts<00:01:27.150> step<00:01:27.450> and

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
problem is it's got five volts step and

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.330 
problem is it's got five volts step and
direction<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:29.090> I'm<00:01:30.259> my<00:01:31.259> translation<00:01:32.100> was

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
direction and I'm my translation was

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.370 
direction and I'm my translation was
that<00:01:33.290> in<00:01:34.290> six<00:01:34.710> which<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.009> 5<00:01:35.460> volts<00:01:36.079> comes<00:01:37.079> over

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
that in six which is 5 volts comes over

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.960 
that in six which is 5 volts comes over
here<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.710> goes<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.310> enable<00:01:39.210> positive<00:01:40.400> 10<00:01:41.400> 5

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
here and goes to enable positive 10 5

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.580 
here and goes to enable positive 10 5
which<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:43.200> step<00:01:44.119> comes<00:01:45.119> over<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.840> goes<00:01:46.350> to

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
which is the step comes over and goes to

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.950 
which is the step comes over and goes to
the<00:01:46.710> poults<00:01:49.070> positive<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.310> then<00:01:51.090> direction

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
the poults positive and then direction

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.660 
the poults positive and then direction
which<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:52.860> number<00:01:53.310> two<00:01:54.200> over<00:01:55.200> here<00:01:55.560> comes<00:01:56.340> back

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
which is number two over here comes back

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.230 
which is number two over here comes back
and<00:01:56.969> goes<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.200> direction<00:01:58.380> positive<00:01:59.240> my

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
and goes to the direction positive my

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.350 
and goes to the direction positive my
question<00:02:00.719> is

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
question is

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.810 
question is
should<00:02:02.230> I<00:02:02.260> be<00:02:02.590> taking<00:02:02.620> and<00:02:03.280> looping<00:02:03.670> my

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
should I be taking and looping my

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.870 
should I be taking and looping my
negatives<00:02:04.360> together<00:02:04.630> and<00:02:05.430> tying<00:02:06.430> that<00:02:06.670> to

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.220 
negatives together and tying that to
ground<00:02:07.180> or<00:02:08.100> doing<00:02:09.100> something<00:02:09.340> else<00:02:09.520> with<00:02:09.700> it<00:02:09.850> I

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.230 
ground or doing something else with it I

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.210 
ground or doing something else with it I
was<00:02:11.230> looking<00:02:11.470> through<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.650> manual<00:02:11.680> and<00:02:12.160> it

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
was looking through the manual and it

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.470 
was looking through the manual and it
says<00:02:12.370> all<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:12.700> rest<00:02:12.910> of<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.090> pins<00:02:13.330> are

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
says all the rest of the pins are

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.640 
says all the rest of the pins are
reserved<00:02:13.900> even<00:02:14.290> though<00:02:14.380> they<00:02:14.500> do<00:02:14.560> have

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
reserved even though they do have

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.370 
reserved even though they do have
positive<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:15.460> negatives<00:02:15.910> I<00:02:16.140> was<00:02:17.140> wondering

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
positive and negatives I was wondering

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.550 
positive and negatives I was wondering
what<00:02:17.470> your<00:02:17.590> thoughts<00:02:17.650> are<00:02:18.040> on<00:02:18.100> that<00:02:19.350> I've<00:02:20.350> got

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
what your thoughts are on that I've got

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.020 
what your thoughts are on that I've got
my<00:02:20.680> stepper<00:02:20.950> motor<00:02:21.220> in<00:02:21.430> there<00:02:21.580> I've<00:02:21.760> got<00:02:21.910> my

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
my stepper motor in there I've got my

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.990 
my stepper motor in there I've got my
power<00:02:22.270> in<00:02:22.510> there<00:02:22.720> it's<00:02:22.900> showing<00:02:23.320> green<00:02:23.620> so<00:02:24.550> in

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
power in there it's showing green so in

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.350 
power in there it's showing green so in
theory<00:02:25.330> it<00:02:25.510> all<00:02:25.690> should<00:02:25.960> work<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:27.330> you<00:02:28.330> know

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
theory it all should work and you know

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.750 
theory it all should work and you know
I've<00:02:28.630> always<00:02:29.050> check<00:02:29.830> polarity<00:02:30.400> any<00:02:31.330> thoughts
