00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.950
 good to all such is here we are a 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.510
 new video and good I wanted to tell you about 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.389
 a topic that I wanted a long time ago 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.769
 make a comment about this I never 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.839
 I had dared since you know that I do not 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.020
 I'm very much commenting on these 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:20.660
 like saying that you need a peak to make 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.689
 nine hundred lav you know I'm not 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.039
 a lot of talk if my thing is to play more 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.980
 what more to talk about and start here 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.019
 say things that people could 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.519
 happen to them mostly one if I'm 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.860
 lately watching comments from people 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.570
 that starts commenting gameplays and what 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.360
 The only thing it does is repeat itself over and over 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.460
 time so I like it better and try 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.810
 comment on them that you post live as 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.120
 say or just comment 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.580
 with making comments about the 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.190
 game about the game that I play so 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.810
 nothing to do this this 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.070
 comment a long time ago what happens 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.510
 that I had never dared to do it already 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.590
 how good I said I did not know how 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.470
 it would be so good I'm going to make a 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.030
 I try to see how the video looks and 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.680
 if I see how good it is understood 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.489
 quite and that you get the idea 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.950
 then I'll upload it so good what I 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.800
 I wanted to talk a lot of people ask me 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.530
 well I see many comments on youtube 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.320
 there are a lot of people that take time 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.450
 making youtube and not pineapples visits not 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.860
 they have subscribers others wonder 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.570
 if it's worth starting after seeing 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.210
 all the people so discouraged that you have to 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.830
 continue uploading videos to youtube and 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.090
 videos do not ask for visits then 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.220
 many people wonder if it should 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.320
 start on this turn if it's already too much 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.580
 late as I say are the kings of 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.820
 youtube or many people who are saying 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.930
 that you are already the kings of youtube 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.610
 It's never too late or it's never too late 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.710
 start on youtube I started doing 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.570
 comments in Spanish will do little more than 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.060
 one year now one year and two weeks if 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.220
 does it think that on September 29 or a 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.870
 week before a year two or three weeks 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.670
 now that I comment in Spanish 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.020
 and when I started making comments 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.610
 in Spanish the Spanish community already 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.500
 I was more than created you do not know that I 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.130
 I was more dedicated to the English community 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.300
 It was what I liked but the food 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.490
 Spanish was already more than done 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.750
 so I mean with this it's never 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.070
 too late when I was more than 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.330
 made to mean the big ones that 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.510
 they had back then they continue 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.619
 being less than now because they had 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.780
 many subscribers and then half 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.790
 I had a thousand subscribers and they were 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.270
 all English and said leads to see where 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.580
 I stop with this gift, I say 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.980
 but right now I have many more 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.780
 videos that the great ones that were in 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.660
 that time then that I love you 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.239
 say with this with effort dedication and 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.640
 especially having fun with this doing 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.709
 what you like you will get what 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.959
 what do you want but always in the 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.849
 minimum requirements on all the by 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.360
 example have a capturing hd she is 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:44.299
 something good that you should know that 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.560
 that is how to say essential in 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.989
 this time not since there are so many channels 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.670
 with such good quality that by 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.799
 you have to take out the same 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.690
 quality or at least in hd be 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:57.049
 original or have very good gameplays 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.090
 you also have to have then have a 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.620
 little piquito does not have many people I 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.780
 It's not my case 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.170
 Another thing that I wanted to comment on is that 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.269
 especially especially if you do this 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.040
 It has to be because you like it, do not think 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.630
 never in money everyone is 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.099
 obsessed on youtube for the money and 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.329
 this is what the taught ones are doing 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.420
 for the money they do not reach us 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.890
 site honestly I started on youtube 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.750
 as many of you already know explain in the 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.050
 special one year that I made some time ago 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.520
 I started on YouTube in 2008 my first 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.440
 Youtube account created in 2008 of 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.900
 upload videos with my captor that I 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.120
 I spent 30 turkeys in the middle markt and happy 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.070
 I was happiest in the world 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.600
 I have channels with about 100 videos 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.760
 uploaded then they hacked me one and what 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.700
 they deleted that I had 120 I have another channel 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.800
 with 90 videos I have my montage channel 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.300
 that the and has 15 assemblies uploaded that 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.670
 the assemblies know that it costs much more 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.680
 to make a comment so what 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.450
 I tell you guys especially if you do 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.920
 this I never thought without money I the last 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.020
 what I thought is that I could charge for 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.700
 this me when I saw people who had the 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.140
 bread was rival the channel not what 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.780
 are the letters that you can explain the 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.760
 knicks I even looked on youtube 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.620
 how could you put that on or not since you do not 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.540
 I knew how to put it on my channel and it said 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.620
 it had to be 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.170
 spalding spam in this being a partner 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.820
 that if I got in and saw that you could 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.860
 I even sent the application full to be 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.390
 partner on youtube and they rejected me and I 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.730
 I shit in the milk that we can not 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.340
 me about the partner 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.480
 and it made me realize that he found out about 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.950
 the maximum and all the roll that you 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.330
 They could afford and why not if you do not 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.860
 something that you like a lot of people and 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.080
 can profit from it forward 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.630
 who would not do it but hey you 're worth 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.980
 I hope the comment has helped you 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.450
 this is ending I did not want to do it 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.090
 very long either because as you know 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.460

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.810
