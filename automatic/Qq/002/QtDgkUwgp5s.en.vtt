 [applause] 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:24.020
 [music] 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:26.780
 I've been thinking here how much you don't eat 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.619
 then you still have to sit at 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.049
 table and get enough sleep once and for all not 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:37.640
 only time is spent on sleeping 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:42.590
 and the food and still did not like the soup 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:51.619
 yes that's not it just so much time 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:57.490
 for nothing it means nothing you didnâ€™t think so 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.490
 morrow will be porridge and and the way it is 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:18.400
 lucky can save time 

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:21.079
 cooking but I have nothing to save you 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:28.490
 again failed to wake up earlier 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:33.100
 Conventional spent more time clock 8 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:46.340
 [music] 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:49.069
 apples chop fall saga eggs I after all 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.090
 I thought that my life consists only of 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:57.370
 creativity of food and sleep 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:03:00.980
 what and happiness that it is only a fallacy 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:05.750
 I completely forgot about hygiene 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.400
 about hygiene forget here this same 10 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.270
 minutes to brush your teeth 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.840
 hedgehog 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:18.500
 none of five minutes in the morning and 5 pm and still 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:26.570
 it would be nice but here I thought a 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:29.000
 If you do not need to take, I calculated 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.610
 what if I stop brushing my teeth 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.420
 then in less than five months a drop 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:38.330
 a whole day of extra time 5 months not 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:46.120
 Brushing your teeth and why do you need so much 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:46.120
 time i will dedicate him to society 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:03.350

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:07.690
 be useful and that almost 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:12.400
 I don't want to brush your teeth, but 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:14.380
 really know whether there is no time to waste 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.410

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.410

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.709

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:55.370
 I have teeth and no game free 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.370
 of time 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.980
 whole 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.720

00:05:54.479 --> 00:06:07.650
 full day free time and two hours 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.650

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:20.520

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:20.520
