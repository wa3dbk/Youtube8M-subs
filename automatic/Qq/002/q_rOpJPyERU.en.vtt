00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.149
 you see 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:15.559
 the red and good we are going to present you the 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.349
 today how to make one is a day and a 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.490
 Thursday and delicious breakfast true for 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:21.890
 morning to bathe 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.259
 first let's pour water here 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:35.590
 we have the route that we are going to disinfect 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:35.590
 the filtered water 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.020
 because to oxygenate good let's use 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.780
 things like more 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.000
 less toxic to the body for 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.240
 kids, we go for two liters of water 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.980
 We can use two layers of hydrogen peroxide 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:03.250
 let's leave 15 minutes 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:08.190
 the oranges are cleaned the apple and the 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.190
 kilo while 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:20.580
 moody it seems to me that this is not 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.450
 like half a cup of yogurt this is 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.450
 red with its birds 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.170
 What is it 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:33.040
 are covers are a very rich fruit that 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.740
 they have many antioxidants and a lot 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:43.320
 energy ok 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:43.320
 and here also this what is 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.180
 and after that a little bit 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.260
 smells 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.299
 good 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:31.630
 ok perfect good then let's see 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.630
 I believe that already infected 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.500
 well now let's start the oranges 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
 one 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.860
 but obviously when you win 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.100
 Y 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.200
 we can hurt you 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.520
 good while I'm losing those 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.520
 oranges I can not say how many 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.770
 a 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.460
 well 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.460
 drink 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:27.430
 we are seeing the oranges 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.140
 the ideal of these reserves is to involve 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.690
 to children 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.970
 in the process it's fun is a bit 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.670
 blurred but the important thing is that they 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.180
 go see that the products that 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.909
 we use are natural 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:49.489
 alive and well generally if you 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:49.489
 they ask a child or an apple 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.790
 we can believe and students at the end of 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.590
 the trees but the children of now do not 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.050
 they are answers to nature and 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.200
 example that we try to find 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:09.450
 the way that they as family and 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:13.080
 see the natural processes and 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.620
 flavors let's finish describing 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.620
 the oranges 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.079
 and as you know they have several 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.860
 little things 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:28.879
 it does not have great science 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.889
 the monk of antioxidants then the 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:31.909
 Ginger also has many 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.699
 properties 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:36.650
 we took a different one and the most 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.479
 important is that 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.660
 they begin to expose the flavors 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.660
 different 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:48.230
 know the diversity of food 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.230
 stop 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.660
 you help me 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:01.240
 if you are going to try it 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.240
 all 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.629
 do not 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:07.629
 123 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.350
 they will have ready to test it 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.740
 however delicious 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.610
 that has no sugar 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:06:00.600
 it's good that we're done with the 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.910
 route is enough I think it's good 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:06.200
 invite people to what to eat 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.200
 living things and sant hables 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.770
 Amen 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:17.689
 Well, we are the mother of 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.689
 red and put no less
