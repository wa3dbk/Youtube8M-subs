00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.830
 so hey people actually i wanted one 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.589
 unboxing to my new camcorder 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:18.859
 because I bought myself today 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:24.830
 it is the canon legria hf 46 and belonged to 16 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:27.500
 violence disk Unfortunately , the day went by 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.869
 is not as good him know from exercises 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:35.149
 already unpacked and there we have now 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:41.620
 Now give a brief overview of what is true 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:41.620
 so there it comes with stereo video cable 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:48.820
 usb so that you can also use the hard disk 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.820
 can read 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:01:03.070
 a hdmi cable installation time 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.070
 transfer utility video browser war 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:11.710
 Guides this is the English and that is 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.640
 The German variant is what times 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.570
 French German Italian and 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.850
 Russian 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.490
 I have my french part 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:25.759
 I have to tear away the German part 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:27.740
 quickly but he thinks it was a 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.200
 Special offer on the one hand I have me 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:34.000
 starts to pay because you recognize 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.530
 12 is all died or that 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.170
 Objectively did such a serious damage 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.829
 that the repair came more expensive 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.220
 would 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:46.990
 the camera back then is my exchange 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.340
 Offers proposed in the value of 305 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:54.740
 that means I finally have it 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:57.920
 Franken paid for the camera then gave 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.880
 there is also a lot in common memory card 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.880
 I already have them 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:14.709
 and a canon protective bag for me 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.599
 very practicable then she stops 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.110
 hopefully a bit longer one 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.690
 canon g12 that's my eyes 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.799
 died too fast 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:30.330
 well what so beautiful that is of course 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:33.599
 important for me is a remote control 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.599
 wonderful too 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:58.650
 super natural charging cable and a 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.370
 good small acute castle well 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:06.180
 keep foundation has wares test of the camera 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:09.329
 a 2 3, where this is a well they 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.819
 was multiple test winner of the next 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:15.269
 Season that is barely two years old 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.040
 but my tests got better of it 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:21.359
 like the 56th 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:25.170
 For example, in the following he 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:27.659
 has to play games like wifi and 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.000
 Other rubbish you finally 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:33.500
 not really the damp does not need 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.730
 only the built-in memory but me 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.150
 Do not pay 600 francs if one 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.129
 camera 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:43.670
 if i trust customers to associate 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:50.959
 can then of course the connections 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:54.230
 HDMI usb and a component in the car 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:58.440
 I could only connect headphones 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:01.069
 then to function us normal 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.069
 up here 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:10.730
 a rotatable display which of course a lot 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:16.480
 important for reviews i want to too 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.480
 See how I hold the fair backpack 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.510
 the camera is currently running now 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.380
 probably always up to date 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:31.120
 the car moto car to car focus the 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.980
 Camera actually started everything by itself 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.770
 I will always be the idiotic mode 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.440
 I do not like that when shooting 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.830
 I still have to test filming it's mine 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:48.650
 very first video camera in my life 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:53.510
 I'm 31 you have to try something out 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:55.490
 good for me, which is also important for me 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.440
 I was masts has finally crashes 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.160
 output 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.810
 the deciding factor was that I was for 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.970
 a better camera decided 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:06.530
 like the cheap models for you 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:09.170
 same price known would be the 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.850
 because I can then stereo accessory 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:15.170
 connect the microphone 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.490
 I'm going to get a real microphone 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.580
 then I can fight that one 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.260
 crane make it ideal for measuring the 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.750
 example, then again brings the 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.810
 gamescom go there a bit 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:30.800
 filming booths may show 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:36.080
 bit of agent has to look at him and one 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:38.270
 video light can also find all 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.130
 All of them are not great 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.610
 a little attitude here 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.300
 a bit naughty little shots 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.140
 this scanner 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:51.260
 I am absolutely convinced that it is one 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:53.150
 Great camera is the money 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:56.660
 even the original cost 600 francs 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:58.550
 without problems he would have been worth it 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.910
 Of course glad that you save a lot of money 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.910
 could 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:09.680
 and as promised I have a camera 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.580
 there will be more reviews in the future 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.080
 I have to come to them a bit 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:16.910
 come in. I'm a bit 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:20.080
 rusted a bit more break but new 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:22.520
 Camera will be giving exceptions 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:25.070
 Measure I give, I hope can be responsible 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:29.510
 then the iwa of course what hints 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:32.390
 videos that was now all just impressive 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:35.360
 not to my new camcorder 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:38.300
 unboxing the verwurstet anyway hope 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.580
 me that it was short and informative 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:43.000
 Thanks for watching and until the 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.000
 next time 

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:49.279
 O
