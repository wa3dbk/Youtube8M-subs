it's about the way that I look at a
construction<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.340> way<00:01:52.430> that<00:01:52.580> I'd<00:01:52.700> raid<00:01:52.940> the

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
construction the way that I'd raid the

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.820 
construction the way that I'd raid the
way<00:01:53.240> that<00:01:53.420> I<00:01:53.509> choose<00:01:53.659> colors<00:01:54.049> the<00:01:54.530> way<00:01:54.649> that<00:01:54.799> I

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
way that I choose colors the way that I

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.649 
way that I choose colors the way that I
play<00:01:55.100> with<00:01:55.250> texture<00:01:55.729> it's<00:01:55.970> like<00:01:56.090> you<00:01:56.210> you're

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
play with texture it's like you you're

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.990 
play with texture it's like you you're
wearing<00:01:57.170> like<00:01:57.259> a<00:01:57.350> walking<00:01:57.770> art<00:01:58.009> piece<00:01:58.250> it's

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
wearing like a walking art piece it's

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.080 
wearing like a walking art piece it's
approachable<00:01:59.450> yet<00:02:00.110> super<00:02:00.890> artistic<00:02:01.759> at<00:02:02.000> the

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
approachable yet super artistic at the

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.389 
approachable yet super artistic at the
same<00:02:02.299> time<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:03.140> jersey<00:02:03.500> was<00:02:03.619> double<00:02:03.890> face<00:02:04.100> and

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
same time the jersey was double face and

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.820 
same time the jersey was double face and
bonded<00:02:04.909> and<00:02:05.090> sort<00:02:05.750> of<00:02:05.840> structured<00:02:06.500> and<00:02:06.710> and

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
bonded and sort of structured and and

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.830 
bonded and sort of structured and and
all<00:02:07.220> of<00:02:07.369> the<00:02:07.460> fabrics<00:02:07.909> were<00:02:08.060> really<00:02:08.479> heavy<00:02:08.810> and

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
all of the fabrics were really heavy and

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.530 
all of the fabrics were really heavy and
I<00:02:09.110> wanted<00:02:09.590> fabrics<00:02:09.950> that<00:02:10.009> had<00:02:10.250> body<00:02:10.580> because<00:02:11.300> I

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
I wanted fabrics that had body because I

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.559 
I wanted fabrics that had body because I
felt<00:02:12.019> we<00:02:12.140> sort<00:02:12.410> of<00:02:12.470> need<00:02:12.650> some<00:02:12.920> protection<00:02:13.569> for

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
felt we sort of need some protection for

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.059 
felt we sort of need some protection for
ourselves<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:15.319> I<00:02:15.410> think<00:02:15.440> that<00:02:15.830> you<00:02:15.980> know

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
ourselves and I think that you know

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.460 
ourselves and I think that you know
fabrics<00:02:17.030> that<00:02:17.120> are<00:02:17.239> dense<00:02:17.600> like<00:02:17.900> that<00:02:18.110> that

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
fabrics that are dense like that that

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.289 
fabrics that are dense like that that
are<00:02:18.500> other<00:02:18.860> beefy<00:02:19.459> like<00:02:19.670> that<00:02:19.819> can<00:02:20.060> sort<00:02:20.239> of

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
are other beefy like that can sort of

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:24.220 
are other beefy like that can sort of
give<00:02:20.480> us<00:02:20.600> at<00:02:20.750> in<00:02:20.900> this<00:02:21.019> time<00:02:21.290> of<00:02:21.319> crisis<00:02:21.980> to
