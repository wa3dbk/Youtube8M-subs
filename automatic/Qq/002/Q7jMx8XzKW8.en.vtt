about the asteroid rotation period we

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.130 
about the asteroid rotation period we
should<00:04:52.190> be<00:04:52.580> able<00:04:52.640> to<00:04:52.850> tell<00:04:53.000> much<00:04:53.270> better<00:04:53.540> with

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
should be able to tell much better with

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.360 
should be able to tell much better with
these<00:04:54.260> new<00:04:54.380> observations<00:04:54.980> that<00:04:55.100> we're<00:04:55.250> going

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
these new observations that we're going

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.980 
these new observations that we're going
to<00:04:55.520> do

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.050 

I<00:05:01.080> really<00:05:01.950> really<00:05:02.280> really<00:05:02.310> hope<00:05:02.730> people<00:05:03.000> don't

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
I really really really hope people don't

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.640 
I really really really hope people don't
start<00:05:03.300> losing<00:05:03.690> their<00:05:03.810> minds<00:05:04.110> over<00:05:04.320> this<00:05:04.440> thing

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
start losing their minds over this thing

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.460 
start losing their minds over this thing
and<00:05:04.860> have<00:05:05.490> another<00:05:05.640> Ellen<00:05:06.360> in<00:05:06.480> kind<00:05:06.780> of<00:05:06.900> Fiasco

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
and have another Ellen in kind of Fiasco

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.950 
and have another Ellen in kind of Fiasco
I<00:05:07.650> guess<00:05:07.920> we'll<00:05:08.100> just<00:05:08.130> have<00:05:08.280> to<00:05:08.460> wait<00:05:08.550> and<00:05:08.610> see

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
I guess we'll just have to wait and see

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.150 
I guess we'll just have to wait and see
so<00:05:09.960> now<00:05:10.110> that<00:05:10.230> we<00:05:10.290> have<00:05:10.320> that<00:05:10.500> out<00:05:10.770> of<00:05:10.980> the<00:05:11.130> way

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
so now that we have that out of the way

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.890 
so now that we have that out of the way
I<00:05:11.250> want<00:05:11.580> to<00:05:11.670> use<00:05:11.850> this<00:05:12.090> flyby<00:05:12.600> as<00:05:12.780> an

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
I want to use this flyby as an

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.570 
I want to use this flyby as an
opportunity<00:05:13.500> to<00:05:13.560> point<00:05:13.920> out<00:05:14.160> that<00:05:14.190> NASA

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
opportunity to point out that NASA

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.940 
opportunity to point out that NASA
operates<00:05:15.240> what<00:05:15.420> I<00:05:15.450> consider<00:05:16.050> one<00:05:16.620> of<00:05:16.710> its<00:05:16.830> most

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
operates what I consider one of its most

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.700

exists<00:05:59.580> I<00:05:59.670> think<00:05:59.880> they<00:05:59.970> do<00:06:00.030> important<00:06:00.630> work

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
exists I think they do important work

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.750 
exists I think they do important work
and<00:06:01.080> they<00:06:01.230> do<00:06:01.350> important<00:06:01.800> observations<00:06:02.400> and<00:06:02.670> I

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 
and they do important observations and I

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.340 
and they do important observations and I
think<00:06:03.000> as<00:06:03.090> an<00:06:03.210> early<00:06:03.510> warning<00:06:03.540> system<00:06:04.020> it's

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.990 
think as an early warning system it's
absolutely<00:06:05.040> vital<00:06:05.190> to<00:06:05.430> know<00:06:05.640> if<00:06:05.820> there's

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
absolutely vital to know if there's
