00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:07.279
 the first row of the sole to get started i 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.279
 doing the first loop 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:24.890
 the resulting loop, I dial 12 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:27.840
 air loops 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.539
 12 you can score more 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.679
 air loops if you need a horse. 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.770
 bigger size 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.610
 this size is determined by the distance from 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.320
 the bases of the fingers to the middle of the heel 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.230
 baby's feet 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.940
 etc. ie if you in this size 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.960
 more respectively air loops 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.690
 recruit more 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:53.670
 further case 3 lifting loops 1 2 3 and 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.890
 I knit further from 4 loops off the hook 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.469
 1 2 3 to the fourth 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:03.120
 three double crochets in one loop 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.210
 I take the fourth nap in the loop 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.560
 hook thread 3 loops 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.470
 grabbing a working thread and tying two 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.850
 loop on the hook left two loops 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.280
 grabbing a working thread I knit two 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.330
 the peaks are one double crochet and here 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.369
 yet another double crochet and another 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.920
 double crochet that is in this loop 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.610
 I just got three columns with 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.950
 nakida and 3 lifting loops 3 loops 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.439
 lifting is considered one pillar with 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.170
 nakidom that is obtained as if from 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.659
 I have all this knot already in this loop 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.030
 next I will knit from each loop by 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.579
 double crochet to the last 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.829
 loop in my case it will be 10 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.659
 double crochets if you type 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.640
 more air loops 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.399
 corresponding columns you will have 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.810
 more so from each loop one by one 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:57.350
 double crochet post 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.350
 Here I have 2 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.590
 345 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.560
 6 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:30.660
 7 8 9 10 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.120
 you may have this amount more 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.290
 if, again, pay attention air 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.500
 there were more loops 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:59.000
 and in the last loop I will tie into one 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:59.000
 7 double crotch loop 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.890
 7 and so we see that the knitting unfolded and 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.560
 continuing to knit on the second side 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.300
 chained to the last loop here 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.820
 it turns out to 1 with which I started 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.040
 make 3 lifting loops for this case 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.530
 me again with 10 columns in sc 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.330
 you will also be the amount that you 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.020
 knitted here that is we knit all 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:33.080
 mirror image so 1 column with 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:33.080
 double crochet second crochet 3 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.890
 four 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:56.420
 5 6 7 8 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:13.190
 9 10 farther on the last loop I will tie 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.190
 three double crochet and so 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:28.790
 123 and do the connecting column with 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:32.540
 the beginning of the row in the third lifting loop 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.540
 this is the first row
