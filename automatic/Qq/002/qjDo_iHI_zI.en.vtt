00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.670
 volume as some say there ' 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.440
 no risk so I'm going to make you 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.559
 so now so simply 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:57.930
 you will take skateboarding you go 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.789
 laurent day here as here and there 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.059
 you see for example that traits 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.470
 which wheels they are really room 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.070
 so there simply your answer 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.159
 she is wet 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.159
 you 're going to wash the wheels just wanted 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.930
 as well 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.620
 here and then we point out that 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.920
 roads will be cold we give a small 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.920
 stroke 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:55.810
 like this and that's it then let's 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.510
 to dry 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.570
 so we see that a difference that a little 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.340
 of colors from there high 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.770
 after for trucks it's the same 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.340
 go take the grill like that and you 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:25.750
 go scrub up until you're better 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:28.930
 that a weft rubbed well like that 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:33.959
 your ex it will do as if you will have 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.959
 new trusts are shiny well go hop 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:46.450
 so there maybe difference yeah we 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:49.510
 can see that treats the blacks and there 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:53.650
 it's already a little less because I 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.330
 will not have any thieves and for the 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:00.000
 board simply you go 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:08.370
 take this side here and you go in 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:12.760
 do it basically caress the cons y 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:17.140
 will have no risk and it's very simple 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:20.890
 he just has to do that and after 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:25.930
 you have cleaned your sponge and the 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:30.810
