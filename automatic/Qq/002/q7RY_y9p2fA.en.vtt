00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.260 
again with one of the insecticidal soaps
or<00:02:03.630> oils<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.439> can<00:02:04.469> control<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.219> but<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:06.000> time

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
or oils you can control it but this time

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.270 
or oils you can control it but this time
of<00:02:06.299> year<00:02:06.689> again<00:02:06.869> it's<00:02:07.380> really<00:02:07.649> not<00:02:07.770> important

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
of year again it's really not important

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.969 
of year again it's really not important
to<00:02:08.810> control<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.959> because<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.440> tree<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.770> going

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
to control it because the tree is going

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.430 
to control it because the tree is going
to<00:02:11.099> lose<00:02:11.610> its<00:02:11.849> leaves<00:02:12.090> anyway

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
to lose its leaves anyway

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.350 
to lose its leaves anyway
this<00:02:13.680> is<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.920> typical<00:02:14.430> top<00:02:14.940> of<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.210> leaf

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
this is the typical top of the leaf

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.080 
this is the typical top of the leaf
symptom<00:02:16.040> similar<00:02:17.040> symptoms<00:02:17.490> are<00:02:17.640> on<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.880> back

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
symptom similar symptoms are on the back

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.210 
symptom similar symptoms are on the back
although<00:02:18.450> sometimes<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:19.230> actually<00:02:19.620> see<00:02:19.860> the

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
although sometimes you actually see the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.840 
although sometimes you actually see the
insect<00:02:20.640> itself<00:02:21.120> in<00:02:21.300> this<00:02:21.390> case<00:02:21.660> we<00:02:22.050> do<00:02:22.290> not<00:02:22.850> but

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
insect itself in this case we do not but

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.970 
insect itself in this case we do not but
again<00:02:24.120> this<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.110> one<00:02:25.290> insect<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:25.740> want<00:02:25.920> to

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
again this is one insect you want to

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.610 
again this is one insect you want to
look<00:02:26.130> for<00:02:26.540> more<00:02:27.540> important<00:02:28.050> during<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.380> fall

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
look for more important during the fall

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.140 
look for more important during the fall
than<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:28.950> is<00:02:29.070> now<00:02:29.280> during<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.940> flowering

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
than it is now during the flowering

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.880 
than it is now during the flowering
period<00:02:31.250> finally<00:02:32.250> as<00:02:32.870> this<00:02:33.870> tree<00:02:34.170> begins<00:02:34.620> to

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
period finally as this tree begins to

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.920 
period finally as this tree begins to
bloom<00:02:35.130> there's<00:02:35.940> an<00:02:36.060> insect<00:02:36.480> called<00:02:36.570> a

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
bloom there's an insect called a

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.070 
bloom there's an insect called a

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
mirrored and these are small insects

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.230 
mirrored and these are small insects
usually<00:02:40.620> greenish<00:02:41.040> yellow<00:02:41.460> sometimes
