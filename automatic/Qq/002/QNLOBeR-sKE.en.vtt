00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
way back to one half of a watt want to

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.750 
way back to one half of a watt want to
play<00:00:57.409> a<00:00:57.440> little<00:00:57.559> bit<00:00:57.800> and<00:00:57.920> I'll<00:00:57.980> turn<00:00:58.550> the

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
play a little bit and I'll turn the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:14.650 
play a little bit and I'll turn the
power<00:00:59.149> scaling<00:00:59.449> downs<00:00:59.629> your<00:00:59.780> plan<00:01:13.360> keeps<00:01:14.360> the

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
power scaling downs your plan keeps the

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.450 
power scaling downs your plan keeps the
tonal<00:01:15.140> characteristics<00:01:15.590> in<00:01:16.039> the<00:01:16.130> way<00:01:16.250> that

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
tonal characteristics in the way that

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.620 
tonal characteristics in the way that
you<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:16.700> guitar<00:01:17.000> behaves<00:01:17.330> with<00:01:17.539> the

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
you the guitar behaves with the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.529 
you the guitar behaves with the
amplifier<00:01:17.840> the<00:01:18.200> same<00:01:18.409> is<00:01:18.679> just<00:01:19.429> now<00:01:19.759> you<00:01:19.820> are

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
amplifier the same is just now you are

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:22.600 
amplifier the same is just now you are
only<00:01:20.840> dealing<00:01:21.259> with<00:01:21.440> half<00:01:21.740> a<00:01:21.860> watt<00:01:22.039> instead<00:01:22.520> of

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
only dealing with half a watt instead of

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.790 
only dealing with half a watt instead of
40<00:01:22.940> watts<00:01:23.149> so<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.869> power<00:01:24.080> scaling<00:01:24.470> is<00:01:24.560> great

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
40 watts so the power scaling is great

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.249 
40 watts so the power scaling is great
because<00:01:25.100> it's<00:01:25.340> a<00:01:25.429> useful<00:01:25.610> tool<00:01:25.909> to<00:01:26.090> drop<00:01:26.929> the

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
because it's a useful tool to drop the

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:28.870 
because it's a useful tool to drop the
output<00:01:27.950> level<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:28.340> amplifier<00:01:28.759> without

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
output level the amplifier without

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:42.830 
output level the amplifier without
sacrificing<00:01:29.659> your<00:01:29.720> guitar<00:01:29.990> tone

now if both switches in the up position
that's<00:02:04.800> the<00:02:05.040> brilliant<00:02:05.490> mode

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.440 

you<00:02:16.080> notice<00:02:16.379> more<00:02:16.590> high-end<00:02:17.099> and<00:02:17.489> less<00:02:18.060> bass

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
you notice more high-end and less bass

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.420 
you notice more high-end and less bass
response<00:02:18.720> now<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.590> cool<00:02:19.830> thing<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.069> I<00:02:20.250> can

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
response now the cool thing is I can

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.390 
response now the cool thing is I can
have<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.940> brilliant<00:02:21.150> mode<00:02:21.799> brightness<00:02:22.799> but

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
have the brilliant mode brightness but

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:39.210 
have the brilliant mode brightness but
the<00:02:23.519> normal<00:02:23.849> mode<00:02:24.090> bass

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
switchable in the preamp section it'll

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.220 
switchable in the preamp section it'll
switch<00:02:45.620> on<00:02:45.800> the<00:02:45.920> back<00:02:46.100> and<00:02:46.610> EF<00:02:46.820> 86<00:02:47.330> is<00:02:47.510> a<00:02:47.540> five

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
switch on the back and EF 86 is a five

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.900 
switch on the back and EF 86 is a five
element<00:02:48.650> tube<00:02:48.860> so<00:02:49.160> you'll<00:02:49.340> get<00:02:49.490> more<00:02:49.820> of
