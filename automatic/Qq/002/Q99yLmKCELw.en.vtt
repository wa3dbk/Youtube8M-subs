00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:07.509
 hello youtube friends in this 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.390
 video just try to how to make a 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.330
 fake tattoo 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:15.050
 The materials that we will need are 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.050
 the following 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.550
 acetone 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.180
 a sheet of paper can be any 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:30.170
 except color 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:33.420
 cotton balls soaked in alcohol 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:38.239
 and some toilet paper 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:43.309
 ah I forgot a pen too 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.309
 It can be a breastplate. No pencil does not work 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.000
 Well, the first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.270
 drawing our sheet can be what 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.580
 you want 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.030
 that's the important thing and it does not improve 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.030
 microphone 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.260

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:06.270
 and this is my good drawing just that what 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.640

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.020
 Well, he already highlights it many times with the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.210
 same test 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.439
 and they're going to cut it, I'm going to cut it 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.359
 with fingers because not against 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:18.260
 scissors but between the materials are 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:20.960
 scissors 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.979
 well after that 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.260
 good to take a little toilet paper and 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:31.610
 they will put acetone if they do not find 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:33.430
 strong acetone use the right one did 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.520
 the flat bands 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.920
 I have it well wet and where they want 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.990
 his tattoos for example skins of 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.240
 side where they put the ink where 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:48.460
 remarked they will put it on top of the 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:52.460
 skin like that and with the little handkerchief they're going to 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:56.050
 put over it with all the acetone 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.750
 well then put them as I said 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.550

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.860

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.810

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.810

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.400

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:22.490

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:36.510

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:40.349
 your little paper like that still wet in acetone and 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.050
 let the good little heart dry 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:46.230
