quickly<00:00:19.650> i'd<00:00:20.369> recommend<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.210> have<00:00:21.300> four

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
quickly i'd recommend that you have four

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.939 
quickly i'd recommend that you have four
people<00:00:21.810> when<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.230> could<00:00:22.380> probably<00:00:22.619> do<00:00:22.920> it

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
people when you could probably do it

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.150 
people when you could probably do it
with<00:00:23.130> three<00:00:23.449> you'd<00:00:24.449> have<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.779> cut<00:00:25.769> back<00:00:25.800> on

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
with three you'd have to cut back on

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.130 
with three you'd have to cut back on
time<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.670> recommend<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:27.840> have<00:00:27.930> the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
time I recommend that you have the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.620 
time I recommend that you have the
ability<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.590> pick<00:00:28.890> up<00:00:29.039> bags<00:00:29.369> quicker<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.240> also

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
ability to pick up bags quicker and also

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.060 
ability to pick up bags quicker and also
further<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.170> further<00:00:31.349> although<00:00:31.920> that's

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
further and further although that's

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.400 
further and further although that's
probably<00:00:32.840> negotiable<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.930> last<00:00:34.170> ones<00:00:36.410> okay

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
probably negotiable the last ones okay

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.930 
probably negotiable the last ones okay
so<00:00:37.469> basically<00:00:37.950> just<00:00:38.309> clear<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.640> enemies

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
so basically just clear the enemies

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.549 
so basically just clear the enemies
around<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.239> bus<00:00:39.390> really<00:00:39.690> don't<00:00:39.930> need<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.320> but

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
around the bus really don't need to but

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.819 
around the bus really don't need to but
it<00:00:40.649> does<00:00:40.829> help<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.610> suppose<00:00:42.079> and<00:00:43.079> what<00:00:43.350> we<00:00:43.559> did

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
it does help I suppose and what we did

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.350 
it does help I suppose and what we did
here<00:00:44.070> just<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.579> make<00:00:44.789> sure<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.059> there's<00:00:45.239> no

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
here just to make sure that there's no

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.470 
here just to make sure that there's no
confusion<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:46.230> we<00:00:46.440> opened<00:00:46.860> our<00:00:47.329> opened<00:00:48.329> air

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
confusion is we opened our opened air

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.200 
confusion is we opened our opened air
crates<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.140> just<00:00:49.649> made<00:00:49.860> sure<00:00:49.940> that<00:00:50.940> we<00:00:51.059> had

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
crates and just made sure that we had

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.270 
crates and just made sure that we had
two<00:00:51.480> designated<00:00:51.780> crates<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.829> we<00:00:52.949> were<00:00:53.039> going

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
two designated crates that we were going

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.369 
two designated crates that we were going
to<00:00:53.489> get<00:00:53.610> ourselves<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.390> we<00:00:54.660> started<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.140> count

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
to get ourselves so we started a count

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.459 
to get ourselves so we started a count
there<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.739> picked<00:00:55.949> them<00:00:56.070> up<00:00:56.870> you<00:00:57.870> quickly<00:00:58.289> you

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
there and picked them up you quickly you

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.709 
there and picked them up you quickly you
just<00:00:58.620> throw<00:00:58.920> one<00:00:59.160> off<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.609> then<00:00:59.850> you<00:01:00.239> pick<00:01:00.480> one

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
just throw one off and then you pick one

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.020 
just throw one off and then you pick one
up<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.219> walk<00:01:02.219> off<00:01:02.489> with<00:01:02.699> it

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
up and walk off with it

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.649 
up and walk off with it
as<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.660> see<00:01:03.840> there<00:01:04.049> we<00:01:04.229> did<00:01:04.830> fail<00:01:05.420> with<00:01:06.420> one

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
as you see there we did fail with one

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.710 
as you see there we did fail with one
bag<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.260> lost<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.740> but<00:01:08.159> we<00:01:08.220> easily<00:01:09.180> managed<00:01:09.570> to

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
bag and lost it but we easily managed to

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.170 
bag and lost it but we easily managed to
get<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.990> obviously<00:01:10.350> with<00:01:10.560> poor<00:01:10.799> people

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
get it obviously with poor people

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.340 
get it obviously with poor people
there's<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.330> fairly<00:01:12.540> good<00:01:12.659> chance<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:13.229> you'll

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
there's a fairly good chance that you'll

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.300 
there's a fairly good chance that you'll
get<00:01:13.500> eight<00:01:13.710> bags<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:15.590> one<00:01:16.590> tip<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.979> can<00:01:17.040> give<00:01:17.130> you

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
get eight bags so one tip I can give you

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.149 
get eight bags so one tip I can give you
and<00:01:17.640> one<00:01:17.790> tip<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.030> probably<00:01:18.689> gets<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.530> market

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
and one tip that probably gets a market

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.340 
and one tip that probably gets a market
overlooked<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.330> should<00:01:21.570> be<00:01:21.750> pretty

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
lose it and the bus doesn't explode

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.480 
lose it and the bus doesn't explode
right<00:01:33.060> away<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.570> starts<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:34.170> fire<00:01:34.439> but<00:01:35.310> you'll

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
right away it starts on fire but you'll

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.190 
right away it starts on fire but you'll
be<00:01:35.610> able<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.880> still<00:01:36.150> walk<00:01:36.390> off<00:01:36.630> with<00:01:36.869> your<00:01:37.020> bag

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
guys I was playing with through the

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.900 
guys I was playing with through the
money<00:02:22.310> bag

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
money bag

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.180 
money bag
at<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.240> helicopter<00:02:23.510> and<00:02:23.900> mist<00:02:24.140> and<00:02:24.590> they<00:02:24.980> fell

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
at the helicopter and mist and they fell

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.580 
at the helicopter and mist and they fell
in<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.430> river<00:02:25.850> if<00:02:25.910> that<00:02:26.090> happens<00:02:26.480> well<00:02:27.140> he

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
in the river if that happens well he

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.020 
in the river if that happens well he
pretty<00:02:27.770> much<00:02:27.980> finished<00:02:28.400> unless<00:02:28.790> you<00:02:28.940> had

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
pretty much finished unless you had

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.810 
pretty much finished unless you had
eight<00:02:29.300> of<00:02:29.510> course<00:02:29.780> you'll<00:02:30.110> be<00:02:30.140> fine

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
eight of course you'll be fine

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.730 
eight of course you'll be fine
but<00:02:31.820> pretty<00:02:32.420> much<00:02:32.480> I<00:02:32.810> guess<00:02:33.080> just<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.500> save

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740

yourself some heartache just designate

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.430 
yourself some heartache just designate
