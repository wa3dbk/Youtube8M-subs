really cute and it didn't hurt like how
I<00:03:01.280> thought<00:03:01.670> it<00:03:01.820> was<00:03:01.970> gonna<00:03:02.180> be<00:03:02.270> it<00:03:02.720> wasn't<00:03:03.110> at

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
I thought it was gonna be it wasn't at

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.990 
I thought it was gonna be it wasn't at
paint<00:03:03.470> actually<00:03:03.950> it<00:03:04.100> wasn't<00:03:04.310> painful<00:03:04.640> at<00:03:04.850> all

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
paint actually it wasn't painful at all

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.630 
paint actually it wasn't painful at all
the<00:03:05.180> only<00:03:05.390> thing<00:03:06.080> that<00:03:06.290> was<00:03:06.410> painful<00:03:06.650> was<00:03:07.100> the

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
the only thing that was painful was the

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.630 
the only thing that was painful was the
clamp<00:03:08.090> rubbing<00:03:08.630> up<00:03:08.750> against<00:03:09.050> my<00:03:09.140> gum<00:03:09.440> um<00:03:10.370> just

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
clamp rubbing up against my gum um just

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.830 
clamp rubbing up against my gum um just
because<00:03:10.760> your<00:03:11.000> gums<00:03:11.180> are<00:03:11.360> really<00:03:11.630> sensitive

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
because your gums are really sensitive

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.979 
because your gums are really sensitive
and<00:03:12.320> that<00:03:12.770> was<00:03:12.920> just<00:03:13.130> like<00:03:13.400> a<00:03:13.900> feeling<00:03:14.900> I

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
and that was just like a feeling I

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.710 
and that was just like a feeling I
didn't<00:03:15.320> really<00:03:15.709> like<00:03:16.370> I<00:03:16.610> held<00:03:16.910> my<00:03:17.030> lip<00:03:17.269> up<00:03:17.480> and

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
she pierced it and then she took out the

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.590 
she pierced it and then she took out the
needle<00:03:22.000> so<00:03:23.000> that<00:03:23.030> they<00:03:23.239> could<00:03:23.390> put<00:03:23.510> the

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
needle so that they could put the

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
that I wasn't used to I felt like it

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.520 
that I wasn't used to I felt like it
might<00:04:38.180> hurt<00:04:38.389> or<00:04:38.720> the<00:04:38.870> balls<00:04:39.080> might<00:04:39.320> come<00:04:39.500> off

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
might hurt or the balls might come off

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
might hurt or the balls might come off
and<00:04:40.100> one<00:04:40.370> of<00:04:40.460> the<00:04:40.520> balls<00:04:40.760> did<00:04:41.150> come<00:04:41.449> off<00:04:41.660> and<00:04:42.550> so

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550

I tried to put it back on and I got it

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.100 
I tried to put it back on and I got it
back<00:04:46.280> on<00:04:46.460> very<00:04:46.669> easy<00:04:47.000> actually<00:04:47.690> a<00:04:47.840> couple

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
back on very easy actually a couple

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.040 
back on very easy actually a couple
weeks<00:04:48.470> later<00:04:48.979> the<00:04:49.610> same<00:04:49.820> ball<00:04:50.240> came<00:04:50.600> off<00:04:50.630> and<00:04:51.020> I

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
weeks later the same ball came off and I

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.570 
weeks later the same ball came off and I
had<00:04:51.169> such<00:04:51.440> a<00:04:51.470> hard<00:04:51.710> time<00:04:51.860> putting<00:04:52.040> it<00:04:52.250> on<00:04:52.370> my

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
had such a hard time putting it on my

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.120 
had such a hard time putting it on my
nails<00:04:52.850> were<00:04:53.090> long<00:04:53.300> I<00:04:53.330> had<00:04:53.630> to<00:04:53.780> clip<00:04:54.050> them<00:04:54.260> just

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
nails were long I had to clip them just

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.340 
nails were long I had to clip them just
to<00:04:55.280> do<00:04:55.490> it<00:04:55.520> I<00:04:55.940> finally<00:04:56.510> got<00:04:56.720> it<00:04:56.840> back<00:04:56.960> on<00:04:57.110> but

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
to do it I finally got it back on but

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.870 
to do it I finally got it back on but
that's<00:04:57.500> one<00:04:57.800> of<00:04:57.830> the<00:04:58.010> reasons<00:04:58.400> I<00:04:58.550> want<00:04:58.729> to<00:04:58.820> get

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
that's one of the reasons I want to get

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.110 
that's one of the reasons I want to get
a<00:04:58.940> captive<00:04:59.479> for<00:05:00.229> it<00:05:00.380> because<00:05:00.950> the<00:05:01.490> ball<00:05:01.760> stays

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
a captive for it because the ball stays

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.379 
a captive for it because the ball stays
on<00:05:02.300> so<00:05:02.900> easily<00:05:03.410> compared<00:05:04.190> to<00:05:04.250> any<00:05:04.970> other<00:05:05.180> kind

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
on so easily compared to any other kind

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:07.000 
on so easily compared to any other kind
of<00:05:05.510> piercing<00:05:05.960> I<00:05:06.110> think<00:05:06.410> it'll<00:05:06.560> look<00:05:06.680> better

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
of piercing I think it'll look better

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.340 
of piercing I think it'll look better
either<00:05:07.760> that<00:05:08.150> or<00:05:08.180> I<00:05:08.360> want<00:05:08.600> to<00:05:08.690> get<00:05:08.900> another
