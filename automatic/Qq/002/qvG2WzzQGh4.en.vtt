so<00:00:49.060> when<00:00:49.210> you<00:00:49.300> go<00:00:49.420> through<00:00:49.570> your<00:00:49.660> punnett

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:49.990 
so when you go through your punnett

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.020 
so when you go through your punnett
strawberries<00:00:50.530> go<00:00:51.370> through<00:00:51.580> just<00:00:51.700> take<00:00:51.940> the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
strawberries go through just take the

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.770 
strawberries go through just take the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
tops off like that and cut them straight

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.800 
tops off like that and cut them straight
down<00:00:55.990> so<00:00:56.200> ideally<00:00:56.650> you<00:00:56.770> want<00:00:56.980> flat<00:00:57.460> faces<00:00:57.810> and

down so ideally you want flat faces and

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.410 
down so ideally you want flat faces and
you<00:00:58.900> want<00:00:59.050> about<00:00:59.110> sort<00:00:59.590> of<00:00:59.650> a<00:00:59.740> about<00:01:00.040> a<00:01:00.070> dozen

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
you want about sort of a about a dozen

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.360 
you want about sort of a about a dozen
strawberries<00:01:01.420> really<00:01:01.810> same<00:01:02.320> time<00:01:02.620> you<00:01:03.190> can

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
strawberries really same time you can

make your own candy floss all right

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.480 
make your own candy floss all right
must<00:01:06.940> be<00:01:07.150> must<00:01:07.390> be<00:01:07.480> castor<00:01:07.960> sugar<00:01:08.370> when<00:01:09.370> you

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
must be must be castor sugar when you

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.790 
must be must be castor sugar when you
heat<00:01:09.730> castor<00:01:10.270> sugar<00:01:10.300> and<00:01:11.050> you<00:01:11.140> apply<00:01:11.410> heat<00:01:11.650> to

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
heat castor sugar and you apply heat to

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.650 
heat castor sugar and you apply heat to
something<00:01:12.190> and<00:01:12.370> shake<00:01:12.640> it<00:01:12.850> it<00:01:13.000> will<00:01:13.240> turn<00:01:13.510> into

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
something and shake it it will turn into

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.600 
something and shake it it will turn into
caramel<00:01:14.200> but<00:01:14.650> most<00:01:14.830> importantly<00:01:15.310> you<00:01:15.460> can

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
caramel but most importantly you can

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.090 
caramel but most importantly you can
then<00:01:15.790> turn<00:01:16.330> it<00:01:16.450> into<00:01:16.600> candy<00:01:17.110> floss<00:01:17.320> and<00:01:18.040> then

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
then turn it into candy floss and then

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.740 
then turn it into candy floss and then
what<00:01:18.340> we<00:01:18.430> do<00:01:18.550> is<00:01:18.580> we<00:01:18.790> take<00:01:19.000> our<00:01:19.180> strawberries

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
what we do is we take our strawberries

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.350 
what we do is we take our strawberries
and<00:01:19.990> place<00:01:20.320> these<00:01:20.729> all<00:01:21.729> the<00:01:21.910> way<00:01:21.940> around<00:01:22.240> the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
and place these all the way around the

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.580 
and place these all the way around the
edge<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:24.100> cake<00:01:24.310> alright<00:01:24.940> so<00:01:25.750> the<00:01:25.869> cut<00:01:26.110> side<00:01:26.410> of

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
edge the cake alright so the cut side of

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.020 
edge the cake alright so the cut side of
the<00:01:26.619> strawberries<00:01:27.190> is<00:01:27.430> going<00:01:27.729> all<00:01:27.850> the<00:01:28.000> way

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
the strawberries is going all the way

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.780 
the strawberries is going all the way
around<00:01:28.360> the<00:01:28.479> edge<00:01:28.630> so<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:30.340> is<00:01:30.490> why<00:01:30.610> it's

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
around the edge so this is why it's

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:31.920 
around the edge so this is why it's
important<00:01:31.180> that<00:01:31.210> roughly<00:01:31.600> you<00:01:31.690> get<00:01:31.840> the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
important that roughly you get the

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.440 
important that roughly you get the
strawberries<00:01:32.729> roughly<00:01:33.729> all<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:34.000> same<00:01:34.210> height

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
strawberries roughly all the same height

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.770 
strawberries roughly all the same height
whenever<00:01:35.440> you're<00:01:35.560> doing<00:01:35.680> this<00:01:36.510> the<00:01:37.510> sugar

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
whenever you're doing this the sugar

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.350 
whenever you're doing this the sugar
really<00:01:38.350> needs<00:01:38.650> to<00:01:38.770> be<00:01:38.860> clean<00:01:39.220> and<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.119> reason

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
really needs to be clean and the reason

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.450 
really needs to be clean and the reason
why<00:01:40.479> it<00:01:40.540> used<00:01:40.720> this<00:01:40.840> type<00:01:41.080> of<00:01:41.110> sugar<00:01:41.560> that<00:01:42.280> it's

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
why it used this type of sugar that it's

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.700 
why it used this type of sugar that it's
been<00:01:42.640> refined<00:01:43.000> as<00:01:43.750> in<00:01:44.020> all<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.290> dirt<00:01:44.530> and

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
been refined as in all the dirt and

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.109 
been refined as in all the dirt and
stuff<00:01:44.890> has<00:01:45.010> been<00:01:45.190> taken<00:01:45.490> out<00:01:45.550> the<00:01:45.670> sugar<00:01:45.940> cane

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
stuff has been taken out the sugar cane

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.419 
stuff has been taken out the sugar cane
and<00:01:47.020> if<00:01:47.110> you<00:01:47.229> use<00:01:47.410> like<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:47.740> save<00:01:47.979> the<00:01:48.190> polar

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
and if you use like the save the polar

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:51.810 
and if you use like the save the polar
bear<00:01:48.670> sugar<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:50.530> sort<00:01:50.860> of<00:01:50.920> organic<00:01:51.369> sugar<00:01:51.640> it

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
bear sugar that sort of organic sugar it

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.499 
bear sugar that sort of organic sugar it
doesn't<00:01:52.149> work<00:01:52.330> all<00:01:52.750> right<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:55.210> can<00:01:55.330> put<00:01:55.450> a

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
doesn't work all right you can put a

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:56.999 
doesn't work all right you can put a
little<00:01:55.660> bit<00:01:55.750> of<00:01:55.869> water<00:01:56.020> and<00:01:56.170> if<00:01:56.259> you<00:01:56.350> want<00:01:56.530> next

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
little bit of water and if you want next

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
we take some double cream now I've done

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.100 
we take some double cream now I've done
enough<00:02:00.580> this<00:02:00.759> this<00:02:01.060> is<00:02:01.210> for<00:02:01.390> one<00:02:01.570> you<00:02:01.929> can

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
enough this this is for one you can

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.180 
enough this this is for one you can
double<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.470> portion<00:02:02.649> if<00:02:02.920> you<00:02:03.039> wish<00:02:05.160> and<00:02:06.160> then

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
double the portion if you wish and then

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.310 
double the portion if you wish and then
you<00:02:06.640> take<00:02:06.880> your<00:02:06.910> palate<00:02:07.479> knife<00:02:07.509> or<00:02:07.960> your<00:02:08.110> knife

you take your palate knife or your knife

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.509 
you take your palate knife or your knife
and<00:02:08.619> spread<00:02:08.920> this

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.429 

then<00:02:12.519> you<00:02:12.640> always<00:02:12.819> spread<00:02:13.359> it<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.010> edge

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
then you always spread it to the edge

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:21.180 
then you always spread it to the edge
the<00:02:17.439> mold<00:02:17.799> I<00:02:18.010> am

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.620

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.170 

now<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.680> sugars<00:02:27.950> cooking<00:02:28.220> away<00:02:28.310> next<00:02:28.880> we<00:02:29.000> take

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
now the sugars cooking away next we take

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.630 
now the sugars cooking away next we take
some<00:02:29.450> of<00:02:29.480> this<00:02:29.690> sugar<00:02:30.320> snow<00:02:30.800> they<00:02:31.220> may<00:02:31.400> go

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
some of this sugar snow they may go

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.820 
some of this sugar snow they may go
right<00:02:32.030> a<00:02:32.360> little<00:02:32.750> bit<00:02:32.900> of<00:02:32.990> sugar<00:02:33.200> look<00:02:33.500> just

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
right a little bit of sugar look just

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.710 
right a little bit of sugar look just
over<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.160> top<00:02:34.190> they<00:02:34.910> need<00:02:35.120> quite<00:02:35.450> a<00:02:35.480> bit<00:02:35.540> of

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
over the top they need quite a bit of

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.210 
over the top they need quite a bit of
sugar<00:02:35.750> on<00:02:35.960> this<00:02:36.140> big<00:02:36.380> plus<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.680> sponge<00:02:36.950> tastes

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
sugar on this big plus the sponge tastes

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.840 
sugar on this big plus the sponge tastes
horrible

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
horrible

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.700 
horrible
makes<00:02:38.180> it<00:02:38.330> taste<00:02:38.570> a<00:02:38.720> bit<00:02:38.810> homemade<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.530> see

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
makes it taste a bit homemade you see

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.770 
makes it taste a bit homemade you see
what<00:02:40.490> we<00:02:40.580> need<00:02:40.730> to<00:02:40.910> do<00:02:41.030> is<00:02:41.150> just<00:02:41.300> turn<00:02:41.510> down<00:02:41.540> the

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
what we need to do is just turn down the

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.370 
what we need to do is just turn down the
heat<00:02:41.810> a<00:02:41.960> little<00:02:42.140> bit

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
heat a little bit

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.090 
heat a little bit
I<00:02:42.820> need<00:02:43.820> a<00:02:43.850> tray<00:02:44.240> of<00:02:44.270> core<00:02:44.720> water<00:02:45.020> it's<00:02:45.950> really

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
I need a tray of core water it's really

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.470 
I need a tray of core water it's really
important<00:02:46.490> when<00:02:46.580> you<00:02:46.640> do<00:02:46.790> this<00:02:46.820> that<00:02:47.210> you<00:02:47.330> make

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
important when you do this that you make

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.880 
important when you do this that you make
sure<00:02:47.630> that<00:02:47.660> all<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.050> sugar<00:02:48.290> crystals<00:02:48.470> gone

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
sure that all the sugar crystals gone

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.740 
sure that all the sugar crystals gone
because<00:02:49.100> sugar<00:02:49.430> always<00:02:50.000> wants<00:02:50.330> to<00:02:50.390> go<00:02:50.480> back<00:02:50.600> to

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
because sugar always wants to go back to

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.900 
because sugar always wants to go back to
be<00:02:50.840> a<00:02:50.870> solid<00:02:51.350> and<00:02:51.620> that's<00:02:52.100> really<00:02:52.370> hot<00:02:52.610> this<00:02:52.760> is

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
be a solid and that's really hot this is

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.850 
be a solid and that's really hot this is
140<00:02:53.780> degrees<00:02:54.050> centigrade<00:02:54.530> cool<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:55.400> down

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.270 

while<00:02:58.460> you<00:02:58.550> tell<00:02:58.730> you<00:02:58.820> attention<00:02:59.180> to<00:02:59.270> this<00:03:00.280> get

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
while you tell you attention to this get

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.240 
while you tell you attention to this get
yourself<00:03:01.580> a<00:03:01.670> blowtorch<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:03.010> then<00:03:04.010> because

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
yourself a blowtorch and then because

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.530 
yourself a blowtorch and then because
we've<00:03:04.400> got<00:03:04.490> these<00:03:04.610> icing<00:03:04.970> sugar<00:03:05.120> on<00:03:05.270> there<00:03:05.420> to

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
we've got these icing sugar on there to

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.660 
we've got these icing sugar on there to
create<00:03:05.750> a<00:03:05.840> little<00:03:06.050> pattern<00:03:06.440> you<00:03:07.250> can<00:03:07.340> do<00:03:07.490> this

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
create a little pattern you can do this

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.920 
create a little pattern you can do this
very<00:03:07.820> quickly<00:03:08.120> so<00:03:08.360> make<00:03:08.480> sure<00:03:08.630> it's<00:03:08.750> really

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
very quickly so make sure it's really

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.060 
very quickly so make sure it's really
hot<00:03:09.200> you<00:03:09.350> can<00:03:09.440> tell<00:03:09.590> what<00:03:09.680> it's<00:03:09.800> hot<00:03:09.920> when<00:03:10.010> it

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
hot you can tell what it's hot when it

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.410 
hot you can tell what it's hot when it
starts<00:03:10.280> to<00:03:10.370> burn<00:03:10.550> your<00:03:10.760> fingers<00:03:11.090> at<00:03:11.210> the<00:03:11.300> other

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
starts to burn your fingers at the other

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:22.750 
starts to burn your fingers at the other
end<00:03:12.370> and<00:03:13.370> you<00:03:13.580> do<00:03:13.700> this

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.910 

and<00:03:23.300> now<00:03:23.450> you<00:03:23.510> can<00:03:23.720> go<00:03:23.870> up<00:03:23.930> your<00:03:24.110> fruit<00:03:24.409> you<00:03:24.769> can

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
and now you can go up your fruit you can

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.670 
and now you can go up your fruit you can
then<00:03:25.269> what<00:03:26.269> I<00:03:26.300> call<00:03:26.690> -<00:03:26.840> the<00:03:26.930> chef's<00:03:27.140> throw<00:03:27.530> this

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
then what I call - the chef's throw this

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.039 
then what I call - the chef's throw this
on<00:03:27.860> with<00:03:27.890> finesse<00:03:28.400> you<00:03:29.269> can<00:03:29.420> start<00:03:29.659> to<00:03:29.840> fill

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
on with finesse you can start to fill

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:35.289 
on with finesse you can start to fill
this<00:03:30.260> up<00:03:30.440> very<00:03:30.709> very<00:03:30.980> quick<00:03:33.730> nice<00:03:34.730> and<00:03:34.940> simple

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
this up very very quick nice and simple

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:36.490 
this up very very quick nice and simple
and<00:03:35.510> then<00:03:35.629> what<00:03:35.780> you<00:03:35.840> can<00:03:35.900> do<00:03:36.110> is<00:03:36.260> you<00:03:36.379> get

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
and then what you can do is you get

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.390 
and then what you can do is you get
yourself<00:03:37.120> watch<00:03:38.120> again<00:03:38.739> around<00:03:39.739> the<00:03:39.860> edge

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
yourself watch again around the edge

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.100 
yourself watch again around the edge
basically<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.209> heat<00:03:41.390> of<00:03:41.599> the<00:03:41.690> blowtorch

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
basically the heat of the blowtorch

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.830 
basically the heat of the blowtorch
softens<00:03:42.830> the<00:03:42.950> cream<00:03:43.220> which<00:03:44.209> enables<00:03:44.690> you<00:03:44.810> to

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
softens the cream which enables you to

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.080 
softens the cream which enables you to
lift<00:03:45.110> off<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:45.410> ring<00:03:48.129> then<00:03:49.129> can<00:03:49.760> turn<00:03:49.940> your

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
lift off the ring then can turn your

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.420 
lift off the ring then can turn your
attention<00:03:50.150> to<00:03:50.599> the<00:03:50.660> sugar<00:03:51.019> now<00:03:51.379> this<00:03:52.280> is

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
attention to the sugar now this is

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.420 
attention to the sugar now this is
liquid<00:03:52.849> caramel<00:03:53.590> and<00:03:54.590> the<00:03:54.890> way<00:03:55.010> that<00:03:55.190> you<00:03:55.250> do

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
liquid caramel and the way that you do

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.660 
liquid caramel and the way that you do
this<00:03:55.640> is<00:03:56.560> spinning<00:03:57.560> backwards<00:03:58.010> and<00:03:58.310> forwards

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
this is spinning backwards and forwards

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.470 
this is spinning backwards and forwards
over<00:03:59.269> a<00:03:59.480> steel<00:03:59.810> or<00:03:59.840> use<00:04:00.709> a<00:04:00.799> mop<00:04:01.069> room<00:04:02.030> mantle

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
over a steel or use a mop room mantle

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.630 
over a steel or use a mop room mantle
walking<00:04:02.930> stick<00:04:03.230> have<00:04:04.160> you<00:04:04.250> got<00:04:04.370> a<00:04:04.400> walking

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
walking stick have you got a walking

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.589
