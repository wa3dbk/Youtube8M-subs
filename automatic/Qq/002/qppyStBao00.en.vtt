comm a lot of people have written in and

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.099 
comm a lot of people have written in and
asked<00:00:04.620> about<00:00:04.910> memory<00:00:05.910> cards<00:00:06.299> SD<00:00:06.750> cards

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
asked about memory cards SD cards

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.450 
asked about memory cards SD cards
compact<00:00:07.500> flash<00:00:07.680> cards<00:00:08.040> whatever<00:00:08.309> you're

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
compact flash cards whatever you're

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.910 
compact flash cards whatever you're
using<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:09.000> what<00:00:09.750> their<00:00:09.900> lifespan<00:00:10.469> is<00:00:10.740> how

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
using and what their lifespan is how

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.830 
using and what their lifespan is how
often<00:00:11.130> do<00:00:11.370> you<00:00:11.460> need<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.670> replace<00:00:12.059> them<00:00:12.389> or<00:00:12.570> do

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
often do you need to replace them or do

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.490 
often do you need to replace them or do
you<00:00:13.019> need<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.380> replace<00:00:13.710> them<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.929> my<00:00:15.929> simple

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
you need to replace them and my simple

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.480 
you need to replace them and my simple
answer<00:00:16.740> for<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.820> is<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.150> if<00:00:18.800> you<00:00:19.800> tend

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
answer for that is is that if you tend

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.970 
answer for that is is that if you tend
to<00:00:20.670> like<00:00:21.359> for<00:00:21.600> myself<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.289> never<00:00:22.380> need<00:00:22.949> to

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
to like for myself I never need to

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.040 
to like for myself I never need to
replace<00:00:23.130> them<00:00:23.640> simply<00:00:24.150> because<00:00:24.269> I'm

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
replace them simply because I'm

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.160 
replace them simply because I'm
replacing<00:00:25.560> cameras<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.730> other<00:00:27.599> equipment

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
replacing cameras and other equipment

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.299 
replacing cameras and other equipment
more<00:00:28.380> frequently<00:00:29.130> then<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.949> card<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.130> going

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
more frequently then the card is going

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.220 
more frequently then the card is going
to<00:00:32.399> wear<00:00:32.550> out<00:00:32.759> simply<00:00:33.329> because<00:00:33.510> for<00:00:33.930> instance

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
to wear out simply because for instance

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.410 
to wear out simply because for instance
as<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.579> megapixels<00:00:35.579> keep<00:00:35.760> going<00:00:36.000> up<00:00:36.149> I'm

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
as the megapixels keep going up I'm

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.040 
as the megapixels keep going up I'm
always<00:00:37.110> getting<00:00:37.469> newer<00:00:38.340> cards<00:00:38.790> for<00:00:39.540> more

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
always getting newer cards for more

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.110 
always getting newer cards for more
capacity<00:00:40.250> for<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.460> cameras<00:00:41.820> with<00:00:41.940> more

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
capacity for the cameras with more

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.840 
capacity for the cameras with more
megapixels<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.260> yeah<00:00:43.860> I've<00:00:44.010> got<00:00:44.250> compact

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
megapixels so yeah I've got compact

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.910 
megapixels so yeah I've got compact
flash<00:00:45.059> cards<00:00:45.510> old<00:00:45.690> ones<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.050> are<00:00:46.230> 512

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
flash cards old ones that are 512

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.639 
flash cards old ones that are 512
megabytes<00:00:47.520> which<00:00:47.940> are<00:00:48.149> ancient<00:00:48.390> now<00:00:48.750> do<00:00:49.590> I

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
megabytes which are ancient now do I

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.470 
megabytes which are ancient now do I
worry<00:00:49.980> about<00:00:50.100> them<00:00:50.370> no<00:00:50.520> cuz<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.760> don't<00:00:50.820> use<00:00:51.180> them

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
worry about them no cuz I don't use them

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.500 
worry about them no cuz I don't use them
I'm<00:00:52.320> into<00:00:52.770> 16<00:00:53.340> gig<00:00:53.579> cards<00:00:53.879> now<00:00:54.059> I'm<00:00:54.210> sure<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
I'm into 16 gig cards now I'm sure the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.200 
I'm into 16 gig cards now I'm sure the
next<00:00:54.690> cards<00:00:55.020> I'll<00:00:55.140> be<00:00:55.230> using<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.649> 32<00:00:56.129> s<00:00:56.190> or<00:00:56.430> 64<00:00:57.030> s

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
next cards I'll be using is 32 s or 64 s

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.360 
next cards I'll be using is 32 s or 64 s
and<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.350> never<00:00:58.559> have<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:58.949> worry<00:00:59.190> about

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
and so I never have to worry about

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.520 
and so I never have to worry about
replacing<00:00:59.670> them<00:01:00.239> because<00:01:00.629> they<00:01:00.840> get<00:01:00.989> replaced

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
replacing them because they get replaced

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.130 
replacing them because they get replaced
just<00:01:02.520> from<00:01:02.730> new<00:01:02.910> things<00:01:03.210> coming<00:01:03.600> out<00:01:03.719> long

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
just from new things coming out long

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.330 
just from new things coming out long
before<00:01:04.379> they<00:01:04.830> wear<00:01:05.159> out<00:01:05.400> now<00:01:06.740> memory<00:01:07.740> cards<00:01:08.100> do

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
before they wear out now memory cards do

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.940 
before they wear out now memory cards do
have<00:01:08.869> there's<00:01:09.869> two<00:01:10.229> types<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.590> memory

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
have there's two types of memory

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.480 
have there's two types of memory
there's<00:01:11.369> SLC<00:01:12.150> or<00:01:12.330> mlc<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.409> depending<00:01:14.010> on<00:01:14.159> what

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
there's SLC or mlc so depending on what

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.960 
there's SLC or mlc so depending on what
your<00:01:14.640> card<00:01:14.939> uses<00:01:15.500> they're<00:01:16.500> rated<00:01:16.979> for<00:01:17.220> 10,000

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
your card uses they're rated for 10,000

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.960 
your card uses they're rated for 10,000
or<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> hundred<00:01:18.720> thousand<00:01:19.229> Reed<00:01:19.470> writes<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.640> if

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
or a hundred thousand Reed writes so if

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.760 
or a hundred thousand Reed writes so if
you're<00:01:21.270> not<00:01:21.390> like<00:01:21.600> myself<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> lot<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.560> pros

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
you're not like myself and a lot of pros

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.800 
you're not like myself and a lot of pros
where<00:01:23.070> you're<00:01:23.390> replacing<00:01:24.390> you're<00:01:24.689> not

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
where you're replacing you're not

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.270 
where you're replacing you're not
replacing<00:01:25.259> but<00:01:25.380> you're<00:01:25.530> adding<00:01:25.710> new<00:01:26.220> stuff

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
replacing but you're adding new stuff

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.550 
replacing but you're adding new stuff
regularly<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.330> kind<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.689> retire<00:01:28.229> this

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
regularly so you kind of retire this

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.700 
regularly so you kind of retire this
stuff<00:01:29.750> then<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.320> know<00:01:31.350> you're<00:01:31.560> going<00:01:31.650> to

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
stuff then and you know you're going to

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.280 
stuff then and you know you're going to
be<00:01:31.799> using<00:01:32.189> them<00:01:32.340> more<00:01:32.729> frequently<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.630> for<00:01:34.259> a

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
be using them more frequently and for a

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.899 
be using them more frequently and for a
longer<00:01:34.710> period<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:35.009> time<00:01:35.220> then<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.610> might

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
longer period of time then you might

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.109 
longer period of time then you might
want<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.180> consider<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.750> 10,000<00:01:37.500> or<00:01:38.119> 100,000

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
want to consider the 10,000 or 100,000

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.539 
want to consider the 10,000 or 100,000
mark<00:01:39.360> on<00:01:39.540> your<00:01:40.290> read<00:01:40.530> writes<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:41.490> other

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
mark on your read writes so in other

mark on your read writes so in other

words if you're having it for a few
years<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.600> maybe<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.750> don't<00:01:45.990> have<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.259> whole

years and maybe you don't have a whole
slew<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:46.920> memory<00:01:47.310> cards<00:01:47.460> because<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.790> don't

slew of memory cards because you don't

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.789 
slew of memory cards because you don't
need<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.180> whole<00:01:48.390> bunch<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.320> might<00:01:49.500> get<00:01:49.649> more

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
need a whole bunch so you might get more

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.590 
need a whole bunch so you might get more
use<00:01:50.130> out<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.579> one<00:01:50.759> or<00:01:50.909> two<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.270> maybe<00:01:51.450> you

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.270 
if maybe you do want to replace them I

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
don't think it's really a big deal they

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.920 
don't think it's really a big deal they

that's<00:03:04.230> gonna<00:03:04.379> be<00:03:04.560> twice<00:03:04.980> or<00:03:05.159> three<00:03:05.430> times<00:03:05.459> the

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
that's gonna be twice or three times the

gonna buy another one so it becomes a
