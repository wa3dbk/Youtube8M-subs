00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 so in this second video I'm going 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.180
 try to explain why I 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.809
 did not choose to use a battery 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.460
 Modeling to fuel my go pro 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.389
 for several reasons the first is 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.920
 that the batteries did not give the isthmus 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.640
 are usually made to deliver 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.670
 strong currents of discharge it imposes 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.730
 big things and that's not the 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.599
 any suitable or for a copro the gopro 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.820
 we will say that we will shoot 1000 1500 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.149
 military per hour for her 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.059
 works to say with the wifi turned on 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:40.140
 this one is able to deliver 64 years 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.550
 so loses 64000 milliamps per hour 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.219
 on a voltage of 12 volts 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.930
 hence the thickness of the cables so that's 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.370
 a battery we'll say he's not 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.860
 all adapted to the use of a gopro 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.469
 even if it works the second reason 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.719
 it is that to transform this 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.129
 battery of 11 volts 1 in 3 volts 7 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.570
 we will have to make a modification 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.359
 at the head of the battery 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.309
 it's not always easy and we have 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.840
 risks of making arcs 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.270
 and short circuits which damage 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.650
 irremediably the elements the 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.420
 third reason is that to charge 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.400
 a battery like this it takes a 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.200
 specific charger with a plug 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.080
 balancing that will balance the 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.600
 charge in the three elements so 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.470
 equally 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.560
 that's why I did not choose this 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.090
 I did not choose this battery and 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.790
 digging in my stuff and ben j 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.560
 find an old laptop 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.680
 dell latitude of 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.090
 dell latitude seems to me so I 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.450
 recovered the battery then this 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.470
 battery once dÃ©piauter found 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.270
 six elements like these inside 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.390
 so let's stop lions elements with 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.929
 a reference here so luckily I 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.509
 found the description of these batteries 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.679
 on the internet and after reflection they 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.049
 are perfectly adapted to 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.119
 the use of a cocoon why the 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.119
 first is that each element 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.729
 each element makes about two 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.289
 go pro batteries so there is some 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.920
 two that are assembled for the 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.689
 demonstration 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.399
 I chose the set and four 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.440
 for two reasons the first is that 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.519
 each element has a capacity of 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.840
 discharge of 450 million then lose 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.760
 if we take two, that makes a capacity 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.890
 discharge 800 million lost there is 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.200
 agree that our opposition 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.549
 use it with the wifi turned on 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.340
 Well, the batteries are not going 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.019
 love they will be in shows a request 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.610
 in the ass and they will not like before 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.440
 loved at all so I chose to 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.910
 gather 4 what is done that also at 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.940
 about one thousand five hundred million 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.859
 father / card his rent widely in 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.769
 is in the 450 range 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:41.820
 million father tolerated by each element 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:46.200
 so as you can see it's 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:48.420
 little is not very big and the second 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.940
 advantage is that with this type of 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.810
 homemade battery 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.269
 you do not need a charger 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.850
 specific because if you resume the 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:00.810
 previous video where I explain 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:04.019
 how to make there the battery with 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.109
 a battery of origin and once again 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.930
 to connect welded clean with the 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:13.019
 war because my entourage chatterton well 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.930
 isolated makes his own name you do not have 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.519
 more than plug in your usb cable for 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.579
 activate the battery charge 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.049
 so where before we had pretty much 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.600
 need an hour to load the 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.100
 battery of the ago that today being 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.840
 given that this one is about 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.600
 9000 and ben ben he will have to 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.470
 wait about 8 to 9 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.060
 to charge the next battery 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.800
 the adapter and where the computer you 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:42.650
 use to recharge the battery 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:44.570
 sometimes you have some dvd you 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.680
 adapters who then who can you 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:52.520
 provide 1 amp charging under 5 volts 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.320
 of otc 450 million father know that these 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.780
 elements there that I showed you they 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.200
 have a charge rate of 1428 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.140
 milliamperes so about a year loses 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.140
 5.2 charging 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.140
 here
