00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
summarized quote here I may not get him

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.360 
summarized quote here I may not get him
word<00:00:45.390> for<00:00:45.600> word<00:00:45.719> but<00:00:45.899> he<00:00:46.020> says<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.440> Drive<00:00:46.980> around

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.700 
word for word but he says I Drive around
and<00:00:47.910> that's<00:00:48.690> just<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.170> best<00:00:49.289> way<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.500> learn

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
and that's just the best way to learn

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.560 
and that's just the best way to learn
the<00:00:49.860> track<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.280> go<00:00:50.430> around<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.879> several<00:00:51.300> times

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
the track you go around it several times

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.389 
the track you go around it several times
you<00:00:51.719> get<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> feel<00:00:52.079> for<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.379> might<00:00:52.530> take<00:00:52.770> 10<00:00:53.129> to

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
you get a feel for it might take 10 to

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.490 
you get a feel for it might take 10 to
20<00:00:53.699> laps<00:00:53.910> but<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.690> can<00:00:54.809> either<00:00:54.930> do<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.260> with<00:00:55.379> a

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
20 laps but you can either do it with a

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.459 
20 laps but you can either do it with a
dynamic<00:00:55.770> racing<00:00:56.340> line<00:00:56.489> turned<00:00:56.789> on<00:00:57.090> or<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:58.440> can

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
dynamic racing line turned on or you can

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.270 
dynamic racing line turned on or you can
just<00:00:58.829> wing<00:00:59.100> it

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
just wing it

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.639 
just wing it
in<00:00:59.460> time<00:00:59.820> trial<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.449> use<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.469> unlimited

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
in time trial and use the unlimited

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.590 
in time trial and use the unlimited
amount<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.280> flashbacks<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.149> correct<00:01:03.480> your

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
amount of flashbacks to correct your

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.780 
amount of flashbacks to correct your
mistakes<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.769> highly<00:01:05.100> recommend<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.700> if

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
mistakes but I highly recommend it if

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.010 
mistakes but I highly recommend it if
you're<00:01:05.880> gonna<00:01:05.939> use<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.360> racing<00:01:06.689> line<00:01:06.840> though

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
you're gonna use the racing line though

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.859 
you're gonna use the racing line though
you<00:01:07.080> don't<00:01:07.470> follow<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.490> blindly<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:09.299> have<00:01:09.630> to

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
you don't follow it blindly you have to

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.690 
you don't follow it blindly you have to
check<00:01:10.140> your<00:01:10.320> environment<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.520> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
check your environment and the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.609 
check your environment and the
surroundings<00:01:12.210> get<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.810> landmark<00:01:13.409> that

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
surroundings get a landmark that

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.100 
surroundings get a landmark that
corresponds<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:15.030> colors<00:01:15.479> changing

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
corresponds to the colors changing

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.810 
corresponds to the colors changing
usually<00:01:16.500> there's<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.740> brake<00:01:16.979> marker<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.520> it

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
usually there's a brake marker and it

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.399 
usually there's a brake marker and it
really<00:01:18.119> helps<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.689> out<00:01:18.720> but<00:01:19.049> sometimes<00:01:19.350> you

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
really helps you out but sometimes you

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.870 
really helps you out but sometimes you
have<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.590> look<00:01:19.710> for<00:01:19.890> something<00:01:20.040> bright<00:01:20.369> maybe

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
have to look for something bright maybe

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.710 
have to look for something bright maybe
a<00:01:21.000> sign<00:01:21.390> or<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.659> post<00:01:22.020> off<00:01:22.320> into<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.340> distance

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
a sign or a post off into the distance

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.990 
a sign or a post off into the distance
but<00:01:24.720> learn<00:01:25.380> your<00:01:25.619> braking<00:01:26.040> spots<00:01:26.369> learn<00:01:26.970> a

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
but learn your braking spots learn a

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.789 
but learn your braking spots learn a
risky<00:01:27.630> spot<00:01:27.869> learn<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> spot<00:01:28.590> where<00:01:28.770> you

usually<00:01:29.189> go<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.729> learn<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.030> safe<00:01:30.509> spot<00:01:30.869> once

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
usually go and learn a safe spot once

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.260 
usually go and learn a safe spot once
you<00:01:31.439> learn<00:01:31.650> those<00:01:31.979> then<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.579> can<00:01:32.759> focus<00:01:33.000> on

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
you learn those then you can focus on

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.690 
you learn those then you can focus on
overtaking<00:01:33.990> positions<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.770> where<00:01:35.460> you're
