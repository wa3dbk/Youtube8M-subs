00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.059
 with four figures 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.550
 what we have to do is look at 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.640
 the number that there is 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.160
 756 now we have to catch on the 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.640
 dividend as many figures in such a way 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.410
 that the number we take is the same or 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.820
 greater than what we have in the divisor of 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.199
 7.485 if we take four figures is more 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.540
 small then we will have to choose 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:39.600
 five figures 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:42.510
 now we distribute the three unit with the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.890
 unit with 6 on 5 with 5 and 8 on 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:50.579
 the 7 and the 74 and for the 8 now a number 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.829
 which multiplied by 8974 approaching 9 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.070
 for 8 72 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:00.460
 but it is not possible are 63 to 9 would happen to me 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:08.520
 with which it would be 8 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:16.049
 86 48 to 53 585 45 45 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:21.649
 to 45 04 756 60 to 68 8 miles 68 with 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:25.560
 other 64 670 to 74 4 lowered the figure 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:29.630
 next is 6 for 6 the 5 for 5 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:34.909
 0 for 7 and 48 to 8 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:38.030
 now a number x 8 m of 48 86 48 but 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:41.580
 then I would spend 6% 42 would take me already 4 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:49.950
 the rest would be that if it would be 5 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:57.260
 56 30 up to 36 6 thousand 355 25 and 3 28 up 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:02:02.780
 35 7 m 93 105 35 38 up to 42 I have been 48 5 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.780
 44 44 to 48 4 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.720
 the smallest of the divisor
