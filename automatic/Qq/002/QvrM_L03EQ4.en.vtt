00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.730 
sup guys start over here it's been a
while<00:00:08.510> I<00:00:08.540> haven't<00:00:08.660> made<00:00:09.080> a<00:00:09.110> video<00:00:09.350> because

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:09.740 
while I haven't made a video because

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.160 
while I haven't made a video because
I've<00:00:10.070> been<00:00:10.219> really<00:00:10.459> busy<00:00:10.700> but<00:00:11.000> now<00:00:11.930> I<00:00:11.959> have

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.170 
I've been really busy but now I have

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.680 
I've been really busy but now I have
some<00:00:12.380> tests<00:00:12.620> some<00:00:12.920> free<00:00:13.219> time<00:00:13.460> as<00:00:13.820> you<00:00:14.299> can<00:00:14.420> see

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
some tests some free time as you can see

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.490 
some tests some free time as you can see
I<00:00:14.719> move<00:00:15.320> my<00:00:15.530> table<00:00:15.710> in<00:00:16.550> another<00:00:17.259> corner<00:00:18.259> of<00:00:18.320> my

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
I move my table in another corner of my

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.670 
I move my table in another corner of my
my<00:00:19.369> room<00:00:19.539> simply<00:00:20.539> to<00:00:21.160> to<00:00:22.160> expect<00:00:22.970> more<00:00:23.680> punchy

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
my room simply to to expect more punchy

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.330 
my room simply to to expect more punchy
sound<00:00:24.920> because<00:00:25.490> this<00:00:26.210> corner<00:00:26.660> is<00:00:26.779> only<00:00:27.340> like

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
sound because this corner is only like

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.480 
sound because this corner is only like
walls<00:00:29.060> but<00:00:29.720> at<00:00:29.900> the<00:00:30.199> other<00:00:30.380> side<00:00:30.740> usually<00:00:31.070> my

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
walls but at the other side usually my

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.590 
walls but at the other side usually my
tables<00:00:31.849> here<00:00:32.830> but<00:00:33.830> there<00:00:34.070> was<00:00:34.309> a<00:00:34.339> window<00:00:34.820> so<00:00:35.570> I

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
tables here but there was a window so I

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.080 
tables here but there was a window so I
think<00:00:35.809> that<00:00:36.320> this<00:00:36.530> part<00:00:37.129> of<00:00:37.280> the<00:00:37.430> of<00:00:37.730> the<00:00:37.879> room

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
think that this part of the of the room

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.010 
think that this part of the of the room
has<00:00:38.420> more<00:00:39.280> some<00:00:40.280> insulation<00:00:41.120> so<00:00:41.329> I<00:00:41.390> think<00:00:41.510> that

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
has more some insulation so I think that

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.770 
has more some insulation so I think that
the<00:00:42.170> sound<00:00:42.410> is<00:00:42.620> louder<00:00:43.149> so<00:00:44.149> finally<00:00:44.600> the

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
the sound is louder so finally the

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.610 
the sound is louder so finally the
result<00:00:45.170> is<00:00:45.710> good<00:00:46.010> and<00:00:46.570> the<00:00:47.570> sound<00:00:47.809> is<00:00:47.960> is

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
result is good and the sound is is

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.939 
result is good and the sound is is
louder<00:00:49.309> so<00:00:50.239> now<00:00:50.510> I<00:00:50.539> think<00:00:50.750> it<00:00:51.110> is<00:00:51.230> it<00:00:51.469> is<00:00:51.649> time

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
louder so now I think it is it is time

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.180 
louder so now I think it is it is time
that<00:00:51.980> I<00:00:52.460> can<00:00:52.699> test<00:00:53.030> my<00:00:53.270> system<00:00:53.750> and<00:00:53.989> also<00:00:54.890> my

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
that I can test my system and also my

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.889 
that I can test my system and also my
TV's<00:00:55.640> my<00:00:56.300> table<00:00:56.660> is<00:00:56.750> completely<00:00:57.199> clean<00:00:58.660> so<00:00:59.660> now

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
TV's my table is completely clean so now

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.240 
TV's my table is completely clean so now
as<00:01:00.260> you<00:01:00.289> can<00:01:00.620> see<00:01:00.890> I<00:01:00.920> have<00:01:01.340> so<00:01:01.670> many<00:01:02.090> stuff<00:01:02.539> -<00:01:03.250> so

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
as you can see I have so many stuff - so

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.520 
as you can see I have so many stuff - so
many<00:01:04.399> requests<00:01:05.149> of<00:01:05.300> use<00:01:05.570> from<00:01:05.780> people<00:01:06.200> asking

do an extra test that I just found out I

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.339 
do an extra test that I just found out I
can<00:04:00.640> do<00:04:00.760> it<00:04:00.879> this<00:04:01.030> for<00:04:01.299> eye<00:04:01.329> handlers<00:04:01.870> just<00:04:02.170> as

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
can do it this for eye handlers just as

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:07.050 
can do it this for eye handlers just as
a<00:04:02.379> bonus<00:04:02.650> is<00:04:03.099> the<00:04:04.090> fan<00:04:04.390> test<00:04:04.720> and<00:04:05.430> it<00:04:06.430> is<00:04:06.459> just

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
a bonus is the fan test and it is just

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.380 
a bonus is the fan test and it is just
to<00:04:07.239> see<00:04:07.599> if<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:09.430> airflow<00:04:10.030> of<00:04:10.269> the

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
to see if the the airflow of the

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.410 
to see if the the airflow of the
subwoofer<00:04:10.720> is<00:04:11.049> good<00:04:11.400> so<00:04:12.400> which<00:04:12.549> I<00:04:12.730> will<00:04:13.060> simply

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
subwoofer is good so which I will simply

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.150 
subwoofer is good so which I will simply
put<00:04:13.629> this<00:04:13.780> on<00:04:13.989> the<00:04:14.440> front<00:04:14.799> of<00:04:15.479> the<00:04:16.479> subwoofer

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
put this on the front of the subwoofer

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.699 
put this on the front of the subwoofer
hub<00:04:18.160> I<00:04:18.340> think<00:04:18.609> the<00:04:19.030> whole<00:04:19.239> I<00:04:19.510> don't<00:04:19.600> know<00:04:19.810> so

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
hub I think the whole I don't know so

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.310 
hub I think the whole I don't know so
let's<00:04:20.739> see<00:04:21.310> if<00:04:21.459> it<00:04:21.609> spins<00:04:21.910> this<00:04:22.780> is<00:04:22.930> the<00:04:23.050> first

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
let's see if it spins this is the first

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.370 
let's see if it spins this is the first
time<00:04:23.500> I<00:04:23.530> test<00:04:23.919> it<00:04:24.070> like<00:04:24.280> this<00:04:24.460> so<00:04:25.419> let's<00:04:26.050> see<00:04:26.229> if

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
time I test it like this so let's see if

00:04:26.380 --> 00:05:06.060 
time I test it like this so let's see if
it<00:04:26.710> can<00:04:26.949> succeed<00:04:29.280> let's<00:04:30.280> play<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.580> song

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070
