00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
not I either we get a hundred gem so I'm

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:21.700 
not I either we get a hundred gem so I'm
gonna<00:01:19.520> go<00:01:19.640> ahead<00:01:19.670> and<00:01:19.820> just<00:01:20.210> I<00:01:20.420> guess<00:01:20.630> I<00:01:20.840> guess

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
gonna go ahead and just I guess I guess

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.830 
gonna go ahead and just I guess I guess
pretty<00:01:21.890> much<00:01:22.070> just<00:01:22.190> use<00:01:22.399> like<00:01:22.430> 50<00:01:22.790> to<00:01:22.910> 75<00:01:23.390> gems

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
pretty much just use like 50 to 75 gems

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.990 
pretty much just use like 50 to 75 gems
hopefully<00:01:24.649> that's<00:01:24.860> enough<00:01:24.979> I<00:01:25.310> honestly<00:01:25.670> think

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
hopefully that's enough I honestly think

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.639 
hopefully that's enough I honestly think
that<00:01:26.119> should<00:01:26.630> be<00:01:26.690> enough<00:01:27.020> i<00:01:27.140> mean<00:01:27.320> the<00:01:27.440> rates

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
that should be enough i mean the rates

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:29.740 
that should be enough i mean the rates
on<00:01:27.800> this<00:01:27.920> unit<00:01:28.250> is<00:01:28.399> increased<00:01:29.180> but<00:01:29.420> either<00:01:29.509> way

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
on this unit is increased but either way

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.990 
on this unit is increased but either way
let's<00:01:30.170> go<00:01:30.350> ahead<00:01:30.440> and<00:01:30.560> do<00:01:30.770> this<00:01:31.040> and<00:01:31.220> yeah

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
let's go ahead and do this and yeah

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.030 
let's go ahead and do this and yeah
let's<00:01:32.210> hope<00:01:32.360> for<00:01:32.390> something<00:01:32.750> good<00:01:33.229> all<00:01:33.800> right
