and good image quality and basically

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.430 
and good image quality and basically
what<00:01:00.270> they've<00:01:00.390> done<00:01:00.510> with<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.719> k20<00:01:01.199> d<00:01:01.320> as

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
what they've done with a k20 d as

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.799 
what they've done with a k20 d as
perhaps<00:01:01.590> some<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.100> will<00:01:02.219> already<00:01:02.340> know

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
perhaps some of you will already know

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.939 
perhaps some of you will already know
they've<00:01:03.809> just<00:01:04.019> really<00:01:04.290> improved<00:01:04.559> upon<00:01:04.769> it

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
they've just really improved upon it

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.560 
they've just really improved upon it
we've<00:01:05.549> got<00:01:05.760> more<00:01:07.760> weather<00:01:08.760> seals<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.540> i

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
we've got more weather seals in it so i

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.550 
we've got more weather seals in it so i
think<00:01:09.689> it's<00:01:09.869> gone<00:01:09.960> up<00:01:10.110> from<00:01:10.170> something<00:01:10.470> like

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
think it's gone up from something like

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.730 
think it's gone up from something like
64<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.640> something<00:01:12.210> like<00:01:12.299> 74<00:01:12.869> now<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.590> just

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
64 to something like 74 now so it just

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.200 
64 to something like 74 now so it just
makes<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.070> little<00:01:14.400> bit<00:01:14.490> more<00:01:14.520> safer<00:01:15.090> in

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
makes it that little bit more safer in

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.210 
makes it that little bit more safer in
sand<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:15.840> moisture<00:01:16.110> well<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.009> can't

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
sand and in moisture well so you can't

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.280 
sand and in moisture well so you can't
take<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.520> underwater<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.810> wasn't<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.170> know

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
take it underwater that wasn't you know

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.770 
take it underwater that wasn't you know
never<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.650> point<00:01:19.830> anyway<00:01:20.270> but<00:01:21.270> what<00:01:21.450> also<00:01:21.600> we

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
never the point anyway but what also we

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.950 
never the point anyway but what also we
got<00:01:21.960> we've<00:01:22.140> got<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.650> 14<00:01:23.040> point<00:01:23.189> 6<00:01:23.460> megapixel

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
got we've got a 14 point 6 megapixel

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.469 
got we've got a 14 point 6 megapixel
chip<00:01:24.960> here<00:01:25.229> it's<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.590> CMOS<00:01:25.920> chip<00:01:26.180> and<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.299> does

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
chip here it's a CMOS chip and it does

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.510 
chip here it's a CMOS chip and it does
have<00:01:28.020> dust<00:01:28.409> reduction<00:01:28.860> built<00:01:29.040> into<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.369> body

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
have dust reduction built into the body

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.910 
have dust reduction built into the body
and<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.420> also<00:01:30.570> has<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:30.960> live<00:01:31.290> view<00:01:31.470> feature<00:01:31.710> as

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
and it also has a live view feature as

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.149 
and it also has a live view feature as
well<00:01:32.720> and<00:01:33.720> it's<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.650> think<00:01:34.950> it's<00:01:35.070> actually

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
well and it's a I think it's actually

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.390 
well and it's a I think it's actually
mechanical<00:01:35.790> shake<00:01:35.970> reduction<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.570> system

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
mechanical shake reduction in the system

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.429 
mechanical shake reduction in the system
this<00:01:38.400> also<00:01:38.610> does<00:01:38.939> 14<00:01:39.329> bit<00:01:39.509> conversion<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.170> your

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
this also does 14 bit conversion of your

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.679 
this also does 14 bit conversion of your
RAW<00:01:41.189> files<00:01:41.430> as<00:01:41.700> well<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.119> can<00:01:42.150> shoot<00:01:42.420> raw

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
RAW files as well and you can shoot raw

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.440 
RAW files as well and you can shoot raw
which<00:01:42.930> are<00:01:43.110> PDF<00:01:43.829> files<00:01:44.130> we<00:01:44.640> shoot<00:01:44.850> JPEGs<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.329> I

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
which are PDF files we shoot JPEGs and I

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.810 
which are PDF files we shoot JPEGs and I
believe<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.780> can<00:01:45.899> shoot<00:01:46.140> raw<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> JPEGs<00:01:47.640> at<00:01:47.759> the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
believe you can shoot raw a JPEGs at the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.600 
believe you can shoot raw a JPEGs at the
same<00:01:48.000> time<00:01:48.240> we've<00:01:49.110> got<00:01:49.140> 11<00:01:49.740> focusing<00:01:50.220> sensors

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
same time we've got 11 focusing sensors

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.219 
same time we've got 11 focusing sensors
which<00:01:50.850> nine<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.329> cross-type<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.020> just

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
which nine of the cross-type so just

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.649 
which nine of the cross-type so just
that<00:01:52.350> little<00:01:52.409> bit<00:01:52.530> more<00:01:52.649> accurate<00:01:53.659> when

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
that little bit more accurate when

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.600 
that little bit more accurate when
you're<00:01:54.810> focusing<00:01:55.280> sensitivity<00:01:56.280> has<00:01:56.340> gone<00:01:56.490> up

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
you're focusing sensitivity has gone up

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.719 
you're focusing sensitivity has gone up
as<00:01:56.729> well<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.090> goes<00:01:57.210> now<00:01:57.420> from<00:01:57.600> 100<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.200> 6400<00:01:58.950> and

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
as well it goes now from 100 to 6400 and

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.910 
as well it goes now from 100 to 6400 and
the<00:01:59.880> Kate<00:02:00.060> nd<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.360> think<00:02:00.600> was<00:02:00.689> only<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.110> 1500<00:02:01.799> so

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
the Kate nd I think was only to 1500 so

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.520 
the Kate nd I think was only to 1500 so
that's<00:02:02.100> an<00:02:02.430> improvement<00:02:02.759> there<00:02:03.259> LCD<00:02:04.259> screen

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
that's an improvement there LCD screen

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.770 
that's an improvement there LCD screen
there's<00:02:06.310> actually<00:02:06.580> just<00:02:06.610> a<00:02:06.850> slight<00:02:07.090> a<00:02:07.480> slight

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
there's actually just a slight a slight

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.540 
there's actually just a slight a slight
change<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.679> catering<00:02:09.039> day<00:02:09.160> was<00:02:09.280> two<00:02:09.429> and<00:02:09.520> a

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
change the catering day was two and a

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.180 
change the catering day was two and a
half<00:02:09.700> inches<00:02:10.000> in<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.270> K<00:02:10.450> 20<00:02:10.840> D<00:02:11.020> this<00:02:11.800> is<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.070> K

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
half inches in the K 20 D this is the K

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.030 
half inches in the K 20 D this is the K
20<00:02:12.520> D<00:02:12.640> here<00:02:12.910> that's<00:02:13.450> got<00:02:13.630> just<00:02:13.990> a<00:02:14.290> slight

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
20 D here that's got just a slight

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.600 
20 D here that's got just a slight
improvement<00:02:15.790> on<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.660> on<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.230> LCD<00:02:17.440> 2.7<00:02:18.310> inches

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
improvement on the on the LCD 2.7 inches

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.050 
improvement on the on the LCD 2.7 inches
now<00:02:18.820> takes<00:02:19.660> all<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.870> usual<00:02:20.200> K<00:02:21.130> 18<00:02:21.340> mount

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
now takes all the usual K 18 mount

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.670 
now takes all the usual K 18 mount
lenses<00:02:22.570> KF<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:24.250> mount<00:02:24.610> lenses<00:02:25.470> dynamic<00:02:26.470> range

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680

as<00:02:26.830> well<00:02:26.950> that's<00:02:27.130> one<00:02:27.310> thing<00:02:27.459> that<00:02:27.490> has

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
as well that's one thing that has

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.090 
as well that's one thing that has
increased<00:02:27.940> dynamic<00:02:28.930> ranges<00:02:29.470> a<00:02:29.530> way<00:02:29.830> of

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
increased dynamic ranges a way of

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.100 
increased dynamic ranges a way of
increasing<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:31.890> contrast<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.780> sensor

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
increasing the contrast that the sensor

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.530 
increasing the contrast that the sensor
can<00:02:35.260> actually<00:02:35.650> record<00:02:36.340> so<00:02:36.970> for<00:02:37.090> example<00:02:37.450> if

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
can actually record so for example if

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.930 
can actually record so for example if
you<00:02:37.630> on<00:02:37.690> a<00:02:37.750> very<00:02:37.959> bright<00:02:38.230> day<00:02:38.530> with<00:02:39.489> a<00:02:39.520> bland

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
you on a very bright day with a bland

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.760 
you on a very bright day with a bland
sky<00:02:40.420> but<00:02:40.810> it's<00:02:40.930> very<00:02:41.080> very<00:02:41.260> bright<00:02:41.440> you've<00:02:41.680> got

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
sky but it's very very bright you've got

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.440 
sky but it's very very bright you've got
a<00:02:41.800> darker<00:02:42.130> foreground<00:02:42.610> what<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.180> can<00:02:43.300> actually

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
a darker foreground what it can actually

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.110 
a darker foreground what it can actually
do<00:02:43.810> is<00:02:43.989> it's<00:02:44.320> got<00:02:44.500> an<00:02:44.620> up<00:02:44.739> to<00:02:44.890> 200%<00:02:45.430> dynamic

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
do is it's got an up to 200% dynamic

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.300 
do is it's got an up to 200% dynamic
range<00:02:46.360> in<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.170> chip<00:02:47.380> so<00:02:47.560> you<00:02:47.650> can<00:02:47.739> just<00:02:47.860> handle

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
range in the chip so you can just handle

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.340 
range in the chip so you can just handle
the<00:02:49.090> ranges<00:02:49.420> and<00:02:49.480> you<00:02:49.570> get<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:49.720> bit<00:02:49.870> more<00:02:50.020> detail

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
the ranges and you get a bit more detail

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.510 
the ranges and you get a bit more detail
in<00:02:50.380> your<00:02:50.590> highlights<00:02:50.920> or<00:02:51.040> inner<00:02:51.190> shadows

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
in your highlights or inner shadows

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.920 
in your highlights or inner shadows
whatever<00:02:51.820> the<00:02:51.880> case<00:02:52.060> may<00:02:52.239> be<00:02:52.270> depending<00:02:52.540> on
