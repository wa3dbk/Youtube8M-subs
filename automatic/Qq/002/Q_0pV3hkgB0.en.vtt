 Xenia and I am pleased to welcome you to 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.540
 my channel today i will tell you how 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:14.400
 make finger paints with your own hands 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:17.820
 and so we need water 1 tea 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.010
 Spoon take food dye 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.380
 just a few grains 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.150
 food coloring should be very good 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.519
 dissolve so that they remain 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.810
 grains all crystals should be 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.030
 well well mixed and after 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.969
 food dye completely dissolved 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.969
 I took almost a whole teaspoon 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.250
 sugar my child will not paint 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.500
 fingers only and tassels and 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.200
 thanks to sugar the paint will not 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.000
 spread out on a piece of paper if you 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.550
 plan to draw only with your fingers 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.399
 sugar can not safely add all 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.160
 stir well 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.980

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.609

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.370
 starch 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.680
 take too teaspoon starch 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.000
 provides the necessary thickness of our 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.439
 paints want more liquid paints 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.869
 add half a teaspoon will 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.130

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.130

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:25.210
 this is our little ones almost ready 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:29.290
 Here is such a consistency 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.090
 but we all go to draw and so let's 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.150

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.470
 our little things in work
