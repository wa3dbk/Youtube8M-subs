I<00:00:55.180> mean<00:00:55.720> it's<00:00:55.930> just<00:00:55.989> still<00:00:56.760> jumping<00:00:57.760> all<00:00:57.879> over

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:57.909 
I mean it's just still jumping all over

the ballpark microwave air conditioner
doesn't<00:01:04.780> really<00:01:05.080> matter<00:01:05.350> I<00:01:10.740> did<00:01:11.740> swap<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
doesn't really matter I did swap the

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.800 
doesn't really matter I did swap the
shunt<00:01:13.659> leads<00:01:13.900> around<00:01:14.290> back<00:01:15.510> didn't<00:01:16.510> make<00:01:16.630> any

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
shunt leads around back didn't make any

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.539 
shunt leads around back didn't make any
difference<00:01:17.020> and<00:01:17.500> it<00:01:17.650> dropped<00:01:17.950> one<00:01:18.159> leg<00:01:18.369> over

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
difference and it dropped one leg over

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.140 
difference and it dropped one leg over
the<00:01:18.700> other<00:01:18.790> side<00:01:20.190> they're<00:01:21.190> both<00:01:21.370> on<00:01:21.580> 50<00:01:22.000> amp

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
the other side they're both on 50 amp

the other side they're both on 50 amp
circuits<00:01:22.570> right<00:01:22.750> now<00:01:22.930> it's<00:01:23.230> 200<00:01:23.740> amp<00:01:23.860> shots

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
circuits right now it's 200 amp shots

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.830 
circuits right now it's 200 amp shots
each<00:01:25.410> the<00:01:26.410> one<00:01:26.560> on<00:01:26.650> the<00:01:26.740> right<00:01:27.040> was<00:01:27.940> the<00:01:27.970> 20<00:01:28.660> amp

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
each the one on the right was the 20 amp

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.100 
each the one on the right was the 20 amp
side<00:01:29.260> of<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.470> generator<00:01:30.660> one<00:01:31.660> on<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:31.870> left

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.670 
side of the generator one on the left
goes<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:32.620> 30<00:01:32.920> amp<00:01:33.100> side<00:01:33.430> of<00:01:33.580> the<00:01:33.640> generator

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:46.190 

you<00:01:39.840> can<00:01:40.840> see

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.500 

a<00:01:46.230> little<00:01:47.100> disappointed<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.910> when<00:01:48.390> I'm

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
a little disappointed that when I'm

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.000 
a little disappointed that when I'm
jumping<00:01:48.840> all<00:01:49.080> over<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.320> place<00:01:49.560> but<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.860> should

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
jumping all over the place but it should

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:59.789 
jumping all over the place but it should
be<00:01:50.160> easy<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.430> pull<00:01:50.640> out<00:01:50.760> and<00:01:50.880> replace

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.690 

and<00:02:00.799> down<00:02:01.130> here<00:02:01.789> we<00:02:02.240> have<00:02:02.329> the<00:02:03.219> two<00:02:04.219> shunts

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
and down here we have the two shunts

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.330 
and down here we have the two shunts
that<00:02:04.880> I<00:02:04.969> installed<00:02:05.420> this<00:02:05.929> is<00:02:06.189> an<00:02:07.189> auto

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
that I installed this is an auto

that I installed this is an auto
transfer<00:02:08.060> switch<00:02:08.810> box<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:10.310> white<00:02:10.670> leg<00:02:10.910> on<00:02:11.420> the

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
transfer switch box the white leg on the

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.530 
transfer switch box the white leg on the
right<00:02:11.720> is<00:02:11.959> the<00:02:12.260> short<00:02:12.590> power<00:02:13.180> black<00:02:14.180> leg<00:02:14.390> in

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
right is the short power black leg in

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.360 
right is the short power black leg in
the<00:02:14.599> middle<00:02:14.750> is<00:02:15.019> the<00:02:15.140> generator<00:02:15.560> power<00:02:15.860> and

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
the middle is the generator power and

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.990 
the middle is the generator power and
then<00:02:17.140> over<00:02:18.140> on<00:02:18.200> your<00:02:18.319> left<00:02:18.560> is<00:02:18.739> your<00:02:19.040> outbound

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
then over on your left is your outbound

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.420 
then over on your left is your outbound
then<00:02:20.300> to<00:02:20.450> that<00:02:20.980> because<00:02:21.980> a<00:02:22.010> breaker<00:02:22.280> panel

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
then to that because a breaker panel

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.710 
then to that because a breaker panel
yeah<00:02:25.430> a<00:02:25.459> few<00:02:25.910> different<00:02:26.209> words<00:02:26.360> aren't<00:02:26.599> up

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
yeah a few different words aren't up

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.070 
yeah a few different words aren't up
there<00:02:26.750> I've<00:02:27.080> got<00:02:27.290> 22<00:02:27.739> gauge<00:02:28.780> wires<00:02:29.780> running

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
there I've got 22 gauge wires running

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.559 
there I've got 22 gauge wires running
out<00:02:30.260> of<00:02:30.319> the<00:02:30.410> top<00:02:30.650> of<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:30.920> shunt<00:02:31.390> that's<00:02:32.390> how

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
out of the top of the shunt that's how

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.259 
out of the top of the shunt that's how
it<00:02:32.690> attaches<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:33.590> then<00:02:34.579> of<00:02:34.700> course<00:02:34.730> a<00:02:35.030> black

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
it attaches and then of course a black

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.860 
it attaches and then of course a black
leg<00:02:35.510> going<00:02:35.720> through<00:02:35.959> one<00:02:36.140> shunt<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:38.660> red

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
leg going through one shunt and the red

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.630 
leg going through one shunt and the red
leg<00:02:39.079> going<00:02:39.290> through<00:02:39.530> there<00:02:39.769> shot<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.310> neutral

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
leg going through there shot the neutral

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.030 
leg going through there shot the neutral
on<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.790> ground<00:02:41.200> don't<00:02:42.200> go<00:02:42.319> through<00:02:42.530> any<00:02:42.590> shunt

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
on the ground don't go through any shunt

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.330

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
and hang out on top all that goes

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.589
