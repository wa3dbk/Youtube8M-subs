00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:07.080
 Where do customers go ? We already know VTB Bank. 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.530
 they are coming 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.009
 well there and so on to others 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.000
 satellite images found 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:18.690
 presumably one hundred twenty two 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.750
 Fragment Boeing did not exist but 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.990
 here I can not agree with this why 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.900
 because first there were found 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.949
 some kind of debris completely different 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.769
 direction 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.510
 Well, that is, a few thousand kilometers 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.399
 from the place where they should be 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:41.969
 and well first of all nobody identified 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.730
 that is, until there are black boxes 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.100
 talk about what is this boeing 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.039
 problems i'm blond avatar any 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.289
 fragments of the second if they are on the ice in 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.899
 few food kilometers from this 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.329
 ment that means one hundred percent of 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.020
 layer some kind of arc arc over there could 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.180
 get there and where is the guarantee that it is not 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.390
 option with hryvnia on submarines 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.970
 which was shown in great 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.290
 patriotic war when guys give 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:16.350
 bombs there make product latrine 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.350
 as it should be and all poured some 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.290
 paper which you shit like this armor 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.590
 the laces were specially thrown into the latrine 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.900
 there shoes like that records created before 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.390
 made it seem exploded but also 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.159
 oil naturally exploded underwater 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.740
 boats and no matter how experienced captain 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:40.560
 the destroyer was just about to leave ours 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.020
 the rivers applauded the chapter as cool 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.420
 fool deceived option is quite 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.610
 maybe that is in some place not 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.680
 need a submarine ship dropped 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.000
 wreckage but they are several thousand 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.640
 kilometers means pilot conscious 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.920
 took the plane there if he deliberately 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.680
 will go there plane means he had 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.899
 some thoughts can be up to the reason where here 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.229
 pudak can in another place led him here 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.710
 Imagine usually leaving the aircraft such 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.530
 these are areas and 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.500
 with him it was not by chance that there were a lot of stains 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.350
 there are thousands of hours co-pilot and 10000 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.860
 flew 1 10 hours he flew nothing 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.380
 It happened 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.020
 go when he decided this plane where 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.420
 I will go to the wrong place why so 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.780
 happened in terms of mathematics from 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.470
 probably but on the forehead probably probably something 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.330
 if there were debris in place 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.460
 found where he was supposed to be no 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.310
 question and if there they are discovered 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.570
 brought 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:45.130
 strange situation the case is generally very 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.190
 overwhelmed them and the Chinese 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.770
 Malaysians here are what 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.370
 some shiny debris is enough 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:58.120
 big sizes 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:03.450
 Well, I can't eat like that 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:06.160
 a bit of that number should be numbers 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.650
 what is any way you can 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:13.980
 we could not identify 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.980
 run this summary here so
