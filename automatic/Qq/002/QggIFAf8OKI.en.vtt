signs it it might not happen but i'll
show<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.190> how<00:00:44.309> if<00:00:44.370> it's<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.670> anyway<00:00:47.300> all<00:00:48.300> right

show you how if it's it anyway all right
so<00:00:49.890> be<00:00:50.219> like<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.730> stern<00:00:50.940> like<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.239> but<00:00:51.449> it

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
so be like in a stern like this but it

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.750 
so be like in a stern like this but it
would<00:00:51.809> keep<00:00:51.930> on<00:00:52.110> repeating<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:53.219> basically

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
would keep on repeating so basically

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.779 
would keep on repeating so basically
what<00:00:53.940> we<00:00:54.059> would<00:00:54.300> do<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:55.469> I'll<00:00:56.370> just<00:00:56.520> show<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.670> a

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
what we would do is I'll just show you a

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.389 
what we would do is I'll just show you a
sudden<00:00:57.109> you<00:00:58.109> would<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.440> just<00:00:58.890> take<00:00:59.010> this<00:00:59.129> case

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
sudden you would I just take this case

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.750 
sudden you would I just take this case
off<00:00:59.609> actually<00:01:00.210> made<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.840> easier<00:01:01.140> than<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.760> yeah

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
off actually made it easier than I yeah

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.539 
off actually made it easier than I yeah
what<00:01:03.449> your<00:01:03.600> base<00:01:03.719> device<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.710> kind<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.100> dfu

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
what your base device and kind of dfu

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.810 
what your base device and kind of dfu
mode<00:01:05.580> but<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.630> really<00:01:06.930> did<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.290> learn<00:01:07.729> so<00:01:08.729> you

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
mode but I really did you learn so you

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.850 
mode but I really did you learn so you
do<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.270> take<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.810> hold<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.830> home

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
do is you take it and hold the home

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.999 
do is you take it and hold the home
power<00:01:11.280> bond<00:01:11.460> down<00:01:13.880> just<00:01:14.880> keep<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.210> hold<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.570> it

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
power bond down just keep a hold on it

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.340 
power bond down just keep a hold on it
and<00:01:17.330> then<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.509> would<00:01:18.630> just<00:01:18.659> flash<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.200> that

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
and then it would just flash that that

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.950 
and then it would just flash that that
you<00:01:19.470> ought<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.710> do<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.310> will<00:01:20.430> boot<00:01:20.580> up<00:01:23.960> so

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
you ought to do and it will boot up so

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.490 
you ought to do and it will boot up so
that<00:01:25.860> would<00:01:26.070> usually<00:01:26.759> work<00:01:27.479> if<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:28.229> does<00:01:28.470> not

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
that would usually work if that does not

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.399 
that would usually work if that does not
work<00:01:30.740> there's<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:32.670> can<00:01:32.820> either<00:01:32.930> read<00:01:33.930> over<00:01:34.350> it

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
work there's you can either read over it

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.960 
work there's you can either read over it
or<00:01:35.900> not<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.439> can<00:01:37.650> this<00:01:38.040> wait<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.820> can

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
or not you can this wait and it you can

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.440 
or not you can this wait and it you can
regenerate<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.840> through<00:01:40.909> Brett's<00:01:41.909> now<00:01:42.180> or

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
regenerate it through Brett's now or

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.520 
regenerate it through Brett's now or
whatever<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:43.439> job<00:01:43.799> work<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.100> with<00:01:44.720> or<00:01:45.720> if<00:01:46.409> that

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
whatever you job work it with or if that

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.280 
whatever you job work it with or if that
doesn't<00:01:46.890> even<00:01:46.950> work<00:01:47.070> what<00:01:47.729> usually<00:01:47.939> does<00:01:48.360> you

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
doesn't even work what usually does you

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.950 
doesn't even work what usually does you
can<00:01:49.590> do<00:01:50.280> on<00:01:50.460> your<00:01:50.640> computer<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.090> worse<00:01:51.659> than

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
can do on your computer and worse than

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.090 
can do on your computer and worse than
is<00:01:52.399> restore<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:54.740> that's<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.860> worst<00:01:56.040> thing

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
is restore it and that's the worst thing

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:05.700 
is restore it and that's the worst thing
that<00:01:56.280> could<00:01:56.460> happen

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.120 

or<00:02:06.710> also<00:02:07.700> what<00:02:07.970> you<00:02:08.060> could<00:02:08.270> do<00:02:08.450> is<00:02:08.770> it's<00:02:09.770> time

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
or also what you could do is it's time

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.100 
or also what you could do is it's time
