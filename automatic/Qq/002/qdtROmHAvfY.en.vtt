00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:08.309
 Hello today, you're talking about 1 brand 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:11.670
 I will tell you a little of my heating 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.330
 about 60 square greenhouses 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.190
 meters 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:22.279
 waste oil stove 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:26.580
 Now we do not start writing but otpizdili 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:30.109
 fuel containers barrels 200 liter 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:35.390
 which are on the fuel line 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:38.840
 collage oil goes 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.840
 application in 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.559
 using this pump 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.550
 who's there for 12 volts 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.000
 this world i 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.000
 pump 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.460
 injection takes place 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.239
 working out 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:04.180
 in the oven than plus this 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.640
 ways the very end places the country with 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.770
 using pumps so that you can accurately 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.290
 adjust feed regardless 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.150
 viscosity versus temperature here 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.750
 can . 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.010
 filing 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.550
 here is help 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.550
 from somewhere 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.330
 a door 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.159
 on the button 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:40.119
 for luck try when you're in a dream 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:42.840
 it's on the ambulance still added 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.470
 brought 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.040
 can be controlled so by 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.440
 occupancy 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.440
 voltmeter dyk possible 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.580
 and here with the help 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.249
 here 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.050
 cabinet 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.800
 stove and ironing 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.319
 First of all 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:30.950
 altai firing which is part of the chimney 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:33.760
 will prove behind all the tricks of the part brother not 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.710
 formed here and 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.560
 also 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.830
 this 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.500
 it's surface is too cool 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:47.020
 due to the fact that I find myself 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:49.680
 and it is blown about ruin and shroud 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:56.019
 opens through these gaps coming out 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:59.440
 Greece eat heat turns out well, pretty 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:04.520
 effective I can 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.560
 hand on and hold on 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.300
 and here above where did when 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.890
 decreasing the purchase chimney or 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.780
 temperature right now somewhere on the level 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.950
 Well, it feels like 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.040
 50 60 degrees when frosty 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.599
 nights of February 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:29.219
 with the wind on the piker and power stove 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:31.319
 there was such a temperature that is already difficult 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:37.500
 there was a hand when applying to this 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:39.950
 Of course, now it's morning temperature 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:44.640
 look now who 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:46.590
 16 degrees for something to start the night for 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.069
 nights to start the day this is optimal but 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.379
 Now we are considering the optimal 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:56.939
 temperature for the plant for 17 degrees 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:59.459
 add a little power or can 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:01.489
 be due to solar some part 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.049
 heating even today overcast and see 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:08.250
 included additional lighting 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:12.540
 lamps given here in the most remote 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.139
 removed from my stove , too, but for 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.780
 of control 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:19.840
 another thermometer here we look like that 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.889
 to 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.889
 I can clearly see 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.259
 So 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:38.020
 Here's the temperature, too, about 16 and 17 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:42.310
 degrees that is pretty going 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.009
 uniform heat distribution system 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:48.960
 fuel supply 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:53.470
 burning with quite stable in the stove and 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.300
 service is of course minimal at night 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.900
 don't have to practically get up and 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:03.449
 occasionally alarm 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.449
 alarm based sensor 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.310
 here's a water temperature sensor 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.040
 because you can 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:18.730
 the rationale for this sensor and when it 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:23.320
 turns on about why that's why 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:25.470
 just about you going to the house on a squeaker 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.390
 like some kind of toy 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:33.790
 beeps and alerts you 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:38.470
 the fact that there is a problem with the heat 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:40.290
 either the electricity went off or else 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.000
 what is there under littered like 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:45.880
 fuel line but that was literally 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.240
 for February one case this year their 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.990
 close I have two or three case 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.990
 kill these for 

00:05:52.499 --> 00:06:00.310
 Well, now a little bit of merit 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:03.639
 obvious but now we don't get it out 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:06.219
 which are also very obvious behind these 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:13.020
 possible deficiencies and I have 

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:18.389
 stop using this stove 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:22.800
 you see smoke is not black is not 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:26.529
 unexpressed any exhaust 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:31.169
 periodical from the pipe especially at the peak 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:35.560
 power crashes so here they are 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:36.669
 pieces of soot though visually 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:42.009
 play fuel 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:45.029
 ok and here are these soot bits and fly 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:49.120
 children on the roof have to periodically 

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:53.379
 we are a greenhouse and of course I will try 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:57.990
 up front and this is a garden here for me here 

00:06:53.379 --> 00:07:01.419
 fruit trees here that the color of apple 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:05.500
 raspberry blackberries pour so here vegetables 

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:06.430
 being grown so i maybe because 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.129
 environmental 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:12.699
 reasons to refuse to use the stove 

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:14.919
 although if for someone itâ€™s not critical 

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:19.689
 probably you can use this stove 

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:22.319
 here is the next turn here under construction 

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:27.219
 greenhouses have actually been erected there 

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:30.759
 there will be wood heating 

00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:33.210
 This is already a new time for the show. 

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:33.210
 are watching
