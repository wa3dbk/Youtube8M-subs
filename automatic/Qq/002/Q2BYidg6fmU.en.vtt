00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.619
 but 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.579
 and 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.480
 and 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.480
 my 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.240
 and 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.280
 hm 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.280
 a 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.420
 hey i'm harry maasen i demonstrated 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.310
 electro harmonix analyzer 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.800
 and are you looking for a pedal whatever you like 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.140
 chilly digital signal or your guitar with 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.950
 single chose can transform into a warm one 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.210
 signal 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.680
 then this is an interesting choice 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.030
 electro harmonix has a good payment 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.650
 what it originally delivered 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.510
 signal in the find it 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.280
 frequency range of low and high 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.530
 does not really affect but the 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.360
 allows to warm up 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.040
 it is actually in helping with a door 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.970
 are not a circuit with additional 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.900
 controls 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:37.330
 volume gives you the output volume 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.820
 blendt it determines the balance between it 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.759
 original signal and it 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.290
 hello guys signal and spreads he gives 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.330
 you had the opportunity to admit it 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.920
 to your original signal 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.540
 let's start with the clean signal 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.259
 i play on a fender grow greenhouses this 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.259
 is changing my profile 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.430
 are as an element 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.270
 I start with the angel guy with the 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.270
 focus on the game 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.520
 and completely 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.379
 Hey 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.280
 and 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.280
 to be 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.640
 as a principle every one is that weird 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.640
 blind 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.080
 and 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.090
 fully 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.470
 back to clean 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.769
 says a significant difference and 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.990
 I step up a bit 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.319
 and 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.319
 Hey 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.740
 No 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.870
 No 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.440
 You can send your small signal that you are single 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.960
 core signal nice warming up with pedal 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.380
 okay spread for that I put the blendt eco 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.380
 again halfway 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.370
 what the late is added to it 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.370
 signal which makes it a bit wider 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.630
 when the settings start on the higher 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.630
 notice that it is one thing 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.450
 my a place to sleep 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.750
 you can be the last full game 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:43.560
 their full with a culture and 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.889
 Yes 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.889
 and
