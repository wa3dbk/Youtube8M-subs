00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
Lindo is front wheel wheelie basically

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.170 
Lindo is front wheel wheelie basically
and<00:01:36.650> this<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.009> best<00:01:38.220> spot<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.460> do<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.820> and

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
and this is the best spot to do it and

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.999 
and this is the best spot to do it and
I'll<00:01:39.299> show<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.600> later<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.380> different<00:01:40.530> run

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
I'll show you later in a different run

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.130 
I'll show you later in a different run
but<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.670> think<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:41.939> just<00:01:42.119> said<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.540> heck<00:01:42.720> with<00:01:42.780> it

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
but I think I just said to heck with it

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.889 
but I think I just said to heck with it
I'll<00:01:43.290> come<00:01:43.470> back<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.979> do<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.220> later

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:55.580 

so<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.140> third<00:01:50.149> flower<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:52.549> a<00:01:54.229> little<00:01:55.229> bit<00:01:55.320> past

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
so the third flower is a little bit past

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.069 
so the third flower is a little bit past
this

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.679 

I<00:01:58.109> think<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.430> temp<00:01:59.759> dye<00:01:59.939> just<00:02:00.119> gave

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
I think this is the temp dye just gave

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.099 
I think this is the temp dye just gave
up<00:02:00.840> on<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:02.750> yeah

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:04.109 
up on it yeah

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:09.100

fall on you I think sometimes it won't
but<00:02:49.049> if<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.319> keep<00:02:49.500> backing<00:02:49.769> up<00:02:50.010> it'll<00:02:50.340> fall<00:02:50.549> on

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
different run other than the flowers but
yeah<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:15.690> just<00:03:16.459> it's<00:03:17.569> difficult<00:03:18.569> but<00:03:19.139> it

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
yeah you just it's difficult but it
