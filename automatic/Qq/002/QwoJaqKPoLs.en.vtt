 taking advantage of recording today that I have 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.430

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.970
 I have to study but this week 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.430

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.880

 to go up this week because 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.780
 this is an extraction and as well 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.220
 you can in the title and I told you that I was going to 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.490
 bring 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:07.030
 similar is the suit of the backpack is worth 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:10.510
 and well and first of all I will tell you and 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:13.630
 I've thought about it, I have everything more or less 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.000
 ready for you to do what 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.890
 I 'm going to take the suitcase and I'll 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.070
 go to teach but I do not have it yet 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.480
 he has practically convinced 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.880
 I'm not convinced that I'm going to 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.650
 but I can do it as I go 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.230
 to prepare for the four days that I 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.060
 I'm going to take to the beach and anything goes 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.310
 then let's start because it's a 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.220
 night 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.370
 in my backpack you must have 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.040
 well-known vale 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.480
 the state of the backpack is well known 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.890
 here on youtube are the videos very 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.710
 requested 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.800
 and I bring the day this is my backpack 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.990
 which it is roxy 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.510
 surely you will know this backpack 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.890
 because it's from last season and if 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.660
 these reduction backpacks are carried 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.130
 a lot for new school apparently from 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:05.770
 cut and the tones had backpack in this 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:10.180
 case they are in shades like purple violets 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:14.550
 brown and fuchsia and the short backpack 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.550
 part of them has two parts 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:25.620
 the pocket this is simple big 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.140
 behind it is bordered the symbol of 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.060
 proxy and the same have the tickets of 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.890
 colors a handle to hold the 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.530
 funny is that all the 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.720
 born to carry states so I'm going 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.019
 to start if I look like your pocket 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.989
 I big I will not teach books 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.450
 books because we all have books and 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.970
 we all know how bad they are but good 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.250
 I'm going to teach a little bit everything I've 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.710
 well, this is the general view 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.960
 like a warning and I've been a few pounds 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.880
 because they will settle we had knowledge 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.760
 and I'm going to eat 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.060
 in the big pocket I carry the case 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.940
 with which I do my homework 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.940
 and here we take 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:13.770
 buts mechanical pencil balls and all that 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.230
 I have a comb for the days that I have 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:20.099
 had general to comb my hair after 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.099
 bad entering 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.370
 in grid 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.970
 and a rubber band just in case 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.360
 with notes 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.930
 I need 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.629
 a bag of candies 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.450
 violets 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:54.260
 and a bottle of in this case hides 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.209
 it's worth always I have to bring water 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.180
 because I love to drink water before 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.330
 changes I also have a lot of thirst and 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.830
 It dries the vowel a lot and it's good 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.830
 hydrate between class changes 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:11.090
 As you can see, I do not have many feelings and 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:18.199
 I'm worth 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:20.359
 but good because all and all are the 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:23.720
 books and little else 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.310
 the tiny pocket worth has this 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.979
 small keychain that I have made that is 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.950
 a tape and not 100 minutes and that was 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:33.570
 A) Yes 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:36.670
 ok it's nothing else and then I'm going to 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:39.330
 teach them this little box that 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.580
 I am 92 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.729
 and all the things that you are going to visit 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.349
 throughout the day 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.349
 I have the station 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.730
 Well, maybe it only grew there 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:59.330
 another little roxie purse arrived with 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:03.589
 roxy architect and symbol 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:06.320
 he intoned one of the squares and good and 

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:09.770
 you know how I see 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:13.000
 there are those who put me to open 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.000
 and this goes 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.310
 without more and with few things the bird took 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.580
 I always carry a pen just in case 

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:32.799
 I carry a 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.870
 from home 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.669
 a cocoa so that I did not get dehydrated and 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:48.900
 the lips 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:53.419
 in this case they gave away and I take it because 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.419
 it's super good and it's like laminates 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:58.649
 good and good 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:04.180
 is mentolate 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:07.570
 it's super good he asked me is that here 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.850
 I also carry the different cocoas worth 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.760
 I think that's what I'm going to teach 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:14.140
 also that another world is possible 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:17.260
 always fed by wearing a 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:30.529
 spare part and all that 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:32.719
 this is brown 

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:35.119
 the lips do not trail shrimp but if 

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:37.069
 we want to put aside and is have 

00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:38.569
 perfumes and the truth is wants 

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:40.999
 develop it with the hinge them 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:43.309
 they stick out their tongue they know a lot 

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:47.509
 Coca-Cola is worth it then this is my steak 

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:50.409
 that is also to use a lot that is like that 

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:54.139
 is the classic of the protection project 

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:56.719
 I have it in the bar and I also have it in 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:07:00.659
 cocoa but the other one I have it at home 

00:06:56.719 --> 00:07:03.039
 ok also give you some pita and this one 

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:07.249
 it smells more vanilla the last more 

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:09.979
 cultural valey is white and steak 

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:13.009
 I already believe that it has lead to the machine 

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:15.379
 backpack the music usually the flower or 

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:18.109
 Take a very simple law because 

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:20.209
 to leave home what you need in 

00:07:18.109 --> 00:07:22.549
 moby the keys and something from 

00:07:20.209 --> 00:07:24.169
 emergencies that you have already taught and then 

00:07:22.549 --> 00:07:26.959
 books because for school I do not know 

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:29.149
 you need nothing else then then 

00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:33.260
 Well I hope you liked the sale 

00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:35.960
 of the backpack that is born very tiny 

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.790
 Well, we already have a language and good 

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.920
 and tell them that I keep commenting if 

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:42.620

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:45.410
 prepare for a trip all this what 

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:47.270
 I see difficult but although it may look bad 

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:51.670
 and well I say the same decent thing 

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:51.670
