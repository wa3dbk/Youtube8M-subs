00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
I think we've got a very good team and

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.980 
I think we've got a very good team and
so<00:01:52.860> yeah<00:01:53.220> I'm<00:01:53.340> I'm<00:01:53.759> very<00:01:53.820> very<00:01:54.270> confident<00:01:54.810> and

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
so yeah I'm I'm very very confident and

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.859 
so yeah I'm I'm very very confident and
also<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.920> fact<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.280> guys<00:01:56.610> are<00:01:56.670> when<00:01:57.630> we

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
also the fact that you guys are when we

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.510 
also the fact that you guys are when we
spoke<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.380> was<00:01:58.619> thinking<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.189> might<00:01:59.219> work

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
spoke I was thinking it might work

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.539 
spoke I was thinking it might work
against<00:02:00.030> us<00:02:00.290> because<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.829> had<00:02:02.250> all<00:02:02.369> those

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
against us because you had all those

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.920 
against us because you had all those
sort<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:02.850> Europa<00:02:03.240> League<00:02:03.360> games<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.780> you'd

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
sort of Europa League games that you'd

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.969 
sort of Europa League games that you'd
be<00:02:04.049> really<00:02:04.290> match<00:02:04.590> ready

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
be really match ready

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.429 
be really match ready
but<00:02:05.969> looking<00:02:06.329> at<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.600> kind<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.869> panned<00:02:07.110> out<00:02:07.259> for

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
but looking at is kind of panned out for

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.809 
but looking at is kind of panned out for
you<00:02:07.530> guys<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.860> hasn't<00:02:08.160> really<00:02:08.280> worked<00:02:08.399> out

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
you guys it hasn't really worked out

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.150 
you guys it hasn't really worked out
that<00:02:09.000> way<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.179> mean<00:02:09.450> if<00:02:09.780> anything<00:02:10.200> it's<00:02:10.800> kind<00:02:11.069> of

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
that way I mean if anything it's kind of

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.530 
that way I mean if anything it's kind of
messed<00:02:11.370> up<00:02:11.489> your<00:02:11.640> preparations<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.420> bit<00:02:12.569> so<00:02:12.840> I

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
messed up your preparations a bit so I

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.940 
messed up your preparations a bit so I
again<00:02:13.659> I<00:02:13.810> think<00:02:14.049> that<00:02:14.200> that<00:02:14.349> helps<00:02:14.590> us<00:02:14.739> submit

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
again I think that that helps us submit

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.789 
again I think that that helps us submit
so<00:02:15.819> should<00:02:16.780> we<00:02:16.810> be<00:02:17.049> worried<00:02:17.319> about<00:02:17.379> it<00:02:17.680> though

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
so should we be worried about it though

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.199 
so should we be worried about it though
I<00:02:17.829> mean<00:02:17.980> there's<00:02:18.219> many<00:02:18.340> many<00:02:18.670> players<00:02:18.939> but

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
I mean there's many many players but

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.030 
I mean there's many many players but
who's<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.959> real<00:02:20.140> danger<00:02:20.469> Manucci<00:02:20.829> thinks

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
who's the real danger Manucci thinks

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.349 
who's the real danger Manucci thinks
going<00:02:21.129> about<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.370> big<00:02:21.549> game<00:02:21.700> big<00:02:21.969> season

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:22.359

Sacko<00:03:19.690> as<00:03:19.870> well<00:03:20.049> good<00:03:20.739> player<00:03:20.979> we<00:03:21.970> definitely

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:22.479 
Sacko as well good player we definitely

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:24.000 
Sacko as well good player we definitely
have<00:03:22.569> to<00:03:22.599> put<00:03:22.659> shackles<00:03:23.019> on<00:03:23.349> them<00:03:23.500> too<00:03:23.709> so

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
have to put shackles on them too so

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.399 
have to put shackles on them too so
those<00:03:24.699> are<00:03:24.879> the<00:03:24.970> two<00:03:25.120> I<00:03:25.150> think<00:03:25.540> to<00:03:26.049> watch<00:03:26.169> out

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:26.409 
those are the two I think to watch out

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:29.699 
those are the two I think to watch out
for<00:03:26.590> obviously<00:03:27.519> we've<00:03:27.639> got<00:03:28.139> weary<00:03:29.139> rumors<00:03:29.590> are

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
for obviously we've got weary rumors are

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.199 
for obviously we've got weary rumors are
starting<00:03:30.010> on<00:03:30.069> the<00:03:30.250> starting<00:03:30.519> line<00:03:30.549> confirmed

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
starting on the starting line confirmed

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.300 
starting on the starting line confirmed
here<00:03:31.389> we've<00:03:31.810> got<00:03:31.900> a<00:03:31.959> 16<00:03:32.440> year<00:03:32.590> old<00:03:32.620> boy<00:03:32.769> plan<00:03:33.159> in

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
here we've got a 16 year old boy plan in

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.009 
here we've got a 16 year old boy plan in
the<00:03:33.400> central<00:03:33.760> midfield<00:03:34.120> restock<00:03:34.780> so<00:03:34.930> it's

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
the central midfield restock so it's

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.990 
the central midfield restock so it's
very<00:03:35.109> highly<00:03:35.440> rated<00:03:35.739> but<00:03:36.010> you<00:03:36.489> know<00:03:36.609> it's<00:03:36.909> a

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
very highly rated but you know it's a

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.879 
very highly rated but you know it's a
worry<00:03:37.180> for<00:03:37.359> us<00:03:37.479> is<00:03:38.229> that<00:03:38.379> something<00:03:38.650> that<00:03:38.680> you

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
worry for us is that something that you

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:40.710 
worry for us is that something that you
think<00:03:38.919> you<00:03:39.159> can<00:03:39.340> explore<00:03:39.669> today<00:03:39.849> well<00:03:40.269> I<00:03:40.299> think

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
think you can explore today well I think

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.879 
think you can explore today well I think
I<00:03:41.819> never<00:03:42.819> seen<00:03:43.000> him<00:03:43.150> play<00:03:43.209> my<00:03:43.599> CV<00:03:43.930> move<00:03:44.169> to<00:03:44.620> even

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
I never seen him play my CV move to even

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:46.619 
I never seen him play my CV move to even
be<00:03:44.979> considered<00:03:45.549> to<00:03:45.669> be<00:03:45.819> playing<00:03:46.180> today<00:03:46.510> he

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:46.629 
be considered to be playing today he

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:48.360 
be considered to be playing today he
must<00:03:46.780> be<00:03:46.900> really<00:03:47.139> really<00:03:47.560> good<00:03:47.739> I<00:03:47.979> think

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
must be really really good I think

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.250 
must be really really good I think
that's<00:03:48.729> a<00:03:48.879> big<00:03:49.060> risk<00:03:49.239> to<00:03:49.389> put<00:03:49.540> a<00:03:49.569> 16<00:03:50.019> year<00:03:50.229> old

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
that's a big risk to put a 16 year old

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.500 
that's a big risk to put a 16 year old
our<00:03:50.919> strength<00:03:51.459> is<00:03:51.579> our<00:03:51.699> midfield<00:03:51.970> it's<00:03:52.389> about

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
our strength is our midfield it's about

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.689 
our strength is our midfield it's about
a<00:03:52.569> 16<00:03:53.079> year<00:03:53.319> old<00:03:53.379> in<00:03:53.799> against<00:03:54.609> Oziel<00:03:55.329> ramsey

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:56.699 
a 16 year old in against Oziel ramsey

00:03:56.699 --> 00:04:01.349 
a 16 year old in against Oziel ramsey
Gazzola<00:03:57.699> I<00:03:59.400> don't<00:04:00.400> know<00:04:00.489> I<00:04:00.729> think<00:04:01.030> there'll<00:04:01.329> be

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
Gazzola I don't know I think there'll be

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:02.670 
Gazzola I don't know I think there'll be
a<00:04:01.419> massive<00:04:01.780> risk<00:04:01.930> on<00:04:02.139> your<00:04:02.260> part

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680
