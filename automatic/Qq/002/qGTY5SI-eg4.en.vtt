a unit and now we've just got you know

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.719 
a unit and now we've just got you know
30<00:01:04.439> some<00:01:04.739> players<00:01:04.949> coming<00:01:05.250> into<00:01:05.519> camp

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
30 some players coming into camp

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.780 
30 some players coming into camp
competing<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:07.290> can't<00:01:07.979> remember<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.520> last<00:01:08.640> time

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
competing I can't remember the last time

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.429 
competing I can't remember the last time
we<00:01:08.909> kind<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.240> had<00:01:09.420> just<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.810> camp<00:01:10.049> where<00:01:10.170> there

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
we kind of had just a camp where there

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.899 
we kind of had just a camp where there
was<00:01:10.560> no<00:01:10.740> games<00:01:10.979> attached<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.549> think<00:01:11.760> this<00:01:11.850> is

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
was no games attached so I think this is

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.020 
was no games attached so I think this is
an<00:01:12.119> important<00:01:12.479> time<00:01:12.659> for<00:01:12.689> us<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.020> get<00:01:13.799> ready<00:01:14.040> to

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
an important time for us to get ready to

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.649 
an important time for us to get ready to
mold<00:01:15.630> gel<00:01:16.170> together<00:01:16.790> and<00:01:17.790> just<00:01:18.180> kind<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.479> push

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
mold gel together and just kind of push

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.170 
mold gel together and just kind of push
on<00:01:18.840> with<00:01:18.869> our<00:01:19.110> fitness<00:01:19.530> get<00:01:20.070> sharp<00:01:20.369> lots<00:01:21.060> of

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
on with our fitness get sharp lots of

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.300 
on with our fitness get sharp lots of
double<00:01:21.420> days<00:01:21.570> coming<00:01:21.869> up<00:01:22.049> but<00:01:22.320> it's<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.189> good

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
double days coming up but it's a good

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.399 
double days coming up but it's a good
thing<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.700> kind<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.970> get<00:01:24.360> going<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.840> just<00:01:25.140> kind

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
thing to kind of get going and just kind

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.749 
thing to kind of get going and just kind
of<00:01:25.439> be<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:25.770> atmosphere<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.430> training

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
of be in this atmosphere of training

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.030 
of be in this atmosphere of training
wise<00:01:26.880> for<00:01:27.720> one<00:01:27.750> because<00:01:28.350> our<00:01:28.560> league<00:01:28.770> only

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
wise for one because our league only

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.069 
wise for one because our league only
lost<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.729> know<00:01:29.850> until<00:01:30.299> end<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.570> august<00:01:30.960> early

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
lost you know until end of august early

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.140 
lost you know until end of august early
step<00:01:31.380> number<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.250> think<00:01:32.579> it's<00:01:32.790> important

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
step number so I think it's important

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.420 
step number so I think it's important
that<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.420> know<00:01:33.630> we<00:01:33.990> have<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:35.189> know<00:01:35.280> we're

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
that you know we have a you know we're

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.940 
that you know we have a you know we're
playing<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.850> training<00:01:36.000> in<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.240> offseason

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
playing and training in the offseason

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.380 
playing and training in the offseason
you<00:01:37.950> know<00:01:38.070> because<00:01:38.340> all<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.820> other<00:01:38.850> teams<00:01:39.180> are

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
you know because all the other teams are

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.539 
you know because all the other teams are
still<00:01:39.509> training<00:01:39.780> as<00:01:39.960> well<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.470> think<00:01:40.740> you
