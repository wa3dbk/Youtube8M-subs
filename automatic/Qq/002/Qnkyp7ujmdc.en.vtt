00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.300 
parallel mode and then you have two
single<00:01:54.000> coil<00:01:54.390> cut<00:01:54.930> modes<00:01:55.229> in<00:01:55.560> which<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.159> can

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
single coil cut modes in which you can

parallel<00:02:26.810> split<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.530> parallel<00:02:28.950> split<00:02:29.310> no

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
parallel split the parallel split no

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.900 
parallel split the parallel split no
split<00:02:30.600> coil<00:02:30.930> okay<00:02:31.920> if<00:02:32.400> you<00:02:32.520> take<00:02:32.760> both

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
split coil okay if you take both

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.760 
split coil okay if you take both
switches<00:02:33.240> that<00:02:33.750> are<00:02:33.810> on<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.230> mounting<00:02:34.590> ring

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
switches that are on the mounting ring

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.290 
switches that are on the mounting ring
and<00:02:34.950> you<00:02:35.040> shove<00:02:35.280> them<00:02:35.400> towards<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.970> neck<00:02:36.150> of

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
and you shove them towards the neck of

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.070 
and you shove them towards the neck of
the<00:02:36.360> guitar<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:37.920> will<00:02:38.070> be<00:02:38.250> activating<00:02:39.080> the

activate the coil with the adjustable
pole<00:02:50.010> pieces<00:02:50.310> which<00:02:50.700> is<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.030> one<00:02:51.180> closest<00:02:51.660> to

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
pole pieces which is the one closest to

00:02:51.690 --> 00:03:03.710 
pole pieces which is the one closest to
your<00:02:51.960> bridge<00:02:52.310> or<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.820> brighter<00:02:54.210> of<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.510> two

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.080 

Hey<00:03:04.990> now<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.200> other<00:03:05.560> single-coil<00:03:06.220> you<00:03:06.940> would

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
Hey now the other single-coil you would

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.620 
Hey now the other single-coil you would
cut<00:03:07.330> or<00:03:08.260> activate<00:03:08.890> by<00:03:09.070> pushing<00:03:09.610> both<00:03:10.030> switches

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630

towards<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:11.590> bridge

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
towards the bridge

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.240 
towards the bridge
turning<00:03:13.150> off<00:03:13.270> the<00:03:13.380> one<00:03:14.380> that<00:03:14.770> you<00:03:14.860> were<00:03:14.980> using

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
turning off the one that you were using

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.980 
turning off the one that you were using
just<00:03:15.550> now<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:16.030> turning<00:03:16.270> on<00:03:16.360> the<00:03:16.390> one<00:03:16.630> closer

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
just now and turning on the one closer

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.920 
just now and turning on the one closer
to<00:03:17.140> the<00:03:17.380> center<00:03:17.710> of<00:03:17.830> the<00:03:17.980> two<00:03:18.130> pickups<00:03:18.570> and<00:03:19.570> it

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
to the center of the two pickups and it

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:31.690 
to the center of the two pickups and it
should<00:03:20.200> be<00:03:20.320> a<00:03:20.350> little<00:03:20.620> bit<00:03:20.770> fuller<00:03:20.950> sounding

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.280 

okay<00:03:32.700> now<00:03:33.180> between<00:03:33.540> those<00:03:33.780> two<00:03:34.670> maybe<00:03:35.670> uh<00:03:36.290> you

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
okay now between those two maybe uh you

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.569 
okay now between those two maybe uh you
know<00:03:37.379> all<00:03:37.500> you<00:03:37.680> guys<00:03:37.709> with<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.129> real<00:03:38.280> sharp

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
know all you guys with the real sharp

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.580 
know all you guys with the real sharp
studio<00:03:38.939> ears<00:03:39.269> can<00:03:39.450> hear<00:03:39.480> big<00:03:39.840> differences<00:03:40.379> I

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
studio ears can hear big differences I

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.199 
studio ears can hear big differences I
hear<00:03:40.829> minor<00:03:41.010> differences

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
hear minor differences

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.940 
hear minor differences
basically<00:03:42.780> I<00:03:42.900> wouldn't<00:03:43.170> hear<00:03:43.290> anything<00:03:43.560> if<00:03:43.829> it

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
basically I wouldn't hear anything if it

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.809 
basically I wouldn't hear anything if it
weren't<00:03:44.159> for<00:03:44.189> the<00:03:44.370> low-end<00:03:44.790> in<00:03:45.689> the<00:03:45.840> pickups

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
weren't for the low-end in the pickups

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.009 
weren't for the low-end in the pickups
as<00:03:47.819> far<00:03:48.060> as<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.299> difference<00:03:48.629> in<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.870> two

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
as far as the difference in the two

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.530 
as far as the difference in the two
coils<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:50.010> I<00:03:50.519> know<00:03:50.579> that<00:03:50.909> that's<00:03:51.180> going<00:03:51.360> to<00:03:51.420> be

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
coils and I know that that's going to be

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.850 
coils and I know that that's going to be
affected<00:03:51.959> by<00:03:52.110> the<00:03:52.280> string<00:03:53.280> sway<00:03:53.989> so<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.530> area

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
affected by the string sway so the area

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.800 
affected by the string sway so the area
between<00:03:56.040> two<00:03:56.519> pickups<00:03:56.940> is<00:03:57.180> gonna<00:03:57.420> have<00:03:57.569> a<00:03:57.599> lot

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
between two pickups is gonna have a lot

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.030 
between two pickups is gonna have a lot
of<00:03:58.049> the<00:03:58.579> spring<00:03:59.579> the<00:03:59.879> string<00:04:00.590> swaying<00:04:01.590> so

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
of the spring the string swaying so

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.349 
of the spring the string swaying so
you're<00:04:02.159> going<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:02.340> get<00:04:02.489> a<00:04:02.519> lot<00:04:02.670> more<00:04:02.700> low<00:04:03.209> in

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
you're going to get a lot more low in

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.990 
you're going to get a lot more low in
frequency<00:04:03.569> response<00:04:04.200> so<00:04:05.069> whichever<00:04:05.340> coil<00:04:05.879> on

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
frequency response so whichever coil on

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.550 
frequency response so whichever coil on
your<00:04:06.150> pickups<00:04:06.510> is<00:04:06.629> closer<00:04:06.870> to<00:04:07.019> that<00:04:07.349> you're

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
your pickups is closer to that you're

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.349 
your pickups is closer to that you're
going<00:04:07.680> to<00:04:07.769> get<00:04:07.890> more<00:04:08.010> low-end<00:04:08.220> and<00:04:08.940> that's<00:04:09.209> the

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
going to get more low-end and that's the

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.920 
going to get more low-end and that's the
only<00:04:09.629> way<00:04:09.750> I<00:04:09.780> can<00:04:09.989> tell<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:10.409> difference<00:04:11.930> next

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
only way I can tell the difference next

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.410 
only way I can tell the difference next
we<00:04:13.079> have<00:04:13.290> parallel<00:04:13.799> and<00:04:14.280> parallel<00:04:14.879> you<00:04:15.060> get<00:04:15.269> by

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
we have parallel and parallel you get by

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.420 
we have parallel and parallel you get by
pushing<00:04:15.720> each<00:04:16.019> switch<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.709> switch<00:04:16.829> closest

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
pushing each switch the switch closest

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.520 
pushing each switch the switch closest
to<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:17.669> neck<00:04:17.850> towards<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.329> neck<00:04:18.539> and<00:04:18.840> the

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
to the neck towards the neck and the

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.560 
to the neck towards the neck and the
switch<00:04:19.769> closest<00:04:20.250> to<00:04:20.430> the<00:04:20.519> bridge<00:04:20.760> towards<00:04:21.449> the

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
switch closest to the bridge towards the

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.360 
switch closest to the bridge towards the
bridge<00:04:21.780> so<00:04:22.770> they<00:04:22.979> go<00:04:23.190> this<00:04:23.820> way<00:04:24.440> now<00:04:25.440> that's

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
bridge so they go this way now that's

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:37.780 
bridge so they go this way now that's
parallel<00:04:26.910> and<00:04:27.180> it'll<00:04:27.900> be<00:04:28.020> a<00:04:28.050> thinner<00:04:28.350> sound

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.910 

okay<00:04:40.690> now<00:04:41.690> when<00:04:41.900> you<00:04:42.020> go<00:04:42.140> to<00:04:42.170> the<00:04:42.410> parallel

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
okay now when you go to the parallel

00:04:42.920 --> 00:05:01.950 
okay now when you go to the parallel
compared<00:04:43.580> to<00:04:43.850> the<00:04:44.540> normal<00:04:44.750> humbucking

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.960 

now<00:05:02.440> as<00:05:02.590> you<00:05:02.740> can<00:05:02.860> hear<00:05:03.100> there's<00:05:03.340> a<00:05:03.400> big<00:05:03.699> big

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
now as you can hear there's a big big

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.939 
now as you can hear there's a big big
difference<00:05:04.270> in<00:05:04.660> volume<00:05:04.810> output<00:05:05.169> there<00:05:05.590> I<00:05:05.620> have

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949 
difference in volume output there I have

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:07.710 
difference in volume output there I have
not<00:05:06.160> touched<00:05:06.430> anything<00:05:06.790> on<00:05:07.030> volumes

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
not touched anything on volumes

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.860 
not touched anything on volumes
I<00:05:07.750> have<00:05:08.199> no<00:05:08.410> pedals<00:05:08.770> on<00:05:08.979> the<00:05:09.009> floor<00:05:09.340> to<00:05:10.120> to<00:05:10.660> cut

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
I have no pedals on the floor to to cut

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.249 
I have no pedals on the floor to to cut
my<00:05:11.020> volume<00:05:11.520> that<00:05:12.520> is<00:05:12.759> strictly<00:05:13.240> what<00:05:13.930> happens

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:14.259 
my volume that is strictly what happens

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:16.800 
my volume that is strictly what happens
when<00:05:14.380> you<00:05:14.500> go<00:05:14.560> to<00:05:14.680> parallel<00:05:15.039> mode<00:05:15.600> it<00:05:16.600> has<00:05:16.780> a

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
when you go to parallel mode it has a

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.930 
when you go to parallel mode it has a
single<00:05:17.229> coil<00:05:17.410> sound<00:05:17.830> I'm<00:05:18.220> not<00:05:18.490> kind<00:05:18.820> of

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
single coil sound I'm not kind of

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.249 
single coil sound I'm not kind of
wondering<00:05:19.210> if<00:05:19.270> it's<00:05:19.389> not<00:05:19.509> more<00:05:19.660> of<00:05:19.690> a<00:05:19.780> p90

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:20.259 
wondering if it's not more of a p90

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:22.200 
wondering if it's not more of a p90
sound<00:05:20.500> but<00:05:21.070> I<00:05:21.100> think<00:05:21.310> p90s<00:05:21.820> might<00:05:21.940> even<00:05:22.090> be

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
sound but I think p90s might even be

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.499 
sound but I think p90s might even be
hotter

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:22.509 
hotter

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:27.990 
hotter
yeah<00:05:22.750> so<00:05:25.289> I'd<00:05:26.289> like<00:05:26.530> the<00:05:27.039> parallel<00:05:27.460> mode<00:05:27.699> on

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
yeah so I'd like the parallel mode on

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.090 
yeah so I'd like the parallel mode on
the<00:05:28.389> bridge<00:05:28.600> or<00:05:28.990> on<00:05:29.050> the<00:05:29.410> neck<00:05:29.590> pickup<00:05:29.919> but<00:05:30.039> I

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
the bridge or on the neck pickup but I

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.499 
the bridge or on the neck pickup but I
don't<00:05:30.340> really<00:05:30.490> like<00:05:30.729> it<00:05:30.880> so<00:05:31.000> much<00:05:31.210> in<00:05:31.419> the

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:31.509 
don't really like it so much in the

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:35.219 
don't really like it so much in the
treble<00:05:31.720> position<00:05:32.880> personally<00:05:33.880> but<00:05:34.510> to<00:05:34.810> each

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
treble position personally but to each

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:37.110 
treble position personally but to each
his<00:05:35.260> own<00:05:35.560> right<00:05:35.860> that's<00:05:36.400> why<00:05:36.520> we<00:05:36.669> have<00:05:36.789> triple

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
his own right that's why we have triple

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.939 
his own right that's why we have triple
shots<00:05:37.330> so<00:05:37.510> we<00:05:37.600> can<00:05:37.750> get<00:05:37.900> off<00:05:38.020> four<00:05:38.350> tones<00:05:38.680> out

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:38.949 
shots so we can get off four tones out

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.659 
shots so we can get off four tones out
of<00:05:39.010> one<00:05:39.360> pickup<00:05:40.360> and<00:05:40.810> used<00:05:41.740> in<00:05:41.979> combination

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
of one pickup and used in combination

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:44.580 
of one pickup and used in combination
with<00:05:42.699> two<00:05:43.030> of<00:05:43.180> them<00:05:43.330> like<00:05:43.510> I<00:05:43.660> have<00:05:43.810> here<00:05:44.199> that

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
with two of them like I have here that

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.200 
with two of them like I have here that
gives<00:05:44.770> you<00:05:44.889> what<00:05:45.100> 16<00:05:45.669> different<00:05:45.910> combinations

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
gives you what 16 different combinations

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.680 
gives you what 16 different combinations
I<00:05:46.750> think<00:05:46.960> I<00:05:47.080> counted<00:05:47.669> of<00:05:48.669> different<00:05:49.389> tonal

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
I think I counted of different tonal

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.430 
I think I counted of different tonal
qualities<00:05:50.199> plus<00:05:50.560> I<00:05:50.710> got<00:05:50.830> a<00:05:50.860> PI<00:05:51.100> zone<00:05:51.370> here

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
qualities plus I got a PI zone here

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.050 
qualities plus I got a PI zone here

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
habit there you know this is a nice

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.029 
habit there you know this is a nice
guitar<00:06:03.580> for<00:06:03.970> this<00:06:04.150> it<00:06:04.630> I<00:06:05.110> can<00:06:05.500> get<00:06:05.650> all<00:06:05.800> kinds

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:06.039 
guitar for this it I can get all kinds

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:07.710 
guitar for this it I can get all kinds
of<00:06:06.099> sounds<00:06:06.310> and<00:06:06.669> I<00:06:07.120> can<00:06:07.300> really<00:06:07.479> hear<00:06:07.690> the

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
of sounds and I can really hear the

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.360 
of sounds and I can really hear the
differences<00:06:08.260> because<00:06:08.710> it's<00:06:08.889> I<00:06:09.010> guess<00:06:09.190> because

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
differences because it's I guess because

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.120 
differences because it's I guess because
it's<00:06:09.639> hollow<00:06:09.910> body<00:06:10.229> I<00:06:11.229> don't<00:06:11.590> know<00:06:11.860> if<00:06:12.010> the

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
it's hollow body I don't know if the

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.159 
it's hollow body I don't know if the
differences<00:06:12.520> will<00:06:12.669> be<00:06:12.699> as<00:06:12.940> strong<00:06:13.330> in<00:06:13.720> a<00:06:13.810> solid

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:14.169 
differences will be as strong in a solid

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:15.659 
differences will be as strong in a solid
body<00:06:14.349> or<00:06:14.560> not<00:06:14.680> I<00:06:14.740> would<00:06:14.979> think<00:06:15.280> that<00:06:15.340> they

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:15.669 
body or not I would think that they

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:19.920 
body or not I would think that they
would<00:06:15.910> and<00:06:16.840> even<00:06:17.710> make<00:06:17.860> them<00:06:18.010> more<00:06:18.400> so<00:06:18.659> but<00:06:19.659> I

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
would and even make them more so but I

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.529 
would and even make them more so but I
only<00:06:20.320> have<00:06:20.590> it<00:06:20.800> tried<00:06:21.310> out<00:06:21.490> on<00:06:21.520> this<00:06:21.880> guitar<00:06:22.270> I

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:22.539 
only have it tried out on this guitar I

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:26.070 
only have it tried out on this guitar I
do<00:06:22.750> have<00:06:23.139> a<00:06:23.520> sector<00:06:24.520> c1<00:06:25.060> there<00:06:25.539> goes<00:06:25.690> my<00:06:25.840> phone

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 
do have a sector c1 there goes my phone

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.659 
do have a sector c1 there goes my phone
in<00:06:26.199> my<00:06:26.229> pocket<00:06:26.500> this<00:06:26.919> lets<00:06:27.159> you<00:06:27.310> list<00:06:27.550> of<00:06:27.820> that
