00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.490
 Puerto Rican prospects that carries six 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.970
 years without losing and 17 victories 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.369
 consecutives óigame gamalier has the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.980

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.380
 Mayweather Senior 2 on the beautiful front 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.449
 the Olympic double gold Lomachenko and 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.190
 current world champion as you see this 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.410
 opportunity and mariel in your career 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.570
 well this I see it as a blessing 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.820
 of God truly because they are many 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.979
 those who have billboard experience but 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.489
 I have truly blessed that fight 

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:48.870
 and although most people say 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.690
 is against I have against the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.100
 forecasts tell me I know god god 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.019
 it's worth the victory they're preparing 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.909
 very strong for the fight good because the 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.790
 fight is being negotiated first the 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:02.100
 fight with walter nicolás walter the 126 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.170
 here the Jamaican but suddenly 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.930
 something happened to me they called me like at 4 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.460
 this one looks at the fight that has to 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.050
 lose mandatorily mind the most 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.690
 and you changed to May 2 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:21.750
 and that was a god blessing because 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:23.160
 there was already big so big when so 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.630
 soon possible 'melar in the opportunity 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.190
 but it is something in the hand of Jesus Christ and 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.950
 If I am given the opportunity, then I will pay 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.230
 is ready enough towards las vegas where 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.790
 many people do not know 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.640
 that you started your professional career 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.920
 there 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.260
 is the prodigal son returns to the scholarships 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.170
 yes truly if I lived around 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.570
 from seven months to nine months I already made two 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.210
 fights back in the past and I met several 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.540
 people in the snag and this return what 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.460
 we see that you are going to achieve what is not 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.320
 could not achieve in the past not like this 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.910
 to be something tremendous this many years 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.130
 waiting for the opportunity so imagine a 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.070
 event so big that the whole world what 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.450
 come and for the cco of the world belt already 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.680
 I do not feel really well 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.259
 proud and grateful to God 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.869
 because I tell myself a great opportunity that 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.489
 A lot may have other names 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.190
 high that they are heard more than them 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.840
 they did not have this privilege and I 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.830
 banque intuited grateful of God for 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.230
 that opportunity 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.610
 this is one a great privilege and that 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.620
 we wanted the opportunity too 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.690
 gamaliel I am now with champions 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.950
 worldwide but not this level of 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.570
 this fight behind pérez considers the 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.070
 problematic of boxing history that 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.540
 nothing else that has been paid and arrived 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.250
 service would be sold the full chair 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.650
 they were given the seats 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.900
 It gives me joy to talk to champions with 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:41.290
 a name of god is different because 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:43.850
 parameters like the missionary we are in 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.070
 that screen with the whole world 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.600
 billions are going to see it and I'm super 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.209
 happy and that is that I take care of myself 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.540
 months seems that space that I do not 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.540
 I deserve
