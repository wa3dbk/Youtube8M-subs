waiting<00:00:22.250> for<00:00:22.280> at<00:00:22.520> this<00:00:22.640> point<00:00:22.760> is<00:00:23.119> the<00:00:23.330> actual

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
waiting for at this point is the actual

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.260 
waiting for at this point is the actual
artwork<00:00:24.020> for<00:00:24.290> the<00:00:24.350> label<00:00:24.820> everything<00:00:25.820> else<00:00:26.119> is

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
artwork for the label everything else is

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.720 
artwork for the label everything else is
one<00:00:26.360> hundred<00:00:26.570> percent<00:00:26.600> finished<00:00:27.230> though<00:00:27.439> i

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
one hundred percent finished though i

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.580 
one hundred percent finished though i
also<00:00:28.730> had<00:00:29.060> a<00:00:29.090> personal<00:00:29.570> prototype<00:00:30.080> made<00:00:30.349> of

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
also had a personal prototype made of

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.229 
also had a personal prototype made of
the<00:00:30.800> game<00:00:30.980> and<00:00:31.250> it<00:00:31.400> works<00:00:31.580> perfectly<00:00:31.760> on<00:00:32.119> the

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
the game and it works perfectly on the

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.030 
the game and it works perfectly on the
real<00:00:32.419> system<00:00:32.690> so<00:00:33.140> that's<00:00:33.440> definitely<00:00:33.650> a<00:00:33.860> good

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
real system so that's definitely a good

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.729 
real system so that's definitely a good
thing<00:00:34.390> but<00:00:35.390> without<00:00:35.629> the<00:00:35.690> artwork<00:00:36.170> for<00:00:36.620> the

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
thing but without the artwork for the

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.970 
thing but without the artwork for the
standard<00:00:37.040> release<00:00:37.309> all<00:00:37.670> i<00:00:37.730> could<00:00:37.879> do<00:00:38.090> is<00:00:38.120> wait

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
standard release all i could do is wait

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.320 
standard release all i could do is wait
alright<00:00:39.980> next<00:00:40.220> question<00:00:40.340> will<00:00:41.059> it<00:00:41.180> be<00:00:41.300> a

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
box or instructions price wise i'm

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.380 
box or instructions price wise i'm
thinking<00:01:06.860> around<00:01:06.950> thirty<00:01:07.460> dollars<00:01:07.909> or<00:01:08.090> so<00:01:08.240> at

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
thinking around thirty dollars or so at

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.570 
thinking around thirty dollars or so at
this<00:01:08.570> point<00:01:08.810> i<00:01:09.110> am<00:01:09.409> writing<00:01:09.680> a<00:01:09.799> manual<00:01:10.220> for<00:01:10.250> it

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
this point i am writing a manual for it

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.880 
this point i am writing a manual for it
but<00:01:10.790> as<00:01:10.880> far<00:01:11.090> as<00:01:11.150> actual<00:01:11.630> boxes<00:01:12.110> go<00:01:12.290> probably

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
but as far as actual boxes go probably

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.850 
but as far as actual boxes go probably
not<00:01:13.479> boxes<00:01:14.479> tend<00:01:14.690> to<00:01:14.750> be<00:01:14.869> cost-prohibitive<00:01:15.350> in

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
not boxes tend to be cost-prohibitive in

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.010 
not boxes tend to be cost-prohibitive in
while<00:01:16.250> neat<00:01:16.460> collectors<00:01:16.909> items<00:01:17.270> not

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
while neat collectors items not

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.100 
while neat collectors items not
necessarily<00:01:18.590> vital<00:01:19.040> in<00:01:19.130> my<00:01:19.280> opinion<00:01:19.580> so<00:01:20.150> sorry

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
it work on a panel system yes well the

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.250 
it work on a panel system yes well the
one<00:01:28.940> thing<00:01:28.970> you<00:01:29.270> need<00:01:29.480> to<00:01:29.510> be<00:01:29.690> aware<00:01:29.930> of<00:01:29.990> though

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
one thing you need to be aware of though

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.350 
one thing you need to be aware of though
is<00:01:30.440> that<00:01:30.470> a<00:01:30.650> pal<00:01:30.950> system<00:01:31.460> runs<00:01:31.760> at<00:01:31.970> a<00:01:32.000> slower

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
is that a pal system runs at a slower

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.950 
is that a pal system runs at a slower
clock<00:01:32.630> speed<00:01:33.080> and<00:01:33.260> then<00:01:33.350> an<00:01:33.470> ntsc<00:01:34.250> system

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
clock speed and then an ntsc system

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.130 
clock speed and then an ntsc system
specifically<00:01:35.960> 56<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:37.280> speed<00:01:37.610> so<00:01:37.970> it<00:01:38.210> will<00:01:38.990> be

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
specifically 56 the speed so it will be

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.320 
specifically 56 the speed so it will be
a<00:01:39.170> slower<00:01:39.530> playing<00:01:40.280> game<00:01:40.550> so<00:01:40.910> just<00:01:41.180> be<00:01:41.300> aware

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
a slower playing game so just be aware

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.070 
a slower playing game so just be aware
of<00:01:41.510> that<00:01:42.130> alright<00:01:43.130> in<00:01:43.310> terms<00:01:44.060> of<00:01:44.390> individual

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
of that alright in terms of individual

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.220 
of that alright in terms of individual
screens<00:01:45.440> how<00:01:45.980> large<00:01:46.340> will<00:01:46.610> it<00:01:46.760> be<00:01:47.020> well<00:01:48.020> there

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230 
screens how large will it be well there

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.050 
screens how large will it be well there
are<00:01:48.350> two<00:01:48.380> main<00:01:48.860> maps<00:01:49.160> you<00:01:49.550> got<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:49.850> large

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
are two main maps you got the large

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.260 
are two main maps you got the large
fortress<00:01:50.570> area<00:01:50.930> which<00:01:51.200> consists<00:01:51.740> of<00:01:51.800> around

all right next question are there any

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.990 
all right next question are there any
perks<00:02:58.940> for<00:02:59.239> replayability<00:03:00.370> well<00:03:01.370> there<00:03:01.820> are

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
perks for replayability well there are

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.640 
perks for replayability well there are
higher<00:03:02.180> difficulty<00:03:02.870> settings<00:03:03.230> where<00:03:03.440> you<00:03:03.500> get

notepad plus plus for writing the code I

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.449 
notepad plus plus for writing the code I
even<00:04:17.000> made<00:04:17.150> a<00:04:17.209> custom<00:04:18.140> syntax<00:04:18.950> highlighter
