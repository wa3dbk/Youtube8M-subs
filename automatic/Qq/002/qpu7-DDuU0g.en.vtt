00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.230
5 Million Bocachicos in a Wetland

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.590
Cesar Department
Chimichagua Municipality - Colombia

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.920
(narrator) Environmental, economic and social variables are being studied at 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.960
Colombia’s biggest continental wetland, the Zapatosa Wetland.  

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.160
Zapatosa Wetland

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.410
This ecosystem is spread between the Cesar and Magdalena departments,

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.890
and 5 municipalities;  Chimichagua, Tamalameque,  

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.990
El Banco, Chiriguaná y Curumaní. Here, 150 thousand people live

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.090
and 170 thousand heads of cattle graze.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.200
The critical environmental situation taking place in the eco region of Zapatosa and in the center of the Cesar department

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.250
is caused by a variety of reasons such as poverty, mining,

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.510
a low level of education of its population, and geographic isolation. 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.560
External factors, such as weather changes,

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.860
affect the rain cycle and rising waters in the Magdalena River basin.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.970
This accentuates periods of flooding and drought

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.000
in the wetlands of the lower Magdalena.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.230
(traditional music)

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.200
(man) We’re here in the municipality of Chimichagua, at the beautiful beaches

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.220
where Guillermo Cubillos’ canoe lies sleeping.  

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.250
A charming municipality with a natural landscape gifted by God.   

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.780
It is part of the department of Cesar’s four municipalities, which are Tamalameque, Chiriguaná and Curumaní,

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.060
as well as El Banco located in the department of Magdalena. These surround the beautiful

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.130
wetland of Zapatosa, the first freshwater source of Colombia. 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.150
(traditional music)

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.460
(narrator) Traditionally, the method most commonly used was the throw net,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.630
but it has been displaced by stationary nets such as the trammel,

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.960
chinchorra and chinchorro nets.  

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:15.040
In the wetlands, fishing practices such as trawling or gill net fishing have always been prohibited,

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.340
yet fishermen paid no attention

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.490
and have continued to fish illegally.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.000
This over-exploitation is practiced every day of the year,

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.120
since fishermen set trammel nets of up to two thousand meters long,

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.170
taking it out only for brief moments in order to collect their catch. 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.200
The problem, besides over-exploitation,

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.260
lies in the capturing of fish that have not yet reached their maturity

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.280
to be consumed and yet the alevins die entangled in the nets.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.400
Species of low commercial value such as the coroncoro, 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.660
is one of several that have been exterminated for being thrown out by fisherman

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.900
due to their low commercial value.  This is a contradiction, since undernourishment

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.900
in this population is a common reality.  

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.360
(fishermen speak in loud voices)

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.870
Happy because you are here today in the Saloa district. 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.900
You showed concern with the issue, with what we are living

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.390
here in this district, but thanks to you, things are improving

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.600
slowly, and we too

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.640
have begun educating one another.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.990
We have been bringing a kind of teaching to many people,

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.020
and so we have been addressing this issue calmly, 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.150
because this was heading, we were heading down the wrong path. 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.540
And, well, we feel happy about this new project that we

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.760
have been doing at this present time, such as the repopulation of alevins

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.920
by introducing 5 million 150 thousand of them, so that we can,

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.950
in the near future, have more fish here in the wetland, 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.990
not just here in Saloa. Now we thank the almighty,

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.600
that we can see, we can forge ahead with this association,

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.690
this association that has been fighting,

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.760
trying hard, loyal to this wetland,

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.860
battling. I too have always been one of

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.860
those who have accompanied this association.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:47.080
(sound of a motorboat over the water)

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.510
(narrator) The TVAgro channel visited the Zapatosa Wetland in order to understand 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:05.590
the social and environmental problem up-close and was met with a big surprise:

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:11.600
The repopulation of the wetland with more than 5 million bocachico alevins

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.020
in an effort to conserve this species in this part of the country,

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.110
but also to give the fisherman another chance to make a living,

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.480
thus creating jobs as well as helping the ecosystem to recover. 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.610
To achieve this, the government is training all the fisherman of the area,

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.740
especially those who fish using illegal methods.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.780
(sound of the wind)

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.150
It is important to stress that it was the fishermen themselves who got together to form groups 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:55.270
in order to take care of and sustain the alevin populations until they are ready to be fished.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:01.280
They patrol the wetland day and night, protecting their alevins from illegal traps. 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.290
Some problems still arise between fishermen, however,

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.340
since some refuse to remove their trammel nets from the water.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.830
(man) Well, we have organized ourselves into a community group

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.330
with the objective of protecting our wetland.  How do we do it?  

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.580
Well, the entire community, approximately 180 people,

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.930
elaborated 6 groups to monitor the different checkpoints in the wetland. 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:34.940
How do we do it? Well, each night we leave to protect that area,

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.410
that wetland. What for? 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.560
So that the people who fish with illegal nets

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.610
do not get away with it and ruin our wetland.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:52.130
(sound of the wind and water)
