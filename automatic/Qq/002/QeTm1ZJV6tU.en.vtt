00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 what a rush today in the klanghaus 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.690
 on the ship my three press conference 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.950
 by tui cruises yes and these 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.990
 attention is only a woman 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.790
 namely godmother the rest fischer 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.740
 next to it had to do it 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.059
 krisses boss richard bird and captain 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.490
 claudio hard 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.240
 yes and helene even said something but 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.470
 hear even I was then very flattened 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.240
 I like the ship so well 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.920
 I 'm not so nice 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.980
 I already knew it is one 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:33.570
 great project but i was easy 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.610
 Yesterday even more surprised me 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.070
 actually put a hand on it 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.489
 There is one somewhere on the ship 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.050
 weld from me and I'm on it 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.629
 also a bit proud because the first one 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.870
 times that shit work 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.860
 have done and I have a lot of fun 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:55.140
 I can give them the job 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.480
 it is understandable for me really 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.820
 A special honor a ship baptizes you 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.309
 not all days and I already have that 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.170
 turbo when i was in rough construction I have 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.740
 already noticed what it does to a 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.409
 So one, I'm not like that myself 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.290
 Cruise experience that I have mine 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.570
 first cruise made 2006 came to me 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.800
 but imagine how is for one 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.250
 normal passengers 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.710
 Passing normally just how nice it is 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.240
 is to make its travel, the 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.850
 so you on this ship anyway 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.080
 yesterday where the more aware as 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.400
 It must be great if you just stay here 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.110
 One week or two weeks 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.690
 if you have the luxury here on this 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.400
 ship to spend a holiday 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.470
 then it is just a very fine one 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.710
 thing if you just wonderful here 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.510
 one is supported one sees one can 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.160
 Just travel to faraway countries without yourself 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.540
 to make the hotel change 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.490
 someone who maybe a bit scared 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.600
 has for exploration itself 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.520
 to tackle something similar 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.770
 you will be completely accompanied 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.760
 does not need because you need 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.600
 no worries about the 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.520
 language problems 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.770

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.500
 canceled and yes I'm just not 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.180
 More is proud that I have this today 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.070
 ship may baptize and that may result 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.130
 a bit too far to go 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:16.220
 history then contribute and have 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.220
