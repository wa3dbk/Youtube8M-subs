00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
trees and found a few got her back out

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.639 
trees and found a few got her back out
from<00:00:59.520> New<00:00:59.640> York<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.210> let<00:01:00.930> her<00:01:01.020> choose<00:01:01.379> which

so she stands on this tree trunk which
has<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.570> markings<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:11.520> beetle

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
has the markings in it of the beetle

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.090 
has the markings in it of the beetle
trails<00:01:12.270> which<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.930> probably<00:01:13.229> what<00:01:13.590> killed<00:01:13.860> it

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
trails which is probably what killed it

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.940 
trails which is probably what killed it
so<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.850> have<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.330> kind<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.720> memento<00:01:16.350> mori<00:01:16.380> of
