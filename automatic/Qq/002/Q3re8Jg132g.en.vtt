00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
kind of some reference points so I've

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.069 
kind of some reference points so I've
got<00:00:49.550> the<00:00:49.579> ipad<00:00:50.000> mini<00:00:50.030> on<00:00:50.449> top<00:00:50.690> and<00:00:50.870> then<00:00:50.989> my

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
got the ipad mini on top and then my

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.110 
got the ipad mini on top and then my

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
iphone 5 so you can kind of see the

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.479 
iphone 5 so you can kind of see the
comparison<00:00:53.480> on<00:00:53.960> size<00:00:54.379> differences<00:00:54.980> and<00:00:55.280> stuff

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
comparison on size differences and stuff

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.579 
comparison on size differences and stuff
like<00:00:55.609> that<00:00:55.670> and<00:00:56.510> how<00:00:56.929> much<00:00:57.079> it<00:00:57.260> will<00:00:57.320> differ

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
like that and how much it will differ

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:00.399 
like that and how much it will differ
but<00:00:58.190> wait<00:00:58.429> again<00:00:58.789> it's<00:00:59.059> over<00:00:59.749> a<00:00:59.780> pound<00:01:00.019> so<00:01:00.289> you

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409 
but wait again it's over a pound so you

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:02.079

version<00:01:18.860> which<00:01:19.040> is<00:01:19.580> a<00:01:19.610> little<00:01:19.820> bit

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
version which is a little bit

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.670 
version which is a little bit
disappointing<00:01:20.540> and<00:01:20.660> then<00:01:21.110> you've<00:01:21.290> got<00:01:21.500> that

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
disappointing and then you've got that

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.130 
disappointing and then you've got that
lightning<00:01:22.360> connector<00:01:23.360> on<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:23.570> bottom<00:01:23.840> so

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
lightning connector on the bottom so

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.070 
lightning connector on the bottom so
I've<00:01:24.260> got<00:01:24.410> my<00:01:24.460> 3rd<00:01:25.460> gen<00:01:25.730> on<00:01:25.940> the<00:01:26.120> left<00:01:26.360> and<00:01:26.660> my

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
I've got my 3rd gen on the left and my

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.540 
I've got my 3rd gen on the left and my
4th<00:01:27.410> gen<00:01:27.560> on<00:01:27.680> the<00:01:27.740> right<00:01:27.890> you<00:01:28.040> can<00:01:28.220> see<00:01:28.250> it's

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
4th gen on the right you can see it's

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.310 
4th gen on the right you can see it's
gone<00:01:28.790> from<00:01:28.910> a<00:01:29.060> 30-pin<00:01:29.420> to<00:01:29.600> a<00:01:29.630> lightning<00:01:29.990> cable

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
gone from a 30-pin to a lightning cable

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.900 
gone from a 30-pin to a lightning cable
that's<00:01:30.710> honestly<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.220> biggest<00:01:31.490> change

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
that's honestly the biggest change

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.690 
that's honestly the biggest change
externally<00:01:32.870> that<00:01:33.020> you'll<00:01:33.170> see<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:34.010> other<00:01:34.220> big

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
externally that you'll see the other big
