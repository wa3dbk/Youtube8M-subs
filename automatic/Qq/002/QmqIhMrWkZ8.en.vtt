00:00:01.849 --> 00:00:06.990
 Factbox allows in combination with scan systems of perfect should 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.400
 Distortion free reproductions of bound templates 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:17.599
 Pocketbook is able to capture the image and 3d data simultaneously 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.599
 offset 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:25.849
 At the same time as the image and text are set, the Perfect Pressure Chamber captures Art 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.849
 the third dimension of the template 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.370
 For the user, the scan process is just as comfortable and 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.370
 fast as inhabited by every inch scanner 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.280
 The determined data are calculated into a 3d-model of the template 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.990
 Based on this, the following measures are automatically executed 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.290
 Recognition of the book middle of the so-called book is wrong 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.810
 Detection of foreign objects such as fingers some notes and finite 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.460
 realize that book Schmitz ends so the pages 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.080
 Determining the outer edge of the page 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.230
 Aligning and aligning the pages can be the largest 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.230
 free actual pages 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.130
 on the basis of the relapse, the picture is moved straight 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.720
 StÃ¶hr elements within the page presentation become the fingers 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.720
 removed and listed by interpolation 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.110
 the 3d model is smoothed out this is the so-called Buchwald Cents achievement 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.720
 Finally, the now two-dimensional image in the two sides 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.270
 separated 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.630
 it would come and all these processing steps run at the same time 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.700
 and are not perceived by the user
