00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
right okay okay I can see how this would

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.930 
right okay okay I can see how this would
work<00:02:18.850> your<00:02:19.850> seat<00:02:20.209> fits<00:02:20.510> very<00:02:20.780> nicely<00:02:21.019> in<00:02:21.410> there

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
work your seat fits very nicely in there

work your seat fits very nicely in there
let's<00:02:22.940> go<00:02:23.090> ahead<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.269> get<00:02:23.390> a<00:02:23.450> closer<00:02:23.720> angle

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
let's go ahead and get a closer angle

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.160 
let's go ahead and get a closer angle
yeah<00:02:24.709> let's<00:02:24.860> see<00:02:25.069> a<00:02:25.099> straps<00:02:25.970> fit<00:02:26.569> right<00:02:27.140> over

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
yeah let's see a straps fit right over

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.630 
yeah let's see a straps fit right over
where<00:02:27.739> the<00:02:27.769> screen<00:02:28.959> starts<00:02:30.099> really<00:02:31.099> minimal

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
where the screen starts really minimal

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.410 
where the screen starts really minimal
minimal<00:02:32.569> loss<00:02:32.959> of<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:34.130> screen<00:02:34.459> viewing<00:02:35.090> wise

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
minimal loss of the screen viewing wise

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.470 
minimal loss of the screen viewing wise
I<00:02:35.720> don't<00:02:36.069> um<00:02:37.069> basically<00:02:37.819> what<00:02:38.090> I'm<00:02:38.150> saying<00:02:38.239> is

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
I don't um basically what I'm saying is

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.699 
I don't um basically what I'm saying is
the<00:02:38.569> straps<00:02:38.840> don't<00:02:39.080> really<00:02:39.260> get<00:02:39.380> in<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.560> way

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
the straps don't really get in the way

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.530 
the straps don't really get in the way
where<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.099> screen<00:02:40.370> starts<00:02:40.700> got<00:02:41.299> full<00:02:41.510> access

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
where the screen starts got full access

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.750 
where the screen starts got full access
to<00:02:41.959> all<00:02:42.200> buttons<00:02:42.320> are<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.310> only<00:02:43.430> thing<00:02:43.640> I

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
to all buttons are the only thing I

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.520 
to all buttons are the only thing I
would<00:02:43.910> see<00:02:44.120> that's<00:02:44.660> really<00:02:45.019> hard<00:02:45.260> is

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
would see that's really hard is

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.199 
would see that's really hard is
accessing<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.220> shoulder<00:02:46.579> buttons<00:02:46.880> from<00:02:47.000> this

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
accessing the shoulder buttons from this

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.750 
accessing the shoulder buttons from this
case<00:02:47.620> more<00:02:48.620> or<00:02:48.739> less<00:02:48.799> I<00:02:49.070> think<00:02:49.340> when<00:02:49.489> you<00:02:49.609> have

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
case more or less I think when you have

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.580 
case more or less I think when you have
a<00:02:49.790> PS<00:02:50.150> Vita<00:02:50.420> in<00:02:50.600> the<00:02:50.720> case<00:02:50.930> you're<00:02:51.109> not<00:02:51.230> worried

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
a PS Vita in the case you're not worried

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.440 
a PS Vita in the case you're not worried
about<00:02:51.650> accessibility<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.670> play<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:53.000> system

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
about accessibility to play the system

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.949 
about accessibility to play the system
like<00:02:54.019> you're<00:02:54.170> mainly<00:02:54.410> just<00:02:55.340> worry<00:02:55.640> about

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
like you're mainly just worry about

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.979 
like you're mainly just worry about
carrying<00:02:56.959> the<00:02:57.829> system<00:02:58.220> around<00:02:58.430> hence

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
carrying the system around hence

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.080 
carrying the system around hence
carrying<00:02:59.989> case<00:03:00.319> let's<00:03:01.310> go<00:03:01.459> ahead<00:03:01.609> and<00:03:01.790> see

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
carrying case let's go ahead and see

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.580 
carrying case let's go ahead and see
what<00:03:02.450> it<00:03:02.600> looks<00:03:02.720> like<00:03:02.870> when<00:03:03.019> you<00:03:03.109> put<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.350> game

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
what it looks like when you put the game

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.759 
what it looks like when you put the game
inside<00:03:04.549> one<00:03:04.700> of<00:03:04.760> these<00:03:04.880> little<00:03:05.590> brood<00:03:06.590> Lee

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
inside one of these little brood Lee

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:12.539 
inside one of these little brood Lee
made<00:03:07.069> slots<00:03:09.910> see<00:03:10.910> just<00:03:11.150> slip<00:03:11.720> right<00:03:11.750> in<00:03:12.109> there

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
made slots see just slip right in there

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.180

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
yeah not a lot of coverage here it just

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.170 
yeah not a lot of coverage here it just
slips<00:03:16.430> right<00:03:16.639> in<00:03:16.700> and<00:03:17.889> next<00:03:19.000> let's<00:03:20.000> go<00:03:20.150> ahead

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
slips right in and next let's go ahead

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.960 
slips right in and next let's go ahead
and<00:03:20.389> see<00:03:20.540> how<00:03:20.810> this<00:03:20.959> thing<00:03:21.230> fits<00:03:21.500> in<00:03:21.620> there<00:03:21.970> all

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
right just like that not really made for

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.030 
right just like that not really made for
his<00:03:26.209> head<00:03:26.480> place<00:03:26.810> but<00:03:27.139> I<00:03:27.170> feel<00:03:27.440> like<00:03:27.560> if<00:03:27.739> we<00:03:27.859> put

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
his head place but I feel like if we put

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.210 
his head place but I feel like if we put
this<00:03:28.190> anywhere<00:03:28.760> else<00:03:29.239> inside<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.810> case<00:03:30.220> it

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
this anywhere else inside the case it

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.259 
this anywhere else inside the case it
gets<00:03:31.430> lost<00:03:31.790> in<00:03:32.120> a<00:03:32.239> sea<00:03:32.510> of<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:33.530> color<00:03:33.799> black

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
gets lost in a sea of the color black

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.270 
gets lost in a sea of the color black
because<00:03:35.269> I<00:03:35.630> can't<00:03:36.530> see<00:03:36.680> this<00:03:36.799> thing<00:03:36.980> in<00:03:37.040> there

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280
