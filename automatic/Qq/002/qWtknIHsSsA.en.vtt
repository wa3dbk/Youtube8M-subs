non-standard height walls the four-foot
product<00:02:29.480> is<00:02:29.630> generally<00:02:30.170> used<00:02:30.440> here<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:32.150> first

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
product is generally used here the first

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.600 
product is generally used here the first
step<00:02:32.690> is<00:02:32.930> to<00:02:33.110> cut<00:02:33.290> lengths<00:02:33.740> of<00:02:33.860> insulation<00:02:34.490> a

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
step is to cut lengths of insulation a

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.550 
step is to cut lengths of insulation a
few<00:02:34.850> inches<00:02:35.180> longer<00:02:35.570> than<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:36.020> height<00:02:36.230> of<00:02:36.440> the

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
few inches longer than the height of the

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.020 
few inches longer than the height of the
walls<00:02:38.920> fit<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.040> blankets<00:02:40.460> tightly<00:02:40.880> together

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
walls fit the blankets tightly together

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.080 
walls fit the blankets tightly together
then<00:02:41.990> use<00:02:42.230> 3-inch<00:02:42.770> white<00:02:43.010> vinyl<00:02:43.370> patch<00:02:43.730> tape

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
then use 3-inch white vinyl patch tape

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.060 
then use 3-inch white vinyl patch tape
to<00:02:44.300> seal<00:02:44.570> the<00:02:44.600> seams<00:02:45.050> along<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:45.590> full<00:02:45.860> length

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
to seal the seams along the full length

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.090 
to seal the seams along the full length
of<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.370> insulation<00:02:46.850> also<00:02:47.810> use<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.710> tape<00:02:48.890> to

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
of the insulation also use the tape to

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.190 
of the insulation also use the tape to
seal<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.520> insulation<00:02:50.120> around<00:02:50.240> doors<00:02:50.840> or

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
seal the insulation around doors or
