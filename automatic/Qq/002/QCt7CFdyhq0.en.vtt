00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.419
 and very good everyone I'm terry and today I 

00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:06.399
 I will teach how to get the frame 

00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:08.860
 that I have just put now that is 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:11.530
 the phosphorescent stone drake 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.450
 it's a saddle something easy they come towards 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.220
 infralara going forward but 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.980
 first I'm going to show you how to get 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.800
 how to come to inflate what I think 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.110
 many people know it and if not just 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.480
 there is a portal that takes you 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.030
 infralarate directly you do not have to 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.520
 do missions or anything in panda sanz in 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.219
 the kingdom so wide and in so many kingdoms 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.809
 that you have the portal is still there for the 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:38.800
 for the two 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:41.170
 Hordes is there for alliances 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.420
 it's something different, you do not forge it because 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.239
 if you saw a good way right there 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.699
 also the portals are always going to be 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:52.769
 they are always all seen from the 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.769
 beginning of eruptions nothing 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.480
 coming infra lar 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.140
 right in the temple as it is full of 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.390
 bugs I do not know why or idea because the 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.580
 panda genes sans and they gave him that 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.900
 but following this path they will see 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.540
 to the left of my screen or the 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.690

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.440
 well following up here not the dragon 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.840
 is not flying in 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.170
 they do not fly or they do not turn anything 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.900
 people who think that it rotates but good 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.870

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:32.159

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:35.270
 good strip that he throws it because it's 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.270

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.270
