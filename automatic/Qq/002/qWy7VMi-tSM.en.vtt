 recent runner-up in emirates 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.650
 Arabs united frame first of all 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.359
 thank you very much how are you nervous 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.460
 anxious about everything that has happened since 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:21.550

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.070

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.830
 So many congratulations as both

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.610
 If you have changed your life, do not 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.960
 he asked is a moment to raul too 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.850
 how much has changed them since the 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.530
 arrival because maybe when they left 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.540
 to this world cup very few knew of 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.070
 you but now you tell them frame 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.559
 pomegranates already know who you are says 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.180
 raúl budiño and of course also if you 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.370
 has changed our lives a lot but it is 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.989
 as I have been saying 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.970
 we are still the same person 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.220
 we continue being so I am still 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.620
 frame pomegranates like you tell me what 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.239
 better people did not know us or not 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.070
 He knows us but little by little we 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.960
 let's go give us people from 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.460
 costs participation in the world such 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.650
 of course you would have liked to be 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.330
 holder in all the matches did not touch you 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.780
 enter having a few minutes and up 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.820
 score a goal if not then that is no longer 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.030
 it depends so much on me the teacher decided 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.040
 well to say of the 11 that start me 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.200
 He was giving in all the 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.080
 matches between exchange I had to score 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.480
 against argentina 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.020
 It was a great pride to put a ball 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:31.390
 Argentina but well pleased that you give 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.310
 by strong port situation I imagine 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.170
 that a great experience what left them 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.660
 this participation in the world cup not by 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.190
 Of course we all wanted the title but 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.750
 having reached the final after 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.300
 of a win in the first game 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.540
 recovering from it is also worthwhile 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.940
 no yes obviously, as I say 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.970
 people maybe he did not trust anymore 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.370
 before us they said it 's a 6-1 to the 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.040
 selection is no longer going to rise and then 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:00.630
 we did not know how to superimpose on so many 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.400
 so many things and we then continue 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.140
 put in ours and obviously then 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.500
 no it's not what we all wanted but 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.899
 it is a great job especially the 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.760
 group that I leave this experience of 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.160
 have been in this world having 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.959
 then faced with selections like 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.270
 Italy as Argentina where it's your turn 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.780
 mark Brazil goal also and leave them in 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.630
 the road if not then it was 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.120
 a great pride for us to leave 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:31.860
 to teams with very big names in the 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:34.380
 on the road and then leave not to leave 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.360
 them out was not anything its 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.040
 work of the whole team now a lot is 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.540
 talks about the possibility of going up 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.390
 first team obviously you carry a 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.640
 process is not just 17 years old 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.620
 road ahead if you feel ready 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.390
 you get to say you know that you do not even go 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.550
 the 20 you go to the first team you're done 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.850
 very hurried no I feel ready 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.769
 for what comes obviously if you touch me 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.360
 be with your 17 do everything you have 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.120
 if you touch me with the 20 with first 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.700
 division I am ready and well yes 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.200
 I step through the process because in 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.030
 more experience to get better 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.890
 obviously prepared after having 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.870
 participation like the one Mexico had in 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.600
 this world champions start the promoters 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.060
 they start to love them as well as to put 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.130
 that little thorn of europe I take you to spend 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.959
 in this process that you had or after 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.170
 of the world cup you approached someone yes 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.640
 Well, it's like they talk to you a lot about 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.010
 europe but then first I would like 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.020
 consolidate making chivas and now a great 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.760
 commitment which has not the sub-17 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.890
 and already having good performances as 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.020
 long of the championship and of course to you 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.780
 you would love to be there if obviously me 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.820
 what I want, I'm waiting for you right now 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.830
 well, on the orders of Professor Ramón de 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.470
 what we will have to do in the 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.600
 liguilla the sub-17 for people who do not 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.970
 knows marco antonio granados describes 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.860
 a little football as you are in 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.900
 what position do you play etcetera of wines 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.900
 as in a frame, because I am central 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:58.080
 whole because I never give a ball 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.230
 lost then I like it because it takes advantage 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.910
 every opportunity within the area and 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.800
 I always like to score a goal 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.380
 you dream with getting to first 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.720
 division and at a certain moment I can 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.180
 travel to Europe a few moments ago you 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.160
 they asked who would you compare with? 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.990
 both the comparison if not the 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.450
 players that you could say to me 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.730
 I look a little like this to those who do 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.260
 they asked me here about chivas and 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.930
 well, when this one, which is nigris 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.970
 more or less to what I to the very like 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.580
 you would like to be like aldo 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.680
 nigris or better than aldo de nigris 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.750
 and apart you'll have it here in the first 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.670
 team does not approach you 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.070
 because you can not help much so 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.770
 obviously, he is a great player and 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.380
 I would like therefore to take advantage of 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.650
 each player both rafa marquez so much 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.900
 to saldivar so much iron you can get 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.550
 the greatest benefit and you can go doing 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.110
 a tip of all the players and 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.390
 also tell them why not here I am 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.340
 me to take that role and at some point 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.710
 play them the post if yes obviously 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.290
 now it will continue to compete 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.660
 little by little and then later to beat them 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.130
 the position they have also marked 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.600
 some message that you want to send to 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.370

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.170
