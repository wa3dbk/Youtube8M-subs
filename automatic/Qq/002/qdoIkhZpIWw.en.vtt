for Landon's hair I'm just using the

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.090 
for Landon's hair I'm just using the
mixture<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.710> leave<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:11.070> conditioner

mixed with water and I just spray it on
you<00:01:17.970> don't<00:01:18.150> want<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.420> too<00:01:18.689> wet<00:01:18.930> though<00:01:20.330> and

you don't want it too wet though and
then<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.280> either<00:01:23.520> use<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:25.040> baby<00:01:26.040> brush<00:01:26.420> or

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
then you can either use a baby brush or

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.890 
then you can either use a baby brush or

a big kids toothbrush which I kind of
like<00:01:30.960> better<00:01:31.380> because<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.549> can<00:01:32.960> its<00:01:33.960> finer

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409

and you can shape the hair more so you

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.789 
and you can shape the hair more so you
just<00:01:38.159> follow<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.759> hair<00:01:39.439> like<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.619> hair

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
just follow the hair like the hair

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.910 
just follow the hair like the hair
pattern<00:01:41.070> that's<00:01:41.520> rooted<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.710> you<00:01:43.710> can<00:01:43.799> just

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
pattern that's rooted in you can just

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.810 
pattern that's rooted in you can just
brush<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.189> down<00:01:45.259> and<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.920> have<00:01:47.070> like<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.399> swirl

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
brush it down and you have like a swirl

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
brush it down and you have like a swirl
hair<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.479> just<00:01:49.250> follow<00:01:50.250> that

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.770 

you<00:01:55.380> just<00:01:56.280> keep<00:01:56.429> going<00:01:57.140> his<00:01:58.140> hair<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.520> rooted

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
you just keep going his hair is rooted

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.340 
you just keep going his hair is rooted
like<00:02:00.780> directionally<00:02:02.689> and<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.780> pattern<00:02:04.049> as<00:02:04.319> you

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
like directionally and a pattern as you

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.900 
like directionally and a pattern as you
can<00:02:04.649> see<00:02:05.509> so<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.659> just<00:02:06.929> kind<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.200> follow<00:02:07.439> it

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
can see so you just kind of follow it

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.850 
can see so you just kind of follow it
and<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.840> good<00:02:10.410> way<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.679> define<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.730> swirl<00:02:12.150> is<00:02:12.860> if

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
and a good way to define the swirl is if

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.600 
and a good way to define the swirl is if
you<00:02:13.980> just<00:02:14.030> wet<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.239> little<00:02:15.450> bit<00:02:16.489> put<00:02:17.489> your

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
you just wet it a little bit put your

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.559 
you just wet it a little bit put your
finger<00:02:18.090> in<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.569> middle<00:02:18.870> of<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.170> swirl<00:02:19.530> and

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
finger in the middle of the swirl and

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.680 
finger in the middle of the swirl and
then<00:02:21.569> brush<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.110> hair<00:02:22.290> around<00:02:22.590> it<00:02:23.269> it<00:02:24.269> holds

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
then brush the hair around it it holds

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.479 
then brush the hair around it it holds
um<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:25.700> really<00:02:26.700> nice<00:02:27.000> shape

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.280 

so<00:02:31.939> that's<00:02:32.090> kind<00:02:32.359> of<00:02:32.420> a<00:02:32.510> good<00:02:32.659> way<00:02:32.689> to<00:02:32.870> define

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
so that's kind of a good way to define

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.589 
so that's kind of a good way to define
the<00:02:33.439> swirl<00:02:33.819> and<00:02:34.819> then<00:02:35.150> you<00:02:35.239> just<00:02:35.420> keep

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
the swirl and then you just keep

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:43.619 
the swirl and then you just keep
brushing<00:02:38.049> and<00:02:39.049> then<00:02:39.260> I<00:02:41.349> usually<00:02:42.349> put<00:02:42.829> his<00:02:43.010> hair

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
brushing and then I usually put his hair

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:48.940 
brushing and then I usually put his hair
like<00:02:44.629> in<00:02:44.780> a<00:02:44.810> little<00:02:45.079> swoop<00:02:45.469> like<00:02:45.709> this<00:02:46.599> but<00:02:47.950> you

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
like in a little swoop like this but you

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.500 
like in a little swoop like this but you
can<00:02:49.159> also<00:02:49.340> do<00:02:49.700> a<00:02:49.969> mohawk<00:02:50.510> if<00:02:50.750> you<00:02:50.900> want<00:02:52.510> which

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
can also do a mohawk if you want which

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.599 
can also do a mohawk if you want which
is<00:02:53.659> kind<00:02:53.930> of<00:02:53.989> fun<00:02:54.230> to<00:02:54.349> do<00:02:54.530> on<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:54.859> boy<00:02:55.069> reborn

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
is kind of fun to do on the boy reborn

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.199 
is kind of fun to do on the boy reborn

you would need it to be a little bit

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:05.890 
you would need it to be a little bit
wetter<00:03:00.489> and<00:03:01.489> then<00:03:01.700> you<00:03:01.819> just<00:03:02.060> take<00:03:04.599> your<00:03:05.599> baby

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.030 

and<00:03:21.880> that's<00:03:22.030> how<00:03:22.350> you<00:03:23.350> can<00:03:23.500> give<00:03:23.650> a<00:03:23.680> reborn

to make sure the hair doesn't come out

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.980 
to make sure the hair doesn't come out
most<00:04:58.250> reborns<00:04:58.760> their<00:04:59.000> hair<00:04:59.210> is<00:04:59.360> sealed<00:04:59.720> from

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
most reborns their hair is sealed from

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.580 
most reborns their hair is sealed from
the<00:05:00.080> inside<00:05:00.650> but<00:05:01.420> Landon's<00:05:02.420> because<00:05:03.320> of<00:05:03.470> the

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
the inside but Landon's because of the

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.870 
the inside but Landon's because of the
way<00:05:03.740> his<00:05:05.650> sculpt<00:05:06.650> does<00:05:06.860> he<00:05:06.980> has<00:05:07.160> like<00:05:07.340> a<00:05:07.370> shell

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
way his sculpt does he has like a shell

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.790 
way his sculpt does he has like a shell
inside<00:05:08.150> of<00:05:08.450> his<00:05:08.540> head<00:05:08.720> so<00:05:08.990> amy<00:05:09.260> was<00:05:09.500> unable<00:05:09.680> to

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
inside of his head so amy was unable to

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.520 
inside of his head so amy was unable to
seal<00:05:10.250> his<00:05:10.430> hair<00:05:10.670> but<00:05:11.630> it<00:05:11.750> stays<00:05:12.020> in<00:05:12.200> pretty

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
seal his hair but it stays in pretty

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.740 
seal his hair but it stays in pretty
well<00:05:12.770> I<00:05:12.800> think<00:05:13.040> the<00:05:13.550> shell<00:05:13.940> kind<00:05:14.240> of<00:05:14.390> holds<00:05:14.690> it

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
well I think the shell kind of holds it

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.570 
well I think the shell kind of holds it
in<00:05:14.870> place<00:05:15.020> but<00:05:15.440> I<00:05:15.470> still<00:05:15.740> have<00:05:15.890> to<00:05:16.010> be<00:05:16.130> careful

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
in place but I still have to be careful

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.630 
in place but I still have to be careful
because<00:05:16.660> his<00:05:17.660> hair<00:05:17.870> could<00:05:18.110> fall<00:05:18.320> it<00:05:18.500> but<00:05:18.920> yeah

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
because his hair could fall it but yeah

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.370 
because his hair could fall it but yeah
