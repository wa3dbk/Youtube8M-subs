feet<00:00:28.400> are<00:00:28.580> not<00:00:28.730> that<00:00:28.940> agile<00:00:29.420> as<00:00:29.600> some<00:00:29.870> drummers

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
feet are not that agile as some drummers

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.760 
feet are not that agile as some drummers
feed<00:00:30.980> so<00:00:31.340> I<00:00:31.940> always<00:00:32.480> have<00:00:32.840> to<00:00:32.990> try<00:00:33.290> to<00:00:33.350> come<00:00:33.740> up

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
feed so I always have to try to come up

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.530 
feed so I always have to try to come up
with<00:00:34.040> alternative<00:00:34.640> techniques<00:00:35.030> for<00:00:35.270> playing

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
with alternative techniques for playing

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
with alternative techniques for playing
stuff<00:00:35.810> like<00:00:35.990> this<00:00:37.300> the<00:00:38.300> way<00:00:38.480> it's<00:00:38.720> most<00:00:39.050> common

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:39.560 
stuff like this the way it's most common

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.190 
stuff like this the way it's most common
I<00:00:39.920> guess<00:00:40.190> is<00:00:40.790> right<00:00:41.239> left<00:00:41.510> right<00:00:41.660> right<00:00:42.020> left

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
I guess is right left right right left

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.530 
I guess is right left right right left
right<00:00:42.530> right<00:00:42.710> left<00:00:43.100> right<00:00:43.430> and<00:00:44.000> so<00:00:44.210> on<00:00:44.239> you

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
right right left right and so on you

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.100 
right right left right and so on you
just<00:00:44.750> play<00:00:44.960> it<00:00:44.989> like<00:00:45.320> that<00:00:46.720> which<00:00:47.720> makes<00:00:47.960> your

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
just play it like that which makes your

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.380 
just play it like that which makes your
right<00:00:48.350> foot<00:00:48.560> work<00:00:48.829> harder<00:00:49.370> or<00:00:49.550> more<00:00:49.850> than<00:00:50.239> your

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
right foot work harder or more than your

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.840 
right foot work harder or more than your
left<00:00:50.570> foot<00:00:50.780> and<00:00:50.960> I<00:00:51.920> guess<00:00:52.190> works<00:00:52.489> for<00:00:52.700> some

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
left foot and I guess works for some

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.180 
left foot and I guess works for some
people<00:00:52.880> but<00:00:53.300> for<00:00:53.360> me<00:00:53.989> it's<00:00:54.170> results<00:00:55.070> in

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
people but for me it's results in

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.930 
people but for me it's results in
inconsistent<00:00:56.149> playing<00:00:56.420> so<00:00:57.910> unevenness<00:00:58.910> and

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
inconsistent playing so unevenness and

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.500 
inconsistent playing so unevenness and
just<00:00:59.420> untighten<00:00:59.989> as'<00:01:00.079> or<00:01:00.680> whatever<00:01:01.510> another

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
just untighten as' or whatever another

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.539 
just untighten as' or whatever another
way<00:01:02.690> of<00:01:02.809> playing<00:01:02.989> it<00:01:03.200> is<00:01:03.350> by<00:01:03.590> doing<00:01:04.040> double

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
way of playing it is by doing double

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.580 
way of playing it is by doing double
strokes<00:01:04.790> on<00:01:04.940> your<00:01:04.970> right<00:01:05.180> foot<00:01:05.360> so<00:01:05.690> you'll<00:01:06.409> be

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
strokes on your right foot so you'll be

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.500 
strokes on your right foot so you'll be
playing<00:01:06.830> right<00:01:07.100> right<00:01:07.790> left<00:01:08.060> right<00:01:08.299> right

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
playing right right left right right

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.039 
playing right right left right right
left<00:01:09.340> which<00:01:10.340> is<00:01:10.549> better<00:01:10.790> for<00:01:10.940> me<00:01:11.240> but<00:01:11.540> still<00:01:11.810> in

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
left which is better for me but still in

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.570 
left which is better for me but still in
consistence<00:01:12.740> not<00:01:13.100> in<00:01:13.640> my<00:01:13.940> liking<00:01:14.420> so<00:01:15.549> today<00:01:16.549> I

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
consistence not in my liking so today I

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.700 
consistence not in my liking so today I
realize<00:01:17.299> I<00:01:17.510> could<00:01:17.690> play<00:01:17.840> it<00:01:17.990> by<00:01:18.170> alternating

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
realize I could play it by alternating

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.250 
realize I could play it by alternating
the<00:01:20.560> alternating<00:01:21.820> the<00:01:22.820> hits<00:01:23.060> by<00:01:23.479> doing<00:01:23.900> right

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
the alternating the hits by doing right

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.080 
the alternating the hits by doing right
left<00:01:24.590> right<00:01:24.710> left<00:01:25.159> right<00:01:25.549> left

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
left right left right left

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.630 
left right left right left
so<00:01:28.450> in<00:01:29.450> essence<00:01:29.840> like<00:01:30.170> that<00:01:30.380> and<00:01:30.650> to<00:01:31.400> break<00:01:31.610> it

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
so in essence like that and to break it

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.320 
so in essence like that and to break it
up

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
up

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.770 
up
you<00:01:33.080> can<00:01:33.229> play<00:01:33.380> it<00:01:33.439> like<00:01:33.710> single<00:01:34.580> foot<00:01:34.790> at<00:01:35.720> a

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
you can play it like single foot at a

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.560 
you can play it like single foot at a
time<00:01:35.869> so<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:37.100> right<00:01:37.310> foot<00:01:37.580> alone<00:01:38.000> sounds<00:01:38.330> like

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
time so the right foot alone sounds like

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.790 
time so the right foot alone sounds like
this

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:51.020 

okay<00:01:44.800> and<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:45.310> left<00:01:45.520> foot<00:01:45.670> sounds<00:01:46.060> like<00:01:46.180> this

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.520 

if<00:01:52.030> you<00:01:52.150> play<00:01:52.300> them<00:01:52.510> at<00:01:52.750> the<00:01:52.840> same<00:01:53.020> time<00:01:53.260> but

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
if you play them at the same time but

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:05.969 
if you play them at the same time but
like<00:01:54.010> after<00:01:54.220> each<00:01:54.940> other<00:01:55.150> in<00:01:55.450> a<00:01:55.570> sequence

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.719 

and<00:02:06.979> so<00:02:07.219> on<00:02:07.780> but<00:02:08.780> we're<00:02:09.739> gonna<00:02:09.860> play<00:02:10.099> together

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
and so on but we're gonna play together

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.910 
and so on but we're gonna play together
now<00:02:11.090> at<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.540> same<00:02:11.810> time<00:02:12.050> and<00:02:12.440> that's<00:02:12.769> gonna

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
now at the same time and that's gonna

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.350 
now at the same time and that's gonna
create<00:02:13.129> the<00:02:13.370> triplet<00:02:13.730> effect<00:02:14.030> ticka<00:02:14.330> ticka

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
create the triplet effect ticka ticka

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.750 
create the triplet effect ticka ticka
ticka<00:02:14.720> ticka<00:02:14.870> ticka<00:02:15.080> ticka<00:02:15.230> ticka<00:02:15.440> so<00:02:16.250> slowly

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
ticka ticka ticka ticka ticka so slowly

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:24.789 
ticka ticka ticka ticka ticka so slowly
it<00:02:17.269> sounds<00:02:17.510> like<00:02:17.660> this<00:02:21.549> and<00:02:23.319> if<00:02:24.319> you<00:02:24.500> play<00:02:24.739> it

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
it sounds like this and if you play it

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.250 
it sounds like this and if you play it
faster<00:02:25.370> I'm<00:02:25.610> gonna<00:02:25.849> just<00:02:26.299> play<00:02:26.540> it<00:02:26.720> like<00:02:26.750> tick

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
faster I'm gonna just play it like tick

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.350 
faster I'm gonna just play it like tick
tick<00:02:27.290> tick<00:02:27.620> tick<00:02:27.860> and<00:02:28.069> then<00:02:28.280> mix<00:02:28.700> it<00:02:28.910> in<00:02:29.090> with

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
tick tick tick and then mix it in with

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.570 
tick tick tick and then mix it in with
some<00:02:29.420> other<00:02:30.019> stuff<00:02:30.349> for<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:31.220> fun<00:02:31.400> of<00:02:31.519> it

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
some other stuff for the fun of it

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.580 
some other stuff for the fun of it
because<00:02:31.910> that's<00:02:32.690> really<00:02:32.900> cool<00:02:33.110> with<00:02:33.260> this<00:02:33.440> it

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
because that's really cool with this it

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
because that's really cool with this it
leaves<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:34.010> room

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.150 
it leaves energy in my feet to do other
things<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.660> not<00:02:38.870> just<00:02:38.900> cramp<00:02:39.560> up<00:02:39.739> and<00:02:39.950> play

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
things and not just cramp up and play

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:53.100 
things and not just cramp up and play
the<00:02:40.310> same<00:02:40.489> pattern<00:02:40.940> so<00:02:41.180> I<00:02:41.390> can<00:02:41.780> do<00:02:42.049> things<00:02:42.200> like

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:02.220 

or<00:02:54.110> maybe<00:02:54.349> the<00:02:54.650> faster

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.410 

well<00:03:03.230> that<00:03:03.530> was<00:03:03.680> too<00:03:03.860> fast<00:03:04.420> inconsistent

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
well that was too fast inconsistent

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.170 
well that was too fast inconsistent
inconsistent<00:03:06.410> playing<00:03:06.680> but<00:03:07.580> still<00:03:07.850> you<00:03:08.030> can

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
inconsistent playing but still you can

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.480 
inconsistent playing but still you can
play<00:03:08.360> it's<00:03:08.540> you<00:03:09.470> just<00:03:09.620> practice<00:03:10.010> at<00:03:10.160> our<00:03:10.280> speed

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
play it's you just practice at our speed

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.780 
play it's you just practice at our speed
you're<00:03:10.670> comfortable<00:03:11.150> ads<00:03:11.330> and<00:03:12.250> just<00:03:13.250> do<00:03:13.370> right

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.130 

it's<00:03:22.940> actually<00:03:23.240> pretty<00:03:23.480> hard<00:03:23.570> to<00:03:23.810> play<00:03:24.020> it

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
it's actually pretty hard to play it

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.660 
it's actually pretty hard to play it
slow<00:03:24.410> which<00:03:24.620> is<00:03:24.740> a<00:03:24.770> good<00:03:25.040> thing<00:03:25.220> that<00:03:25.520> means

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
slow which is a good thing that means

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.700 
slow which is a good thing that means
you<00:03:25.820> need<00:03:25.910> to<00:03:25.970> practice<00:03:26.450> playing<00:03:27.230> it<00:03:27.500> slow

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
you need to practice playing it slow

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
you need to practice playing it slow
before<00:03:27.920> playing<00:03:28.280> it<00:03:28.430> fast<00:03:30.730> although

before playing it fast although

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.700 
before playing it fast although
sometimes<00:03:32.420> it<00:03:32.750> can<00:03:32.900> seem<00:03:33.110> as<00:03:33.290> if<00:03:33.320> you<00:03:33.440> can't

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:46.660 
sometimes it can seem as if you can't
play<00:03:33.890> it<00:03:34.010> fast<00:03:45.010> it's<00:03:46.010> just<00:03:46.220> enough<00:03:46.430> time<00:03:46.610> to

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
play it fast it's just enough time to

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.680
