00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.080
 my name is left my heart 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.200
 today we are going to make a 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.639
 succulent mushroom sauce 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.860
 to prepare this sauce I need some 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.719
 mushrooms an onions garlic from the 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.880
 oil margarine flour 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.480
 of white wine of broth and the 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.830
 substitute her the g of crème fraîche 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.270
 you are free to choose which types of 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.859
 mushrooms used for this sauce 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.640
 today I opted for 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.680
 mushrooms of Paris 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.960
 but ceps maury and chanterelles 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.130
 the secret of a 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.960
 successful mushroom sauce and 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.489
 to use very fresh mushrooms 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.460
 make sure they are not damaged 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.739
 and that they are fleshy and firm after 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.850
 have them thoroughly clean I 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.950
 cut in thick slices 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.420
 then I heat a spoon to 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.620
 oil soup or liquid margarine 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.960
 in a frying pan 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.710
 I add 2 cloves of finely chopped garlic 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.280
 I go back two minutes later 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.140
 I add the finely chopped onions 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.329
 so that the mushrooms cook but do not 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.149
 do not brown I stop cooking at 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.230
 maximum of five minutes 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.230
 they are perfect look 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.970
 now let's go to the base of the sauce 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.310
 the wheels call for leaders 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.870
 to make this light binder I melt 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.000
 a tablespoon of margarine 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.250
 I add 3 tablespoons of flour 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.360
 I mix everything with whips and I 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.360
 cook for one to two minutes 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.570
 without stopping stirring for the wine 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.210
 dry white 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.090
 the light cream substitute and the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.340
 broth stir constantly to avoid 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.350
 the formation of lumps 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.360
 and finally I added cooked mushrooms 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.690
 and I leave it all simmering for five minutes 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.690
 Furthermore 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.869
 I only dirty and pepper at the last 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.869
 minute 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.890
 good sauce and good appetite
