00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
that was this massive damage especially

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.100 
that was this massive damage especially
on<00:02:54.560> held<00:02:54.680> it<00:02:54.850> almost<00:02:55.850> one<00:02:56.120> shot<00:02:56.330> me<00:02:56.480> before<00:02:56.810> I

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
not a basic attack so I might as well go

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.960 
not a basic attack so I might as well go
ahead<00:03:00.710> and<00:03:00.800> try<00:03:00.950> and<00:03:01.040> dodge<00:03:01.340> it<00:03:01.580> whenever<00:03:01.760> he

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970
