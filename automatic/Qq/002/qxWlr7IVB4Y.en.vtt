00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.310
 fly emulate the birds while they furrow 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.010
 impassive the heavens above 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.290
 our heads is since time 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.490
 ancestral one of the dreams more 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.490
 yearned for the human being 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.410
 we have a template 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.140
 certified instructors and recognized 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.600
 experience that will provide the student 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:44.550
 all the necessary knowledge to 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.550
 the safe practice of this sport 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:06.059
 the displacements to the zones of 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.059
 flight are borne by the school 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.170
 For this we have a fleet of 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.909
 vehicles adapted to circulate through 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.909
 roads and mountain tracks 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.210
 the learning is progressive and consists of 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.210
 four phases 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.970
 in the first the student makes contact 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.400
 with the material and the medium 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.310
 his first takeoff practices on 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.380
 a level ground so that in no 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.380
 moment loses contact with the ground 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.850
 in a second stage the future pilot 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.950
 radio-guided a series of 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.520
 short flights with very uneven levels 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.380
 small ones that will allow you to master so much 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.160
 the takeoff technique like that of 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.160
 landing 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.700
 in the third phase the elevation increases 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.700
 considerably 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.180
 the course ends with the release in 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.180
 mountain flights 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.320
 during this stage they are put into practice 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.920
 the knowledge acquired in phases 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.920
 previous 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.489
 it's time to enjoy the new 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.790
 sensations that the flight provides 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.790
 free
