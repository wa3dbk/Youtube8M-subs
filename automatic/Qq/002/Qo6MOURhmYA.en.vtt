the<00:02:40.640> e<00:02:40.670> your<00:02:41.480> on<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.810> E<00:02:41.840> string<00:02:41.960> your<00:02:42.260> hitting

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
the e your on the E string your hitting

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:51.310 
the e your on the E string your hitting
the<00:02:42.530> fifth<00:02:42.710> fret<00:02:44.260> same<00:02:49.420> and<00:02:50.420> then<00:02:50.600> it<00:02:50.840> changes

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
the fifth fret same and then it changes

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.490 
the fifth fret same and then it changes
up<00:02:51.500> right<00:02:51.710> here<00:02:51.920> and<00:02:52.130> you<00:02:52.220> put<00:02:52.280> your<00:02:52.460> pinkie<00:02:52.850> on

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
up right here and you put your pinkie on

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:03.550 
up right here and you put your pinkie on
the<00:02:54.500> B<00:02:54.980> string<00:02:55.330> on<00:02:57.820> the<00:02:58.820> eighth<00:02:59.030> fret<00:03:02.110> and<00:03:03.110> you

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
the B string on the eighth fret and you

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.620 
the B string on the eighth fret and you
kind<00:03:03.770> of<00:03:03.830> leave<00:03:04.040> I<00:03:04.400> leave<00:03:04.790> my<00:03:05.180> bar<00:03:05.420> there

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
kind of leave I leave my bar there

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.970 
kind of leave I leave my bar there
because<00:03:05.840> that<00:03:05.959> it's<00:03:06.080> easy<00:03:06.290> not<00:03:06.500> to<00:03:06.680> move<00:03:06.800> it

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
because that it's easy not to move it

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.260 
because that it's easy not to move it
around<00:03:07.040> so<00:03:07.340> it's<00:03:07.700> like

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.180 

and<00:03:11.930> then<00:03:12.050> you<00:03:12.140> hit<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.290> B<00:03:12.530> string<00:03:12.860> then<00:03:13.160> you

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
and then you hit the B string then you

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:25.750 
and then you hit the B string then you
change<00:03:13.460> up<00:03:13.550> the<00:03:13.670> pattern<00:03:15.340> you<00:03:16.340> hit<00:03:18.550> B<00:03:19.550> G<00:03:24.100> G<00:03:25.100> Dean

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
change up the pattern you hit B G G Dean

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.230 
change up the pattern you hit B G G Dean
then<00:03:26.270> back<00:03:26.720> to<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:26.990> B<00:03:27.200> and<00:03:27.830> then<00:03:28.670> the<00:03:28.820> E<00:03:28.850> string

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
then back to the B and then the E string

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.160 
then back to the B and then the E string
and<00:03:29.750> then<00:03:30.500> you<00:03:31.250> go<00:03:31.370> down<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:32.660> fretboard<00:03:32.870> again

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
and then you go down the fretboard again

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:45.730 
and then you go down the fretboard again
-<00:03:36.850> so<00:03:43.690> it's<00:03:44.690> pretty<00:03:44.900> simple<00:03:45.200> I'm<00:03:45.350> making<00:03:45.650> it

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
- so it's pretty simple I'm making it

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.010 
- so it's pretty simple I'm making it
sound<00:03:45.890> way<00:03:46.250> harder<00:03:46.640> than<00:03:46.670> it<00:03:46.820> should<00:03:47.300> be<00:03:47.510> but

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
sound way harder than it should be but

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:58.619 
sound way harder than it should be but
yeah<00:03:48.860> so<00:03:49.310> the<00:03:49.940> next<00:03:50.120> part<00:03:50.330> goes

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:58.629 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:01.690 

you<00:03:59.629> take<00:03:59.810> that<00:03:59.930> same<00:04:00.140> shape<00:04:00.470> down<00:04:01.010> to<00:04:01.489> where

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
you take that same shape down to where

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:08.199 
you take that same shape down to where
you<00:04:01.849> were<00:04:02.060> before<00:04:03.400> so<00:04:04.400> you<00:04:04.459> are<00:04:06.040> on<00:04:07.040> the<00:04:07.760> sixth

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
you were before so you are on the sixth

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:14.530 
you were before so you are on the sixth
fret<00:04:08.360> E<00:04:08.599> string<00:04:10.060> fourth<00:04:11.060> fret<00:04:11.120> B<00:04:11.780> string<00:04:13.540> third

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
fret E string fourth fret B string third

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.190 
fret E string fourth fret B string third
fret<00:04:14.750> G<00:04:15.319> and<00:04:16.070> fifth<00:04:16.639> D<00:04:16.880> and<00:04:17.180> you<00:04:17.780> still<00:04:18.019> have<00:04:18.109> a

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
fret G and fifth D and you still have a

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:26.430 
fret G and fifth D and you still have a
little<00:04:18.260> bar<00:04:18.560> thing<00:04:18.829> so

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.690 

so<00:04:27.440> then<00:04:27.620> you<00:04:27.740> do<00:04:27.860> the<00:04:27.980> same<00:04:28.190> you<00:04:28.430> down<00:04:28.610> the

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
so then you do the same you down the

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.630 
so then you do the same you down the
fretboard<00:04:30.130> the<00:04:31.130> strings<00:04:33.340> and<00:04:34.340> then<00:04:34.520> you

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
fretboard the strings and then you

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.990 
fretboard the strings and then you
change<00:04:35.650> your<00:04:36.650> pinkie<00:04:37.070> to<00:04:37.310> the<00:04:37.490> fifth<00:04:37.730> fret<00:04:37.940> and

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
change your pinkie to the fifth fret and

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.730 
change your pinkie to the fifth fret and
so<00:04:38.270> the<00:04:38.420> sixth<00:04:38.750> and<00:04:38.930> then<00:04:39.260> go<00:04:40.180> and<00:04:41.200> then<00:04:42.200> to<00:04:42.500> the

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
so the sixth and then go and then to the

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.180 
so the sixth and then go and then to the
third<00:04:42.950> fret<00:04:43.160> just<00:04:43.280> take<00:04:43.460> your<00:04:43.550> pick<00:04:43.670> you<00:04:43.790> off

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
third fret just take your pick you off

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.560 
third fret just take your pick you off
back<00:04:46.190> to<00:04:46.760> fifth<00:04:48.310> so<00:04:49.310> that<00:04:49.610> last<00:04:50.000> part<00:04:50.300> sounds

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
back to fifth so that last part sounds

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:57.010 
back to fifth so that last part sounds
like<00:04:55.210> so<00:04:56.210> this<00:04:56.300> is<00:04:56.360> what<00:04:56.480> it<00:04:56.570> sounds<00:04:56.750> like<00:04:56.810> so

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
like so this is what it sounds like so

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:09.910 
like so this is what it sounds like so
far

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:09.920 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:21.010 

the<00:05:10.640> next<00:05:11.030> part<00:05:11.300> is<00:05:16.540> so<00:05:19.480> take<00:05:20.480> that<00:05:20.600> same<00:05:20.780> shape

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
the next part is so take that same shape

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.510 
the next part is so take that same shape
from<00:05:21.200> up<00:05:21.320> here<00:05:21.500> and<00:05:21.680> take<00:05:21.800> it<00:05:21.830> down<00:05:22.010> there<00:05:22.220> so

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
from up here and take it down there so

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.730 
from up here and take it down there so
you're<00:05:23.120> on<00:05:23.210> the<00:05:23.300> fifth<00:05:23.510> fret<00:05:23.630> E<00:05:23.840> string<00:05:23.870> second

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
you're on the fifth fret E string second

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.730 
you're on the fifth fret E string second
fret<00:05:24.860> B<00:05:25.270> um<00:05:27.070> second<00:05:28.070> fret<00:05:28.280> g<00:05:28.580> string

fret B um second fret g string

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.620 
fret B um second fret g string
wait<00:05:30.740> so<00:05:30.920> third<00:05:31.130> fret<00:05:31.340> B<00:05:31.490> string<00:05:31.520> second<00:05:32.330> fret

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
wait so third fret B string second fret

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:38.980 
wait so third fret B string second fret
g<00:05:33.260> string<00:05:33.290> and<00:05:34.150> fourth<00:05:35.150> fret<00:05:35.510> D<00:05:36.230> so<00:05:37.870> do<00:05:38.870> that

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
g string and fourth fret D so do that

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.650 
g string and fourth fret D so do that
same<00:05:39.290> pattern<00:05:40.040> where<00:05:40.400> you<00:05:40.490> go<00:05:40.610> just<00:05:40.940> down<00:05:41.540> the

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
same pattern where you go just down the

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:48.790 
same pattern where you go just down the
strings<00:05:47.020> then<00:05:48.020> you<00:05:48.110> take<00:05:48.230> your<00:05:48.260> pinkie<00:05:48.530> off

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
strings then you take your pinkie off

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.780 
strings then you take your pinkie off
and<00:05:49.130> hit<00:05:49.580> second<00:05:50.000> fret<00:05:50.210> with<00:05:50.840> on<00:05:51.740> the<00:05:51.860> E<00:05:51.920> string

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.060 

and<00:05:55.790> then<00:05:56.000> this<00:05:56.480> this<00:05:56.990> is<00:05:57.140> how<00:05:57.290> I<00:05:57.320> do<00:05:57.470> this<00:05:57.800> part

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
and then this this is how I do this part

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.560 
and then this this is how I do this part
but<00:05:58.340> it<00:05:58.460> might<00:05:58.580> not<00:05:58.610> be<00:05:58.820> the<00:05:58.940> easiest<00:05:59.120> way<00:05:59.360> I

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
but it might not be the easiest way I

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.690 
but it might not be the easiest way I
move<00:06:02.380> my<00:06:03.380> middle<00:06:03.650> finger<00:06:03.920> down<00:06:04.250> so<00:06:04.550> it's

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
move my middle finger down so it's

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:11.350 
move my middle finger down so it's
barring<00:06:05.150> these<00:06:05.480> two<00:06:05.690> frets<00:06:06.020> because<00:06:10.330> so<00:06:11.330> you

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
barring these two frets because so you

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.780 
barring these two frets because so you
can<00:06:11.540> hit<00:06:11.690> all<00:06:11.930> those<00:06:12.140> notes<00:06:12.440> and<00:06:12.710> so<00:06:13.370> it<00:06:13.670> would

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:13.790 
can hit all those notes and so it would

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:26.620 
can hit all those notes and so it would
be<00:06:22.750> and<00:06:23.750> when<00:06:24.020> you<00:06:24.110> do<00:06:24.200> that<00:06:24.230> shape<00:06:24.620> it<00:06:24.980> is<00:06:25.630> you

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:26.630 
be and when you do that shape it is you

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.020 
be and when you do that shape it is you
are<00:06:26.780> on<00:06:27.020> third<00:06:27.620> fret<00:06:27.860> E<00:06:28.040> string<00:06:28.070> third<00:06:28.640> fret<00:06:28.790> B

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.030 
are on third fret E string third fret B
