 lounge of san pablo brasil second 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.519
 program of the hall of san pablo in the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.950
 previous program I think we did it 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.870
 participant in the enthusiasm that has seized us 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.400
 when we find this room 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.020
 If he did not see it, he did not have the opportunity to 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.170
 see him I remind you that we are in 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.630
 facebook or in www of technical auto tv.com 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.519
 point ar look for it because it really has 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.890
 very interesting things but following 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.500
 now with this is good one does not stop 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.000
 be surprised does not cease to be surprised of 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.210
 a concept that in our program 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.309
 express to see quantity and quality and 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.229
 presentations many presentations not 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.530
 only for brazil but for all 

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:46.519
 Latin America where concepts prevail 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.690
 of I tell you of growth 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.790
 obviously the automotive industry 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.760
 Latin American has definitely 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.739
 own entity and I propose that in 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.600
 this program let's go through the 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.610
 room to justly reaffirm that 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.589
 concept the identity that has the 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.710
 Latin American with their own 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:03.710
 vehicles 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.980
 from the stand of citroën enjoying 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.470
 a magnificent show with this concept to 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.870
 my backs of purely conception 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.250
 sports and with a lot of news 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.700
 that in a moment we will be 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.700
 commenting 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.150
 a julieta rockera julieta company 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.790
 is responsible for communications of 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.290
 citroën argentina crack what are 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.570
 really the news that has 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.520
 presented the citroën in this room the 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.550
 main novelty for us and that goes 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.090
 to be short coming to argentina is 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.710
 the new c3 recently released in 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.260
 Brazil has been launched in the month of August 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.570
 with excellent results in just 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.660
 month and a half of release has exceeded 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.570
 the 3,500 units and they have also 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.180
 presented as a novelty also for the 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.760
 Brazilian market the ds4 and the ds5 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.920
 announcing its launch soon 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.720
 they are going to complete the range since 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.959
 comes from launching very few months ago 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.970
 in March of this year the ds3 for 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.370
 resemble what you have to do 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.160
 parallelism with the Argentine market 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.390
 we have officially announced 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.580
 confirm that we are going to be launching the 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.320
 new c3 in the Argentine market before 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.700
 year- end 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:45.120
 soon we will be announcing the 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.070
 presale in the month of November giving 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.950
 more information about the versions and 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.810
 the 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.360
 prices that this new line will have 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.269
 in Argentina and also why not 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.700
 announce that we are in strong analysis 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:00.310
 to complete our line of s then 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.700
 of having launched the one of that 13 in 2011 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:07.860
 and the ds4 this year thinking is because not in 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:11.709
 the 2013 complete the line with the ds5 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.680
 we have already seen in paris too and worse 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.780
 that here of san pablo there is one there is another 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.489
 oxygen there is another air that gives me the 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.010
 impression that is also affecting 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.720
 Argentina in what it does to growth 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.049
 how are you currently positioning yourself 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.209
 citroën in argentina for us is a 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:31.090
 excellent year of consolidation 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.910
 releases that 4 released in the month of 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.680
 may a c3 picasso and a c3 aircross of 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.660
 full year because we have launched 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.180
 half practically last year 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.910
 we are consolidating what is these 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:46.420
 releases and we have an estimate of 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:49.090
 year end of about 34 thousand units a 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.240
 very important volume for the brand that 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.910
 if we remember we come from an excel 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.070
 and performance in 2011 since we've 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.850
 grown 40% of the brand that more 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:01.590
 grew the truth over the market 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.660
 that we think we can follow 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.060
 growing we are working and with this 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.520
 new release of c3 we consider that 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.680
 is going to be a success for 2013 and 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.780
 we estimate close to 40 thousand units for 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.760
 next year so we wait 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.489
 continue with the success that is already seen in 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.130
 Brazil in the Argentine market a new 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.350
 c3 with excellent new equipment 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:26.150
 motorizations and well we hope that what 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.150
 can enjoy the Argentines 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.950
 sometimes it seems that what we are in 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.770
 this topic we had an obsession with what 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:44.240
 what does pollution do with what it does 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:47.490
 to toxic gases recyclable materials 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.919
 green materials specifically and 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.950
 Well, it's a kind of obsession 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:55.590
 know that a kilo passes has 1000 grams 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:58.060
 that is when one says if a gram of 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.389
 non-recyclable material 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:05.440
 in a vehicle you can have I do not know 5 6 10 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:07.510
 50 100 kilos not recyclable this shipments 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.580
 to the production of a day we are already 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.889
 talking about tons and extended of 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.960
 pressure of a year we are talking about 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.750
 hundreds of tons 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.120
 then the crap accumulates and 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.340
 we have to do something urgent for 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.280
 reduce it in automotive industry is 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.110
 fully aware that so 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:29.620
 this s 3 that my backs are a new 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.270
 c3 has that concept incorporated and 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:35.130
 has achieved in this vehicle already a 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:37.720
 reduction of 33 kilos in materials 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:40.419
 Absolutely recyclable or of origin 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:43.300
 natural that is to say vegetable fibers by 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:45.280
 example are recyclable if you do not 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.870
 generate carbon dioxide or if 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.930
 they generate then they reduce it again 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:52.630
 etcetera etcetera etcetera a vehicle 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:55.000
 It has approximately 75 percent 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.790
 of its weight that is metal 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.620
 the metal should be totally 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:02.770
 recyclable let's assume that 60 percent 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.240
 it will be if you have the precaution of 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.360
 than the car when 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:10.300
 and development when it is designed is 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.210
 conceived so that after that can be 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.160
 recyclable and curiously I think I have 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.349
 mentioned sometime today when it 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:20.139
 build a vehicle you have so much 

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:22.120
 attention to build it itself as 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:25.090
 to think when it reaches the end of 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:27.729
 their lives as they are going to destroy it and 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:30.280
 how are you going to recycle that material 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:33.220
 this new c3 is an excellent example 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.139
 since the beginning of the vehicle how 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.509
 will recycle it at the end until the 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:38.860
 materials that are being used 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:41.770
 just to be able to take advantage of that 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.539
 recycled and minimize that which is no longer 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.610
 a ghost forgiveness I want to be 

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:50.039
 absolutely concrete in this is a 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.039
 reality garbage pollution 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:00.090
 we can only see stimulating things 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.810
 nice things after the break 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:02.810
 we keep going
