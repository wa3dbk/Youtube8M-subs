00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
doer view for the dell XPS 83 thousand

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.879 
doer view for the dell XPS 83 thousand
the<00:00:06.150> newer<00:00:06.870> one<00:00:08.269> so<00:00:09.269> it's<00:00:09.809> made<00:00:09.960> by<00:00:10.110> dell<00:00:10.170> it's

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
the newer one so it's made by dell it's

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.680 
the newer one so it's made by dell it's
the<00:00:11.070> second<00:00:11.429> bet<00:00:11.580> it's<00:00:11.849> not<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.210> second<00:00:12.540> best

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
the second bet it's not the second best

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.360 
the second bet it's not the second best
it's<00:00:12.990> really<00:00:13.230> different<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.559> other<00:00:13.710> XPS<00:00:14.190> oh<00:00:14.219> so

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
it's really different to other XPS oh so

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.029 
it's really different to other XPS oh so
it's<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.960> second<00:00:15.960> in<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.170> lineup<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.740> don't<00:00:16.980> know

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
it's a second in the lineup I don't know

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.400 
it's a second in the lineup I don't know
which<00:00:17.340> ones<00:00:17.520> better<00:00:17.670> not<00:00:17.970> or<00:00:18.180> what<00:00:18.449> but<00:00:19.260> it's

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
which ones better not or what but it's

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.250 
which ones better not or what but it's
all<00:00:19.529> better<00:00:19.680> than<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.920> seven<00:00:20.160> 1000<00:00:21.260> starting

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
all better than the seven 1000 starting

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.349 
all better than the seven 1000 starting
down<00:00:22.380> here<00:00:22.760> we've<00:00:23.760> done<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.090> for<00:00:24.390> i7<00:00:24.900> 2600

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
down here we've done that for i7 2600

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.419 
down here we've done that for i7 2600
it's<00:00:27.359> not<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.660> cave<00:00:27.869> version<00:00:28.320> it's<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:29.220> lock

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
it's not the cave version it's the lock

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.160 
it's not the cave version it's the lock
degree<00:00:29.699> here<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.470> this<00:00:31.470> doesn't<00:00:31.740> let<00:00:31.949> you

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
degree here so this doesn't let you

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.130 
degree here so this doesn't let you
overclock<00:00:34.170> as<00:00:34.469> fast<00:00:34.940> it's<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.270> four-car

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.940 
on it and keyboard so now you've seen
the<00:02:00.240> computer<00:02:00.600> i'll<00:02:00.990> do<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.229> boot<00:02:01.590> up<00:02:01.680> on<00:02:01.829> it

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
the computer i'll do a boot up on it

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:15.020 
the computer i'll do a boot up on it
stop<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.060> screen<00:02:06.229> and<00:02:07.229> stop<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.740> computer

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:33.950 

okay<00:02:16.030> starting<00:02:16.510> now

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.290 

I<00:02:34.250> will<00:02:35.250> have<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.430> enter<00:02:35.520> password<00:02:35.880> so<00:02:36.210> it

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
I will have to enter password so it

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:49.290 
I will have to enter password so it
might<00:02:36.420> be<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.600> bit<00:02:36.750> longer<00:02:36.930> but

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.040 

and<00:02:49.930> we're<00:02:50.380> on<00:02:51.390> there<00:02:52.390> you<00:02:52.480> go<00:02:52.600> pretty<00:02:52.870> fast

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
and we're on there you go pretty fast

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.110 
and we're on there you go pretty fast
boot<00:02:53.320> up<00:02:55.590> just<00:02:56.590> close<00:02:56.830> this<00:02:57.100> and<00:02:57.340> everything

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
boot up just close this and everything

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.970 
boot up just close this and everything
that<00:02:58.180> it<00:02:58.330> works<00:02:58.510> open<00:03:00.150> windows<00:03:02.580> it<00:03:03.580> up<00:03:03.760> so

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
that it works open windows it up so

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:13.770 
that it works open windows it up so
that's<00:03:05.980> XPS<00:03:07.470> 8300<00:03:08.490> 8400<00:03:09.490> and<00:03:09.640> up<00:03:10.050> yeah<00:03:11.050> so<00:03:11.470> see
