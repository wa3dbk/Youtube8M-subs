00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
easiest way to make a squeak shoe but

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:51.609 
easiest way to make a squeak shoe but
for<00:01:44.909> me<00:01:45.090> not<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.540> most<00:01:45.689> effective

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.730 

now<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.740> can<00:01:53.040> see<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.610> does<00:01:53.909> work<00:01:54.270> and

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
now you can see that it does work and

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.630 
now you can see that it does work and
it's<00:01:55.740> definitely<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.250> little<00:01:56.399> bit<00:01:56.549> more

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
it's definitely a little bit more

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.730 
it's definitely a little bit more
annoying<00:01:57.090> when<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.450> put<00:01:57.720> the<00:01:57.869> second<00:01:58.350> shoe<00:01:58.530> on

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
annoying when you put the second shoe on

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.340 
annoying when you put the second shoe on
but<00:01:59.430> for<00:01:59.700> me<00:01:59.880> it's<00:02:00.060> not<00:02:00.149> loud<00:02:00.750> enough<00:02:00.810> I'm

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
but for me it's not loud enough I'm

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.109 
but for me it's not loud enough I'm
going<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.560> show<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.770> another<00:02:02.520> way<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:02.880> you

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
going to show you another way that you

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.789 
going to show you another way that you
can<00:02:03.390> do<00:02:03.539> this<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:03.960> requires<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.500> little<00:02:04.710> bit

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
can do this that requires a little bit

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.679 
can do this that requires a little bit
more<00:02:05.039> time<00:02:05.280> but<00:02:05.850> it's<00:02:05.970> going<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.149> be<00:02:06.270> worth<00:02:06.450> it

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
more time but it's going to be worth it

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.600 
more time but it's going to be worth it
okay<00:02:07.080> now<00:02:07.470> what<00:02:07.830> I'm<00:02:07.920> going<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.130> do<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.459> I'm

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
is the one that I pulled out of the

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.240 
is the one that I pulled out of the
donut<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.450> one<00:02:30.600> on<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.810> right<00:02:30.989> is<00:02:31.350> one

donut and the one on the right is one
that<00:02:32.549> I<00:02:32.580> got<00:02:32.940> from<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:34.110> bigger<00:02:34.610> squeaker

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
that I got from the bigger squeaker

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.570 
that I got from the bigger squeaker
thingy<00:02:36.660> you<00:02:37.440> know<00:02:37.530> what<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.650> mean<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:38.280> smaller

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
thingy you know what I mean the smaller

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.770 
thingy you know what I mean the smaller
one<00:02:38.819> has<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.030> higher<00:02:39.360> pitched<00:02:39.690> week<00:02:41.299> while<00:02:42.299> the

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
one has a higher pitched week while the

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.449 
one has a higher pitched week while the
bigger<00:02:43.140> one<00:02:43.380> has<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.590> little<00:02:43.890> bit<00:02:43.980> lower<00:02:44.160> of<00:02:44.280> a

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
bigger one has a little bit lower of a

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.130 
bigger one has a little bit lower of a
squeak<00:02:46.849> both<00:02:47.849> are<00:02:48.090> very<00:02:48.269> loud<00:02:48.599> and<00:02:48.900> annoying

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
squeak both are very loud and annoying

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.250 
squeak both are very loud and annoying
but<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:50.040> reason<00:02:50.459> that<00:02:50.640> I<00:02:50.700> want<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.239> use<00:02:51.569> the

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
but the reason that I want to use the

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.740 
but the reason that I want to use the
bigger<00:02:52.470> one<00:02:52.680> is<00:02:52.950> because<00:02:53.549> we<00:02:53.730> need<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:54.209> little

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
bigger one is because we need a little

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:12.370 
bigger one is because we need a little
bit<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:55.019> room<00:02:55.350> in<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:56.519> shoe<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:57.180> connect

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.530 

okay<00:03:13.380> so<00:03:13.440> we<00:03:13.710> completed<00:03:14.250> our<00:03:14.550> sweetie<00:03:15.300> shoe

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
okay so we completed our sweetie shoe

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.050 
okay so we completed our sweetie shoe
and<00:03:15.870> this<00:03:16.020> is<00:03:16.140> what<00:03:16.320> it<00:03:16.440> should<00:03:16.470> look<00:03:16.620> like<00:03:17.060> of

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
and this is what it should look like of

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.350 
and this is what it should look like of
course<00:03:18.570> I<00:03:18.840> had<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.740> cover<00:03:20.310> up<00:03:20.580> our<00:03:20.700> whole<00:03:20.970> Pole

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
course I had to cover up our whole Pole

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.060 
course I had to cover up our whole Pole
because<00:03:21.570> it's<00:03:21.810> at<00:03:21.960> up<00:03:22.110> here<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:22.620> it<00:03:22.800> doesn't

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
because it's at up here and it doesn't

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.530 
because it's at up here and it doesn't
make<00:03:23.160> any<00:03:23.280> sense<00:03:23.580> if<00:03:23.760> your<00:03:23.910> foot<00:03:24.150> is<00:03:24.180> going<00:03:24.480> to

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
make any sense if your foot is going to

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.480 
make any sense if your foot is going to
be<00:03:24.630> going<00:03:24.840> right<00:03:25.110> here<00:03:25.350> now<00:03:25.950> this<00:03:26.190> is<00:03:26.370> the

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
be going right here now this is the

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.250 
be going right here now this is the
problem<00:03:26.850> that<00:03:26.940> I've<00:03:27.090> seen<00:03:27.360> when<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:27.690> first<00:03:28.050> put

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
problem that I've seen when I first put

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.290 
problem that I've seen when I first put
it<00:03:28.380> so<00:03:28.590> if<00:03:29.190> you<00:03:29.340> can<00:03:29.490> get<00:03:29.580> a<00:03:29.640> donut<00:03:30.150> or

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
it so if you can get a donut or

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.120

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
then you have a winner

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.280 
then you have a winner
but<00:03:43.740> the<00:03:43.950> cupcake<00:03:44.430> wasn't<00:03:45.360> as<00:03:45.540> comfortable<00:03:45.840> as

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290
