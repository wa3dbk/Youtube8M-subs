I you know like I said I got in a car

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.740 
I you know like I said I got in a car
kit<00:02:42.740> so<00:02:42.920> I'm<00:02:43.010> not<00:02:43.160> identified<00:02:43.750> individually

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
kit so I'm not identified individually

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.620 
kit so I'm not identified individually
but<00:02:45.560> my<00:02:46.340> understanding<00:02:46.400> is<00:02:46.910> this<00:02:47.060> like<00:02:47.240> four

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
but my understanding is this like four

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.280 
but my understanding is this like four
or<00:02:47.750> five<00:02:47.810> dollars<00:02:48.470> maybe<00:02:49.270> and<00:02:50.270> it's<00:02:50.390> for<00:02:50.570> 6.7

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
or five dollars maybe and it's for 6.7

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.590 
or five dollars maybe and it's for 6.7
ounces<00:02:51.650> um<00:02:52.270> which<00:02:53.270> is<00:02:53.690> a<00:02:54.170> good<00:02:54.440> value<00:02:55.209> just<00:02:56.209> you

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
ounces um which is a good value just you

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.020 
ounces um which is a good value just you
know<00:02:56.630> but<00:02:57.080> I<00:02:57.290> mean<00:02:57.740> I<00:02:58.010> use<00:02:58.310> a<00:02:58.340> lot<00:02:58.459> of

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
know but I mean I use a lot of

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.600 
know but I mean I use a lot of
conditioner<00:02:59.750> when<00:03:00.440> I<00:03:00.470> wash<00:03:00.709> my<00:03:00.920> hair<00:03:01.100> like<00:03:01.400> I

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
conditioner when I wash my hair like I

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.030 
conditioner when I wash my hair like I
use<00:03:01.790> a<00:03:01.820> lot<00:03:01.940> like<00:03:02.510> I<00:03:02.750> don't<00:03:03.620> know<00:03:03.800> I'm<00:03:03.920> really

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
use a lot like I don't know I'm really

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.330 
use a lot like I don't know I'm really
used<00:03:04.400> maybe<00:03:04.640> a<00:03:04.730> quarter<00:03:05.060> of<00:03:05.209> this<00:03:05.480> container

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
used maybe a quarter of this container

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.180 
used maybe a quarter of this container
so<00:03:07.340> I<00:03:07.370> didn't<00:03:07.730> use<00:03:07.850> a<00:03:07.880> whole<00:03:08.269> lot<00:03:08.540> but<00:03:08.840> I<00:03:09.140> mean<00:03:09.739> I

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
so I didn't use a whole lot but I mean I

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.660 
so I didn't use a whole lot but I mean I
don't<00:03:10.550> know<00:03:10.880> i<00:03:11.209> just<00:03:11.269> i<00:03:11.860> don't<00:03:12.860> know<00:03:13.070> i<00:03:13.370> mean<00:03:13.519> i

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
don't know i just i don't know i mean i

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.580 
don't know i just i don't know i mean i
guess<00:03:14.000> a<00:03:14.030> little<00:03:14.300> does<00:03:14.570> goal<00:03:14.810> only<00:03:14.989> because<00:03:15.440> it

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
guess a little does goal only because it

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.060 
guess a little does goal only because it
is<00:03:15.709> so<00:03:15.890> moisturizing<00:03:16.190> but<00:03:17.150> i<00:03:17.530> don't<00:03:18.530> know<00:03:18.620> like

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
is so moisturizing but i don't know like

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.729 
is so moisturizing but i don't know like
it's<00:03:19.340> not<00:03:19.519> as<00:03:19.760> good<00:03:20.060> value<00:03:20.660> as<00:03:20.989> it<00:03:21.440> trust<00:03:21.680> me

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
it's not as good value as it trust me

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.740 
it's not as good value as it trust me
naturals<00:03:22.280> but<00:03:22.519> it<00:03:22.640> mean<00:03:23.000> but<00:03:23.180> you<00:03:23.450> know<00:03:23.600> the

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
naturals but it mean but you know the

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.120 
naturals but it mean but you know the
different<00:03:24.080> ingredients<00:03:24.620> this<00:03:24.709> is<00:03:24.920> more

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
different ingredients this is more

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.910 
different ingredients this is more
moisturizing<00:03:25.670> so<00:03:26.209> that's<00:03:26.450> probably<00:03:26.720> why<00:03:27.200> it

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
moisturizing so that's probably why it

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.030 
moisturizing so that's probably why it
costs<00:03:28.550> a<00:03:28.610> little<00:03:28.700> bit<00:03:28.850> more<00:03:29.209> per<00:03:29.840> ounce<00:03:30.050> but

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
costs a little bit more per ounce but

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.870 
costs a little bit more per ounce but
but<00:03:31.880> overall<00:03:32.739> um<00:03:33.739> what<00:03:34.400> else<00:03:34.580> is<00:03:34.790> there

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
but overall um what else is there

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
but overall um what else is there
anything<00:03:35.060> else<00:03:35.330> I<00:03:35.390> need<00:03:35.420> to<00:03:35.570> tell<00:03:35.630> you<00:03:35.780> about

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
to go um but anyways so um my initial

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.270 
to go um but anyways so um my initial
impression<00:04:03.420> of<00:04:03.540> this<00:04:03.720> is<00:04:04.010> it's<00:04:05.010> pretty<00:04:05.190> good

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
impression of this is it's pretty good

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.710 
impression of this is it's pretty good
like<00:04:06.090> I<00:04:06.270> say<00:04:06.690> on<00:04:07.050> the<00:04:07.290> one<00:04:07.470> on<00:04:07.740> the<00:04:07.920> IANA<00:04:08.720> a2f

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
like I say on the one on the IANA a2f

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.070 
like I say on the one on the IANA a2f
scale<00:04:10.170> of<00:04:11.000> conditioners<00:04:12.000> this<00:04:12.570> is<00:04:12.720> like<00:04:12.930> a
