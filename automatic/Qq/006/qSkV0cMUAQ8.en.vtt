is very good for me I'm get some decent

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.020 
is very good for me I'm get some decent
schools<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.320> it's<00:00:46.440> fairly<00:00:47.100> easy<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.340> handle<00:00:47.760> i

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
schools and it's fairly easy to handle i

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.090 
schools and it's fairly easy to handle i
think<00:00:48.390> i<00:00:48.539> ever<00:00:48.629> got<00:00:48.780> 900<00:00:49.379> horsepower<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:49.950> it's

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
think i ever got 900 horsepower so it's

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.619 
think i ever got 900 horsepower so it's
not<00:00:50.219> sure<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.640> have<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.789> bit<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.059> grunt<00:00:51.390> either

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
not sure to have a bit of grunt either

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.350 
not sure to have a bit of grunt either
and<00:00:51.980> again<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.160> paint<00:00:53.370> move<00:00:53.670> up<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.090> is

and again the paint move up in this is

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.660 
and again the paint move up in this is
the<00:00:54.690> one<00:00:54.780> for<00:00:54.809> my<00:00:55.020> HT<00:00:55.410> tempest<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.460> go<00:00:56.550> and

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.510 
version we have come with the twin turbo
on<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.079> 30<00:01:55.290> bill<00:01:55.530> we<00:01:55.829> went<00:01:56.040> with<00:01:56.310> the

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
on the 30 bill we went with the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.490 
on the 30 bill we went with the
supercharger<00:01:57.329> about<00:01:57.659> on<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.810> dress<00:01:57.990> code<00:01:58.170> we

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
supercharger about on the dress code we

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.810 
supercharger about on the dress code we
are<00:01:58.619> going<00:01:58.799> with<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.509> tables<00:02:01.460> souls<00:02:02.460> back<00:02:02.640> at

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
are going with the tables souls back at

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.039 
are going with the tables souls back at
this<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.210> now<00:02:03.450> what<00:02:03.570> I've<00:02:03.659> looked<00:02:03.869> at<00:02:03.930> the

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
this and now what I've looked at the

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.539 
this and now what I've looked at the
engine<00:02:04.469> upgrades<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.159> as<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.340> can<00:02:05.490> imagine

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
engine upgrades and as you can imagine

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.420 
engine upgrades and as you can imagine
without<00:02:05.969> much<00:02:06.180> horsepower

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
without much horsepower

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.820 
without much horsepower
all<00:02:07.490> of<00:02:07.670> these<00:02:07.820> are<00:02:07.850> race<00:02:08.420> but<00:02:09.320> I'll<00:02:09.380> go<00:02:09.500> to<00:02:09.560> any

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
all of these are race but I'll go to any

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.420 
all of these are race but I'll go to any
weight<00:02:10.009> so<00:02:10.220> you<00:02:10.369> got<00:02:10.460> the<00:02:10.490> race<00:02:10.700> air<00:02:10.940> intake

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
weight so you got the race air intake

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.840 
weight so you got the race air intake
now<00:02:13.430> we<00:02:13.610> have<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.910> race<00:02:14.060> fuel<00:02:14.360> system<00:02:15.700> we<00:02:16.700> have

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
now we have the race fuel system we have

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:23.250 
now we have the race fuel system we have
the<00:02:17.000> race<00:02:17.150> ignition<00:02:19.810> exhaust<00:02:20.810> is<00:02:21.110> races<00:02:21.710> on

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
the race ignition exhaust is races on

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.920 
the race ignition exhaust is races on
cam<00:02:24.260> shaft<00:02:24.530> is<00:02:25.280> race<00:02:27.790> valves<00:02:28.790> are<00:02:28.820> race<00:02:29.750> as

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
cam shaft is race valves are race as

cam shaft is race valves are race as
well<00:02:31.600> twin<00:02:32.600> turbos<00:02:32.990> we<00:02:33.709> have<00:02:33.860> upgraded<00:02:34.250> to<00:02:34.640> the

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
well twin turbos we have upgraded to the

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.850 
well twin turbos we have upgraded to the
race<00:02:34.880> twin<00:02:35.240> turbos<00:02:35.630> make<00:02:35.990> a<00:02:36.020> bit<00:02:36.260> stronger<00:02:36.530> may

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
race twin turbos make a bit stronger may

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.310 
race twin turbos make a bit stronger may
make<00:02:37.130> them<00:02:37.220> a<00:02:37.280> bit<00:02:37.400> more<00:02:37.550> powerful<00:02:38.320> yep

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
make them a bit more powerful yep

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.130 
make them a bit more powerful yep
they're<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.709> ones<00:02:39.830> you<00:02:39.890> want<00:02:40.040> to<00:02:40.100> go<00:02:40.160> with<00:02:41.140> the

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
they're the ones you want to go with the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.130 
they're the ones you want to go with the
intercooler<00:02:42.680> is<00:02:42.950> also<00:02:43.640> a<00:02:43.850> race<00:02:44.090> as<00:02:44.300> well<00:02:44.360> don't

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
intercooler is also a race as well don't

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.600 
intercooler is also a race as well don't
add<00:02:45.290> those<00:02:45.500> on<00:02:45.650> my<00:02:45.680> circuit<00:02:46.070> builds<00:02:46.370> because

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
add those on my circuit builds because

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:47.949 
add those on my circuit builds because
this<00:02:46.730> had<00:02:46.910> more<00:02:47.090> weight<00:02:47.300> than<00:02:47.390> you<00:02:47.600> do<00:02:47.720> to<00:02:47.840> get

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
this had more weight than you do to get

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.020 
this had more weight than you do to get
power<00:02:48.200> but<00:02:48.590> under<00:02:48.800> fields<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:49.430> like<00:02:49.910> the

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
power but under fields and like the

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.260 
power but under fields and like the
extra<00:02:50.270> power<00:02:50.420> power<00:02:50.780> is<00:02:51.020> called<00:02:51.760> and<00:02:52.760> finally

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
extra power power is called and finally

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.949 
extra power power is called and finally
the<00:02:53.570> flywheel<00:02:54.140> is<00:02:54.380> race<00:02:55.010> as<00:02:55.220> well<00:02:55.840> so<00:02:56.840> it's

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
the flywheel is race as well so it's

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.170 
the flywheel is race as well so it's
