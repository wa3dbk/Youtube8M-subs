00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.440
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.260
 Yes Hello I eat cage 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.670
 It is today 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.070
 For the first time 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.779
 this 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.779
 It is that raw live 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:35.480
 I think that I want to deliver the information 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.480
 In in the I would like to respond It is this question 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:50.829
 It's a question, will you tell me your time when Mr. Mori was young? 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:55.729
 One day practice I'd like time also tell me I do things that I need your help if possible 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.659
 The Tteyuu I wish how much smaller You're Well small This time is I'm kinda array 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:57.360
 But also 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:59.850
 Well 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.020
 is not it 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.580
 Hm 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:10.220
 So I started playing the game 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.830
 At that time I will be in fourth grade 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.580
 Well 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:21.450
 Personal medley 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:24.340
 I think after 2 minutes and 50 seconds I think I have 40 seconds of swimming 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:30.290
 It is around in to 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:37.520
 That Tteyuu when I started out at that time in about 39 seconds to eat it 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:44.060
 Just for the first time cut the standard record of breastfeeding Olympics 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:46.100
 I went to the class freely, but I regret that I was in the state of second from the other side and there 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.280
 Still though I was practicing from 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.540
 Originally I was a relationship that not only the swimming but various sports 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.610
 Let's go to 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.510
 So more and more out from around Really fourth grade less to say Rutte out in tournament 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.400
 Go 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:05.760
 Originally nobody was doing various sports, so maybe that 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.000
 I did not have the number of trainings 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.900
 The motor ability part is that 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.760
 If anything was good kana I think that's in 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.350
 Engineering project lympics were cut soon, but after all, oneself scrapes each other 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.390
 After all, in some of it was 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:27.010
 It is better to count from above and count dishes from below 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.510
 Even the Tteyuu was devoted from there still is little that frustrated the path swimming for Tteyuu was 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:34.690
 There is 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:40.360
 One day had to practice about two hours I heard approximately one and a half hours in the deli 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:42.410
 In 2 times exercises so it is guess that at that time I do I did not do or at Kyushu 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.640
 2 times practice exists but is Tan 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:49.430
 Not only practice is once a day without train 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:54.709
 Of junior high school second grader 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:56.629
 Say for the first time knew to say twice practice in the All Japan Junior training camp if it is only once in the mountains 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.379
 I did not practice 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:02.480
 And does not mean that it is a good good the second floor once said in manners 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:07.489
 Well that one and a half hours 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.989
 Roshika 2 hours is all after the mess of much be stopped from the direction of really also my coach 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:13.540
 About it was working hard 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:16.240
 Though I think how to open maybe twice so that the concentration has been and body were not the 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:20.220
 It is a one time practice anyway 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.220
 I remember I concentrated
