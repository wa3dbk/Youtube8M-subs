10 reps but uh I just don't think that

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.870 
10 reps but uh I just don't think that
was<00:01:46.929> on<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.109> cards<00:01:47.349> today<00:01:47.579> after<00:01:48.579> that<00:01:48.700> I<00:01:48.729> went

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
was on the cards today after that I went

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.409 
was on the cards today after that I went
ahead<00:01:49.359> and<00:01:49.569> did<00:01:49.659> some<00:01:49.840> front<00:01:50.079> squats<00:01:51.389> been<00:01:52.389> a

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:52.419 
ahead and did some front squats been a

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:54.089 
ahead and did some front squats been a
while<00:01:52.599> since<00:01:52.810> I<00:01:52.959> since<00:01:53.409> I<00:01:53.499> fronts<00:01:53.799> why<00:01:53.919> I'd

00:01:54.089 --> 00:01:54.099 
while since I since I fronts why I'd

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:55.289 
while since I since I fronts why I'd
also<00:01:54.369> doing<00:01:54.609> everything<00:01:54.849> in<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.149> offseason

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
also doing everything in the offseason

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.599 
also doing everything in the offseason
with<00:01:55.689> no<00:01:55.810> belts<00:01:56.200> and<00:01:56.669> I<00:01:57.719> think<00:01:58.719> this<00:01:58.869> is<00:01:59.020> about

00:01:59.599 --> 00:01:59.609 
with no belts and I think this is about

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:03.239 
with no belts and I think this is about
220<00:02:00.609> kilos<00:02:00.909> or<00:02:01.539> maybe<00:02:01.869> you<00:02:02.049> even<00:02:02.289> only<00:02:02.770> 200

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:03.249 
220 kilos or maybe you even only 200

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:06.330 
220 kilos or maybe you even only 200
kilos<00:02:03.579> but<00:02:04.229> we're<00:02:05.229> supposed<00:02:05.439> to<00:02:05.499> do<00:02:05.679> a<00:02:06.009> set<00:02:06.249> of

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
kilos but we're supposed to do a set of

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.979 
kilos but we're supposed to do a set of
five<00:02:06.520> with<00:02:06.849> that<00:02:06.999> ended<00:02:07.329> up<00:02:07.450> just<00:02:07.630> doing<00:02:07.779> two

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:07.989 
five with that ended up just doing two

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:09.779 
five with that ended up just doing two
sets<00:02:08.170> of<00:02:08.289> three<00:02:08.470> instead<00:02:08.739> so<00:02:09.369> that<00:02:09.520> was<00:02:09.640> my

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
sets of three instead so that was my

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.090 
sets of three instead so that was my
plan<00:02:10.090> for<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:10.599> day<00:02:10.780> I<00:02:11.080> go<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.620> little<00:02:11.830> bit<00:02:11.980> off

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
plan for the day I go a little bit off

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.070 
plan for the day I go a little bit off
the<00:02:12.130> plan<00:02:12.460> but<00:02:12.760> that's<00:02:13.120> that's<00:02:13.570> kind<00:02:13.960> of<00:02:13.990> the

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
the plan but that's that's kind of the

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.080 
the plan but that's that's kind of the
goal<00:02:14.230> for<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.530> day<00:02:14.640> unfortunately<00:02:15.640> I<00:02:15.730> didn't

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
goal for the day unfortunately I didn't

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.380 
goal for the day unfortunately I didn't
the<00:02:16.480> bench<00:02:17.080> footage<00:02:17.560> but<00:02:18.069> there<00:02:18.459> you<00:02:18.610> go<00:02:19.000> just

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
the bench footage but there you go just

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.000 
the bench footage but there you go just
working<00:02:19.569> on<00:02:19.750> my<00:02:19.930> speed<00:02:20.230> day<00:02:20.470> there<00:02:20.680> with<00:02:20.920> the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
working on my speed day there with the

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.100 
working on my speed day there with the
short<00:02:21.220> rest<00:02:21.430> periods<00:02:21.849> so<00:02:22.660> here<00:02:22.840> we<00:02:22.930> go<00:02:23.050> to

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
short rest periods so here we go to

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.400 
short rest periods so here we go to
Friday<00:02:23.410> Friday<00:02:24.360> this<00:02:25.360> week<00:02:25.420> would<00:02:25.810> be<00:02:25.870> my<00:02:26.140> rep

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
Friday Friday this week would be my rep

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.580 
Friday Friday this week would be my rep
squat<00:02:26.830> day<00:02:27.040> and<00:02:27.370> I<00:02:27.459> did<00:02:27.670> five<00:02:28.030> sets<00:02:28.480> of<00:02:28.569> 10<00:02:28.840> high

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
squat day and I did five sets of 10 high

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.360 
squat day and I did five sets of 10 high
bar<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:30.640> closed<00:02:31.120> stance<00:02:31.450> squats<00:02:31.900> with<00:02:32.370> 450

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
bar and closed stance squats with 450

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.780 
bar and closed stance squats with 450
pounds<00:02:33.760> I<00:02:34.650> think<00:02:35.650> that<00:02:36.040> doing<00:02:36.310> a<00:02:36.430> lot<00:02:36.580> of<00:02:36.610> high

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
pounds I think that doing a lot of high

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.150 
pounds I think that doing a lot of high

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
low back a little bit for harder work on

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:48.990 
low back a little bit for harder work on
the<00:02:47.410> deadlift<00:02:47.709> and<00:02:48.010> you<00:02:48.640> know<00:02:48.760> continue

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
the deadlift and you know continue

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.580 
the deadlift and you know continue
building<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.690> strength<00:02:49.870> of<00:02:50.049> my<00:02:50.170> legs

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
building the strength of my legs

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.559 
building the strength of my legs
there's<00:02:51.370> so<00:02:51.519> much<00:02:51.610> talk<00:02:51.849> about<00:02:51.880> high<00:02:52.329> bar<00:02:52.540> low

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
there's so much talk about high bar low

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.930 
there's so much talk about high bar low
bar<00:02:52.959> debate<00:02:53.349> and<00:02:53.890> I'm<00:02:54.400> not<00:02:54.579> really<00:02:54.700> concerned

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
bar debate and I'm not really concerned

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.699 
bar debate and I'm not really concerned
with<00:02:55.329> that<00:02:55.420> debate<00:02:55.720> but<00:02:56.019> I<00:02:56.230> do<00:02:56.349> think<00:02:56.650> that

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
with that debate but I do think that

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.319 
with that debate but I do think that
high<00:02:56.980> bar<00:02:57.190> is<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.430> great<00:02:57.640> way<00:02:57.880> to<00:02:57.910> build

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
high bar is a great way to build

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.330 
high bar is a great way to build
strength<00:02:58.840> in<00:02:59.079> the<00:02:59.200> squat<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.709> low<00:03:00.130> water

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
strength in the squat the low water

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.369 
strength in the squat the low water
being<00:03:00.519> a<00:03:00.610> great<00:03:00.790> way<00:03:00.940> to<00:03:00.970> express<00:03:01.750> that<00:03:02.019> string

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379 
being a great way to express that string

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.440 
being a great way to express that string
so<00:03:02.650> here<00:03:03.220> I<00:03:03.250> am<00:03:03.310> doing<00:03:03.430> some<00:03:03.790> sumo<00:03:04.060> Douglas

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
so here I am doing some sumo Douglas
