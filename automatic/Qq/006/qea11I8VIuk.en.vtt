00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
split them with my thread that way the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.649 
split them with my thread that way the
tails<00:01:12.020> will<00:01:12.350> stay<00:01:14.290> split<00:01:15.290> for<00:01:15.590> me<00:01:16.479> and<00:01:17.479> then<00:01:17.600> I

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
tails will stay split for me and then I

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.389 
tails will stay split for me and then I
capture<00:01:18.080> that<00:01:18.200> piece<00:01:18.440> of<00:01:18.590> thread<00:01:18.799> once<00:01:19.100> I<00:01:19.219> have

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
capture that piece of thread once I have

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:28.899 
capture that piece of thread once I have
them<00:01:20.049> separated<00:01:21.049> I<00:01:24.820> can<00:01:25.820> trim<00:01:26.060> all<00:01:26.240> this<00:01:27.909> out

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
them separated I can trim all this out

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.109 
them separated I can trim all this out
of<00:01:29.090> the<00:01:29.210> way<00:01:29.390> let's<00:01:29.930> see<00:01:30.109> I<00:01:30.140> have<00:01:30.789> those<00:01:31.789> tails
