about tuning we approach it from a

it makes sense to be okay with this for

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.970 
it makes sense to be okay with this for
hard<00:00:48.390> mode<00:00:48.570> it's<00:00:48.989> more<00:00:49.170> consistent<00:00:49.739> with<00:00:49.829> what

is they do nothing with hard mode and

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:55.910 
is they do nothing with hard mode and
either<00:03:54.720> buff<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.320> other<00:03:55.440> phases<00:03:55.680> of<00:03:55.859> the

to<00:04:44.550> sidestep<00:04:44.729> you<00:04:45.120> guys<00:04:45.300> I<00:04:45.419> said<00:04:45.660> it<00:04:46.080> should

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349 
to sidestep you guys I said it should

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:49.100 
to sidestep you guys I said it should
probably<00:04:46.530> be<00:04:46.830> about<00:04:47.250> 180<00:04:48.180> degrees<00:04:48.539> at<00:04:48.690> most<00:04:48.900> if

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
probably be about 180 degrees at most if

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.309 
probably be about 180 degrees at most if
your<00:04:49.259> back<00:04:49.470> is<00:04:49.680> facing<00:04:49.860> it<00:04:50.190> easier<00:04:50.699> to<00:04:50.759> hit<00:04:50.819> you

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:51.319 
your back is facing it easier to hit you

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:53.180 
your back is facing it easier to hit you
that<00:04:52.319> will<00:04:52.410> give<00:04:52.530> a<00:04:52.560> lot<00:04:52.740> of<00:04:52.800> groups<00:04:52.979> more

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
that will give a lot of groups more

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.589 
that will give a lot of groups more
wiggle<00:04:53.400> room<00:04:53.550> to<00:04:53.669> squeeze<00:04:53.880> in<00:04:54.180> damage<00:04:54.449> and

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
wiggle room to squeeze in damage and

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:56.420 
wiggle room to squeeze in damage and
healing<00:04:54.720> which<00:04:55.530> will<00:04:55.650> help<00:04:55.740> them<00:04:55.949> pass<00:04:56.160> the

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
healing which will help them pass the

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.850 
healing which will help them pass the
DPS<00:04:56.789> check<00:04:57.030> given<00:04:57.960> that<00:04:57.990> when<00:04:58.440> nightmare

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
DPS check given that when nightmare

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.469 
DPS check given that when nightmare
eventually<00:04:59.460> releases<00:04:59.910> the<00:05:00.030> back<00:05:00.150> step<00:05:00.360> will

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
eventually releases the back step will

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.860 
eventually releases the back step will
probably<00:05:00.750> more<00:05:01.669> whatever<00:05:02.669> nerf<00:05:02.940> they<00:05:03.240> apply

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
probably more whatever nerf they apply

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.390 
probably more whatever nerf they apply
will<00:05:04.110> probably<00:05:04.440> be<00:05:04.560> lifted<00:05:04.949> and<00:05:05.130> it'll

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
will probably be lifted and it'll

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.469 
will probably be lifted and it'll
brought<00:05:05.550> up<00:05:05.699> be<00:05:05.880> brought<00:05:06.060> up<00:05:06.180> to<00:05:06.210> the<00:05:06.300> level

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
brought up be brought up to the level

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.689 
brought up be brought up to the level
it's<00:05:06.690> at<00:05:06.810> right<00:05:07.020> now<00:05:07.160> maybe<00:05:08.160> with<00:05:08.370> some<00:05:08.400> minor

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
it's at right now maybe with some minor

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:10.700 
it's at right now maybe with some minor
tweaks<00:05:08.940> but<00:05:09.599> I<00:05:09.660> hope<00:05:10.080> nothing<00:05:10.500> too

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
tweaks but I hope nothing too

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.390 
tweaks but I hope nothing too
game-changing<00:05:11.400> as<00:05:11.580> I<00:05:12.150> said<00:05:12.210> it<00:05:12.660> is<00:05:13.070> very<00:05:14.070> close

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
game-changing as I said it is very close

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.779 
game-changing as I said it is very close
to<00:05:14.430> the<00:05:14.639> limit<00:05:14.759> of<00:05:15.030> what<00:05:15.539> I<00:05:15.570> could<00:05:15.870> expect

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:16.789 
to the limit of what I could expect

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:19.520 
to the limit of what I could expect
these<00:05:17.789> Star<00:05:18.150> Wars<00:05:18.389> population<00:05:19.110> to<00:05:19.259> be<00:05:19.289> able<00:05:19.470> to

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
these Star Wars population to be able to

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.990 
these Star Wars population to be able to
do<00:05:19.729> and<00:05:20.729> still<00:05:21.300> succeed<00:05:22.039> yes<00:05:23.039> Bioware<00:05:23.729> will

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
do and still succeed yes Bioware will

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.809 
do and still succeed yes Bioware will
probably<00:05:24.690> upset<00:05:24.960> a<00:05:25.139> lot<00:05:25.289> of<00:05:25.349> a<00:05:25.620> lot<00:05:25.949> of<00:05:26.009> people

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:26.819 
probably upset a lot of a lot of people

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:29.300 
probably upset a lot of a lot of people
who<00:05:27.000> have<00:05:27.030> already<00:05:27.210> cleared<00:05:27.449> it<00:05:27.690> but<00:05:28.289> that's<00:05:29.130> a

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
who have already cleared it but that's a

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.890 
who have already cleared it but that's a
very<00:05:29.639> small<00:05:29.970> number<00:05:30.030> of<00:05:30.270> people<00:05:30.360> right<00:05:30.720> now

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
very small number of people right now

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.249 
very small number of people right now
and<00:05:32.360> since<00:05:33.360> there's<00:05:33.539> not<00:05:33.659> that<00:05:33.720> many<00:05:33.930> of<00:05:34.080> us

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:34.259 
and since there's not that many of us

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:36.020 
and since there's not that many of us
frankly<00:05:34.680> it's<00:05:34.919> a<00:05:35.070> lot<00:05:35.310> better<00:05:35.460> to<00:05:35.699> cater<00:05:35.880> to

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
frankly it's a lot better to cater to

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.760 
frankly it's a lot better to cater to
the<00:05:36.180> larger<00:05:36.509> audience<00:05:36.900> than<00:05:36.990> the<00:05:37.259> smaller<00:05:37.500> one

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
the larger audience than the smaller one

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.100 
the larger audience than the smaller one
you<00:05:38.280> can<00:05:38.400> just<00:05:38.550> ask<00:05:38.669> wildstar<00:05:39.210> how<00:05:39.419> catering

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
you can just ask wildstar how catering

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:48.659 
hard mode down a bit so that they have

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:50.270 
hard mode down a bit so that they have
