switches here there are baseball so I
have<00:04:49.050> four<00:04:49.440> different<00:04:49.710> on<00:04:50.539> four<00:04:51.539> levels<00:04:52.970> and

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
have four different on four levels and

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.540 
have four different on four levels and
each<00:04:54.120> one<00:04:54.389> makes<00:04:55.080> them<00:04:55.289> a<00:04:55.470> bit<00:04:55.710> more<00:04:55.830> open<00:04:56.280> or<00:04:56.490> a

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
each one makes them a bit more open or a

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.300 
each one makes them a bit more open or a
bit<00:04:56.760> more<00:04:56.880> sealed<00:04:57.270> so<00:04:58.229> just<00:04:58.470> let<00:04:58.680> the<00:04:59.070> base<00:04:59.280> a

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
bit more sealed so just let the base a

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.000 
bit more sealed so just let the base a
bit<00:04:59.639> more<00:04:59.820> room<00:05:00.030> to<00:05:00.270> play<00:05:00.300> around<00:05:00.750> in<00:05:00.990> and<00:05:01.260> just

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
bit more room to play around in and just

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.909 
bit more room to play around in and just
you<00:05:02.160> know<00:05:02.190> boost<00:05:02.820> it<00:05:03.180> as<00:05:03.389> per<00:05:03.840> step<00:05:04.139> I'm<00:05:04.860> going

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
you know boost it as per step I'm going

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:06.469 
you know boost it as per step I'm going
to<00:05:05.190> show<00:05:05.340> these<00:05:05.550> in<00:05:05.699> the<00:05:05.760> past<00:05:06.000> of<00:05:06.210> the<00:05:06.240> black

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
to show these in the past of the black

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.320 
to show these in the past of the black
version<00:05:06.720> I<00:05:07.400> found<00:05:08.400> that<00:05:08.550> through<00:05:08.729> really<00:05:09.030> nice

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
version I found that through really nice

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.659 
version I found that through really nice
you<00:05:09.660> know<00:05:09.780> if<00:05:09.900> the<00:05:10.020> songs<00:05:10.289> of<00:05:10.440> it<00:05:10.590> base<00:05:11.220> unit

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
you know if the songs of it base unit

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:13.010 
you know if the songs of it base unit
wants<00:05:11.849> a<00:05:11.880> bit<00:05:12.000> more<00:05:12.120> warmth<00:05:12.539> it<00:05:12.720> once<00:05:12.840> a<00:05:12.900> bit

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
wants a bit more warmth it once a bit

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.839 
wants a bit more warmth it once a bit
more<00:05:13.169> bump<00:05:13.380> down<00:05:13.620> below<00:05:13.949> and<00:05:14.250> you<00:05:14.520> can<00:05:14.580> have<00:05:14.820> a

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 
then you know you just step up the base

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:27.020 
then you know you just step up the base
to<00:05:25.830> the<00:05:25.860> biggest<00:05:26.250> base<00:05:26.430> of<00:05:26.610> the<00:05:26.669> second

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
to the biggest base of the second

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.120 
to the biggest base of the second
biggest<00:05:27.150> bass<00:05:27.449> and<00:05:27.660> you<00:05:27.720> really<00:05:28.050> really<00:05:28.770> feel

and<00:05:29.340> listen<00:05:29.699> to<00:05:29.820> the<00:05:29.940> base<00:05:30.150> and<00:05:30.419> it's<00:05:30.780> a<00:05:30.930> really

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 
and listen to the base and it's a really

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.730 
and listen to the base and it's a really
nice<00:05:31.409> feeling<00:05:32.300> then<00:05:33.300> you<00:05:33.990> know<00:05:34.139> you<00:05:34.229> listen<00:05:34.650> to

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
nice feeling then you know you listen to

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.899 
nice feeling then you know you listen to
some<00:05:34.919> online<00:05:35.159> some<00:05:36.060> classical<00:05:36.599> and<00:05:36.810> jazz

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:37.909 
some online some classical and jazz

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:41.779 
some online some classical and jazz
think<00:05:38.909> of<00:05:39.000> it<00:05:39.120> slower<00:05:39.889> or<00:05:40.889> make<00:05:41.159> it<00:05:41.280> faster

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:41.789 
think of it slower or make it faster

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:43.279 
think of it slower or make it faster
even<00:05:41.880> where<00:05:42.150> you<00:05:42.210> want<00:05:42.360> the<00:05:42.479> faster<00:05:42.930> base<00:05:43.080> you

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289 
even where you want the faster base you

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:45.560 
even where you want the faster base you
want<00:05:43.440> the<00:05:43.500> better<00:05:43.680> Pratt<00:05:44.090> I'm<00:05:45.090> you<00:05:45.270> want<00:05:45.419> a<00:05:45.449> bit

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
want the better Pratt I'm you want a bit

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.089 
want the better Pratt I'm you want a bit
less<00:05:45.750> power<00:05:46.080> you<00:05:46.409> don't<00:05:46.560> like<00:05:46.680> to<00:05:46.830> really

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:47.099 
less power you don't like to really

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:49.670 
less power you don't like to really
touch<00:05:47.849> the<00:05:48.090> mids<00:05:48.330> so<00:05:48.900> you<00:05:49.110> just<00:05:49.139> you<00:05:49.470> know<00:05:49.620> you

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
touch the mids so you just you know you

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.570 
touch the mids so you just you know you
small<00:05:50.460> in<00:05:50.610> the<00:05:50.729> bass<00:05:50.880> down<00:05:51.180> and<00:05:52.370> you<00:05:53.370> get

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
small in the bass down and you get

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.960 
small in the bass down and you get
you've<00:05:53.760> got<00:05:53.970> less<00:05:54.240> bass<00:05:54.479> response<00:05:54.720> there<00:05:55.289> and

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
you've got less bass response there and

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.240 
you've got less bass response there and
it's<00:05:56.970> really<00:05:57.389> nicely<00:05:57.599> is<00:05:57.930> effective<00:05:58.560> it's<00:05:59.159> not

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
it's really nicely is effective it's not

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.250 
it's really nicely is effective it's not
too<00:05:59.669> drastic<00:06:00.300> but<00:06:00.659> it<00:06:00.780> really<00:06:01.020> does<00:06:01.229> change

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
too drastic but it really does change

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.110 
too drastic but it really does change
the<00:06:01.650> children<00:06:02.130> of<00:06:02.190> the<00:06:02.310> headphone<00:06:02.699> slightly

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
the children of the headphone slightly

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.719 
the children of the headphone slightly
and<00:06:03.360> give<00:06:03.750> you<00:06:04.110> a<00:06:04.169> different<00:06:04.440> experience<00:06:05.400> and

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:05.729 
and give you a different experience and

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:06.980 
and give you a different experience and
that's<00:06:05.880> what<00:06:06.060> i<00:06:06.090> think<00:06:06.389> is<00:06:06.449> really<00:06:06.780> nice<00:06:06.930> about

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
that's what i think is really nice about

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.120 
that's what i think is really nice about
it<00:06:08.000> it<00:06:09.000> also<00:06:09.229> makes<00:06:10.229> it<00:06:10.409> slightly<00:06:10.650> more<00:06:11.010> of<00:06:11.070> a

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
it it also makes it slightly more of a

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.399 
it it also makes it slightly more of a
semi-open<00:06:11.970> headphone<00:06:12.360> in<00:06:12.539> a<00:06:12.659> command<00:06:13.139> instead

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:13.409 
semi-open headphone in a command instead

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:15.379 
semi-open headphone in a command instead
they've<00:06:14.010> closed<00:06:14.310> will<00:06:14.520> open<00:06:14.789> the<00:06:14.849> base<00:06:15.000> ports

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:15.389 
they've closed will open the base ports

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:17.120 
they've closed will open the base ports
and<00:06:15.990> that<00:06:16.110> does<00:06:16.320> give<00:06:16.500> you<00:06:16.620> a<00:06:16.680> better<00:06:16.830> feel<00:06:17.099> of

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.130 
and that does give you a better feel of

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.810 
and that does give you a better feel of
spaciousness<00:06:17.760> as<00:06:18.030> well<00:06:18.240> so<00:06:18.930> I'm<00:06:19.139> I<00:06:19.669> did<00:06:20.669> for
