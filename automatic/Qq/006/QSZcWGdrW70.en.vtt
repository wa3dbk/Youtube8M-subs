00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.710
 welcome everyone to a new video of 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.110
 this year 2013 I am very sorry to have taken 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.849
 so much in doing another but is that I do not have 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.400
 enough books to teach you a 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.560
 new and nn but like all months 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.430
 asking him to upload a new video and that 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.710
 If I miss my videos, I've decided 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.079
 do other types of videos to not have 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.750
 to wait so long to get books 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:32.180
 for a new and mn and with these videos it 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.420
 try a book tag as well put in 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.670
 the title of the video that are a series of 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.600
 questions related to books like 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:45.440
 normal and labeled me a girl 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.000
 calls fan of this channel that the truth is 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.120
 since I saw that I love and I 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.250
 love how it is company and nothing 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.590
 many times to tag me and we go with 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.500
 the questions the first question has 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.050
 what to do with the sin of greed and 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.810
 says well which is your most expensive book and the 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:07.230
 cheaper because my most expensive book is 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:09.690
 host the guest of stephenie meyer 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.240
 now you can find this edition in 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.370
 hard cover for six euros I do not know if it 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.630
 will have already removed but at the time in 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:21.360
 2009 it cost me about 23 or 24 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.060
 euros if I remember correctly the truth is 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.610
 which is the fat one although I took it with me 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.380
 couple of days because I bought it in faith 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.510
 the fever of stephenie meyer 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.570
 twilight as soon as the one that was going 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:37.530
 to run out save and I bought it 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.480
 and the truth is that I loved the book and 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.790
 now with making the movie because I'm 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.030
 Wishing truly the cheapest this is 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:49.260
 of cody and peter a book like us 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.860
 they taught no inm but it 's that in 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.770
 english all my books in a month are 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.710
 thrown of price the truth that hopefully 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.640
 those from Spain study like this 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.460
 and it cost me about six euros and something 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.110
 the truth that you do not get on video 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.110
 pocket but pocket here in Spain 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.080
 It costs between nine and ten euros and this one 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.989
 It has no pocket and costs so cheap 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.780
 jalados de espaÃ±a good and the next 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.720
 question is with author wade do you have a 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.810
 love-hate relationship as well 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.630
 I go back to 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.959
 to repeat to stephenie meyer because 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.720
 when the twilight boom was 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.540
 I read the four books in a week and 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.330
 I loved them then I read them a little more 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.260
 forward and when I did I saw that the 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:45.080
 cream for so much but I still like 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:48.319
 and that's not that I have a love 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.540
 really but then I hate her quite 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.099
 because instead of writing the second 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.870
 part of games that I liked so much 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.610
 after four years where I keep 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.530
 waiting for his second part and over they go 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.140
 to leave the movie I do not know what is 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.170
 waiting and it brings me the second life of 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.230
 bree tanner that enough was enough 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.540
 the four books of twilight and only 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.010
 why now I hate her in quotes the 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.620
 next question you have to see 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.140
 with the cure is that there is a time 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.760
 time after time, I do not know much about rereading 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.080
 in books sooner because I had 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.560
 less but now as I have so many 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.090
 books to read because I do not have time 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.030
 of rlm 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.640
 but what I did before rereading 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.890
 non-stop was those of harry potter one and 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.200
 again and I never got tired of the next 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.860
 question is what book we read by 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.870
 laziness because while there are many who 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.269
 every time I say that book early and 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.549
 diego there is but laziness stands 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.530
 that are enough but there is one that I have 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.959
 tried a couple of times and I could not 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.560
 follow and it is heart of snow Indians 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.980
 blacksmith and it's not that he does not hook me from 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:58.220
 the beginning and does not invite me to read more 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.780
 but someday I'll get it pride of 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.860
 that the book speaks is to suffer 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:06.920
 intellectual because I do not usually talk about a 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.079
 book to look more intellectual but 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.260
 well it's supposed to do more 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.970
 intellectual is supposed to have to do 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:18.440
 with classics and the latest classic that 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:20.000
 read is romeo and julieta lust that is 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.590
 what you find attractive in the 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.940
 male or female characters 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:29.220
 well, less feminine than it is 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.560
 apart from seeing if the part of the 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.310
 physical attractive I'm going to say that I 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.710
 bring the girls who are fighters 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.620
 mature women who do not let themselves be influenced and 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:45.419
 that are themselves and some male 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:47.850
 that although on the outside they look like guys 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:51.030
 hard and without feelings then do not give 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:53.669
 embarrassed to show them is to say someone 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:57.150
 I have a breastplate but in my 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:58.560
 inside have a little heart and the 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.930
 last question has to do with the 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:06.360
 envy that this book would like you to 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:08.220
 they will give you then in a book that was going to 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.780
 save for him but there are others that I 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.450
 they call more but I would like me 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.789
 they will deny the treasures of harry potter that 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.220
 It's worth thirty euros but that will not be 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:20.430
 bought already but I've seen it inside 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:24.419
 in photos and videos and it seems like a pass 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:26.130
 with with drop-down letters and so on and 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.400
 how I love the world of harry potter 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.130
 I wish they gave it to me 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.870
 and until here the first product I hope 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.600
 have done well I do not know how I have been 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.509
 come out I hope you liked it and 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:41.710
 now that I have started recording record 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:44.110
 another other video more because these days 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.419
 they had to have recorded it first 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.860
 a little lazy now talking about 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:50.729
 the deadly sins 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.729
 See you in next
