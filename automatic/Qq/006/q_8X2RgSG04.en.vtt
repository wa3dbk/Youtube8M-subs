00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
today I'm going to do a test of an

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
original wheelie king servo saver spring

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.760 
original wheelie king servo saver spring
and<00:00:17.770> the<00:00:18.770> new<00:00:18.950> Delrin<00:00:19.550> one<00:00:19.820> which<00:00:20.060> I<00:00:20.240> made<00:00:20.480> up

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 
and the new Delrin one which I made up

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.260 
and the new Delrin one which I made up
now<00:00:21.770> you<00:00:21.830> can<00:00:22.099> see<00:00:22.279> for<00:00:22.430> my<00:00:22.580> test<00:00:22.880> I<00:00:23.060> may<00:00:23.210> have

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
now you can see for my test I may have

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.950 
now you can see for my test I may have
the<00:00:23.419> special<00:00:23.900> little<00:00:24.080> fixed<00:00:24.529> here<00:00:25.180> where<00:00:26.180> it

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
the special little fixed here where it

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.980 
the special little fixed here where it
acts<00:00:27.199> pretty<00:00:27.439> much<00:00:27.740> as<00:00:28.180> the<00:00:29.180> old<00:00:29.330> one<00:00:29.539> did<00:00:29.779> just

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
acts pretty much as the old one did just

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.560 
acts pretty much as the old one did just
holding<00:00:30.560> the<00:00:30.890> two<00:00:31.070> halves<00:00:31.429> and<00:00:31.760> pulling<00:00:32.419> apart

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
holding the two halves and pulling apart

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.780 
holding the two halves and pulling apart
and<00:00:33.230> we're<00:00:33.890> going<00:00:34.040> to<00:00:34.070> give<00:00:34.220> a<00:00:34.250> little<00:00:34.519> stretch

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
and we're going to give a little stretch

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.660 
and we're going to give a little stretch
test<00:00:35.180> and<00:00:35.540> see<00:00:35.840> what<00:00:35.989> happens<00:00:36.470> first<00:00:37.339> of<00:00:37.519> all

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
test and see what happens first of all

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.729 
test and see what happens first of all
we're<00:00:38.210> going<00:00:38.360> to<00:00:38.420> go<00:00:38.629> with<00:00:38.900> the<00:00:39.140> original<00:00:39.589> one

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
we're going to go with the original one

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.619 
we're going to go with the original one
so<00:00:41.350> put<00:00:42.350> the<00:00:42.469> fixture<00:00:42.980> and<00:00:43.670> our<00:00:44.360> vise<00:00:44.600> here

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
so put the fixture and our vise here

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:55.600 
so put the fixture and our vise here
like<00:00:45.079> this<00:00:45.350> and<00:00:51.399> the<00:00:52.399> original<00:00:52.760> clip<00:00:53.059> here<00:00:54.610> was

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
like this and the original clip here was

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:02.939 
like this and the original clip here was
in<00:00:55.789> the<00:00:55.820> place<00:00:59.649> and<00:01:00.649> a<00:01:00.920> stretcher<00:01:01.399> goes<00:01:01.640> on<00:01:01.879> top

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
in the place and a stretcher goes on top

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.680 
in the place and a stretcher goes on top
and<00:01:03.949> we're<00:01:04.280> gonna<00:01:04.460> open<00:01:04.640> it<00:01:04.940> up<00:01:05.000> until<00:01:05.420> she

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
and we're gonna open it up until she

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:20.020 
and we're gonna open it up until she
snaps<00:01:15.280> that<00:01:16.280> was<00:01:16.459> it<00:01:16.670> there

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:31.620 

as<00:01:20.330> you<00:01:20.780> can<00:01:20.930> see<00:01:21.430> she<00:01:22.430> broke<00:01:29.590> okay

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
as you can see she broke okay

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.960 
as you can see she broke okay
now<00:01:32.630> we're<00:01:32.810> going<00:01:32.930> to<00:01:32.990> try<00:01:33.260> or<00:01:33.830> improve<00:01:34.400> Delrin

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
now we're going to try or improve Delrin

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.080 
now we're going to try or improve Delrin
one<00:01:35.650> you'll<00:01:36.650> see<00:01:36.890> what<00:01:37.040> happens<00:01:37.430> with<00:01:37.610> this<00:01:37.820> I

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
one you'll see what happens with this I

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.630 
one you'll see what happens with this I
already<00:01:38.960> know<00:01:39.290> what's<00:01:39.530> going<00:01:39.740> to<00:01:39.770> happen<00:01:41.590> and

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
already know what's going to happen and

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.130 
already know what's going to happen and
likewise<00:01:43.640> we'll<00:01:43.940> stick<00:01:44.240> it<00:01:44.270> on<00:01:44.480> our<00:01:44.600> stretcher

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
likewise we'll stick it on our stretcher

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.430 
likewise we'll stick it on our stretcher
here<00:01:46.660> top<00:01:47.660> piece<00:01:47.930> goes<00:01:48.200> on<00:01:48.440> top<00:01:48.680> and<00:01:50.440> we'll

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
here top piece goes on top and we'll

00:01:51.440 --> 00:02:02.890 
here top piece goes on top and we'll
pull<00:01:51.710> it<00:01:57.280> look<00:01:58.280> at<00:01:58.460> there<00:01:59.500> look<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:02.630> she

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
pull it look at there look and she

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.870 
pull it look at there look and she
stretched<00:02:03.320> much<00:02:03.860> farther<00:02:04.250> than<00:02:04.460> the<00:02:04.700> other

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
stretched much farther than the other

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.050 
stretched much farther than the other
one<00:02:05.119> as<00:02:05.300> you<00:02:05.450> can<00:02:05.479> see<00:02:06.369> and<00:02:07.369> it's<00:02:07.520> like<00:02:07.729> you<00:02:07.880> can

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
one as you can see and it's like you can

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.510 
one as you can see and it's like you can
also<00:02:08.240> see<00:02:08.690> it's<00:02:09.320> still<00:02:09.679> in<00:02:09.800> one<00:02:09.950> piece<00:02:10.220> is

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
also see it's still in one piece is

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.040 
also see it's still in one piece is
still<00:02:10.790> quite<00:02:11.060> usable<00:02:11.600> too<00:02:13.540> as<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.690> goes<00:02:14.840> to

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
still quite usable too as it goes to

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.990 
still quite usable too as it goes to
show<00:02:15.080> how<00:02:15.500> much<00:02:15.740> stronger<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.340> Delrin<00:02:16.790> is

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
show how much stronger the Delrin is

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.110 
show how much stronger the Delrin is
over<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.480> original<00:02:17.660> composite<00:02:18.530> I<00:02:18.940> hope<00:02:19.940> you

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120
