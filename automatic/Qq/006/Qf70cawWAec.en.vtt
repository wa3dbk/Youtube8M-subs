00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
think well I to makes a small issue I

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.049 
think well I to makes a small issue I
think<00:00:45.930> it's<00:00:46.260> by<00:00:46.469> now<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:47.160> judgment<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.789> thinks

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
think it's by now the judgment I thinks

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.049 
think it's by now the judgment I thinks
basically<00:00:48.210> out<00:00:49.200> there<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.100> soft<00:00:50.640> landing

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
basically out there that is soft landing

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.090 
basically out there that is soft landing
is<00:00:51.270> there<00:00:51.570> hard<00:00:52.079> landing<00:00:52.410> has<00:00:52.620> been<00:00:52.829> already

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
is there hard landing has been already

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.340 
is there hard landing has been already
avoided<00:00:53.610> I've<00:00:54.300> been<00:00:54.480> talking<00:00:54.809> about<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:54.989> for

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
avoided I've been talking about this for

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.930 
avoided I've been talking about this for
the<00:00:55.379> past<00:00:55.440> two<00:00:56.039> years<00:00:56.219> maybe<00:00:56.460> two<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.820> half

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
the past two years maybe two and a half

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.630 
the past two years maybe two and a half
years<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.289> growth<00:00:58.800> rate<00:00:59.100> will<00:00:59.489> slow

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
years that is the growth rate will slow

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.360 
years that is the growth rate will slow
down<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.149> little<00:01:00.359> bit<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.809> then<00:01:01.410> pick<00:01:01.620> up<00:01:01.770> what

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
down a little bit and then pick up what

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.700 
down a little bit and then pick up what
why<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.780> hard<00:01:04.049> landing<00:01:04.530> was

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
why is it that the hard landing was

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.149 
why is it that the hard landing was
averted<00:01:05.070> was<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.450> government<00:01:07.159> did

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
averted was it that the government did

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.980 
averted was it that the government did
something<00:01:08.610> extraordinary<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.450> has<00:01:09.780> that

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
something extraordinary that has that

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.950 
something extraordinary that has that
has<00:01:10.290> averted<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.640> prospect<00:01:12.240> well<00:01:12.780> they

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
has averted that that prospect well they

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.160 
has averted that that prospect well they
eat<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.290> immediate<00:01:14.060> immediate<00:01:15.060> solution<00:01:15.840> was

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
eat the immediate immediate solution was

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.060 
eat the immediate immediate solution was
government<00:01:16.500> putting<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.850> few<00:01:18.119> projects

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
government putting a few projects

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.160 
government putting a few projects
speeding<00:01:20.070> up<00:01:20.159> there<00:01:20.580> are<00:01:20.820> reviving<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.840> speed

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
speeding up there are reviving the speed

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.710 
speeding up there are reviving the speed
of<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:23.040> rapid<00:01:23.549> rail<00:01:23.790> construction<00:01:24.119> and

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
of a rapid rail construction and

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.950 
of a rapid rail construction and
building<00:01:25.670> high-tech<00:01:26.670> steel<00:01:27.479> plants

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
building high-tech steel plants

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.190 
building high-tech steel plants
replacing<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.770> old<00:01:28.950> ones<00:01:29.189> these<00:01:29.820> are

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
replacing the old ones these are

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.859 
replacing the old ones these are
immediate<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:32.210> superficial<00:01:33.210> policies<00:01:33.659> I

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
immediate and a superficial policies I

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.630 
immediate and a superficial policies I
think<00:01:34.320> fundamentally<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:35.100> because<00:01:35.400> the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
think fundamentally is because the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.420 
think fundamentally is because the
economy<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.270> still<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.930> poor<00:01:37.380> economy<00:01:37.710> per

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
economy is still a poor economy per

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.910 
economy is still a poor economy per
capita<00:01:38.610> income<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.450> steal<00:01:39.920> eighteen

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
capita income is a steal eighteen

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.210 
capita income is a steal eighteen
percent<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:42.270> u.s.<00:01:42.299> per<00:01:42.899> capita<00:01:43.259> income<00:01:43.619> so

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
percent of the u.s. per capita income so

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.280 
percent of the u.s. per capita income so
there's<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.460> long<00:01:44.640> way<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.030> go<00:01:45.479> for<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.960> Chinese

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
there's a long way to go for the Chinese

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.499 
there's a long way to go for the Chinese
Academy<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:47.220> catch<00:01:47.430> up<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.479> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
Academy to catch up so that the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.410 
Academy to catch up so that the
fundamentally<00:01:49.320> they<00:01:49.860> are<00:01:49.979> still<00:01:50.420> basic

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
fundamentally they are still basic

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.020
