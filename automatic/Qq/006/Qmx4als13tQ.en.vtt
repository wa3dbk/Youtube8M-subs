00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.660 
trick to do that take it fold it down
until<00:03:23.790> it's<00:03:24.660> aligned<00:03:25.620> with<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.250> part<00:03:26.579> you

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
until it's aligned with the part you

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.479 
until it's aligned with the part you
want<00:03:26.819> to<00:03:26.940> get<00:03:27.090> in<00:03:27.290> then<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.410> take<00:03:28.680> it<00:03:28.920> take

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
want to get in then you take it take

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:36.680 
want to get in then you take it take
this<00:03:29.849> part<00:03:30.209> look<00:03:30.569> closely<00:03:31.670> open<00:03:32.670> this<00:03:33.090> up<00:03:35.690> kind

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
this part look closely open this up kind

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.289 
this part look closely open this up kind
of<00:03:36.750> poke<00:03:36.989> it<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.440> open<00:03:37.739> it<00:03:38.069> up<00:03:38.220> just<00:03:38.910> tuck<00:03:39.269> that

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
of poke it to open it up just tuck that

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.860 
of poke it to open it up just tuck that
in<00:03:39.540> there<00:03:40.459> and<00:03:42.079> do<00:03:43.079> that<00:03:43.260> to<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.560> other<00:03:43.590> three

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
in there and do that to the other three

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.699 
in there and do that to the other three
and<00:03:47.629> maybe<00:03:48.629> a<00:03:48.810> little<00:03:48.959> tricky<00:03:49.290> you<00:03:49.410> might<00:03:49.560> not

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
and maybe a little tricky you might not

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.250 
and maybe a little tricky you might not
get<00:03:49.859> it<00:03:49.920> on<00:03:50.040> your<00:03:50.190> first<00:03:50.340> try<00:03:50.870> you<00:03:51.870> just<00:03:52.079> keep

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
get it on your first try you just keep

00:03:52.260 --> 00:04:00.339 
get it on your first try you just keep
trying<00:03:52.560> and<00:03:52.829> you'll<00:03:53.040> eventually<00:03:53.280> get<00:03:53.819> it

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:08.020 

okay<00:04:03.319> flip

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:20.910 

fold<00:04:09.260> started<00:04:10.260> shaking<00:04:10.739> too<00:04:10.860> mom

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:51.180 

sold<00:04:21.550> again<00:04:23.370> one<00:04:24.370> last<00:04:24.730> time

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.890 

ok

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:01.330 

now

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.830 

ok<00:05:03.440> now<00:05:04.440> you<00:05:05.220> can<00:05:05.280> kind<00:05:05.789> of<00:05:05.850> you<00:05:06.449> know<00:05:06.479> give<00:05:06.750> it

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
ok now you can kind of you know give it

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.719 
ok now you can kind of you know give it
a<00:05:06.870> little<00:05:07.020> touch<00:05:07.289> up<00:05:07.500> and<00:05:08.160> you'll<00:05:08.280> see<00:05:08.520> there
