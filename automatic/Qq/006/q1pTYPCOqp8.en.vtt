 So were on different websites

 these websites will have the 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.050
 successes of advance warfare posted 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.789
 with pictures with description with how much 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.829
 gamers course should be there 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.510
 and the interesting thing was that then 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.820
 also secret and not yet 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.710
 publish successes with pictures here 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.200
 was and perhaps the most interesting 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.540
 success of all further axxo survivor 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.090
 Success this sex sex is full 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.630
 complete works survival bonus 12.10 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.150
 gamerscore in German means to do it 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.020
 So the bonus wave is successful 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.520
 yes, that kind of thing and that's easy 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.409
 only interesting for the reason I will 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.479
 Now show the picture that it is so 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.950
 makes interesting I say already 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.570
 again too much interesting but you 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.759
 will now see what I mean by that 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.780
 and here is the picture you see one 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.159
 zombie so i know this website 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.899
 how do you see it ? 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.860
 trustworthy from all the others 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.680
 determine success 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.090
 and I mean if there are several 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.860
 post trusted websites 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.659
 this picture then I think you can 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.159
 already believe that it is true that it is one 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.829
 bit advance warfare will give 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.630
 But now I'm wondering if it's easy 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.520
 only a bonus wave is like it already 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.680
 So here is how I mentioned, for example 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.649
 in the last video this is bonus though 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.240
 the dogs are world and so on and if 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.860
 just once in the middle of everything 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.709
 come five rounds or so on 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.569
 zombies or whether the simple times 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.410
 any longer is that is the 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.840
 question 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.760
 I think that somehow with it 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.260
 is built in as a bonus wave so not 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.240
 that it is just like treyarch 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.740
 that there are only zombies that we have 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.210
 a little weird, I think it is 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.220
 just suddenly at once 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.110
 map changes a little bit darker 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.150
 All of a sudden, zombies, etc 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.250
 I think that's it 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.060
 are cool that at once zombies 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.770
 is installed 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.150
 but that does not change my opinion 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.920
 that I think it's a pity 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.870
 that it's just such a kind of mp3 sometimes 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.600
 mode in advanced victim will give 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.060
 and yes I have to tell you now that one 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.280
 he has little of the typical xpg 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.590
 mentioned that has already posted that 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.450
 which will be initial letter and 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.670
 He has everything tuned 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.980
 exclusive and he said that it was something 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.660
 has to do with zombies and now it has 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.120
 what to do with zombies there is zombie 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.830
 benneteau in advanced office of five 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.480
 mode good that was it already 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.870
 again with the new information to 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.400

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.510
