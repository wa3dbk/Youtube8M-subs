my computer and more or less purchased
it<00:01:26.640> for<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:26.970> reason<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.540> they<00:01:27.659> can<00:01:27.840> have<00:01:27.960> just

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
it for that reason so they can have just

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.550 
it for that reason so they can have just
a<00:01:28.530> dock<00:01:28.799> connector<00:01:29.340> line<00:01:29.909> by<00:01:30.240> my<00:01:30.479> bed<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.960> I

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
twice as thick but you can flip it over

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.330 
twice as thick but you can flip it over
when<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.119> have<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.240> case<00:01:51.479> on<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.500> as<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.189> can

see here I just look I just take the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.550 
see here I just look I just take the
iphone<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.240> you<00:01:57.240> just<00:01:57.479> push<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.020> down<00:01:58.259> lightly

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
iphone and you just push it down lightly

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.709 
iphone and you just push it down lightly
just<00:01:58.829> like<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.219> and<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.240> starts<00:02:00.509> charging

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
just like that and it starts charging

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.889 
just like that and it starts charging
and<00:02:01.250> on<00:02:02.250> top<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:03.240> still<00:02:03.509> have<00:02:03.869> room

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
and on top of that I still have room

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.990 
and on top of that I still have room
here<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:04.619> if<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.009> wanted<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.340> go<00:02:05.460> off<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.670> larger

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
here so if I wanted to go off a larger

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.449 
here so if I wanted to go off a larger
case<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.360> could<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:07.049> if<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.409> want<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:08.280> can

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
here within the next year it is heavy

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.020 
here within the next year it is heavy
the<00:02:29.439> biggest<00:02:29.620> thing<00:02:29.799> is<00:02:30.159> I<00:02:30.430> held<00:02:30.879> it<00:02:31.000> down

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
the biggest thing is I held it down

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.080 
the biggest thing is I held it down
earlier<00:02:31.480> but<00:02:31.659> you<00:02:31.810> can<00:02:31.989> plug<00:02:32.200> this<00:02:32.379> in<00:02:32.650> and

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
earlier but you can plug this in and

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.720 
earlier but you can plug this in and
without<00:02:34.090> touching<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.959> base<00:02:35.109> at<00:02:35.349> all<00:02:35.500> I<00:02:35.769> could

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
without touching the base at all I could

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.030 
without touching the base at all I could
pull<00:02:36.939> up<00:02:37.090> on<00:02:37.329> it<00:02:37.480> then<00:02:38.169> it's<00:02:38.409> a<00:02:38.590> little<00:02:38.859> heavy

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
pull up on it then it's a little heavy

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.849 
pull up on it then it's a little heavy
but<00:02:39.129> if<00:02:39.400> you<00:02:39.489> just<00:02:39.669> drink<00:02:39.939> it<00:02:40.060> out<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:41.530> and

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:41.859 
but if you just drink it out it and

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:44.849 
but if you just drink it out it and
that<00:02:42.519> may<00:02:42.669> have<00:02:42.790> been<00:02:42.909> a<00:02:42.969> bad<00:02:43.180> example<00:02:43.389> but<00:02:43.930> you

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
that may have been a bad example but you

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.170 
that may have been a bad example but you
know<00:02:44.950> I'm<00:02:45.010> pulling<00:02:45.340> it<00:02:45.400> from<00:02:45.519> client<00:02:45.969> so<00:02:46.090> if

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
know I'm pulling it from client so if

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.149 
know I'm pulling it from client so if
you<00:02:46.299> have<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:46.659> forward<00:02:47.409> though<00:02:47.590> you're<00:02:47.950> lying

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159 
you have it forward though you're lying

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:50.490 
you have it forward though you're lying
in<00:02:48.310> bed<00:02:48.340> you<00:02:48.879> pull<00:02:49.120> it<00:02:49.209> out<00:02:49.329> it's<00:02:49.959> not<00:02:50.139> too<00:02:50.319> bad

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
in bed you pull it out it's not too bad

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.270 
in bed you pull it out it's not too bad
it<00:02:50.829> adds<00:02:51.250> a<00:02:51.459> lot<00:02:51.790> more<00:02:52.030> heft<00:02:52.389> to<00:02:52.719> a<00:02:53.280> dock

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
it adds a lot more heft to a dock

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.580 
it adds a lot more heft to a dock
connector<00:02:55.090> than<00:02:55.449> anything<00:02:56.079> out<00:02:56.230> there<00:02:56.409> right

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
connector than anything out there right

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.890 
connector than anything out there right
now<00:02:56.620> it's<00:02:57.310> made<00:02:57.489> out<00:02:57.519> of<00:02:57.669> aluminum<00:02:58.269> so<00:02:58.750> this

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
now it's made out of aluminum so this

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.270 
now it's made out of aluminum so this
means<00:02:59.079> going<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.379> last<00:02:59.560> now<00:03:00.010> I<00:03:00.040> have<00:03:00.250> it

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
means going to last now I have it

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.189 
means going to last now I have it
polished<00:03:00.909> that<00:03:00.969> in<00:03:01.359> the<00:03:01.719> in<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:01.959> powder

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
going to be a smaller 18 pin connector

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.819 
going to be a smaller 18 pin connector
rather<00:03:15.340> than<00:03:15.579> the<00:03:15.730> current<00:03:15.969> um<00:03:16.239> teeny<00:03:17.199> 34<00:03:17.739> or
