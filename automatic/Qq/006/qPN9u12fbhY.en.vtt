00:00:57.633 --> 00:01:00.737
 Our aim is to manufacture a 43 mm Altiplano watch 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.641
 Is breaking two indices 

00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:09.846
 The first record is the manufacturing of automatic clock thinner in the world 

00:01:10.113 --> 00:01:14.083
 The second record is the manufacture of the thinnest automatic mechanism in the world 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.719
 We achieved both goals today 

00:01:16.953 --> 00:01:21.124
 Because the thickness of the clock does not exceed 5.25 mm 

00:01:21.124 --> 00:01:24.260
 The thickness of the mechanical mechanism is 2.35 mm 

00:01:25.528 --> 00:01:28.364
 When you declare two double digits, we have to make sure 

00:01:28.965 --> 00:01:31.300
 We began by asking ourselves 

00:01:31.634 --> 00:01:33.569
 How to design the clock and how to produce it 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:36.572
 In order to achieve the goals set before us? 

00:01:36.672 --> 00:01:39.008
 Of course, we faced the issue of work 

00:01:39.675 --> 00:01:42.545
 In small sizes 

00:01:42.645 --> 00:01:45.948
 Today we have a lot of vehicles 

00:01:46.382 --> 00:01:49.018
 Which is less thick than the thickness of human hair 

00:01:50.987 --> 00:01:55.525
 In order to get the thinnest hour in the world 

00:01:55.525 --> 00:01:58.561
 All existing spaces had to be used optimally 

00:01:58.561 --> 00:02:00.630
 In the mechanism and clothing 

00:02:01.931 --> 00:02:04.367
 Here we are aware of the limitations imposed on us 

00:02:04.367 --> 00:02:07.804
 Both technical and aesthetic 

00:02:07.937 --> 00:02:11.541
 Elegance appears at the very core of the piece 

00:02:11.574 --> 00:02:12.909
 Ie in extreme tenderness 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:14.877
 This watch is very thin because this mechanism is special 

00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:16.245
 It is in turn super-tender 

00:02:16.245 --> 00:02:21.884
 The pursuit of adult tenderness is an integral part of Piaget 

00:02:22.185 --> 00:02:25.721
 So today we have a perfect harmony 

00:02:25.822 --> 00:02:28.291
 Between the enclosure and the motor 

00:02:28.491 --> 00:02:32.295
 Put all Piaget experiences and experience 

00:02:32.495 --> 00:02:35.631
 In the field of ultra-thin watches 

00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:40.436
 And contributed directly to this project 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.207
 Thanks to the company's long historical legacy 

00:02:44.373 --> 00:02:45.575
 We were able to complete this project
