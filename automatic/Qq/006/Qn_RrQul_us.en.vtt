00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:15.470
 hello to all friends and friends of recipes 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.539
 for cooking I 'm our chef and today 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.700
 then we talk together about the stew of 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:23.240
 veal with potatoes 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:27.560
 we need a piece of veal 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:31.970
 maybe the staircase then we need 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.940
 some chopped celery and some carrot 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.940
 potatoes and a tropea onion after 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:42.739
 that we will get salt pepper as much as we need 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:45.399
 once cleaned from grease and dainelli 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:51.260
 we can move on to cut it to 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:56.719
 small pieces then we cut the slices 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:01:08.530
 of this type and after that we cut it 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:08.530
 in pieces further and then again 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:26.660
 now let's put plenty of oil in one 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:29.500
 casserole we put to fry one 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.500
 fried stem 

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:38.630
 we put a dash of white wine 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.549
 we are waiting for the onion to obstruct 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.349
 add the onion to the sauce 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:11.600
 now let's add the meat and do it 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.600
 think well 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.450
 add a dash of wine 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.820
 add hot water to cover 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:03:00.910
 we go up with coarse salt and compare the 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.460
 our pot 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.860
 while the stew cooks us 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:13.980
 we cut our potatoes we cut them 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:20.050
 neither touched nor cut into pieces 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:27.640
 size similar to that of the pieces of 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:30.070
 life the macro indices so the potatoes then 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.440
 let's add about 25 minutes 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:35.050
 before the end of cooking so 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:45.820
 that remain a little firm 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:55.500
 now we add the potatoes we add 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:55.500
 a little water a little more salt 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:12.140
 compare and let cook for 25 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.920
 around minutes and here it is ready 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.920
 veal stew 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.020
