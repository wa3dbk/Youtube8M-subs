hi I'm Suzy Morris another really
interesting<00:00:09.099> medium<00:00:10.000> I<00:00:10.150> want<00:00:10.269> to<00:00:10.389> talk<00:00:10.660> to<00:00:10.809> you

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:10.900 
interesting medium I want to talk to you

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.420 
interesting medium I want to talk to you
about<00:00:10.990> is<00:00:11.440> shrinkers<00:00:12.280> medium<00:00:12.730> W<00:00:13.500> now<00:00:14.500> medium<00:00:14.920> W

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:15.430 
about is shrinkers medium W now medium W

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.560 
about is shrinkers medium W now medium W
is<00:00:16.150> an<00:00:16.449> odorless<00:00:16.960> low<00:00:17.800> solvent<00:00:18.640> additive<00:00:19.179> for

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
is an odorless low solvent additive for

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.109 
is an odorless low solvent additive for
mixing<00:00:19.960> oil<00:00:20.199> colors<00:00:20.860> with<00:00:21.100> water<00:00:21.430> instead<00:00:21.970> of

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:22.119 
mixing oil colors with water instead of

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.160 
mixing oil colors with water instead of
turpentine<00:00:22.660> or<00:00:23.230> turpentine<00:00:23.590> substitute

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
turpentine or turpentine substitute

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.439

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:28.449 
so in essence medium W will turn any

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.470 
so in essence medium W will turn any

before<00:01:15.069> use<00:01:17.130> medium<00:01:18.130> W<00:01:18.579> should<00:01:18.639> be<00:01:18.939> mixed<00:01:19.270> with

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
before use medium W should be mixed with
