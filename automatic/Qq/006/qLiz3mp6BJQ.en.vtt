on how fast you move and yeah and what

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.349 
on how fast you move and yeah and what
direction<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.250> click<00:00:17.430> so<00:00:17.699> if<00:00:17.760> I<00:00:17.880> if<00:00:18.060> I<00:00:18.180> don't

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
direction you click so if I if I don't

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.630 
direction you click so if I if I don't
move<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.779> moves<00:00:19.020> straight<00:00:19.289> it<00:00:20.070> drops<00:00:20.400> very

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
move it moves straight it drops very

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.810 
move it moves straight it drops very
close<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.180> me<00:00:21.300> mm-hmm<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.230> in<00:00:23.070> some<00:00:23.250> cases<00:00:23.519> it

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
close to me mm-hmm and in some cases it

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.029 
close to me mm-hmm and in some cases it
I<00:00:23.910> can<00:00:24.330> just<00:00:24.480> let<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.260> it'll<00:00:25.470> just<00:00:25.529> drop<00:00:25.859> on

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
I can just let it and it'll just drop on

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.259 
I can just let it and it'll just drop on
me<00:00:26.189> no<00:00:26.310> matter<00:00:26.460> what<00:00:26.670> mm-hmm<00:00:28.279> so<00:00:29.279> we<00:00:30.000> can<00:00:30.119> talk

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
me no matter what mm-hmm so we can talk

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.659 
me no matter what mm-hmm so we can talk
a<00:00:30.330> little<00:00:30.689> bit<00:00:30.869> about<00:00:31.050> like<00:00:31.260> sort<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.800> if

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
a little bit about like sort of the if

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:33.950 
a little bit about like sort of the if
you<00:00:32.820> haven't<00:00:33.120> mentioned<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.510> like<00:00:33.780> the

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
you haven't mentioned it like the

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.940 
you haven't mentioned it like the
downfall<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:35.149> the<00:00:36.149> way<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.450> Q<00:00:37.050> works<00:00:37.469> when<00:00:37.800> it

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
downfall to the way is Q works when it

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.970 
downfall to the way is Q works when it
bounces<00:00:38.219> off<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.430> opponent<00:00:39.120> um<00:00:39.829> like<00:00:40.829> when

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
bounces off a opponent um like when

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.350 
bounces off a opponent um like when
you're<00:00:41.129> chasing<00:00:41.340> for<00:00:41.670> example<00:00:42.059> like<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.300> know

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
you're chasing for example like I know

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.060 
you're chasing for example like I know
if<00:00:42.690> Draven<00:00:43.230> has<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> little<00:00:43.559> bit<00:00:43.770> too<00:00:43.890> high

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
if Draven has a little bit too high

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.220 
if Draven has a little bit too high
movement<00:00:44.520> speed<00:00:44.730> or<00:00:45.480> like<00:00:45.690> let's<00:00:45.870> say<00:00:45.930> you're

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
movement speed or like let's say you're

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.279 
movement speed or like let's say you're
using<00:00:47.039> your<00:00:47.250> w<00:00:47.579> while<00:00:47.910> you're<00:00:48.149> chasing<00:00:48.539> you

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
using your w while you're chasing you

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.220 
using your w while you're chasing you
might<00:00:49.469> over<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.190> might<00:00:50.340> outrun<00:00:50.760> your<00:00:50.940> own

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
might over you might outrun your own

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.709 
might over you might outrun your own
bouncing<00:00:52.230> blade<00:00:53.090> yeah<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.149> think<00:00:54.329> there's<00:00:54.600> a

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
bouncing blade yeah I think there's a

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.720 
bouncing blade yeah I think there's a
certain<00:00:55.050> range<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.829> how<00:00:55.949> far<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.399> bouncing

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
certain range to how far the bouncing

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.569 
certain range to how far the bouncing
blade<00:00:56.910> are<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.449> spinning<00:00:57.750> axe<00:00:57.899> drops<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:59.219> five

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
blade are the spinning axe drops so five

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.400 
blade are the spinning axe drops so five
my<00:00:59.760> w<00:01:00.120> for<00:01:00.239> example<00:01:00.600> do<00:01:00.750> right<00:01:00.960> here<00:01:00.989> I'll<00:01:01.289> just

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
my w for example do right here I'll just

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.429 
my w for example do right here I'll just
run<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.590> straight<00:01:01.920> line<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.449> won't<00:01:03.449> catch<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.870> so

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
run a straight line I won't catch it so

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.100 
run a straight line I won't catch it so
you<00:01:04.830> can't<00:01:05.129> chase<00:01:05.430> as<00:01:05.790> effectively<00:01:06.570> as<00:01:06.810> I

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
you can't chase as effectively as I

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.640 
you can't chase as effectively as I
would<00:01:07.409> like<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:08.420> but<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:11.869> me<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.900> set<00:01:13.140> date<00:01:13.350> you

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
would like to but I me a set date you

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.710 
would like to but I me a set date you
just<00:01:13.799> have<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.979> like<00:01:14.100> tone<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.369> down<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.850> turn

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
just have to like tone it down and turn

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.289 
just have to like tone it down and turn
around<00:01:15.990> for<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> second<00:01:16.560> player<00:01:17.040> w<00:01:17.520> again<00:01:17.729> wins

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
around for a second player w again wins

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.109 
around for a second player w again wins
all<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:19.049> elite<00:01:19.259> into<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.860> guess<00:01:20.130> my<00:01:20.340> W<00:01:20.700> which

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
all that elite into I guess my W which

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.600 
all that elite into I guess my W which
is<00:01:21.299> blood<00:01:21.750> rush<00:01:21.990> ah<00:01:22.350> do<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.310> mind<00:01:23.400> if<00:01:23.490> I

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
is blood rush ah do you mind if I

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.120 
is blood rush ah do you mind if I
interrupt<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.090> one<00:01:24.450> moment<00:01:24.600> that's<00:01:25.080> okay<00:01:25.860> uh

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
interrupt you one moment that's okay uh

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.819 
interrupt you one moment that's okay uh
I<00:01:26.250> was<00:01:27.090> wondering<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.750> when<00:01:28.200> let's<00:01:28.590> say<00:01:28.680> you're

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
I was wondering so when let's say you're

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.080 
I was wondering so when let's say you're
chasing<00:01:29.189> something<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.490> guess<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.729> sort<00:01:30.030> of

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
chasing something I guess this sort of

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.940 
chasing something I guess this sort of
applies<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.570> W<00:01:30.869> still<00:01:31.140> on<00:01:31.320> when<00:01:31.799> you're

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
applies the W still on when you're

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.560 
applies the W still on when you're
chasing<00:01:32.100> someone<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.790> turn<00:01:33.000> on<00:01:33.119> your<00:01:33.150> W

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
chasing someone and you turn on your W

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.100 
chasing someone and you turn on your W
do<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.900> wait<00:01:34.170> for<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:35.130> catch<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
do you wait for the to catch the

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.740 
do you wait for the to catch the
bouncing<00:01:37.110> blade<00:01:37.259> before<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:39.200> like<00:01:41.240> you<00:01:42.240> okay

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
bouncing blade before you like you okay

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.569 
bouncing blade before you like you okay
so<00:01:42.810> either<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.560> were<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:43.799> so<00:01:44.130> do<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.310> wait

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
so either you were this so do you wait

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.780 
so either you were this so do you wait
or<00:01:44.850> like<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.420> stay<00:01:45.960> like<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.189> can<00:01:47.460> yeah

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
or like to stay like the so you can yeah

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.660 
or like to stay like the so you can yeah
so<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.030> can<00:01:48.210> get<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.619> W<00:01:49.619> or<00:01:50.040> now<00:01:50.220> not<00:01:50.430> stack

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
so you can get the W or now not stack

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.620 
so you can get the W or now not stack
the<00:01:50.790> passage<00:01:51.090> like<00:01:51.210> let's<00:01:51.390> say<00:01:51.450> you're

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
the passage like let's say you're

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.780 
the passage like let's say you're
chasing<00:01:51.930> up<00:01:52.049> on<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.350> down<00:01:52.530> do<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.100> wait<00:01:53.369> to

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
chasing up on it down do you wait to

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.190 
chasing up on it down do you wait to
catch<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.180> bouncing<00:01:54.509> blade<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.810> refresh<00:01:55.140> your

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
catch the bouncing blade to refresh your

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.310 
catch the bouncing blade to refresh your
W<00:01:55.649> or<00:01:55.860> do<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.130> just<00:01:56.189> like<00:01:56.520> run<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.600> chase<00:01:58.020> or

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
W or do you just like run and chase or

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.990 
W or do you just like run and chase or
dissolve<00:01:58.710> like<00:01:58.860> dependent<00:01:59.369> on<00:01:59.430> like<00:01:59.579> if<00:01:59.880> you

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
dissolve like dependent on like if you

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
just to keep the moving speed up so he

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.490 
just to keep the moving speed up so he
wouldn't<00:02:22.709> try<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:22.950> catch<00:02:23.190> like<00:02:23.400> all<00:02:23.550> of<00:02:23.670> them<00:02:23.790> I

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
wouldn't try to catch like all of them I

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.750 
wouldn't try to catch like all of them I
still<00:02:25.500> try<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.680> catch<00:02:25.860> all<00:02:26.040> others<00:02:26.370> because

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
still try and catch all others because

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.790 
still try and catch all others because

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
to do the alcohol damage on driven you

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.350 
to do the alcohol damage on driven you
have<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.040> catch<00:02:29.220> every<00:02:29.459> X<00:02:29.640> if<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.060> don't<00:02:30.239> catch

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
have to catch every X if you don't catch

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.610 
have to catch every X if you don't catch
all<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.660> X's<00:02:31.019> then<00:02:31.200> you're<00:02:31.319> going<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.470> be

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
all the X's then you're going to be

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.309 
all the X's then you're going to be
substantially<00:02:32.580> weaker<00:02:32.910> okay<00:02:33.599> and<00:02:34.110> your

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
substantially weaker okay and your

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.140 
substantially weaker okay and your
damage<00:02:34.560> output<00:02:34.680> will<00:02:35.040> be<00:02:35.069> like<00:02:35.849> hugely

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
damage output will be like hugely

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.540 
damage output will be like hugely
decreased<00:02:36.660> okay<00:02:37.410> just<00:02:37.650> because<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:38.250> queue

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
decreased okay just because the queue

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.270 
decreased okay just because the queue
literally<00:02:39.150> doubles<00:02:39.989> your<00:02:40.200> damage<00:02:40.590> basically

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
literally doubles your damage basically

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.030 
literally doubles your damage basically
it's<00:02:42.120> an<00:02:42.209> extra<00:02:42.569> nine<00:02:42.959> eighty-five<00:02:43.680> percent

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
it's an extra nine eighty-five percent

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.150 
it's an extra nine eighty-five percent
of<00:02:44.280> your<00:02:44.370> ad<00:02:45.110> so<00:02:46.110> it's<00:02:46.380> basically<00:02:46.769> doubling

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
of your ad so it's basically doubling

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.030 
of your ad so it's basically doubling
your<00:02:47.280> damage<00:02:47.580> almost<00:02:47.989> and<00:02:48.989> being<00:02:49.769> able<00:02:49.860> to

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
your damage almost and being able to

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.199 
your damage almost and being able to
juggle<00:02:50.220> both<00:02:50.519> axes<00:02:51.060> for<00:02:51.090> every<00:02:51.600> auto<00:02:51.780> attack

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
juggle both axes for every auto attack

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.539 
juggle both axes for every auto attack
just<00:02:54.739> makes<00:02:55.739> it<00:02:55.860> so<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.040> can<00:02:56.160> get<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.370> full

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
just makes it so you can get the full

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.250 
just makes it so you can get the full
damage<00:02:56.849> output<00:02:57.030> of<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.269> champion<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:57.900> use

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
damage output of the champion and use

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.100 
damage output of the champion and use
them<00:02:58.410> to<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.620> highest<00:02:58.739> potential<00:02:59.660> but<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.750> w

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110

in a fight but always be wary of your
mana<00:03:19.290> just<00:03:20.280> because<00:03:20.489> you<00:03:20.579> have<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:20.820> be<00:03:21.239> like<00:03:22.140> if

mana just because you have to be like if

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.599 
mana just because you have to be like if
you're<00:03:22.320> using<00:03:22.500> your<00:03:22.799> blood<00:03:23.010> rush<00:03:23.190> every<00:03:23.430> time

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
you're using your blood rush every time

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.580 
you're using your blood rush every time
you<00:03:23.730> drop<00:03:23.940> an<00:03:24.120> axe<00:03:24.299> you're<00:03:24.600> using<00:03:24.840> 40<00:03:25.380> manna

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
you drop an axe you're using 40 manna

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.190 
you drop an axe you're using 40 manna
every<00:03:25.890> auto<00:03:26.340> attack<00:03:26.700> every<00:03:27.480> two<00:03:27.660> auto<00:03:27.840> attacks

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
every auto attack every two auto attacks

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.599 
every auto attack every two auto attacks
so<00:03:28.530> it<00:03:29.220> gets<00:03:29.370> kind<00:03:29.670> of<00:03:29.780> man<00:03:30.780> expensive<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:31.650> you

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
so it gets kind of man expensive and you

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:33.979 
so it gets kind of man expensive and you
still<00:03:32.850> gotta<00:03:32.970> have<00:03:33.060> enough<00:03:33.209> mana<00:03:33.390> fury<00:03:33.720> and

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
still gotta have enough mana fury and

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.539 
still gotta have enough mana fury and
ultimate<00:03:34.380> if<00:03:34.500> you're<00:03:34.620> using<00:03:34.739> those<00:03:35.600> I'm<00:03:36.600> so<00:03:36.989> oh

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
ultimate if you're using those I'm so oh
