00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 so hello and welcome back 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.759
 We're gonna hang the pit here now 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:13.530
 then you can continue right away 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:15.030
 go with the happy harvest set 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.000
 I'm not there yet 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.150
 more so ever in preparation there 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.660
 Drove and I think we have to go here 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.560
 Already almost full we drive already 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:33.480
 Let's go with them here when he finishes 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.430
 turned the carrier of the thresher that 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:41.160
 happens when you do thousands of things again 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:44.579
 wants to say at the same time then will out 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.789
 tricks on fast sneakers so by two 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.800
 Of course, papas are not pineapple either 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.449
 also very interesting to know because 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.800
 have not yet know they want to 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.760
 really two dads and no pineapple 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.760
 sounds weird but that's the way it is 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.009
 but there is so much in it 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.580
 have tasted not at all what I would do 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:12.520
 but I believe that now 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.220
 everything in it should be board already 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.899
 at some point on the efficient machines 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.920
 it can take a while 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:24.540
 you can now really been easy 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.259
 you can already believe the paragraphs 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.149
 to conquer 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.729
 I I know constantly just a 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.320
 I do not really care about that 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.420
 I would have to interrupt the helper there 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.330
 realigning him later does more 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:43.080
 work as that over here too 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.080
 rough man 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.240
 so 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:58.460
 not not punched right here 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.550
 always a little bit like that 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:07.960
 every case here the edge takes the 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.960
 could the big band like that 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.450
 now is running well again with helper 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.270
 actually always makes a lot of sense 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.310
 So much he can probably load the here 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:25.410
 I'm still waiting a little 50 percent 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.850
 there are then we know that such a 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.700
 Tonne can also be at least me 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.360
 rather think they will be 1500, the 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.370
 1500 kilos of the chamber were supposed to load 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.310
 kilo are some you also hear 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:44.610
 that's what i do somewhere 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:47.700
 no sense yes how do you see the prices 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.320
 there are still five left here 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.210
 hours okay since we are now in real time 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.730
 We can play in five hours 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.110
 just loose the whole fields gentlemen and 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:01.500
 to go there that is we get 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:03.660
 still top prices our stuff and therefore 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.260
 now everything can go as a production line 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.510
 I also briefly here on pro7 1500 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.280
 brings the assumption will bring there 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.260
 manage 20 percent year on our 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.440
 used vehicles that we each other 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.270
 1500 get because 9000 for here 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.360
 Of course you could be so nice here 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.580
 does not buy so naturally 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.560
 much cheaper from entertaining than 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:32.810
 he here to the already quite Reinhard 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:36.349
 270 120 need 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:39.550
 it is that that is something quite again 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:43.970
 interesting here is what the price 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:45.530
 so for the liman I also like it 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:53.330
 still there looks very much like 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:55.550
 the lamborghini but ok later then 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.470
 good ps in any case and looks too 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:02.209
 pretty fat but also costs each one 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:06.560
 The maintenance costs even in the 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:13.519
 radio costs almost as much as the 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:16.790
 very thick agroton and watt 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:19.729
 the climber the two the cost ago 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:24.229
 really good, I'm not sure yet 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:25.750
 but what I buy at the moment must be the 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:29.150
 I believe why no sense network 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.919
 if we still have one to buy 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.780
 small robot small very machine 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.250
 to buy 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.700
 then we would work faster here 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.919
 on our fields but does not do any 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.600
 sense because so why later on big 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:46.220
 want to change devices and then can 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.880
 you also have to wait until then what have 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.390
 we're here 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:53.720
 that rough helper is okay this week 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:57.020
 First of all a warning is now 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.729
 from fueled be located to the fight 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:03.620
 right now we need it every year 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:06.250
 I prefer this one so hopefully 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:11.470
 Recording as I said without stuttering 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.470
 researcher of that would be really 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.069
 it seems to me out for parties 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.960
 already recorded when I'm here 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:25.250
 take the part individually as in the moment 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:28.080
 then confuses me that there is always something good 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:35.840
 3000 so you have then full 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:40.520
 its 3180 that means about twelve 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.520
 We have already earned 13,000 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.210
 working for the helper looks like this 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.949
 All food transport is one 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.990
 Coolbox left lying 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:57.180
 Deliver this after accepting it ok 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.530
 seven and a half minutes we have there for 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.240
 front is that's not even so 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.240
 far, okay 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:15.010
 so not so violent dangling here 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.010
 loses control 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:24.320
 for this cottage from the beautiful here 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:24.710
 in the water small campfire that too 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.360
 beautiful 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.480
 The culprits are a bit steamy in the 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.580
 air was not in there now 

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:34.730
 our time 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:39.620
 I am always so very economical here 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:42.670
 Correct work always curious where we 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:45.670
 then need to drop the crate back 

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:49.070
 how do you do that 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:51.100
 and how do you get it right? 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:56.200
 packed 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:07:01.790
 but really we christain under yes 

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:04.370
 that she dances out of the wheel loader 

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.590
 I would sometimes say of now is lp 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:12.230
 He is at the forefront 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:16.540
 You have to be the one you agree with 

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:16.540
 Say that there, stand well here 

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:22.129
 then load was 

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:30.570
 and there slow to Sun and make the 

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.810
 We will then this mission in the next few 

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.810
 crooked
