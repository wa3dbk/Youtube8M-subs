 on the leaf of the tree of the nim 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.750
 the tree of my teacher originating from the 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.700
 India 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.080
 however, he only lives in regions 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.920
 tropical but look 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:13.400
 this sheet is used by people to decrease 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.400
 blood glucose levels

 good this 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.000

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.000
 Water 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.929
 well once serving the water 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.990
 it is added 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.990
 two hours

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.450

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.000
 you can wait about five minutes 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.939
 once it boils 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.939
 Soy is removed 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.540
 and it can be served cold or hot 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.220
 and that's it
