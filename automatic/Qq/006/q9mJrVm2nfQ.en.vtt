00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 hi dear subscribers today i want 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.120
 tell you no more about design 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.519
 nails and about the tool for sure you saw 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.500
 many videos in which some 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.080
 the remedy would be around the cuticle afterwards 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.640
 neatly the film is removed to me 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.410
 it was also interesting what is this 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.510
 the remedy I really wanted 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.689
 protect your cuticle during design 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.660
 I looked on the internet like this 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.880
 means called and found that in 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.080
 America, it costs about $ 20 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.800
 plus shipping 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.290
 And I decided that it was not worth it, but so 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.930
 as i subscribed to one store in 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.670
 the store came the news and I came 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.329
 a letter that our Russian 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.289
 the company made similar means and i 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.289
 decided to buy 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.770
 I bought it and I want to show you how it is 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.960
 running company this el corazon i'm very 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.930
 I often talk about varnishes like this 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.719
 tube looks like it has 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.270
 beige but their news was 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.909
 drawn that happens still pink and 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.530
 my blue well, I'm not the color 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.159
 critical so i still took 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:15.330
 beige one that was what I did not really 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.729
 liked the smell very ammonia 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.650
 reminds a very unpleasant smell but in 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.460
 In principle, it disappears very quickly and 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:27.420
 when you put it on the cuticle smell 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.970
 there is no such stagnation that 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.790
 you caused it to evaporate immediately dried up 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.090
 plenochka and ok you don't feel 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.680
 discomfort and more complaints about this 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.480
 I don't have a tool 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.940
 she's great 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.330
 removed from the cuticle she really 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:48.180
 protects your cuticle the time when you 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.240
 put design i'm excited about it 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.490
 the means and the price and if I'm not exactly right now 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.460
 I remember but in my opinion something about 390 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.290
 that is, compared with 20 rubles 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.610
 dollars + shipping 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.200
 It is very profitable to buy such a tool and 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:08.610
 naturally i will show how i use it 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.100
 during design so look me 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:16.680
 need a protective agent today and 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:19.380
 I already applied a set for a steamping 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.870
 who will be stamping and now 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.510
 I need to apply a protective agent of his 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:30.120
 need to shake up basically like any varnish 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:33.210
 And I will put the instructions that it is written 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.750
 need to apply around the cuticle to me 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:42.380
 it is desirable not to fall on the varnish and I already 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.380
 I tried it on one finger 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.110
 need to make a good layer if too 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.800
 thin layer then it is not removable 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.800
 evenly 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.670
 where it seemed to me that tony is the number I want 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:09.569
 just gone out 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:11.550
 so that later there were no problems in the instructions 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.300
 Said that you need to wait while he 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.180
 will dry 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.780
 about a minute now you can do 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:23.810
 stamping 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:23.810
 I chose a disk with flowers exactly tits 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:52.560
 color we can remove protection pretty 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.060
 easily removed but here the form has flowed to 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:02.090
 rather cuticle nail edge what it already 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:03.360
 so easy does not depart one whole 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.940
 have to 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:11.450
 imechkom but in principle it does not bother me 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.450
 absolutely it is very easy to remove 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:22.420
 see again and there where the nail 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:25.030
 closer fell on remained very comfortable 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:29.200
 shoot it straight light such a film 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:32.290
 removed and I twist and then to 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.440
 it was convenient to fold not to lose here 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.620
 we got a clean cuticle after 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.620
 stemping 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.230
 I hope you this video was helpful to you 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.410
 Liked how I used during 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.419
 design subscribe to my channel 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:53.290
 put likes do not forget to ask 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:56.490
 questions I always wait for them and follow 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.490
 news for now
