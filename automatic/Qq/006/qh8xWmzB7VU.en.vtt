there's<00:01:11.710> something<00:01:11.979> very<00:01:12.159> simple<00:01:12.460> you<00:01:12.700> can<00:01:12.880> do

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
there's something very simple you can do

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.960 
there's something very simple you can do
to<00:01:13.659> spice<00:01:13.900> up<00:01:14.170> that<00:01:14.320> ostinato<00:01:14.920> pattern<00:01:15.370> and<00:01:15.550> it

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
to spice up that ostinato pattern and it

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.580 
to spice up that ostinato pattern and it
makes<00:01:16.330> it<00:01:16.450> sound<00:01:16.570> really<00:01:16.870> advanced<00:01:17.200> it's<00:01:17.409> hard

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
makes it sound really advanced it's hard

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.620 
makes it sound really advanced it's hard
to<00:01:17.650> figure<00:01:17.860> out<00:01:17.950> what's<00:01:18.130> going<00:01:18.310> on<00:01:18.520> and<00:01:18.850> some

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
to figure out what's going on and some

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.660 
to figure out what's going on and some
people<00:01:19.840> call<00:01:19.960> it<00:01:19.990> a<00:01:20.049> diddle<00:01:20.350> or<00:01:20.560> a<00:01:21.190> double

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
people call it a diddle or a double

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.820 
people call it a diddle or a double
stroke<00:01:21.970> so<00:01:22.510> look<00:01:22.690> at<00:01:22.780> the<00:01:22.900> second<00:01:23.409> piece

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
stroke so look at the second piece

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.520 
stroke so look at the second piece
written<00:01:24.190> you'll<00:01:24.820> see<00:01:25.030> a<00:01:25.060> dash<00:01:25.630> or<00:01:26.140> a<00:01:26.200> slash

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
written you'll see a dash or a slash

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.560 
written you'll see a dash or a slash
written<00:01:27.190> on<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:27.370> stem<00:01:27.580> of<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:27.729> note<00:01:27.970> that

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
written on the stem of the note that

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.270 
written on the stem of the note that
means<00:01:28.750> to<00:01:28.900> double<00:01:29.260> that<00:01:29.350> stroke<00:01:29.740> or<00:01:29.979> to<00:01:30.040> bounce

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
means to double that stroke or to bounce

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.700 
means to double that stroke or to bounce
it<00:01:30.520> so<00:01:31.390> I'm<00:01:31.450> gonna<00:01:31.540> play<00:01:31.750> this<00:01:31.930> second<00:01:32.409> beat

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
it so I'm gonna play this second beat

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:42.770 
it so I'm gonna play this second beat
for<00:01:33.040> you

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.330 

there's<00:01:43.780> two<00:01:43.930> ways<00:01:44.110> you<00:01:44.170> can<00:01:44.380> do<00:01:44.560> this<00:01:44.799> one<00:01:45.220> is

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
there's two ways you can do this one is

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.889 
there's two ways you can do this one is
by<00:01:45.490> bouncing<00:01:45.970> the<00:01:46.090> stick<00:01:46.330> in<00:01:46.570> this<00:01:46.689> place

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
by bouncing the stick in this place

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.050 
by bouncing the stick in this place
probably<00:01:47.140> easier<00:01:47.830> you've<00:01:48.640> got<00:01:48.790> to<00:01:48.909> practice

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
probably easier you've got to practice

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.940 
probably easier you've got to practice
it<00:01:49.420> so<00:01:49.540> that<00:01:49.689> when<00:01:49.780> you<00:01:49.810> bounce<00:01:50.080> it<00:01:50.320> you<00:01:50.799> can

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
it so that when you bounce it you can

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.160 
it so that when you bounce it you can
get<00:01:51.070> two<00:01:51.280> distinct<00:01:51.759> hits<00:01:52.000> and<00:01:52.270> they're<00:01:52.899> clear

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
get two distinct hits and they're clear

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.830 
get two distinct hits and they're clear
and<00:01:53.320> you<00:01:53.380> can<00:01:53.500> catch<00:01:53.680> it<00:01:53.829> afterwards<00:01:54.810> what<00:01:55.810> I

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
and you can catch it afterwards what I

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.990 
and you can catch it afterwards what I
like<00:01:56.080> to<00:01:56.200> do<00:01:56.380> just<00:01:57.039> because<00:01:57.189> I'm<00:01:57.549> used<00:01:57.880> to

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
like to do just because I'm used to

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.700 
like to do just because I'm used to
doing<00:01:58.060> it<00:01:58.479> is<00:01:58.600> actually<00:01:59.049> just<00:01:59.860> hit<00:02:00.429> it<00:02:00.460> twice

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.800 

so<00:02:05.710> I'm<00:02:05.799> not<00:02:05.950> bouncing<00:02:06.399> it<00:02:06.520> at<00:02:06.640> all<00:02:06.789> and<00:02:07.000> it's

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
so I'm not bouncing it at all and it's

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.870 
so I'm not bouncing it at all and it's
not<00:02:07.899> better<00:02:08.619> to<00:02:08.830> do<00:02:08.950> it<00:02:09.039> that<00:02:09.190> way<00:02:09.340> necessarily

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
not better to do it that way necessarily

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.210 
not better to do it that way necessarily
it's<00:02:10.179> just<00:02:10.420> what<00:02:10.780> I'm<00:02:10.899> used<00:02:11.049> to<00:02:11.170> take<00:02:12.010> a<00:02:12.040> look

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
it's just what I'm used to take a look

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:23.240 
it's just what I'm used to take a look
at<00:02:12.280> number<00:02:12.519> two<00:02:12.730> this<00:02:13.120> is<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.299> base<00:02:13.540> pattern

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.860 

now<00:02:24.250> I<00:02:24.280> picked<00:02:24.549> this<00:02:24.670> rhythm<00:02:25.030> on<00:02:25.239> purpose

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
now I picked this rhythm on purpose

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.229 
now I picked this rhythm on purpose
because<00:02:26.350> I<00:02:26.620> hear<00:02:26.860> a<00:02:26.890> lot<00:02:27.340> of<00:02:27.580> beginner

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
because I hear a lot of beginner

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.270 
because I hear a lot of beginner
drummers<00:02:28.690> I<00:02:29.019> hear<00:02:29.350> this<00:02:29.500> a<00:02:29.560> lot<00:02:29.650> in<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:29.950> radio

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
drummers I hear this a lot in the radio

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.530 
drummers I hear this a lot in the radio
this<00:02:30.519> beat<00:02:30.700> is<00:02:30.880> played<00:02:31.180> all<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:32.080> time<00:02:36.450> so<00:02:37.450> I'm

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
this beat is played all the time so I'm

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.000 
this beat is played all the time so I'm
hoping<00:02:37.870> that<00:02:38.080> this<00:02:38.200> bounce<00:02:38.470> just<00:02:38.739> adds<00:02:38.920> a

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
hoping that this bounce just adds a

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:50.280 
hoping that this bounce just adds a
little<00:02:39.099> more<00:02:39.370> of<00:02:39.459> that<00:02:39.610> rhythm<00:02:49.109> now<00:02:50.109> I'm<00:02:50.170> just

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
little more of that rhythm now I'm just

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.810 
little more of that rhythm now I'm just
gonna<00:02:50.410> mess<00:02:50.620> around<00:02:50.680> this<00:02:51.070> technique<00:02:51.459> around

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820
