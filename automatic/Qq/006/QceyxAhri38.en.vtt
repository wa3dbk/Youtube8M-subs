the hemispheres of the brain this
connection<00:00:09.540> is<00:00:09.630> interrupted<00:00:10.349> we<00:00:11.340> have<00:00:12.150> the

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
connection is interrupted we have the

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.240 
connection is interrupted we have the
problems<00:00:13.170> with<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.799> patients<00:00:14.460> not<00:00:15.089> only

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
problems with the patients not only

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.800 
problems with the patients not only
coordination<00:00:17.250> like<00:00:17.460> for<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.480> poor<00:00:18.690> the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
coordination like for the poor the

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.769 
coordination like for the poor the
extremities<00:00:19.350> but<00:00:19.859> also<00:00:20.100> as<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.910> said<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.689> be

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
extremities but also as I said to be

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.310 
extremities but also as I said to be
stable<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.670> if<00:00:23.670> these<00:00:24.119> connections<00:00:24.900> are

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
stable and if these connections are

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.500 
stable and if these connections are
interrupted<00:00:26.039> with<00:00:26.279> with<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.880> frontal<00:00:27.330> lobe

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
interrupted with with the frontal lobe

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.650 
interrupted with with the frontal lobe
we<00:00:28.439> have<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.740> symptom<00:00:29.160> hold<00:00:29.429> ice<00:00:29.699> in<00:00:30.210> there<00:00:30.390> be

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
we have the symptom hold ice in there be

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.530 
we have the symptom hold ice in there be
a<00:00:30.710> buttinsky<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:32.460> means<00:00:32.850> i<00:00:33.120> will<00:00:33.360> show<00:00:33.480> you

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
a buttinsky this means i will show you

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.830 
a buttinsky this means i will show you
to<00:00:33.750> touch<00:00:34.070> this<00:00:35.070> means<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.180> patient

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
to touch this means that the patient

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.790 
to touch this means that the patient
that<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.469> patient<00:00:37.920> can't<00:00:38.790> stand<00:00:39.440> he<00:00:40.440> falls

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
that the patient can't stand he falls

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.580 
that the patient can't stand he falls
down<00:00:41.809> if<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:43.739> ask<00:00:44.010> him<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.370> walk<00:00:44.820> he<00:00:45.690> can't<00:00:45.989> do

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
down if you ask him to walk he can't do

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.440 
down if you ask him to walk he can't do
the<00:00:46.829> key<00:00:47.160> can't<00:00:47.399> walk<00:00:47.730> because<00:00:47.910> he<00:00:48.239> doesn't

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
the key can't walk because he doesn't

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.450 
the key can't walk because he doesn't
know<00:00:48.629> how<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.469> do<00:00:49.649> walking<00:00:50.550> like<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.690> child

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
know how to do walking like the child

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.049 
know how to do walking like the child
it's<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:54.149> other<00:00:54.180> one<00:00:54.480> we<00:00:54.600> call<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.930> apraxia<00:00:55.410> of

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
it's the other one we call it apraxia of

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.810 
it's the other one we call it apraxia of
walking<00:00:57.230> we<00:00:58.230> have<00:00:58.379> practice<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.980> walking<00:00:59.340> we

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
walking we have practice of walking we

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.000 
walking we have practice of walking we
teach<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.300> children<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:01.050> stand<00:01:01.289> up<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.590> to

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
teach the children to stand up and to

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.920 
teach the children to stand up and to
walk<00:01:02.190> yeah<00:01:02.550> we<00:01:02.820> show<00:01:03.000> him<00:01:03.180> how<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.420> do<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.809> way

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
walk yeah we show him how to do the way

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.289 
walk yeah we show him how to do the way
isn't<00:01:04.080> how<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.409> step<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.580> he<00:01:05.790> can't<00:01:06.030> stand

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
isn't how to step so he can't stand

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.750 
isn't how to step so he can't stand
because<00:01:06.479> he<00:01:06.750> doesn't<00:01:06.960> know<00:01:07.110> which<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.490> third

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
because he doesn't know which the third

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.330 
because he doesn't know which the third
has<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.299> move<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:10.049> leg<00:01:10.380> or<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:11.100> leg

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
has to move this leg or this leg

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.070 
has to move this leg or this leg
toasters<00:01:12.030> which<00:01:12.750> muscles<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.380> be<00:01:15.080> contracted

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
toasters which muscles to be contracted

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.620 
toasters which muscles to be contracted
and<00:01:16.320> which<00:01:16.920> has<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.250> be<00:01:17.369> relaxed<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:17.939> that's

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
and which has to be relaxed and that's

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.530 
and which has to be relaxed and that's
why<00:01:18.869> he<00:01:19.110> can't<00:01:19.350> do<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:20.640> other<00:01:20.790> one<00:01:21.060> thing

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
why he can't do it the other one thing

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.929 
why he can't do it the other one thing
is<00:01:21.750> we<00:01:22.020> can<00:01:22.170> test<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.650> we<00:01:23.189> ask<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.580> patient<00:01:23.700> to

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
is we can test it we ask the patient to

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.469 
is we can test it we ask the patient to
lie<00:01:24.150> on<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.420> bed<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.619> put<00:01:25.799> his<00:01:25.979> hands<00:01:26.790> here

come sit okay so the other test is with

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.650 
come sit okay so the other test is with
only<00:01:59.350> Romberg<00:01:59.950> test<00:02:00.160> we<00:02:00.460> all<00:02:00.580> came<00:02:00.850> to<00:02:01.240> put<00:02:01.450> his

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
only Romberg test we all came to put his

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.440 
only Romberg test we all came to put his
legs<00:02:02.320> together<00:02:02.530> yep<00:02:03.190> to<00:02:03.820> do<00:02:03.970> hands<00:02:04.180> like<00:02:04.420> this

this<00:02:05.110> is<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.410> wrong<00:02:05.530> purpose<00:02:05.890> and<00:02:06.490> we<00:02:06.729> have<00:02:06.850> to

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
this is the wrong purpose and we have to

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.410 
this is the wrong purpose and we have to
do<00:02:07.210> it<00:02:07.330> it<00:02:07.540> wasn't<00:02:08.020> at<00:02:08.140> his<00:02:08.380> open<00:02:08.830> eyes<00:02:09.119> if<00:02:10.119> we

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
do it it wasn't at his open eyes if we

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.470 
do it it wasn't at his open eyes if we
ask<00:02:10.600> and<00:02:10.959> if<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.410> patient<00:02:11.830> is<00:02:11.950> stable<00:02:12.670> he

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
ask and if the patient is stable he

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.600 
ask and if the patient is stable he
doesn't<00:02:13.840> have<00:02:14.050> any<00:02:14.350> problems<00:02:14.920> with<00:02:15.070> various

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
doesn't have any problems with various

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.600 
doesn't have any problems with various
of<00:02:15.820> the<00:02:16.000> cerebellum<00:02:16.420> yes<00:02:16.930> but<00:02:17.860> if<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.220> patient

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
of the cerebellum yes but if the patient

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.080 
of the cerebellum yes but if the patient
closes<00:02:19.180> his<00:02:19.420> eyes<00:02:19.570> and<00:02:20.040> then<00:02:21.040> we<00:02:21.280> see<00:02:21.580> that<00:02:21.610> he

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
closes his eyes and then we see that he

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.650 
closes his eyes and then we see that he
began<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.450> swing<00:02:23.400> this<00:02:24.400> means<00:02:24.820> that<00:02:25.150> the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
began to swing this means that the

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.640 
began to swing this means that the
problem<00:02:26.260> is<00:02:26.470> with<00:02:26.770> his<00:02:27.070> deep<00:02:27.510> sensation<00:02:28.650> with

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
problem is with his deep sensation with

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.970 
problem is with his deep sensation with
his<00:02:29.860> posterior<00:02:30.370> column<00:02:31.060> cones<00:02:31.390> in<00:02:32.140> his<00:02:32.650> spinal

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
his posterior column cones in his spinal

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.630 
his posterior column cones in his spinal
cord<00:02:33.459> this<00:02:34.239> another<00:02:34.750> way<00:02:35.020> this<00:02:35.350> is<00:02:35.640> sensitive

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
cord this another way this is sensitive

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.199 
cord this another way this is sensitive
ataxia<00:02:37.890> sensitive<00:02:38.890> this<00:02:39.370> is<00:02:39.580> the<00:02:39.700> difference

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
ataxia sensitive this is the difference

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.080 
ataxia sensitive this is the difference
between<00:02:40.530> cerebellum<00:02:41.530> ataxia<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.430> sensitive

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
between cerebellum ataxia and sensitive

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.750 
between cerebellum ataxia and sensitive
attack<00:02:43.390> see<00:02:43.600> this<00:02:44.380> is<00:02:44.590> why<00:02:44.770> you<00:02:44.830> asked<00:02:45.340> me<00:02:45.430> did

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
attack see this is why you asked me did

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.150 
attack see this is why you asked me did
this<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.270> patient<00:02:46.630> realized<00:02:47.110> so<00:02:47.709> when<00:02:47.920> his

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
this the patient realized so when his

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.870 
this the patient realized so when his
eyes<00:02:48.400> are<00:02:48.700> opened<00:02:49.270> and<00:02:49.920> she<00:02:50.920> realises<00:02:51.400> that<00:02:51.610> he

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
eyes are opened and she realises that he

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.020 
eyes are opened and she realises that he
can't<00:02:52.150> stand<00:02:52.540> this<00:02:53.350> means<00:02:53.650> cerebellum<00:02:54.549> ataxia

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
can't stand this means cerebellum ataxia

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.140 
can't stand this means cerebellum ataxia
he<00:02:55.989> wants<00:02:56.350> to<00:02:56.500> be<00:02:56.920> stable<00:02:57.190> but<00:02:57.489> he<00:02:57.640> can't<00:02:57.910> do

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
he wants to be stable but he can't do

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.640 
he wants to be stable but he can't do
this<00:02:58.620> but<00:02:59.620> if<00:02:59.860> he<00:03:00.130> said<00:03:00.430> that<00:03:00.940> i'm<00:03:01.390> okay<00:03:02.110> i<00:03:02.410> am

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
this but if he said that i'm okay i am

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.430 
this but if he said that i'm okay i am
walking<00:03:03.130> okay<00:03:03.670> without<00:03:04.090> any<00:03:04.570> disturbances

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
walking okay without any disturbances

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.490 
walking okay without any disturbances
and<00:03:05.620> he<00:03:06.250> can<00:03:06.489> stand<00:03:06.790> stable<00:03:07.360> in<00:03:07.480> this<00:03:07.720> but<00:03:08.290> when

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
and he can stand stable in this but when

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.910 
and he can stand stable in this but when
he<00:03:08.680> closes<00:03:09.010> his<00:03:09.250> eyes<00:03:09.549> he<00:03:10.450> can't<00:03:10.720> stealth<00:03:11.110> this

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
he closes his eyes he can't stealth this

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.610 
he closes his eyes he can't stealth this
means<00:03:12.250> that<00:03:12.400> deep<00:03:12.820> sensation<00:03:13.450> is<00:03:13.630> affected

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
means that deep sensation is affected

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.520 
means that deep sensation is affected
but<00:03:15.519> because<00:03:15.970> if<00:03:16.299> you<00:03:16.510> see<00:03:16.810> that<00:03:17.110> he<00:03:17.290> closed

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
but because if you see that he closed

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.220 
but because if you see that he closed
his<00:03:17.709> eyes<00:03:17.860> he<00:03:18.489> swings<00:03:18.970> he<00:03:19.600> realized<00:03:19.959> that<00:03:20.049> he

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
his eyes he swings he realized that he

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.640 
his eyes he swings he realized that he
swings<00:03:20.500> at<00:03:20.620> that<00:03:20.650> time<00:03:20.920> yes<00:03:21.280> he<00:03:21.519> can't<00:03:22.650> realize

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
swings at that time yes he can't realize

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.100 
swings at that time yes he can't realize
sometimes<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.790> patient<00:03:25.239> will<00:03:25.390> tell<00:03:25.630> you<00:03:25.870> that

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
sometimes the patient will tell you that

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.530 
sometimes the patient will tell you that
when<00:03:26.950> it<00:03:27.070> is<00:03:27.220> night<00:03:28.110> it<00:03:29.110> is<00:03:29.320> difficult<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.769> walk

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
when it is night it is difficult to walk

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.990 
when it is night it is difficult to walk
again<00:03:31.540> because<00:03:32.230> his<00:03:32.500> visual<00:03:33.010> activity<00:03:33.160> is

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
again because his visual activity is

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.259 
again because his visual activity is
decreased<00:03:34.480> it's<00:03:35.200> dark<00:03:35.620> and<00:03:35.910> that's<00:03:36.910> why<00:03:37.090> it's

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
decreased it's dark and that's why it's

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.140 
decreased it's dark and that's why it's
difficult<00:03:37.450> for<00:03:37.720> him<00:03:38.310> because<00:03:39.310> our<00:03:39.700> deep

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
difficult for him because our deep

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.840 
difficult for him because our deep
sensation<00:03:40.900> as<00:03:41.049> we<00:03:41.230> were<00:03:41.380> discussed<00:03:41.880> before

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
sensation as we were discussed before

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.990 
sensation as we were discussed before
it<00:03:44.450> also<00:03:45.280> is<00:03:46.280> them<00:03:46.880> it<00:03:47.870> is<00:03:48.800> it<00:03:49.190> is<00:03:49.220> it<00:03:49.700> also

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
it also is them it is it is it also

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.770 
it also is them it is it is it also
organizes<00:03:50.960> our<00:03:51.110> system<00:03:51.650> to<00:03:52.100> walk<00:03:52.370> to<00:03:53.180> to<00:03:53.600> do

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
organizes our system to walk to to do

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.490 
organizes our system to walk to to do
things<00:03:54.440> and<00:03:54.680> so<00:03:55.310> on<00:03:55.520> it's<00:03:55.910> our<00:03:56.240> sensation<00:03:57.020> teen

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
things and so on it's our sensation teen

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.330 
things and so on it's our sensation teen
sensation<00:03:58.100> for<00:03:58.730> muscles<00:03:59.120> for<00:04:00.080> our<00:04:00.320> joints<00:04:01.040> and

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
sensation for muscles for our joints and

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.430 
sensation for muscles for our joints and
so<00:04:01.760> on<00:04:01.910> okay<00:04:03.670> dammit<00:04:04.670> ask<00:04:04.880> him<00:04:05.150> to<00:04:05.960> ask<00:04:06.170> the

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
so on okay dammit ask him to ask the

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.570 
so on okay dammit ask him to ask the
patient<00:04:06.620> to<00:04:07.070> go<00:04:07.990> through<00:04:08.990> the<00:04:09.170> line<00:04:09.380> like<00:04:10.160> this

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
patient to go through the line like this

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:17.130 
patient to go through the line like this
to<00:04:11.390> poop<00:04:11.660> his<00:04:12.160> pills<00:04:13.160> to<00:04:14.120> his<00:04:14.300> toys<00:04:15.280> this<00:04:16.280> way

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
to poop his pills to his toys this way

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.500 
to poop his pills to his toys this way
straight<00:04:18.140> and<00:04:18.410> if<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.430> patient<00:04:19.850> has<00:04:20.030> problems

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
straight and if the patient has problems

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.290 
straight and if the patient has problems
he<00:04:20.870> comes<00:04:21.110> with<00:04:21.200> us<00:04:21.380> he<00:04:21.560> will<00:04:21.710> do<00:04:21.830> like<00:04:22.250> this

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
he comes with us he will do like this

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.380 
he comes with us he will do like this
walk<00:04:24.310> first<00:04:25.310> you<00:04:25.490> ask<00:04:25.640> him<00:04:25.910> wouldn't<00:04:26.240> open

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
walk first you ask him wouldn't open

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.840 
walk first you ask him wouldn't open
eyes<00:04:26.660> then<00:04:27.410> you<00:04:27.560> ask<00:04:27.710> ask<00:04:28.100> him<00:04:28.460> to<00:04:28.610> close<00:04:28.790> his

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
eyes then you ask ask him to close his

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.210 
eyes then you ask ask him to close his
eyes<00:04:29.500> again<00:04:30.500> this<00:04:30.710> is<00:04:30.890> the<00:04:30.920> difference

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
eyes again this is the difference

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:38.550 
eyes again this is the difference
between<00:04:31.840> cerebellum<00:04:32.840> and<00:04:33.020> sensation<00:04:34.270> okay<00:04:37.360> so

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
between cerebellum and sensation okay so

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.170 
between cerebellum and sensation okay so
this<00:04:39.560> is<00:04:39.800> the<00:04:39.950> most<00:04:40.160> important<00:04:40.760> things<00:04:40.970> which

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
this is the most important things which

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.270 
this is the most important things which
we<00:04:41.390> have<00:04:41.570> to<00:04:41.750> discuss<00:04:41.990> about<00:04:42.260> cerebellum<00:04:43.100> and

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
we have to discuss about cerebellum and

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.660 
we have to discuss about cerebellum and
its<00:04:43.820> functions<00:04:44.390> now<00:04:45.230> the<00:04:45.710> other<00:04:45.740> question<00:04:46.040> is

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
its functions now the other question is

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.330 
its functions now the other question is
extrapyramidal<00:04:47.510> system<00:04:48.340> extrapyramidal

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
extrapyramidal system extrapyramidal
