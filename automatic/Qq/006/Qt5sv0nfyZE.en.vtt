00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:20.459 
of measure it out and see what I usually

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:21.919 
of measure it out and see what I usually
try<00:05:20.580> to<00:05:20.639> go<00:05:20.819> for<00:05:20.999> three<00:05:21.269> to<00:05:21.360> four<00:05:21.509> ounces<00:05:21.629> of

try to go for three to four ounces of

00:05:21.929 --> 00:05:25.639 
try to go for three to four ounces of
protein<00:05:22.459> and<00:05:23.459> that's<00:05:23.969> usually<00:05:24.719> about<00:05:24.809> 200

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:25.649 
protein and that's usually about 200

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:28.489 
protein and that's usually about 200
calories<00:05:25.939> or<00:05:26.939> less<00:05:27.149> I<00:05:27.629> mean<00:05:27.899> it's<00:05:28.050> all<00:05:28.229> just
