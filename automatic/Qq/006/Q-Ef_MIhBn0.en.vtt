00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 well it him everyone started 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.690
 starbucks 98 and today we get 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.950
 found for a gamma trick but 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.610
 this time it is realistic not 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.070
 as the last 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.530
 I forgive myself I'm not going to make you a 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.860
 little fake at 37 seconds a little trick 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.859
 of the kind 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.930
 I sell to give the real there to brown 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.640
 of then already do not worry so small 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.990
 egg 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.420
 it's normal because it's justified 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.760
 that Tuesday I have a special sound that I 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.689
 am going to write to the point that I'm all a 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.689
 nice little egg 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.399
 so here is now but we're going 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.190
 go straight to the trick it's going to be 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.410
 pretty fast so it's all 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.340
 simply to ride his billion craft 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.250
 30 his job as a lumberjack or 30 and his 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.040
 business forget 11h level 10 and at kraft 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.550
 kraft trait is then a time 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.870
 mix job time good lumberjack 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.220
 I had May 24 in terms of 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.040
 chains actually I took in bank 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:02.690
 because I had moreover I put 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.690
 twice the rent is stupid 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.490
 here and so 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.009
 you are a lumberjack forcher 2h level 10 for 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.360
 cards and slices idle so we go 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.759
 see what we will do after then 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.619
 hand on one of the walls and pasty 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.539
 preliminary that I need these workshops 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:25.850
 blacksmiths have dropped right next door 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:33.500
 rather the drover 10 k for the only the 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:37.970
 happy to backup surf everywhere then 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:44.259
 it was going at that moment that buzz 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.259
 what is fugue 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:53.620
 good i'm changing i'm going to do that for 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:55.000
 debug always 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:02:04.360
 that makes you that it's normal that at the 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:06.490
 drop there go here my bug games a 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:11.800
 shot in tangier than lovers by strikes 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:15.600
 it's the shadows game 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.890
 I was down on the short map 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.070
 I equipped my forge hammer hours 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.070
 2 hours 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.810
 here we are going to forge an ax 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.780
 this possible molosse and do the same 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:42.030
 slicers that you can not 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:45.300
 to do 20 of them and and we will try to 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.060
 nice to have jets that would be estimated 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:53.110
 it would take 34 35 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:55.390
 yes and so so now we're going to them 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:59.730
 break those idle slices and if you 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:04.120
 want from 34 to 35 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.760
 intel you have a 100% chance of having 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:11.230
 a wrinkle and after it's down about 6 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:15.340
 or 7% by an intelligent man if 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:18.640
 or lÃ© but my friend is cali but I tell you 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.940
 jamie miami miami 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.500
 ok I stop then but we go all the 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.800
 break this is the next step I 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:33.110
 want to say sorry me if you 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:35.780
 hear my pad then 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.360
 often shows to show but actually 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.470
 otherwise normally what to do 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.170
 it's you keep your axes that do not 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.430
 not 34-35 turned you from crevel 65 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.530
 like recipes it's too much 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.210
 until the 80's and you're unemployed 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.670
 and everything is there you are studying a 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:56.270
 sick thing so the bay you see 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:58.250
 I really do not have a cold 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:02.630
 found with an offer a ride 48 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:06.650
 payne 144 in for devin paul's craft 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:09.050

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.510
 minutes to drop frankly and again I 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.900
 am grabbed a sale 25 30 in my 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:21.709
 craft we started with the runes so

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.790
 sold in 60 and 134 the 10 mhz 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:37.040
 it's been 15 years since 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:42.169
 it's the least interesting 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:49.700
 second alpine stage so 5100 which 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:50.680
 I was 498 top-10 this way there and 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.190
 the 40 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.020
 this wii so with the lines is not 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:00.190
 a wholesale you do ten thousand cases in 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:03.340
 roughly and finally the rhein that 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:06.970
 are here see so that's 7000 units of 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:09.970
 dude so here I'm having fun because 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.410
 b in ten minutes from europe 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:16.030
 see I'm doing seventy thousand cases 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:17.979
 and still imagine with messi who are 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.030
 much higher level knowing that 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.050
 bella i'm trying to get them 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.979
 like crazy I really do that 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:28.870
 because I really have common 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:30.250
 gavage range to ckoi and to move to 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.680
 next stage which is really going all 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.849
 tear geoffrey a video from elsewhere 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.620
 Well, I'm going to make videos 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:36.940
 presentation of the characters of my 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.440
 end peeps roughly the guys with whom 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.979
 I do all the time pretty much 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:45.729
 all together yes and so b so I want 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:47.949
 presented there will be a cra do a stadium 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.400
 ifo is an elected to already I think he 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:51.400
 accepted 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:54.430
 we will see that in any case the stadium 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.139
 fear it's almost safe bay so voila 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.720
 it was for a little tip kawa so 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:01.860
 I hope you liked it 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.639
 see there I have for about 80000 that a 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:07.210
 invented I did only 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:10.870
 finally h and again I have not had a bowl at 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.820
 level of rhein there and more 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.860
 that we were at 65 high unemployment and so 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.520
 It's awesome 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.979
 so I advise you very strongly 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:22.240
 this trick if you can perform 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:23.830
 it's really a great trick 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.539
 you really repeat yourself the whole 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.099
 day the job and at the end of the day 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:29.169
 you kraft and all your shovels from 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:31.169
 all your axes forgive excuse me and 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:35.139
 like that the next morning 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:38.680
 maybe happy if not for a lumberjack 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:41.919
 minors if you want a little tutorial I 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.360
 you will do but otherwise a big woodcutter 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:44.530
 you really need to make and make potions 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.249
 of chips you can not too much because 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.479
 to buy the woods 

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:49.399
 all made chipping compressions of 

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:50.839
 wood the bel20 if you want but me 

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:53.899
 I kept my rents could for 

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:56.359
 finally for but for my h and for 

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:58.849
 get but me as needed from 

00:06:56.359 --> 00:07:00.139
 cobalt I first geminated after I 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:01.609
 makes good ideas to the minute for 

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:03.439
 a little earlier 

00:07:01.609 --> 00:07:06.979
 I am not aiming to raise funds 

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:08.839
 for purpose of up and so b like that has me 

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:10.099
 allowed to be and as it is necessary that 

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:11.299
 cobalt and like more or cobalt it costs 

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:13.999
 dear it's thirty thousand the 100 on my 

00:07:11.299 --> 00:07:15.349
 waiter the camel 6 and walnut too 

00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:19.159
 so that makes 66 

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:22.759
 by and large if you if you pay to do 

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:25.459
 20 pm do you do you do 120% of 

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:27.079
 rocket that kind of it costs you 59 

00:07:25.459 --> 00:07:28.939
 because it's just three sailboats on 

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:33.110
 the multi projects that 60 66 that three 

00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:35.329
 months so b actually you multiple and at 

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:36.679
 apparent calm although 3 I think but 

00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:39.079
 good is still better my job 

00:07:36.679 --> 00:07:39.979
 we really have 100% bnf apart from 

00:07:39.079 --> 00:07:42.289
 apps but hey what's that 

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:44.109
 the api happily bomb and I hope 

00:07:42.289 --> 00:07:46.339
