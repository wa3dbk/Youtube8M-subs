 not this we already have this pig 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.730
 for the simple fact that he uses it 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.470
 quite at war and now I do not have to 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.019
 ask for them now I just do it myself 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.760
 the best three I ask in the castle of 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:35.499
 war what do I know maybe a witch 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.600
 a little Valkyrie that board that 

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:39.609
 bust very beast and the truth is that 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.039
 I'm doing very well there, we receive four 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:44.859
 ride pigs of Mr. Javi at level 3 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:47.019

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:49.479
 what do you want and we're going to ask you 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.100
 I'm so excited that I have many 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:53.649
 point out why I'm getting up 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.379
 nervous so let's see a village 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:59.440
 have a pretty nice motive 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:03.609
 not with sympathetic I mean to give us 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.560
 very much played not a mutiny squeeze him to see 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:06.870
 how can this be no more or less what 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.000
 What I'm looking for is a village 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.500
 so that someone really seems 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.440
 rides pigs that is a very attack 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.900
 pimp that I do not know what to imply them 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.000
 Town Hall 8 comments pigs not because 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.920
 is in level 1 and maybe not 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.260
 they could arrive but we are going to look for something 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.700
 that is equal of conditions no no 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.530
 let's search for example a 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.970
 councils to the maximum for example this 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.160
 town hall that is a town hall ten 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.680
 out there though not there to see the wall 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.200
 Low such goes slow and super blind ball 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.120
 city ​​hall 9 do not be that we're not going to 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.610
 I do not care what you say you are 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.300
 a coward because it 's the sad thing is not 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.860
 guys, it's not that story, I know it 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.360
 my mother to see let's look is it already 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.760
 I tell you that I do not want to be 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.310
 here looking for ten years and by the way 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.140
 tell you that many thanks to all x that 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.960
 I like to say I do not know in every video that 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.280
 I do love to remember then nothing that 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.650
 I really like that you are out there and such 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.570
 and share the videos with you 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.160
 friends you know that lately I was 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.300
 attacking a lot what comes 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.710
 being town hall at level 8 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.510
 City councils above all older than me 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.780
 in the videos although I have not noticed 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.150
 but yes I did but it was not 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.700
 by the way I would like to touch now a 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.860
 City Hall not so much City Hall but 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.140
 that had enough elixir of dark 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.790
 because he has spent a lot on me 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.860
 has spent a lot on the rest is a 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.569
 town hall 8 pretty to say pretty 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.600
 come on, let's attack this 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.239
 example a very exemplary example let's 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.130
 see her this payroll I want dark elixir and 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.020
 I'm not leaving this list 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.730
 Like this list, it seems much more 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.349
 funny 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.840
 has 4 by 400 the chest is compressed 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.700
 I do not know if and you do not have me there with what 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.310
 I 've spent myself and now for now 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.569
 I need at least that I know 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.480
 better but I think it's too much 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.069
 peron village very normalita so 500 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.290
 it may be fine for example to see 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.760
 are going to go directly to the 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.280
 defenses with putting a few 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.819
 rides pigs but is not apart 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.170
 I want I do not want it to be a booty like that or 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.870
 you get a booty so I know we're not going 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.060
 to get it but imagine what 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.450
 we make 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.810
 you imagine neither of cogna no no of coña no 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.849
 come on let's go let's see what it gives me 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.349
 Well, this one is very good too, so 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:20.239
 let's go for this pull though 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.520
 I think he has the bombs in there 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.519
 inside yes there is a look to have a 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.380
 giant bomb and another one that you flip so 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.600
 what are we going to do 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.580
 this is the dilemma enter or not enter and 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.930
 where we enter the first thing that I 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.730
 would like to take off would be the actor of 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.200
 magicians so let's go in is that there 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.480
 we can enter straight here we go to 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.850
 try to enter diagonally so 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.740
 first of all let's go to it let's 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.020
 throw a mountain batch here today 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.650
 perfect pigs together with a first 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:51.200
 cure is worth once there it comes in very well 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.970
 it's ok and the perfect tesla comes in 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.640
 nothing I want on the other hand making a 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.380
 little bit of who says a little bit of 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.930
 bait not to the sap that there was a bomb 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.260
 It was very clear uncle was very clear 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.880
 the water is clearer than the best 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.530
 I do the comparison because if I do not 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.850
 you say what favors you could 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.980
 have saved because I can not do it 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.240
 save something happens on my channel and if I do not 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.350
 I have to load something so if you do not 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.870
 saving by the way I'm going to throw 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.000
 one of these here perfect does not come 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.010
 still my mother first is here with 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.010
 mounts pigs first is here that I 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.140
 I just looked like I do not know if it's me today 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.150
 that's good I think it's pretty good 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.580
 in attack if there are enough cities and 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.410
 foxes I do not know because enough foxes 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.060
 but there are not enough hogs like that 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.230
 that I am very happy there the rival neighborhood 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.030
 saying this what 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.190
 they do not stop passing doors up and 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.000
 down then nothing simply you 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.830
 you have to stay there 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.300
 now they will start now look at the king 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.830
 it's super quiet here what I 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.480
 I really like the pigs 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.760
 You have to jump the walls are super 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.800
 fast they go for the defenses and they leave 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.060
 what they see is the whole village 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.040
 so that the barbarian king then go 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.390
 little by little stealing everything 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.000
 you need to see there is one minute left and something 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.110
 there are still quite a few things though 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.970
 I would like someone to knock down the 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.770
 City Council sincerely to see what 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.870
 we are doing gentlemen do not you put 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.040
 there to throw that, my mother, my mother, to 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.630
 see how we do it because the king 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.060
 barbarian I think he's going to fuck us up 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.560
 for the simple fact that it does not 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.570
 we have the beat on the river but be like 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.310
 do not go my rival to put and still 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.230
 is level 5 thing that I think is not going 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.180
 to do anything to notice more of me is that I 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.490
 they are bursting every time they go there 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.900
 bust me so just that 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.700
 let's do good they're going to do what 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.950
 rides pigs this simply is already 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.780
 wait or wait for then for 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.220
 example the pig rides and this one have a 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.440
 little bit of luck and they all go to the 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.090
 once for the town hall for example and 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.950
 that immediately go directly to 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.810
 for look to see you are not going to miss the 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.210
 votes but I'm going to get three trips and 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.740
 medium and he's going to send me to my house 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.930
 It will cost me in bed 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.310
 here behind so imagine mothers being 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.599
 they are fighting for king barbarians me 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.729
 I would like to do a little zuma there 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:48.889
 to see the fight how is hitting a 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:50.389
 authentic beating and perfect vale 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:51.650
 voucher voucher voucher voucher voucher 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:52.970
 I like I like all the 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.370
 you ride because then this will last 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.620
 nothing and now they are going for this very well 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.630
 well uncle now yes yes now perfect 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.580
 perfect I think it will not give me 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.199
 time because good because it always gets 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.229
 well I think yes yes it will give me 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:05.229
 weather 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:10.499
 perfect I loved you do not have to do 

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:13.289
 the corners that is the last building 

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:15.059
 30 seconds ahead of 30 seconds 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:16.469
 separate us from a victory that also 

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:18.629
 it can be said that we were separated 

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:20.969
 four hits and we have achieved a 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:24.539
 montonazo or hundred and something of each 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:26.309
 one hundred and something thousand out of every 1 676 of 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:28.949
 dark isr that is very good blackjack 

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:30.659
 100% cup to a town hall 8 the truth 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:33.150
 is that this attack has made me feel very 

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:36.210
 I would like to share it with the whole clan 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:38.520
 to see how it is shared I am not very very 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.770
 active skills share attacks 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:44.399
 let's see repeat sharing 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:46.620
 perfect tomorrow's video is worth having 

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:48.479
 capital block activated but does not pass 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.009
 absolutely nothing because then because to 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:51.330
 from here I simply have to 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:53.219
 tell you that we are going to see each other in the 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.779
 next video meanwhile to a like 

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:56.309
 in favorites they help a button see you 

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:59.689
 in the next video a greeting to all 

00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:59.689
 and good bye
