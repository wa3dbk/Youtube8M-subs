bicycle<00:00:05.609> this<00:00:05.730> has<00:00:05.970> been<00:00:06.750> out<00:00:06.870> in<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.020> shed

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
bicycle this has been out in the shed

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.839 
bicycle this has been out in the shed
for<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.500> long<00:00:07.649> time<00:00:07.919> I<00:00:07.950> just<00:00:08.280> remembered<00:00:08.580> I<00:00:08.670> had

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
for a long time I just remembered I had

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.459 
for a long time I just remembered I had
it<00:00:08.970> when<00:00:09.059> I<00:00:09.120> started<00:00:09.420> shooting<00:00:09.480> all<00:00:10.050> these

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
it when I started shooting all these

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:11.770 
it when I started shooting all these
bike<00:00:10.679> videos<00:00:11.010> that<00:00:11.190> have<00:00:11.280> been<00:00:11.309> going<00:00:11.460> lately

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:11.780 
bike videos that have been going lately

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.950 
bike videos that have been going lately
so<00:00:12.780> see<00:00:13.139> you<00:00:13.200> get<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.469> Campagnolo<00:00:14.750> gruppo<00:00:15.750> on

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
so see you get the Campagnolo gruppo on

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.480 
so see you get the Campagnolo gruppo on
there<00:00:18.500> remember<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:19.650> one<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.039> San<00:00:20.250> Marco

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
there remember this one the San Marco

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.490 
there remember this one the San Marco

got<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.400> figure<00:00:29.609> out<00:00:29.640> where<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:29.849> put<00:00:30.029> my<00:00:30.150> shoes

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
got to figure out where I put my shoes

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.020 
got to figure out where I put my shoes
for<00:00:30.599> those<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.679> frame<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.369> made<00:00:32.820> of

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
for those and the frame is made of

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.900 
for those and the frame is made of
aluminum<00:00:33.899> with<00:00:34.260> carbon-fiber<00:00:34.980> tube<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:35.760> it's

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
aluminum with carbon-fiber tube so it's

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.250

shifters anybody remember this brand
name<00:00:58.699> and<00:01:01.640> just<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.699> good<00:01:02.850> old<00:01:03.000> bike<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.359> was<00:01:03.449> a

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
name and just a good old bike it was a

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.390 
name and just a good old bike it was a
lot<00:01:03.600> flexi<00:01:04.049> er<00:01:04.080> than<00:01:04.260> my<00:01:04.409> old<00:01:04.559> steel<00:01:04.799> bike<00:01:05.010> that

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
lot flexi er than my old steel bike that

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.469 
lot flexi er than my old steel bike that
was<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.670> thing<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:05.850> took<00:01:05.970> some<00:01:06.270> getting

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
was the thing that took some getting

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.940 
was the thing that took some getting
used<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.720> when<00:01:07.080> you're<00:01:07.260> descending<00:01:07.740> going

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
used to when you're descending going

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.510 
used to when you're descending going
fast<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.570> it<00:01:09.570> would<00:01:10.080> get<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.710> lot<00:01:10.920> more<00:01:10.950> squirmy

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
fast is it would get a lot more squirmy

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.870 
fast is it would get a lot more squirmy
than<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.760> steel<00:01:12.180> bike<00:01:12.420> would<00:01:12.689> but<00:01:13.549> never<00:01:14.549> let<00:01:14.760> me

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
than a steel bike would but never let me

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.280 
than a steel bike would but never let me

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
down in the corners you just have to get

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.789 
down in the corners you just have to get
used<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.710> like<00:01:16.830> an<00:01:16.979> old<00:01:17.100> Japanese<00:01:18.680> you<00:01:19.680> know

that's<00:01:37.290> my<00:01:37.530> bike<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.920> then<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.130> course<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.400> got

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
that's my bike and then of course it got

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.380
