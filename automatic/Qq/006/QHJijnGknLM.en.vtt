00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.730 

another<00:00:02.370> liver<00:00:02.879> right<00:00:03.419> of<00:00:03.750> course<00:00:04.319> it's<00:00:04.560> right

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
another liver right of course it's right

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.430 
another liver right of course it's right
because<00:00:05.100> it<00:00:05.250> looks<00:00:05.430> exactly<00:00:05.759> like<00:00:06.000> liver<00:00:06.660> here

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
because it looks exactly like liver here

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.370 
because it looks exactly like liver here
are<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.620> cards<00:00:08.300> sinusoids<00:00:09.300> here's<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:09.900> portal

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
are the cards sinusoids here's a portal

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.190 
are the cards sinusoids here's a portal
area<00:00:10.679> what<00:00:11.639> instantly<00:00:12.179> bothers<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:12.990> however

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
is you got these little white areas all

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.240 
is you got these little white areas all
over<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:16.590> place<00:00:16.859> like<00:00:17.730> stars<00:00:18.119> in<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.480> sky<00:00:18.779> are

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
over the place like stars in the sky are

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.490 
over the place like stars in the sky are
snowflakes<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.960> you<00:00:21.960> know<00:00:22.080> they<00:00:22.230> shouldn't

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
snowflakes and you know they shouldn't

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.679 
snowflakes and you know they shouldn't
be<00:00:22.650> in<00:00:22.830> liver<00:00:23.130> let's<00:00:23.670> take<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.850> look<00:00:24.119> at<00:00:24.240> any<00:00:24.390> one

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
be in liver let's take a look at any one

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.470 
be in liver let's take a look at any one
of<00:00:24.720> them<00:00:24.930> would<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:26.279> like<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.699> randomly<00:00:26.910> look

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
of them would you like to randomly look

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.580 
of them would you like to randomly look
at<00:00:27.630> this<00:00:27.779> one<00:00:28.050> okay<00:00:28.920> let's<00:00:29.550> look<00:00:29.699> at<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.590> well

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
at this one okay let's look at it well

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.040 
at this one okay let's look at it well
it's<00:00:31.890> within<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.940> liver<00:00:33.239> like<00:00:33.510> all<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.899> other

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
it's within the liver like all the other

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:43.240 
it's within the liver like all the other
ones<00:00:34.320> are<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:35.390> you'll<00:00:36.390> notice<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:39.800> it<00:00:40.800> has

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
ones are and you'll notice that it has

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.619 
ones are and you'll notice that it has
circular<00:00:44.480> spaces<00:00:45.480> filled<00:00:46.440> with<00:00:46.980> slightly

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
circular spaces filled with slightly

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:54.229 
circular spaces filled with slightly
refractile<00:00:49.190> well-defined<00:00:50.899> little<00:00:53.239> sphere

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
refractile well-defined little sphere

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.430 
refractile well-defined little sphere
yewll's<00:00:54.539> like<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:56.149> so<00:00:57.149> reminiscent<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:58.140> all

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
yewll's like this so reminiscent of all

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.080 
yewll's like this so reminiscent of all
the<00:00:59.570> fungal<00:01:00.570> yeast<00:01:00.930> forms<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.649> we<00:01:01.859> saw<00:01:02.100> this

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
the fungal yeast forms that we saw this

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.679 
the fungal yeast forms that we saw this
is<00:01:03.329> Greta<00:01:03.600> caucus<00:01:04.320> if<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.790> remember<00:01:06.360> when<00:01:06.570> we

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
is Greta caucus if you remember when we

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.990 
is Greta caucus if you remember when we
saw<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:06.990> cryptococcal<00:01:07.710> meningitis<00:01:08.000> it

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
saw the cryptococcal meningitis it

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.600 
saw the cryptococcal meningitis it
looked<00:01:09.299> exactly<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.960> same<00:01:10.110> if<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:11.310> were<00:01:11.340> to

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
looked exactly the same if you were to

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.969 
looked exactly the same if you were to
take<00:01:11.820> these<00:01:12.119> little<00:01:12.390> yeasts<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.020> put<00:01:13.770> them<00:01:13.890> in

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
take these little yeasts and put them in

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.100 
take these little yeasts and put them in
the<00:01:14.130> spinal<00:01:14.460> fluid<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.119> put<00:01:15.270> India<00:01:15.630> ink<00:01:15.869> on

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
the spinal fluid and put India ink on

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.160 
the spinal fluid and put India ink on
them<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:17.009> would<00:01:17.220> also<00:01:17.250> show<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:18.420> little<00:01:18.600> halo

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
them it would also show this little halo

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.240 
them it would also show this little halo
pattern<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.549> all<00:01:20.790> crypto<00:01:21.509> caucus<00:01:22.250> this

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
pattern this is all crypto caucus this

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.140 
pattern this is all crypto caucus this
is<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.549> extensive<00:01:25.310> cryptococcus<00:01:26.310> involvement

is a extensive cryptococcus involvement
of<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.450> liver<00:01:28.070> could<00:01:29.070> very<00:01:29.340> very<00:01:29.700> likely<00:01:30.090> be

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
of a liver could very very likely be

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.350 
of a liver could very very likely be
that<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:31.860> patient<00:01:32.130> was<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.909> very

the other conditions that might lead the

the other conditions that might lead the

notice<00:01:50.570> it's<00:01:51.570> not<00:01:51.659> cirrhotic<00:01:53.000> notice<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.420> it

notice it's not cirrhotic notice that it

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.020 
notice it's not cirrhotic notice that it
is<00:01:54.930> just<00:01:55.170> overrun<00:01:55.860> with<00:01:56.250> these<00:01:57.180> little<00:01:57.920> crypto

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
is just overrun with these little crypto
