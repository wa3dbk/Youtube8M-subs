the<00:00:19.510> third<00:00:20.519> set<00:00:21.519> second<00:00:22.029> expansion<00:00:22.539> I<00:00:22.810> guess

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
the third set second expansion I guess

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.600 
the third set second expansion I guess
you<00:00:23.110> could<00:00:23.260> say<00:00:23.289> yeah

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
you could say yeah

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.420 
you could say yeah
so<00:00:25.090> still<00:00:25.420> 1999<00:00:26.110> I<00:00:26.320> guess<00:00:26.530> it<00:00:26.680> was<00:00:26.770> October

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
so still 1999 I guess it was October

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.910 
so still 1999 I guess it was October
1999<00:00:28.180> when<00:00:28.420> this<00:00:28.539> was<00:00:28.660> released<00:00:28.990> another<00:00:29.590> tiny

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 
1999 when this was released another tiny

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.779 
1999 when this was released another tiny
little<00:00:30.340> expansion<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:31.810> think<00:00:32.410> I<00:00:32.760> might<00:00:33.760> be

00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:33.789 
little expansion I think I might be

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:35.340 
little expansion I think I might be
wrong<00:00:34.030> in<00:00:34.180> this<00:00:34.270> I<00:00:34.359> think<00:00:34.390> it's<00:00:34.629> another<00:00:34.840> 48

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350
