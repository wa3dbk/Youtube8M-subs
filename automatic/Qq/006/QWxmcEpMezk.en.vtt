 and how about that after this free kick 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:25.440

 the last world cup to sing a goal of 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.670
 Ecuador 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.840

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.480

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:07.010
 medium 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:10.240
 then the match went side and side in 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.020
 the right figure and the Swiss 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.930
 they were looking for the second 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.610

 the discounts ninety-three minutes 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.400
 Swiss attacks that would end in goal 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.080
 We could not believe it from the possibility 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.410
 to win the match 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.920
