 in this finalized examination 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.759
 you need a crew of this plant 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.590
 as there is a couple of sightings apart 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.670

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.000
 preparing four heavy trucks and 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:33.070
 then these systems are 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.070
 fussy these systems are a 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:42.670

 through a communications system 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.010
 massive called the nexus the leaders 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.960
 stroke can send instructions

 hosts large lines of communications 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:02.689
 of the nexus is to tell a convoy that 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.219
 carries an electromagnetic pump 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:06.219
 up to a sub level of this building 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.800
 the convoy will proceed to the position 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.800
 designated and the detonate to 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.720
 the explosion over will charge the 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.760
 transfer device which will leave 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.400
 isolated to the nexus forces stroke and 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.170
 its controls to ensure success others 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.720
 three platoons will escort devices 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.610
 additional pm to the same location your 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.040
