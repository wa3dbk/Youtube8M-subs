00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.490
 hello today we are going to make crumpled potatoes 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.890
 which is a typical dish of the islands 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.290
 Canary Islands for this we will need 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.210
 well it depends on how much you 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.800
 want me I'm using 400 grams of 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.080
 potatoes and potatoes as you can see are 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.700
 I'm going to show it to you in 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.860
 comparison with a hand so they see 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.930
 that they have to be dads like that 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.220
 these are not the most appropriate 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.530
 because here in the peninsula it is not 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.320
 I can get some potatoes that are like that 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.300
 and you already know about these that are 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.480
 as with the red eyes or more 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.609
 wrinkled or more suitable for the place as 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.309
 They are pretty potatoes but good with that 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:56.250
 get a little potato and we are worth 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.489
 then we also have to use lemon that 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.109
 is used for in the stew of the potatoes that 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.420
 whiten the skin although in this case 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.129
 these potatoes are more than lemon and salt 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.159
 that has to be as you see in 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.690
 that salt thick to the fat one and habitually 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.580
 you use one that is more color than it is 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.380
 but it is more chubby than they found in 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.610
 supermarkets and we're also going to 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.870
 need water 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.250
 that simple with those four 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.930
 ingredients we have some potatoes 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.760
 wrinkled in things 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.250
 20 minutes what the potatoes take in 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.330
 stay soft we'll see how it 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.370
 make 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.590
 As you can see, I put the potatoes inside a 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.660
 pot but that does not work for 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.070
 then pour the salt the lemon and cover 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.710
 with water and that we are not overflowing 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.930
 bisa I also put the lemon we lost the 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.170
 8 and inside is cuter the one that is the one 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.200
 it is needed but good and we will cover 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.590
 abundantly with water the liters 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.590
 I'm going to put 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.500
 by more or less as they say out there under 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.750
 good cubero I'm going to leave it as well 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.970
 about a half liter and 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.880
 salt is also some that as I said 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:04.120
 and thrown into the eye that is basically 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.190
 take about 400 grams of potatoes 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.840
 that we are going to need approximately 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.880
 let's say it's like half of the 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.680
 amount of potatoes in fat salt but to me 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.330
 that seems a lot to me then what 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.820
 I'll miss about it 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.920
 about 100 grams or so I just do 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.880
 It's worth and they go like 200 grams there because 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.430
 I think with that 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.200
 is more than enough then one says 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.820
 my god but now I have thrown a lot 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.090
 of you know or you will fall the potatoes 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.610
 super salty there is no problem 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.830
 backwards the potatoes have to carry a lot 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.350
 salt but the salt will absorb it is 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.300
 simply the necessary the rest is going 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.010
 to be stuck and is attached to the 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.300
 skin when we finish doing the 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.980
 wrinkled potatoes then now 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.220
 we just have to give small to 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.620
 fire and we're going to boil them for about 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.510
 15-20 minutes what the potato takes in 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.670
 Doing that simply checks 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.410
 pricking the potato and when it is done it 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.410
 drain and we see the result 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.540
 after fifteen or twenty minutes 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.100
 knowing each other depending on the size of 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.880
 the potato when they see that they can already 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.790
 click and exit 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.230
 that is to say and all more or less are 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.360
 blanditas so fork and enter 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.860
 easily especially large potatoes 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.420
 which are the ones that cost the most 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.590
 then what we are going to do is 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:21.069
 Remove from heat and drain 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.540
 to drain 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.140
 please do it 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:29.060
 with the lid of the pileup and with a rag 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:32.900
 and the rag 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.940
 put it right so that leaves a 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.870
 small slit 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.060
 ah 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.640
 in cold water nights and not 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.900
 and little by little 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.900
 let's learn love 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.470
 until nothing is left 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:04.180
 then we return to the fire with it 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:06.640
 and now we will simply take no 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.180
 I know if you can see well but see that 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.180
 they are 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:21.090
 stay away from the side effects and from 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:22.660
 do dad dad jaua I'm going to take out the 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.560
 lemon 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.560
 and here he paints little 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.670
 and as you can see well they are listening 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.200
 and wrinkling is simply why I 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:41.640
 let's give a little bit so that 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:43.800
 all of them stay dry and 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.810
 wrinkled 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.120
 the one that stays wrinkled really is 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:52.610
 for the salt to harass them that what they do is 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:55.150
 that separates the skin from the own potato 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.460
 and this is the aspect 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:01.090
 that should have the wrinkled potatoes the 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.530
 pot as they see for the pot always 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.390
 everything that splashes water is tinged with 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:08.070
 salt white but do not worry 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.070
 that comes out very easy with a rag and water
