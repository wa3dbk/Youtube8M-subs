00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
have did have this enable you guys can

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.700 
have did have this enable you guys can
actually<00:01:50.580> find<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:50.939> under<00:01:51.330> settings

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
actually find this under settings

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.170 
actually find this under settings
accessibility<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.950> there<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.340> go<00:01:53.490> reduce

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
accessibility and there you go reduce

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.120 
accessibility and there you go reduce
motion<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:54.750> be<00:01:54.930> sure<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.200> turn<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.560> off<00:01:55.830> if

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
motion so be sure you turn this off if

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.060 
motion so be sure you turn this off if
not<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:57.000> know<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.270> animation<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.140> bouncy

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
not you know the animation of the bouncy

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.190 
not you know the animation of the bouncy
animation<00:01:59.549> wouldn't<00:01:59.909> occur<00:02:00.270> all<00:02:00.869> right<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.170> I

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
animation wouldn't occur all right so I

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.780 
animation wouldn't occur all right so I
think<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.710> pretty<00:02:01.890> much<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.520> by<00:02:02.729> the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
think that is pretty much it and by the

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.969 
think that is pretty much it and by the
way<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.090> know<00:02:03.270> after<00:02:03.689> using<00:02:03.930> this<00:02:04.140> tweak<00:02:04.500> for

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
way you know after using this tweak for

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.640 
way you know after using this tweak for
day<00:02:05.369> now<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.869> know<00:02:06.990> from<00:02:07.170> my<00:02:07.320> perspective

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
day now and you know from my perspective

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.979 
day now and you know from my perspective
I<00:02:08.009> think<00:02:08.189> it's<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.399> pretty<00:02:08.640> cool<00:02:08.729> tweak<00:02:09.209> you

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
I think it's a pretty cool tweak you

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.720 
I think it's a pretty cool tweak you
know<00:02:10.079> it<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.679> best<00:02:10.920> thing<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.280> it

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
know it the best thing is that it

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.699 
know it the best thing is that it
