 episode of the series né 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.670
 But as many people have commented, it's a 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.260
 texture that many people know then 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.000
 so I also defended beck low and 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.710
 I hope it really is that then. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.750
 This texture is too fucking 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.850

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.800
 is almost always picking up then 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.410
 and gain the name in this texture that is 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.500
 People speck the creator of it is the coconut with 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.600
 games type is it's channel subscriber was 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.760
 catch the texture of subscribers but subject 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.640
 My friend and I went to hell, text. 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.399
 So I'm going to use it in this video is 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.500
 how gardens are fucking textures that I 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:13.060
 in my opinion I found it very fucking and that 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.799
 you can see on the channel that these 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.290
 Days I'm using her a lot, man. 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.790
 Curtia again was pretty cool. 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.290
 So let's start to show she is. 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.900
 first here I'll show you the 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.170
 roche goes to you limou from zero is a 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.360
 Great, my, how simple is it here in the background. 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.970
 is the same as above is nec sef 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.600
 transparent and here in Atibaia that well 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.640
 Nice or I like the selection 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.860
 blood in the sector also says that 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.330
 selected here in the scrotum was also 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.490
 Just when you can see 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.330
 Pretty, I fucking enjoyed it, old man. 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.560
 rock n roll of one and let's start with 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.869
 minerals beauty 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.729
 the question is some tools right? 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.040
 some some items 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:57.430
 here are the soups you can see here that without 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.720
 surprises in your soup content and here 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.759
 with the soup, right? 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.030
 It was cool but pretty well here 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.890
 that is, ores are not 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.450
 detached but anyway you see 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.689
 by far, because he is a little bit 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.459
 different from that of normal stone 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:14.019
 I leave it to you here it's dark to 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.819
 Geez, this is light. 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.140
 So you can highlight the beauty and you can 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.599
 see by far 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.580
 here are the ores are in stone 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.770
 missing is a little edited only 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.870
 but they're pretty good too normal 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.670
 they are cool 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.980
 and here you have seen with some items 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.000
 Let's go to the next part. Let's see. 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.720
 now the biomes are here biomes beauty 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.580
 ready 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.799
 here are the biomes the tree is 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.790
 default nor the leaves of the trees are 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.680
 pretty beautiful 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.900
 the ground in the grass that was also good 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.510
 It was very nice outside and if I did not 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.340
 I mistake this texture that is this team that 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.180
 It's but I think that José Luis in some 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.670
 his video 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.420
 The texture of the grass here are some 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.000
 items here are the furnace e and bmx and tals 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.910
 run defaults here as well but are 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.069
 edited and here are daily here are 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.019
 have a difference in the tree and 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.599
 pretty mushrooms here pretty 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.489
 Let's now see this part that has 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.109
 some are default and others are 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.420
 little edited third is not so great 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.940
 so so price is also good it's kind of light 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.159
 And man, as I said very beautiful, right? 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.510
 we ready for the next part that 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:21.989
 said the leaves are all in 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.000
 default has had an edit that are the 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.459
 armor we'll see the swords and 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.709
 armor that I also found very fucking 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.150
 Dude the thin one and it looks pretty good. 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.340
 usually does not like swords much 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.530
 fine but here it was very fucking carol 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.940
 was pretty big beautiful young pretty well 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:43.200
 time and a strong game than the bow 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:46.200
 you will now see what if the critic 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.139
 it is that the particles are not 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.620
 put at least 20 means bar 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:54.900
 time 70 to be clear that the 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.449
 very beautiful particles here too. 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:01.109
 armor let's get it here and wear it 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:05.010
 for you to see how it looks is 5 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:06.660
 very cute, let's try here and 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.609
 Let's go to the last part is that they are 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.769
 seeing that face got pretty pretty spaces 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:13.650
 I enjoy the other as the very strong 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.329
 swords and now for the last part nor the 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.190
 beauty particle 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:20.130
 let's see that some positions can see 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.289
 here some positions were good 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.300
 This one is cool too. 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:26.910
 cute that I like the most and does not have 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.410
 but it's the same same thing style is 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.210
 kind a question mark is that they 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.650
 They are seeing pick up a bucket of milk here 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.479
 and we'll search here for you to see 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.169
 also that the fire does not disturb almost 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:41.409
 nothing is worth a very beautiful fire 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:44.319
 if playing is up in HD and fire is fine 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:45.909
 It was beautiful outside and we're going to 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:48.219
 the most important part 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:49.629
 at least for me in texture it is from 

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:51.550
 of the particles looks at how much 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:54.490
 Beautiful people, they were really fucking expensive. 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.759
 It's very beautiful, I fucking looked 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:00.099
 The boss here criticized him, right? 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:02.379
 and here the critic from there the two mixed 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:04.360
 It was pretty much got really fuck 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:06.099
 even see from here to make a mess 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.599
 then in the next episode 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:09.610
 and I think they are the same people 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:12.759

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.589
