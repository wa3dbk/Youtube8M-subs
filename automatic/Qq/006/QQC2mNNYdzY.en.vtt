terrified of using the Cuisinart even

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.539 
terrified of using the Cuisinart even
though<00:00:10.299> they<00:00:10.660> own<00:00:10.870> one<00:00:11.170> and<00:00:11.440> the<00:00:11.500> fact<00:00:11.709> is<00:00:12.160> I

my<00:00:14.950> grandmother<00:00:15.370> and<00:00:15.670> it<00:00:15.759> took<00:00:15.849> me<00:00:16.029> about<00:00:16.150> five

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
my grandmother and it took me about five

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.290 
my grandmother and it took me about five
years<00:00:17.050> until<00:00:17.320> I<00:00:17.619> started<00:00:18.130> using<00:00:18.310> it<00:00:18.669> because<00:00:18.970> I

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
years until I started using it because I

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.330 
years until I started using it because I
was<00:00:19.509> scared<00:00:19.779> of<00:00:19.869> it<00:00:20.020> too<00:00:20.230> so<00:00:20.680> I<00:00:20.710> just<00:00:20.949> want<00:00:21.279> to

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
was scared of it too so I just want to

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.730 
was scared of it too so I just want to
take<00:00:21.519> a<00:00:21.550> moment<00:00:21.789> to<00:00:22.060> demystify<00:00:22.600> the<00:00:22.990> Cuisinart

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
take a moment to demystify the Cuisinart

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.250 
take a moment to demystify the Cuisinart
first<00:00:24.550> of<00:00:24.699> all<00:00:24.820> the<00:00:25.150> Cuisinart<00:00:25.779> the<00:00:25.960> purpose

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.260 
first of all the Cuisinart the purpose

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.919 
first of all the Cuisinart the purpose
of<00:00:26.410> a<00:00:26.500> Cuisinart<00:00:26.769> is<00:00:27.189> that<00:00:27.670> it<00:00:28.060> has<00:00:28.480> a<00:00:28.510> blade

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:28.929 
of a Cuisinart is that it has a blade

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:30.660 
of a Cuisinart is that it has a blade
that<00:00:29.170> spins<00:00:29.349> around<00:00:29.619> really<00:00:29.949> really<00:00:30.279> fast

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:30.670 
that spins around really really fast

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:31.890 
that spins around really really fast
okay

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
okay

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.660 
okay
but<00:00:32.650> the<00:00:32.769> reason<00:00:33.070> why<00:00:33.190> it's<00:00:33.340> kind<00:00:33.519> of

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
but the reason why it's kind of

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.430 
but the reason why it's kind of
complicated<00:00:34.059> to<00:00:34.360> put<00:00:34.600> together<00:00:34.780> is<00:00:35.260> because

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
complicated to put together is because

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.959 
complicated to put together is because
it<00:00:35.680> has<00:00:35.860> a<00:00:35.890> lot<00:00:36.280> of<00:00:36.309> safety<00:00:37.620> precaution

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
it has a lot of safety precaution

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.180 
it has a lot of safety precaution
measures<00:00:39.969> taken<00:00:40.780> in<00:00:41.170> making<00:00:41.559> it<00:00:41.710> so<00:00:41.890> the<00:00:42.010> blade

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
measures taken in making it so the blade

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.799 
measures taken in making it so the blade
doesn't<00:00:42.399> come<00:00:42.700> off<00:00:42.910> and<00:00:43.180> hit<00:00:43.329> you<00:00:43.360> in<00:00:43.570> the<00:00:43.629> face
