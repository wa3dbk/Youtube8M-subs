00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.650 
I think to get any sort of book written
I<00:02:01.960> feel<00:02:02.500> like<00:02:02.619> moments<00:02:03.010> of<00:02:03.130> inspiration<00:02:03.660> are

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
I feel like moments of inspiration are

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.790 
I feel like moments of inspiration are
necessary<00:02:05.729> but<00:02:06.729> offering<00:02:07.479> rare<00:02:07.810> often<00:02:08.709> the

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
necessary but offering rare often the

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.580 
necessary but offering rare often the
spark<00:02:09.220> for<00:02:09.940> a<00:02:09.970> chapter<00:02:10.390> or<00:02:10.630> a<00:02:10.840> story<00:02:11.230> will<00:02:11.440> come

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
spark for a chapter or a story will come

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.199 
spark for a chapter or a story will come
to<00:02:11.800> me<00:02:11.920> in<00:02:12.010> an<00:02:12.130> instant<00:02:12.490> all<00:02:12.580> to<00:02:12.730> your<00:02:12.910> line<00:02:13.090> of

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
to me in an instant all to your line of

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.900 
to me in an instant all to your line of
dialogue<00:02:13.630> or<00:02:13.780> I'll<00:02:14.500> hear<00:02:15.040> a<00:02:15.100> first<00:02:15.519> line<00:02:15.700> in<00:02:15.880> my

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
dialogue or I'll hear a first line in my

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.949 
dialogue or I'll hear a first line in my
head<00:02:16.180> and<00:02:16.810> I'll<00:02:17.019> go<00:02:17.140> with<00:02:17.230> that<00:02:17.290> voice<00:02:17.590> but

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
head and I'll go with that voice but

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.880 
head and I'll go with that voice but
those<00:02:19.959> moments<00:02:20.140> when<00:02:20.410> I<00:02:20.440> actually<00:02:20.620> hear

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
those moments when I actually hear

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.290 
those moments when I actually hear
something

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
something

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.060 
something
give<00:02:22.900> from<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.230> writing<00:02:23.530> guts<00:02:23.740> but<00:02:23.980> they

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
give from the writing guts but they

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.220 
give from the writing guts but they
don't<00:02:24.250> happen<00:02:24.430> so<00:02:24.760> often<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.450> so<00:02:25.480> that's<00:02:26.050> why

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
don't happen so often and so that's why

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.050 
don't happen so often and so that's why
excited<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:27.040> lot<00:02:27.190> of<00:02:27.280> writing<00:02:27.460> which<00:02:27.550> is<00:02:27.640> just

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
excited a lot of writing which is just

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.770 
excited a lot of writing which is just
hard<00:02:28.240> work<00:02:28.950> but<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.370> you<00:02:30.700> have<00:02:30.880> to<00:02:31.060> love<00:02:31.270> to<00:02:31.540> do

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
hard work but and you have to love to do

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.840 
hard work but and you have to love to do
it<00:02:31.960> too<00:02:32.260> I<00:02:32.290> think<00:02:32.500> in<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:32.950> night<00:02:33.100> and<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:33.460> also

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
it too I think in the night and you also

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.150 
it too I think in the night and you also
have<00:02:34.060> to<00:02:34.180> like<00:02:34.540> be<00:02:34.780> alone

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
have to like be alone

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.430 
have to like be alone
and<00:02:36.810> because<00:02:37.810> it's<00:02:37.960> a<00:02:37.990> very<00:02:38.020> solitary

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
and because it's a very solitary

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.020 
and because it's a very solitary
endeavor<00:02:39.270> and<00:02:40.530> maybe<00:02:41.530> my<00:02:41.980> nature<00:02:42.220> I<00:02:42.640> do<00:02:42.850> like

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
endeavor and maybe my nature I do like

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.490 
endeavor and maybe my nature I do like
kind<00:02:43.510> of<00:02:43.660> sitting<00:02:43.870> alone<00:02:44.080> in<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.290> corner

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
kind of sitting alone in the corner

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.070 
kind of sitting alone in the corner
that's<00:02:44.920> very<00:02:45.280> film<00:02:45.490> is<00:02:45.610> comfortable<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:49.080> and

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
that's very film is comfortable and and

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.450 
that's very film is comfortable and and
I<00:02:51.330> it's<00:02:52.330> really<00:02:52.810> what<00:02:53.500> I'd<00:02:53.620> rather<00:02:53.800> be<00:02:54.010> doing<00:02:54.130> I

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
I it's really what I'd rather be doing I

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.120 
I it's really what I'd rather be doing I
think<00:02:54.580> more<00:02:54.970> than<00:02:55.000> anything<00:02:55.300> else<00:02:55.570> is<00:02:55.810> just

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
think more than anything else is just

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.590 
think more than anything else is just
working<00:02:57.130> on<00:02:57.400> sentences<00:02:58.030> and<00:02:58.210> trying<00:02:58.540> to

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
working on sentences and trying to

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.800 
working on sentences and trying to
figure<00:02:58.780> things<00:02:59.020> out<00:02:59.260> and<00:02:59.680> I<00:03:00.130> think<00:03:00.190> that<00:03:00.810> also

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
figure things out and I think that also

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.900 
figure things out and I think that also
naturally<00:03:02.470> my<00:03:02.920> brain<00:03:03.160> likes<00:03:03.430> to<00:03:03.670> solve

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
naturally my brain likes to solve

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.560 
naturally my brain likes to solve
puzzles<00:03:04.330> and<00:03:04.900> I<00:03:05.590> feel<00:03:05.890> like<00:03:06.010> writing<00:03:06.820> is<00:03:07.060> kind

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
puzzles and I feel like writing is kind

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.610 
puzzles and I feel like writing is kind
of<00:03:07.750> a<00:03:07.810> huge<00:03:08.110> puzzle

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
of a huge puzzle

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.800 
of a huge puzzle
it's<00:03:08.860> a<00:03:08.950> massive<00:03:09.580> puzzle<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:10.150> every

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
it's a massive puzzle and every

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.570 
it's a massive puzzle and every
paragraph<00:03:11.140> is<00:03:11.440> a<00:03:11.470> puzzle<00:03:11.860> to<00:03:11.980> every<00:03:12.190> sentence

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
paragraph is a puzzle to every sentence

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.370 
paragraph is a puzzle to every sentence
as<00:03:12.700> a<00:03:12.730> puzzle<00:03:13.000> and<00:03:13.420> just<00:03:13.720> making<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:14.050> pieces

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
as a puzzle and just making the pieces

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.480 
as a puzzle and just making the pieces
fit<00:03:14.770> together<00:03:14.980> in<00:03:15.940> the<00:03:16.150> right<00:03:16.300> way<00:03:16.360> is<00:03:17.490> very

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
fit together in the right way is very

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.400 
fit together in the right way is very
challenging<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:19.240> we're<00:03:19.810> able<00:03:19.960> to<00:03:20.230> do<00:03:20.380> it

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
challenging and we're able to do it

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.320 
challenging and we're able to do it
successfully<00:03:20.680> it's<00:03:21.400> ultimately<00:03:22.060> very

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
successfully it's ultimately very

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.750 
successfully it's ultimately very
satisfying<00:03:23.020> and<00:03:23.320> when<00:03:24.070> they<00:03:24.160> add<00:03:24.310> up<00:03:24.340> to<00:03:24.490> a

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
satisfying and when they add up to a

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.150 
satisfying and when they add up to a
story<00:03:25.180> it<00:03:25.630> almost<00:03:25.870> seems<00:03:26.140> like<00:03:26.380> magic<00:03:26.650> they

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
story it almost seems like magic they

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.790 
story it almost seems like magic they
did<00:03:27.850> it<00:03:28.000> it<00:03:28.690> could<00:03:28.900> happen<00:03:29.050> and<00:03:29.350> be<00:03:29.470> out<00:03:29.590> there

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
did it it could happen and be out there

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.160 
did it it could happen and be out there
in<00:03:29.890> the<00:03:29.980> world
