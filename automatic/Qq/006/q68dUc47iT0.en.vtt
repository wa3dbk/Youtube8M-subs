00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.810 

it's<00:01:05.420> hard<00:01:05.600> to<00:01:05.720> get<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:05.960> dirt<00:01:06.170> off<00:01:06.350> with<00:01:06.620> him

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
it's hard to get the dirt off with him

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.660 
it's hard to get the dirt off with him
just<00:01:07.820> just<00:01:08.330> leave<00:01:08.479> it<00:01:08.920> we<00:01:09.920> better<00:01:10.220> be<00:01:10.430> careful

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
just just leave it we better be careful

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:20.410 
just just leave it we better be careful
then<00:01:11.150> yeah<00:01:11.600> so<00:01:17.920> during<00:01:18.920> this<00:01:19.040> summit<00:01:19.490> the

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
then yeah so during this summit the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.840 
then yeah so during this summit the
leaders<00:01:20.780> were<00:01:20.960> able<00:01:21.229> to<00:01:21.320> take<00:01:21.530> on<00:01:21.740> one<00:01:22.580> of<00:01:22.610> the

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
leaders were able to take on one of the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.730 
leaders were able to take on one of the
most<00:01:23.030> difficult<00:01:23.270> issues<00:01:23.990> that<00:01:24.380> they<00:01:24.590> are

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
most difficult issues that they are

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.969 
most difficult issues that they are
facing<00:01:25.330> they<00:01:26.330> have<00:01:26.509> high<00:01:26.810> high<00:01:27.080> energy<00:01:27.619> costs

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
facing they have high high energy costs

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.469 
facing they have high high energy costs
and<00:01:28.130> they<00:01:28.250> are<00:01:28.310> desperately<00:01:28.850> trying<00:01:28.970> to<00:01:29.270> come

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
and they are desperately trying to come

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.420 
and they are desperately trying to come
up<00:01:29.509> with<00:01:29.630> solutions<00:01:29.900> and<00:01:30.500> one<00:01:31.250> of<00:01:31.369> the

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
up with solutions and one of the

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.480 
up with solutions and one of the
solutions<00:01:32.020> is<00:01:33.020> to<00:01:33.229> look<00:01:33.380> at<00:01:33.590> all<00:01:33.800> types<00:01:34.310> of

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490

with the the watershed Council is very

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.540 
with the the watershed Council is very
helpful<00:02:34.459> to<00:02:34.819> us<00:02:35.090> because<00:02:35.420> it<00:02:36.040> it<00:02:37.040> brings<00:02:37.370> the

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.760 

would<00:02:58.660> you<00:02:58.750> have<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:58.870> motor<00:02:59.140> generator<00:02:59.560> to

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
would you have a motor generator to

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.720 
would you have a motor generator to
write<00:02:59.980> write<00:03:00.610> out<00:03:01.530> lips<00:03:02.530> on<00:03:02.830> the<00:03:03.040> on<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.340> grid

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
write write out lips on the on the grid

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.540 
write write out lips on the on the grid
or<00:03:04.060> and<00:03:04.300> if<00:03:04.450> there<00:03:04.959> was<00:03:05.080> a<00:03:05.190> localized<00:03:06.190> grid

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
or and if there was a localized grid

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.339 
or and if there was a localized grid
loss<00:03:06.819> would<00:03:07.060> you<00:03:07.270> does<00:03:07.569> that<00:03:07.750> mean<00:03:07.930> an

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
loss would you does that mean an

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.670 
loss would you does that mean an
automatic<00:03:08.860> scram<00:03:09.660> no<00:03:10.660> presumably<00:03:11.260> this<00:03:11.470> would

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
automatic scram no presumably this would

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
automatic scram no presumably this would
be<00:03:11.800> located<00:03:11.980> in<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:12.580> area<00:03:13.150> of<00:03:13.620> limited

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
be located in the area of limited

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.460 
be located in the area of limited
production<00:03:15.700> capability<00:03:16.569> a<00:03:16.600> limited<00:03:16.989> grid<00:03:17.260> and

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
production capability a limited grid and

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.270 
production capability a limited grid and
so<00:03:17.970> anytime<00:03:18.970> one<00:03:19.209> lost<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.810> local<00:03:20.200> grid<00:03:20.830> one

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
so anytime one lost the local grid one

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.530 
so anytime one lost the local grid one
would<00:03:21.430> basically<00:03:22.620> scram<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.830> reactor<00:03:24.540> are

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
would basically scram the reactor are

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.360 
would basically scram the reactor are
you<00:03:27.120> eliminating<00:03:28.120> the<00:03:28.269> risk<00:03:28.500> altogether<00:03:29.500> by

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
you eliminating the risk altogether by

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.550 
you eliminating the risk altogether by
the<00:03:30.430> design<00:03:31.000> or<00:03:31.330> you're<00:03:31.630> just<00:03:31.750> reducing<00:03:34.560> the

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
the design or you're just reducing the

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.650 
the design or you're just reducing the
risk<00:03:35.799> of<00:03:36.040> having<00:03:36.549> some<00:03:37.030> sodium<00:03:37.390> water

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
risk of having some sodium water
