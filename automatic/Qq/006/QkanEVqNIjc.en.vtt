00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
are so creamy that's just like one swipe

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.160 
are so creamy that's just like one swipe
with<00:01:15.930> each<00:01:17.180> so<00:01:18.180> they<00:01:18.330> glide<00:01:18.600> on<00:01:18.750> very<00:01:18.990> nicely

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
with each so they glide on very nicely

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.880 
with each so they glide on very nicely
did<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.310> crease<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> little<00:01:20.759> bit<00:01:21.119> but<00:01:21.900> if<00:01:22.740> you

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
did you crease a little bit but if you

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.100 
did you crease a little bit but if you
just<00:01:23.040> blend<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.430> out<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.880> use<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.390> over<00:01:24.659> like<00:01:24.869> a

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
just blend it out and use it over like a

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.039 
just blend it out and use it over like a
primer<00:01:25.380> like<00:01:25.770> Urban<00:01:26.159> Decay<00:01:26.430> primer<00:01:26.729> potion

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
primer like Urban Decay primer potion

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.170 
primer like Urban Decay primer potion
then<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.140> should<00:01:28.290> work<00:01:28.439> out<00:01:28.590> just<00:01:28.650> great<00:01:29.090> and<00:01:30.090> I

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
then it should work out just great and I

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.210 
then it should work out just great and I
think<00:01:30.390> these<00:01:30.509> are<00:01:30.570> like<00:01:30.869> 399<00:01:33.350> so<00:01:34.350> we<00:01:34.619> they're

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
think these are like 399 so we they're

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.730 
think these are like 399 so we they're
really<00:01:36.119> inexpensive<00:01:37.079> like<00:01:37.229> compared<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.650> like
