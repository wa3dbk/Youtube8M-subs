a banana box said it was perfect for a
review<00:01:00.470> and<00:01:01.570> I'm<00:01:02.570> doing<00:01:02.750> a<00:01:02.870> review<00:01:03.170> on<00:01:03.230> the

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
you to Laura for getting me this banana

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.570 
you to Laura for getting me this banana
box<00:01:11.080> basically<00:01:12.080> what<00:01:12.560> it<00:01:12.680> is<00:01:12.830> it<00:01:13.160> is<00:01:13.220> what

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
box basically what it is it is what

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.100 
box basically what it is it is what
exactly<00:01:14.090> what<00:01:14.210> you<00:01:14.330> would<00:01:14.450> expect<00:01:14.479> it<00:01:14.960> to<00:01:14.990> be

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
exactly what you would expect it to be

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.620 
exactly what you would expect it to be
it's<00:01:15.470> a<00:01:15.649> banana<00:01:15.890> box<00:01:16.220> it<00:01:16.520> holds<00:01:17.000> a<00:01:17.060> banana<00:01:17.390> of

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
it's a banana box it holds a banana of

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.359 
it's a banana box it holds a banana of
course<00:01:17.990> we'll<00:01:18.170> get<00:01:18.289> into<00:01:18.590> that<00:01:18.680> in<00:01:18.890> a<00:01:18.950> second

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
course we'll get into that in a second

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.440 
course we'll get into that in a second
let's<00:01:19.850> have<00:01:20.000> a<00:01:20.030> look<00:01:20.210> first<00:01:20.420> at<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:20.600> package

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
let's have a look first at the package

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.230 
let's have a look first at the package
it<00:01:23.450> does<00:01:23.539> come<00:01:23.869> with<00:01:23.899> a<00:01:24.020> banana<00:01:24.440> fork<00:01:24.950> I<00:01:25.240> don't

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
it does come with a banana fork I don't

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.050 
it does come with a banana fork I don't
personally<00:01:26.479> see<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:27.050> reasoning<00:01:27.410> for<00:01:27.440> it

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
personally see the reasoning for it

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.040 
personally see the reasoning for it
surely<00:01:29.060> everybody<00:01:29.420> knows<00:01:29.630> how<00:01:29.810> to<00:01:29.869> eat<00:01:29.960> a

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
surely everybody knows how to eat a

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.130 
surely everybody knows how to eat a
banana<00:01:30.200> monkeys<00:01:30.800> know<00:01:31.130> how<00:01:31.250> to<00:01:31.310> eat<00:01:31.460> bananas<00:01:31.910> I

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
banana monkeys know how to eat bananas I

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.570 
banana monkeys know how to eat bananas I
don't<00:01:33.140> see<00:01:33.289> many<00:01:33.470> people<00:01:33.530> eat<00:01:33.920> bananas<00:01:34.369> with

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
don't see many people eat bananas with

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.320 
don't see many people eat bananas with
forks<00:01:35.030> but<00:01:35.450> at<00:01:35.600> any<00:01:35.750> rate<00:01:36.040> on<00:01:37.040> the<00:01:37.250> back<00:01:37.400> tired

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
forks but at any rate on the back tired

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.600 
forks but at any rate on the back tired
of<00:01:38.600> finding<00:01:38.869> a<00:01:39.170> bruised<00:01:39.560> and<00:01:39.979> squashed

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
of finding a bruised and squashed

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.590 
of finding a bruised and squashed
bananas<00:01:41.270> in<00:01:41.869> your<00:01:41.930> lunch<00:01:42.320> box<00:01:43.180> yeah

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
bananas in your lunch box yeah

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.140 
bananas in your lunch box yeah
this<00:01:45.259> unique<00:01:45.619> banana<00:01:46.040> box<00:01:46.369> ensures<00:01:46.850> your

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
this unique banana box ensures your

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.469 
this unique banana box ensures your
banana<00:01:47.420> is<00:01:47.570> kept<00:01:47.900> in<00:01:48.140> tip-top<00:01:48.740> condition<00:01:49.479> the

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
banana is kept in tip-top condition the

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.090 
banana is kept in tip-top condition the
ventilation<00:01:51.049> holes<00:01:51.320> prevent<00:01:51.740> premature

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
ventilation holes prevent premature

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.569 
ventilation holes prevent premature
ripening<00:01:53.060> because<00:01:53.990> I'm<00:01:54.110> sure<00:01:54.290> as<00:01:54.500> any<00:01:54.770> guy<00:01:55.340> out

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
ripening because I'm sure as any guy out

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:57.749 
ripening because I'm sure as any guy out
there<00:01:55.759> knows<00:01:56.030> there's<00:01:56.570> nothing<00:01:56.990> worse<00:01:57.229> than

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
there knows there's nothing worse than

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.840 
there knows there's nothing worse than
premature<00:01:58.759> ripening<00:02:00.009> and<00:02:01.009> there's<00:02:01.340> even<00:02:01.670> a

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
premature ripening and there's even a

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.149 
premature ripening and there's even a
really<00:02:02.390> useful<00:02:02.840> for<00:02:03.049> concluded<00:02:03.649> again<00:02:03.979> I

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
really useful for concluded again I

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.350 
really useful for concluded again I
don't<00:02:04.939> know<00:02:05.149> the<00:02:05.270> reasoning<00:02:05.780> for<00:02:05.840> Forks<00:02:06.549> if<00:02:07.549> it

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
don't know the reasoning for Forks if it

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.389 
don't know the reasoning for Forks if it
makes<00:02:08.540> no<00:02:08.690> sense<00:02:08.720> to<00:02:09.079> me<00:02:09.140> breaks<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.709> laws<00:02:09.920> of

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
makes no sense to me breaks the laws of

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.220 
makes no sense to me breaks the laws of
of<00:02:10.640> nature<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.570> fact<00:02:11.750> that<00:02:11.840> we<00:02:11.989> would<00:02:12.110> ever

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
of nature the fact that we would ever

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.800 
of nature the fact that we would ever
eat<00:02:12.500> a<00:02:12.530> banana<00:02:13.150> with<00:02:14.150> a<00:02:14.180> fork

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
eat a banana with a fork

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.030 
eat a banana with a fork
at<00:02:15.739> any<00:02:15.829> rate<00:02:15.950> though<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:17.420> banana<00:02:17.750> box<00:02:17.989> so<00:02:18.650> I

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
at any rate though the banana box so I

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.100 
at any rate though the banana box so I
don't<00:02:19.579> even<00:02:19.640> think<00:02:19.790> that<00:02:20.600> weren't<00:02:20.780> gonna<00:02:20.900> neat

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
don't even think that weren't gonna neat

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.410 
don't even think that weren't gonna neat
good<00:02:21.470> old<00:02:21.650> Hank<00:02:21.920> for<00:02:22.160> this<00:02:22.280> one<00:02:22.489> it<00:02:23.120> looks<00:02:23.269> to

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
good old Hank for this one it looks to

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.940 
good old Hank for this one it looks to
me<00:02:23.510> that<00:02:23.540> these<00:02:23.810> are<00:02:23.870> just<00:02:24.140> twists<00:02:24.440> tied<00:02:24.709> in

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
me that these are just twists tied in

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.970 
me that these are just twists tied in
we're<00:02:25.910> gonna<00:02:26.030> take<00:02:26.269> the<00:02:26.390> very<00:02:26.860> attractive<00:02:27.860> I

why<00:04:17.630> it's<00:04:17.900> not<00:04:18.019> opening<00:04:18.470> it<00:04:18.979> should<00:04:19.160> be<00:04:19.250> just<00:04:19.280> a

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
why it's not opening it should be just a

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.820 
why it's not opening it should be just a
latch<00:04:20.709> seems<00:04:21.709> simple<00:04:22.430> enough<00:04:22.490> there<00:04:23.390> we<00:04:23.510> go

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
latch seems simple enough there we go

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.370 
latch seems simple enough there we go
and<00:04:24.830> it<00:04:25.040> singed<00:04:25.460> very<00:04:25.700> good<00:04:25.850> as<00:04:26.060> mentioned<00:04:26.840> the

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
and it singed very good as mentioned the

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.930 
and it singed very good as mentioned the
banana<00:04:27.710> fork<00:04:29.860> your<00:04:30.860> your<00:04:31.250> guess<00:04:31.490> is<00:04:31.729> as<00:04:31.790> good

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
banana fork your your guess is as good

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.880 
banana fork your your guess is as good
as<00:04:32.120> mine<00:04:32.360> I<00:04:32.570> don't<00:04:32.840> know<00:04:33.110> the<00:04:33.350> reason<00:04:33.680> why<00:04:33.830> you

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
as mine I don't know the reason why you

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.070 
as mine I don't know the reason why you
would<00:04:34.190> have<00:04:34.370> a<00:04:34.400> fork<00:04:34.729> if<00:04:35.270> you<00:04:35.479> were<00:04:35.630> ever<00:04:35.900> to

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
would have a fork if you were ever to

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.159 
would have a fork if you were ever to
eat<00:04:36.229> your<00:04:36.410> banana<00:04:36.820> said<00:04:37.820> banana<00:04:38.090> with<00:04:38.630> a<00:04:38.660> fork

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
eat your banana said banana with a fork

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.530 
eat your banana said banana with a fork
I<00:04:39.470> don't<00:04:40.220> know<00:04:40.310> perhaps<00:04:40.640> this<00:04:41.150> is<00:04:41.360> not<00:04:41.390> the

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
I don't know perhaps this is not the

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.409 
I don't know perhaps this is not the
most<00:04:42.220> masculine<00:04:43.220> a<00:04:43.460> Forks<00:04:43.880> that<00:04:44.060> you'd<00:04:44.210> want

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
most masculine a Forks that you'd want

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.510 
most masculine a Forks that you'd want
to<00:04:44.479> be<00:04:44.570> using<00:04:44.780> but<00:04:45.169> it<00:04:45.650> does<00:04:45.860> come<00:04:46.040> with<00:04:46.070> a<00:04:46.160> fork

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
to be using but it does come with a fork

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.030 
to be using but it does come with a fork
and<00:04:46.729> keep<00:04:47.180> it<00:04:47.300> right<00:04:47.419> up<00:04:47.570> there<00:04:48.040> for

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
and keep it right up there for

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.820 
and keep it right up there for
safekeeping<00:04:49.360> and<00:04:50.380> what<00:04:51.380> we'll<00:04:51.500> do<00:04:51.620> is<00:04:51.740> we'll

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
safekeeping and what we'll do is we'll

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.400 
safekeeping and what we'll do is we'll
take<00:04:52.010> the<00:04:52.220> banana<00:04:52.570> we'll<00:04:53.570> put<00:04:53.720> the<00:04:53.810> banana<00:04:54.200> in

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
take the banana we'll put the banana in

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:55.540 
take the banana we'll put the banana in
the<00:04:54.560> box

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
the box

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.529 
the box
and<00:04:55.720> then<00:04:56.720> we'll<00:04:56.900> close<00:04:57.169> the<00:04:57.379> banana<00:04:58.539> it's

00:04:59.529 --> 00:04:59.539 
and then we'll close the banana it's

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:02.700 
and then we'll close the banana it's
kind<00:04:59.780> of<00:04:59.840> like<00:04:59.960> a<00:05:00.099> sarcophagus<00:05:01.099> for<00:05:01.490> banana

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
kind of like a sarcophagus for banana

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.140 
kind of like a sarcophagus for banana
now<00:05:03.710> I<00:05:03.740> can<00:05:04.039> actually<00:05:04.159> have<00:05:04.430> my<00:05:04.580> banana<00:05:04.879> I<00:05:05.000> can

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
now I can actually have my banana I can

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.969 
now I can actually have my banana I can
either<00:05:05.330> take<00:05:05.479> it<00:05:05.599> to<00:05:05.690> work<00:05:05.810> or<00:05:06.080> I<00:05:06.379> can<00:05:06.560> bury<00:05:06.889> it

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
either take it to work or I can bury it

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:09.879 
either take it to work or I can bury it
in<00:05:07.190> a<00:05:07.310> tomb<00:05:07.520> somewhere<00:05:07.909> and<00:05:08.330> then<00:05:09.050> years<00:05:09.650> to

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
in a tomb somewhere and then years to

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:11.610 
in a tomb somewhere and then years to
come

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
come

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.749 
come
explorers<00:05:12.620> will<00:05:12.800> find<00:05:13.069> this<00:05:13.220> and<00:05:13.430> say<00:05:13.550> well

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 
explorers will find this and say well

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:16.439 
explorers will find this and say well
what<00:05:13.940> is<00:05:14.060> this<00:05:14.270> at<00:05:14.840> some<00:05:15.229> point<00:05:15.259> somebody<00:05:15.979> has

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
what is this at some point somebody has

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.990 
what is this at some point somebody has
put<00:05:17.449> enough<00:05:17.780> value<00:05:18.080> into<00:05:18.590> a<00:05:18.620> banana<00:05:18.830> that<00:05:19.699> they

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
put enough value into a banana that they

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.700 
put enough value into a banana that they
buried<00:05:20.930> it<00:05:21.050> in<00:05:21.319> this<00:05:21.560> plastic<00:05:22.220> sarcophagus

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
buried it in this plastic sarcophagus

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.869 
buried it in this plastic sarcophagus
but<00:05:24.710> it<00:05:24.830> seems<00:05:24.979> to<00:05:25.099> hold<00:05:25.280> the<00:05:25.340> banana<00:05:25.580> pretty

00:05:25.869 --> 00:05:25.879 
but it seems to hold the banana pretty

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:28.870 
but it seems to hold the banana pretty
good<00:05:26.150> I<00:05:26.470> guess<00:05:27.470> the<00:05:27.650> biggest<00:05:28.039> issue<00:05:28.340> is<00:05:28.639> is

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
good I guess the biggest issue is is

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.460 
good I guess the biggest issue is is
making<00:05:29.449> sure<00:05:29.599> you've<00:05:29.780> got<00:05:29.960> the<00:05:30.050> right<00:05:30.199> size

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
making sure you've got the right size

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.439 
making sure you've got the right size
banana<00:05:30.860> because<00:05:31.610> of<00:05:31.759> course<00:05:31.970> if<00:05:32.180> you've<00:05:32.300> got

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:32.449 
banana because of course if you've got

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:34.240 
banana because of course if you've got
too<00:05:32.630> big<00:05:32.810> of<00:05:32.900> a<00:05:32.960> banana<00:05:33.259> it's<00:05:33.500> not<00:05:33.710> gonna<00:05:33.860> fit

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
too big of a banana it's not gonna fit

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.899 
too big of a banana it's not gonna fit
in<00:05:34.520> the<00:05:35.210> banana<00:05:35.389> box<00:05:36.159> and<00:05:37.159> that<00:05:37.250> could<00:05:37.520> be<00:05:37.639> that

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:37.909 
in the banana box and that could be that

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:41.200 
in the banana box and that could be that
could<00:05:38.150> spell<00:05:38.419> trouble<00:05:39.370> but<00:05:40.370> it<00:05:40.699> seems<00:05:40.940> to<00:05:41.090> me

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
could spell trouble but it seems to me

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.390 
could spell trouble but it seems to me
that<00:05:41.240> I've<00:05:41.599> got<00:05:41.930> just<00:05:42.229> the<00:05:42.380> right<00:05:42.590> size<00:05:42.889> banana

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
that I've got just the right size banana

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.790 
that I've got just the right size banana
this<00:05:43.940> is<00:05:44.210> such<00:05:44.449> this<00:05:45.050> is<00:05:45.110> such<00:05:45.440> a<00:05:45.470> vulgar

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
this is such this is such a vulgar

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.680 
this is such this is such a vulgar
review<00:05:46.280> but<00:05:46.909> it<00:05:47.000> seems<00:05:47.240> that<00:05:47.330> I've<00:05:47.419> got<00:05:47.569> the

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
review but it seems that I've got the

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.850 
review but it seems that I've got the
right<00:05:47.930> size<00:05:48.199> banana<00:05:48.590> for<00:05:49.099> the<00:05:49.460> banana<00:05:49.849> box<00:05:50.860> now

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
right size banana for the banana box now

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.129 
right size banana for the banana box now
I<00:05:51.889> can<00:05:52.130> keep<00:05:52.310> it<00:05:52.460> safe<00:05:52.759> I<00:05:53.030> can<00:05:53.300> take<00:05:53.539> my<00:05:53.780> banana
