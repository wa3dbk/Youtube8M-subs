00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:14.859 
a glitch I get it let's just suppose

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:16.859 
a glitch I get it let's just suppose
them<00:00:15.250> but<00:00:15.789> anyway<00:00:16.029> I<00:00:16.059> don't<00:00:16.330> only<00:00:16.510> bring<00:00:16.720> these

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
kind of videos these glitch videos but I

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.290 
kind of videos these glitch videos but I
thought<00:00:18.460> I'd<00:00:18.609> do<00:00:18.789> this<00:00:18.820> one<00:00:19.029> because<00:00:19.180> it's

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
thought I'd do this one because it's

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.910 
thought I'd do this one because it's
pretty<00:00:19.330> cool<00:00:19.660> and<00:00:19.900> anyway<00:00:20.619> let's<00:00:20.769> go<00:00:20.890> ahead

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
pretty cool and anyway let's go ahead

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.950 
pretty cool and anyway let's go ahead
and<00:00:21.250> try<00:00:21.430> it<00:00:21.490> out<00:00:21.610> right<00:00:21.760> now<00:00:21.820> so<00:00:22.060> this<00:00:22.210> is<00:00:22.810> the

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
and try it out right now so this is the

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.359 
and try it out right now so this is the
place<00:00:23.170> you<00:00:23.289> have<00:00:23.410> to<00:00:23.500> come<00:00:23.680> to<00:00:23.800> on<00:00:23.920> the<00:00:24.010> map

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 
place you have to come to on the map

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.040 
place you have to come to on the map
let<00:00:24.730> me<00:00:24.850> see<00:00:24.970> can<00:00:25.119> I<00:00:25.210> get<00:00:25.330> to<00:00:25.420> the<00:00:25.510> map<00:00:25.660> quickly

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
let me see can I get to the map quickly

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.140 
let me see can I get to the map quickly
they<00:00:26.860> react<00:00:27.130> to<00:00:27.280> see<00:00:27.369> where<00:00:27.490> my<00:00:27.610> dad<00:00:27.820> is<00:00:28.000> right

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
they react to see where my dad is right

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.120 
they react to see where my dad is right
now<00:00:28.330> where<00:00:28.539> my<00:00:28.570> arrow<00:00:28.810> just<00:00:29.470> over<00:00:29.770> there<00:00:29.949> and

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
now where my arrow just over there and

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.090 
now where my arrow just over there and
it's<00:00:30.640> this<00:00:30.760> room<00:00:31.000> called<00:00:31.300> the<00:00:31.390> elevator<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.980> go

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
it's this room called the elevator so go

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.889 
it's this room called the elevator so go
ahead<00:00:33.190> and<00:00:33.340> Crouch<00:00:33.879> at<00:00:34.090> the<00:00:34.239> earth<00:00:34.449> so<00:00:34.690> I<00:00:34.719> go

00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:34.899 
ahead and Crouch at the earth so I go

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:36.720 
ahead and Crouch at the earth so I go
prone<00:00:35.199> at<00:00:35.379> the<00:00:35.500> bottom<00:00:35.920> right<00:00:36.100> part<00:00:36.309> of<00:00:36.520> this

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
prone at the bottom right part of this

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.210 
prone at the bottom right part of this
glass<00:00:37.030> right<00:00:37.210> here<00:00:37.270> and<00:00:37.630> then<00:00:38.380> just<00:00:38.980> keep

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
glass right here and then just keep

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.530 
glass right here and then just keep
filling<00:00:39.430> around<00:00:39.700> and<00:00:39.880> you<00:00:39.940> should<00:00:40.180> be<00:00:40.300> able<00:00:40.390> to

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
filling around and you should be able to

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.020 
filling around and you should be able to
get<00:00:40.660> inside<00:00:40.810> it<00:00:41.020> and<00:00:41.710> as<00:00:42.280> you<00:00:42.340> can<00:00:42.430> see<00:00:42.579> their

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
get inside it and as you can see their

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.580 
get inside it and as you can see their
bullets<00:00:43.360> actually<00:00:43.630> do<00:00:43.809> land<00:00:44.110> up<00:00:44.230> so<00:00:44.350> if<00:00:44.500> I'm

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
bullets actually do land up so if I'm

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.960 
bullets actually do land up so if I'm
just<00:00:44.680> gonna<00:00:44.770> wait<00:00:44.980> for<00:00:45.040> some<00:00:45.370> of<00:00:45.460> the<00:00:45.550> Buckeyes

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
just gonna wait for some of the Buckeyes

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.900 
just gonna wait for some of the Buckeyes
to<00:00:46.210> come<00:00:46.329> over<00:00:46.540> and<00:00:47.070> I'm<00:00:48.070> see<00:00:48.399> if<00:00:48.489> we<00:00:48.579> can<00:00:48.730> shoot

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
a glitch hopefully you enjoy it and as I

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:05.639 
a glitch hopefully you enjoy it and as I
said<00:01:04.539> I'm<00:01:04.750> not<00:01:04.869> really<00:01:04.989> one<00:01:05.170> for<00:01:05.409> the<00:01:05.469> glitches

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:05.649 
said I'm not really one for the glitches

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:07.289 
said I'm not really one for the glitches
and<00:01:05.950> stuff<00:01:06.100> like<00:01:06.219> that<00:01:06.460> but<00:01:06.640> I<00:01:06.850> thought<00:01:07.149> I'd

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
and stuff like that but I thought I'd

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:08.910 
and stuff like that but I thought I'd
bring<00:01:07.390> you<00:01:07.570> this<00:01:07.689> anyway<00:01:07.930> and<00:01:08.350> as<00:01:08.590> you<00:01:08.710> can<00:01:08.829> see

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
bring you this anyway and as you can see

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.200 
bring you this anyway and as you can see
you<00:01:09.040> can't<00:01:09.250> get<00:01:09.369> out<00:01:09.490> like<00:01:09.700> this<00:01:09.880> you<00:01:10.090> have<00:01:10.180> to

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
you can't get out like this you have to

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.420 
you can't get out like this you have to
crouch<00:01:10.540> down<00:01:10.570> again<00:01:11.049> and<00:01:11.440> actually<00:01:12.190> if<00:01:12.250> you<00:01:12.340> do

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
crouch down again and actually if you do

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.710 
crouch down again and actually if you do
got<00:01:12.610> really<00:01:12.850> close<00:01:13.030> to<00:01:13.180> the<00:01:13.270> glass<00:01:13.450> that<00:01:13.479> I

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
got really close to the glass that I

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.990 
got really close to the glass that I
should've<00:01:13.960> just<00:01:13.990> shoot<00:01:14.260> you<00:01:14.409> guys<00:01:15.220> can<00:01:15.430> sit

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
bad aim so actually maybe the Arab to

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.149 
bad aim so actually maybe the Arab to
shoot<00:01:19.990> me<00:01:20.080> to<00:01:20.229> this<00:01:20.380> guys<00:01:20.530> it's<00:01:20.710> a<00:01:20.740> bit<00:01:20.890> iffy

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
shoot me to this guys it's a bit iffy

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.609 
shoot me to this guys it's a bit iffy
seeing<00:01:21.760> as<00:01:21.880> a<00:01:22.119> glitch<00:01:22.450> of<00:01:22.600> course<00:01:22.840> but<00:01:23.080> as<00:01:23.409> you

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
seeing as a glitch of course but as you

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.109 
seeing as a glitch of course but as you
can<00:01:23.680> see<00:01:23.830> that<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:24.310> map<00:01:24.520> tripping<00:01:24.850> out<00:01:24.970> like

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
can see that the map tripping out like

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:26.429 
can see that the map tripping out like
that<00:01:25.270> source<00:01:25.540> it<00:01:25.720> is<00:01:25.840> a<00:01:25.869> glitch<00:01:26.110> it's<00:01:26.290> not

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
that source it is a glitch it's not

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.469
