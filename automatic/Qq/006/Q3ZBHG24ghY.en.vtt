00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
red wire to the ACC if the red wire is

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.459 
red wire to the ACC if the red wire is
supposed<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.850> be<00:00:33.030> tapped<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.480> ACC<00:00:34.140> like<00:00:34.320> in

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
supposed to be tapped to the ACC like in

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.530 
supposed to be tapped to the ACC like in
this<00:00:34.649> instance<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.460> will<00:00:35.760> need<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.149> locate

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
this instance you will need to locate

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.000 
this instance you will need to locate
the<00:00:36.719> ACC<00:00:37.290> location<00:00:37.890> in<00:00:38.100> your<00:00:38.250> fuse<00:00:38.579> box<00:00:40.010> you

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
the ACC location in your fuse box you

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.799 
the ACC location in your fuse box you
will<00:00:41.129> first<00:00:41.430> need<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.850> tap<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.270> black<00:00:42.480> wire<00:00:42.780> to

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
will first need to tap the black wire to

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.799 
will first need to tap the black wire to
the<00:00:43.260> ground<00:00:43.590> as<00:00:43.829> indicated<00:00:47.450> now<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.510> will

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
the ground as indicated now you will

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.500 
the ground as indicated now you will
need<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.079> open<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.680> fuse<00:00:49.980> box<00:00:50.190> just<00:00:51.059> push<00:00:51.329> in

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
need to open the fuse box just push in

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.180 
need to open the fuse box just push in
the<00:00:51.629> tabs<00:00:51.899> on<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.230> side<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.739> remove<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.250> cover

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
the tabs on the side to remove the cover

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.220 
the tabs on the side to remove the cover
so<00:00:56.190> now<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.489> will<00:00:56.879> test<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.420> see<00:00:57.629> some<00:00:57.870> vacant

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
so now you will test to see some vacant

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.849 
so now you will test to see some vacant
locations<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.039> could<00:00:59.309> be<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.609> ACC<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:01.199> ACC

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
locations that could be the ACC the ACC

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.369 
locations that could be the ACC the ACC
is<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.280> accessory<00:01:02.850> location<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.780> only<00:01:04.049> has

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
is the accessory location that only has

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.460 
is the accessory location that only has
power<00:01:04.680> when<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.220> engine<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.760> on<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.960> test<00:01:07.229> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
power when the engine is on to test the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.200 
power when the engine is on to test the
engine<00:01:07.619> must<00:01:08.130> be<00:01:08.310> off<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.150> key<00:01:09.390> out<00:01:11.210> take

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
engine must be off and the key out take

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.810 
engine must be off and the key out take
the<00:01:12.360> red<00:01:12.630> wire<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.290> touch<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.369> vacant

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
the red wire and touch it to the vacant

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.050 
the red wire and touch it to the vacant
locations<00:01:15.420> if<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:16.409> LED<00:01:16.890> DRL<00:01:17.400> lights<00:01:17.430> up<00:01:17.909> at

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
locations if the LED DRL lights up at

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.330 
locations if the LED DRL lights up at
this<00:01:18.270> point<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.840> means<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.830> not<00:01:20.100> an

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
this point it means that this is not an

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.240 
this point it means that this is not an
ACC<00:01:21.000> location

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.920 

so<00:01:27.250> it<00:01:27.430> looks<00:01:27.640> like<00:01:27.730> I<00:01:28.060> didn't<00:01:28.360> find<00:01:28.600> any

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
so it looks like I didn't find any

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.820 
so it looks like I didn't find any
vacant<00:01:29.560> ACC<00:01:30.190> locations<00:01:30.730> if<00:01:31.230> you<00:01:32.230> did<00:01:32.380> not<00:01:32.530> find

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
vacant ACC locations if you did not find

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.460 
vacant ACC locations if you did not find
an<00:01:33.010> ACC<00:01:33.580> location<00:01:34.150> during<00:01:34.420> initial<00:01:34.960> testing

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
an ACC location during initial testing

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.290 
an ACC location during initial testing
like<00:01:35.620> in<00:01:35.800> this<00:01:35.920> instance<00:01:36.520> you<00:01:36.730> will<00:01:36.970> need<00:01:37.180> to

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
like in this instance you will need to

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.020 
like in this instance you will need to
pull<00:01:37.510> out<00:01:37.690> a<00:01:37.990> relay<00:01:38.560> take<00:01:39.550> a<00:01:39.580> look<00:01:39.790> at<00:01:39.910> your

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
pull out a relay take a look at your

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.300 
pull out a relay take a look at your
fuse<00:01:40.300> box<00:01:40.330> cover<00:01:40.900> and<00:01:41.200> pull<00:01:41.620> out<00:01:41.800> one<00:01:42.040> of<00:01:42.070> the
