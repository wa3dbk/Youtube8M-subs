so<00:03:30.130> this<00:03:30.340> is<00:03:30.520> lower<00:03:30.820> because<00:03:31.300> I<00:03:31.360> don't<00:03:31.540> know

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
so this is lower because I don't know

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.420 
so this is lower because I don't know

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
for guitar for a reason for example it's

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.380 
for guitar for a reason for example it's
going<00:03:36.190> to<00:03:36.310> be<00:03:36.370> lower<00:03:36.610> than<00:03:36.790> they<00:03:37.000> play<00:03:37.210> on<00:03:37.330> the

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
going to be lower than they play on the

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.570 
going to be lower than they play on the
CD<00:03:37.720> but<00:03:38.260> it's<00:03:38.410> a<00:03:38.440> great<00:03:38.740> soft<00:03:39.070> beginners
