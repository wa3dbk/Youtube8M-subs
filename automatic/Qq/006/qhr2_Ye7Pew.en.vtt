 " Baby" 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.000
 I know I have changed 

00:00:13.902 --> 00:00:19.968
 I swear I'm better now 

00:00:20.668 --> 00:00:22.705
 Darling why not 

00:00:22.705 --> 00:00:27.765
 Darling why do not you like 

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:29.517
 Darling why not 

00:00:29.517 --> 00:00:34.333
 Darling why do not you love me 

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:40.083
 I hold on to everything we had 

00:00:41.083 --> 00:00:47.585
 But nothing will ever bring you back 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:08.400
 I know you have changed 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.923
 But I do not know how 

00:01:15.923 --> 00:01:21.697
 I am always looking for love 

00:01:21.697 --> 00:01:25.382
 For all works shall end to nothing 

00:01:25.382 --> 00:01:29.634
 Nothing really matters, my girl 

00:01:29.634 --> 00:01:31.198
 Darling why not 

00:01:31.198 --> 00:01:36.387
 Darling why do not you like 

00:01:36.387 --> 00:01:38.009
 Darling why not 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.823
 Darling why do not you love me 

00:01:42.823 --> 00:01:49.261
 I hold on to everything we had 

00:01:49.261 --> 00:01:54.963
 But nothing will ever bring you back 

00:01:54.963 --> 00:02:11.391
 Oh 

00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:24.401
 Nothing will ever bring you back 

00:02:24.401 --> 00:02:32.339
 I am not mad, I am calmer, calmer, for you 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:39.845
 Darling why not 

00:02:39.845 --> 00:02:44.967
 Darling why do not you like 

00:02:44.967 --> 00:02:46.408
 Darling why not 

00:02:46.408 --> 00:02:51.907
 Darling why do not you love me 

00:02:51.907 --> 00:02:58.344
 I hold on to everything we had 

00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:05.536
 But nothing will ever bring you back 

00:03:05.536 --> 00:03:07.348
 Darling why not 

00:03:07.348 --> 00:03:11.662
 Darling why do not you love me
