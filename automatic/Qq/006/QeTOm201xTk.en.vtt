00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:41.409
 This is Phantom 30 3 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:44.649
 the third generation of the 30-foot boat 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:47.859
 of this state 's chief shipyard and reaches 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:50.049
 the skin derived from fan 290 which was 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.390
 released in 2002 

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:55.479
 then it is a very successful boat in the 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.039
 brazil in its category is the most sold 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:59.530
 by far 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:02.920
 up to last year have already been manufactured 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.720
 more than a thousand and 400 units counting 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.929
 three generations 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.409
 or is it the darling of Brazil in your 

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:10.409
 class 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.290
 because this spot was so successful 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.590
 first is well built 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.440
 she has an excellent cockpit in the cockpit 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.020
 she was the inspiration for other 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.020
 boats of this size that came 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.950
 sequence because it has a good 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.990
 with the double seat has a 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.440
 a divan next to the 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.990
 pilot a very large cockpit on the 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.230
 back with the sofa on a 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.830
 center a small bar with a box 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:16.920
 thermal map a glassware or 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.160
 pilot cockpit and the 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.300
 company before sitting back 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.160
 people 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.930
 so the cockpit is a very 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.480
 important in this boat that is a point 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.610
 very strong on a boat to Brazil 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.650
 the hot weather you want to stay longer 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.890
 time away from the boat than within the 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.890
 neighborhood 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:08.350
 however this spot also has a booth 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:11.140
 in this cabin sleeps up to two couples and 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.750
 two double beds and the bed of the 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.290
 bow is actually a sofa and what can 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.300
 being converted into bed has a bathroom 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.450
 most people stand inside 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.450
 From the cabin the bathroom has 1 63 so no 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.120
 is so high per cabin entrance and has 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.520
 one and 83 on the right foot 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.270
 it's a good time for a 30-speed boat 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.280
 foot 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.590
 this is a differential in this boat in 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.140
 relation to previous models of 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.440
 own yard and it has good 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.470
 well constructed finish and if this 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:48.030
 these are also reasons for the 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.030
 success of this boat 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:15.410
 this spot can be motorized with two 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:20.350
 diesel engines two engines from 150 to 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:24.500
 170 hp each a gasoline engine from 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:27.410
 380 430 app but she normally goes out 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:31.190
 the most sought after is the diesel version with 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:34.460
 two 170 horsepower engines each center 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.950
 open to learn more about this boat 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.190
 keep reading the magazine's tests
