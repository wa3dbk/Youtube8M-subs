 Yes 

00:00:13.399 --> 00:00:16.869
 they are no longer a freshman contributor and performing a longer trekking 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:17.859
 gate 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:19.869
 your next trekking tour 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:20.890
 but should 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.390
 offer something more 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.159
 they have to take something more

 Take some food with you

 and they will be traveling a bit more 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:31.609
 in this case 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.679
 is that Olga x1 carrying system has the answer to their needs 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.300
 The x1 systems is designed to also guide loads 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.250
 up to 30 kilos or in extreme cases more 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.520
 ATIC Jawwad on 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.730
 according to brisk or the wearer to be able to transfer 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.590
 Generally, the carrying system for large fracking backpacks is always about it 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.350
 to remove the load from the area of ​​the shoulder and around the hip 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.610
 invite 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.900
 so you have to be able to relieve the spine 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.210
 and much of the load on the very well-fitting structure of the legs 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.760
 ablate 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.950
 technically, the whole thing is like that 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.890
 executed or guaranteed 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.409
 that the park says is applied to a load-bearing structure 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.770
 consists of a p plate 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.440
 which is processed inside this practice 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.840
 and an additional strength structure mostly made of aluminum 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.960
 the higher the load that needs to be handled 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.550
 the better 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.380
 No, in the evening 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.780
 and wear system running 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.010
 the problem is that there result that the body when running or 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.770
 the pelvic area while walking 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.790
 demonstrated a pendulum motion 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.280
 is the connection of the short pack says too stiff 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.950
 disabled man the natural pendulum movements 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.320
 of the carrier 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.030
 That's why you try this area 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.120
 at the same time to keep steep and at least partially decouple 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.580
 this happens in the x1 system by the two aluminum strive 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.320
 to cross in the middle 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.699
 this gives you one 

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:12.589
 Pivot point of the forms Rift Kurt way is shifted upward 

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:16.400
 the two aspire to run out of the outside of the 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.759
 Bettencourts 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:23.829
 allow a certain movement in spite of a high stability of the system 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:24.769
 this area 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.889
 to increase the comfort in coping with such high loads again 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.099
 will be compared to 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.530
 Standard the system of tracking backpacks in the x1 system also the 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:38.260
 The upholstery is a bit more massive and it also has different foams 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.339
 Layers in a row

 dumped and then 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.919
 on the but contact page 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:49.119
 m thick covered which ensures that there is also a certain ventilation 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:51.599
 to the body is still possible 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.490
 additionally supported by 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.879
 Scan the ventilation which is incorporated into the upholstery
