00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
user will immediately be detected as

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.560 
user will immediately be detected as

running a violation or a prohibit rule

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.190 
running a violation or a prohibit rule
and<00:02:48.840> will<00:02:49.320> lose<00:02:49.530> connectivity<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.489> the

production side of the network and so

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.900

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
completely disconnect them from the port

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.300 
completely disconnect them from the port
you<00:04:32.760> can<00:04:32.940> do<00:04:33.120> that<00:04:33.410> you<00:04:34.410> can<00:04:34.590> also<00:04:34.740> adjust<00:04:35.010> the

you can do that you can also adjust the

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.510 
you can do that you can also adjust the
sensitivity<00:04:35.670> set<00:04:36.270> settings<00:04:37.080> here<00:04:37.350> as<00:04:37.470> well<00:04:37.710> so

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
sensitivity set settings here as well so

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.100 
sensitivity set settings here as well so
once<00:04:38.730> that's<00:04:38.970> complete<00:04:39.420> all<00:04:39.660> you<00:04:39.750> have<00:04:39.840> to<00:04:39.960> do

once that's complete all you have to do

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.840 
once that's complete all you have to do
is<00:04:40.290> select<00:04:40.470> the<00:04:40.830> switch<00:04:41.220> that<00:04:41.400> you<00:04:41.520> want<00:04:41.730> to

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
is select the switch that you want to

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:47.810 
is select the switch that you want to
assign<00:04:42.150> this<00:04:42.330> to<00:04:43.910> and<00:04:45.950> then<00:04:46.950> select<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.490> port

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
assign this to and then select the port

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:54.260 
assign this to and then select the port
that<00:04:48.000> you<00:04:48.060> want<00:04:48.360> to<00:04:48.510> assign<00:04:48.870> this<00:04:49.560> to<00:04:50.960> and<00:04:53.270> then

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
that you want to assign this to and then

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.630 
that you want to assign this to and then
simply<00:04:54.720> apply<00:04:54.750> those<00:04:55.320> settings<00:04:55.830> or<00:04:56.220> changes

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:02.150 
simply apply those settings or changes
to<00:04:56.669> the<00:04:56.880> switch

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.010 

so<00:05:03.160> when<00:05:03.340> we<00:05:03.460> go<00:05:03.610> back<00:05:03.640> to<00:05:03.850> the<00:05:04.090> user<00:05:04.300> we're

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
so when we go back to the user we're

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.060 
so when we go back to the user we're
going<00:05:05.320> to<00:05:05.670> emulate<00:05:06.670> what<00:05:06.880> a<00:05:06.910> hacker<00:05:07.180> would<00:05:07.480> use

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
going to emulate what a hacker would use

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.150 
going to emulate what a hacker would use
