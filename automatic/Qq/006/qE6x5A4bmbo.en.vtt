knock off this torch and play some

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.039 
knock off this torch and play some
redstone<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.429> activate<00:00:12.150> this<00:00:12.269> lever<00:00:12.540> and

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
redstone and activate this lever and

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.620 
redstone and activate this lever and
what<00:00:13.170> this<00:00:13.290> will<00:00:13.440> do<00:00:13.590> is<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:13.920> will<00:00:14.009> constantly

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
what this will do is it will constantly

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.599 
what this will do is it will constantly
read<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:16.020> V<00:00:16.199> tape<00:00:18.439> and<00:00:19.439> then<00:00:19.710> we<00:00:20.279> should<00:00:20.430> make

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
read the V tape and then we should make

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.790 
read the V tape and then we should make
our<00:00:20.820> own<00:00:20.910> combination<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.920> am<00:00:22.920> gonna<00:00:23.160> go<00:00:24.800> white

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
our own combination I am gonna go white

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.870 
our own combination I am gonna go white
right

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
right

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.480 
right
white<00:00:27.210> right<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.720> then<00:00:28.680> once<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.099> set<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.310> to

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
white right and then once you set it to

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.189 
white right and then once you set it to
white<00:00:29.609> right<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:30.029> start<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.420> clock<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:31.019> can

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
white right you start the clock you can

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.650 
white right you start the clock you can
flip<00:00:32.130> this<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.579> whatever<00:00:32.730> direction<00:00:32.969> what<00:00:33.390> you

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
flip this to whatever direction what you

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.110 
flip this to whatever direction what you
want<00:00:33.840> I'm<00:00:34.050> doing<00:00:34.260> quite<00:00:34.590> right<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.940> go<00:00:36.059> to

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
want I'm doing quite right and you go to

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.549 
want I'm doing quite right and you go to
the<00:00:36.300> back<00:00:36.510> here<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:38.780> as<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.930> can<00:00:39.989> see<00:00:40.200> some<00:00:40.440> of

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
the back here and as you can see some of

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.920 
the back here and as you can see some of
this<00:00:40.649> stuff<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:41.719> turned<00:00:42.719> on<00:00:42.930> now<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:44.930> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
this stuff is turned on now and the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.900 
this stuff is turned on now and the
stuff<00:00:46.200> that's<00:00:46.379> turned<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.100> want<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.370> flip

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
stuff that's turned on you want to flip

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.790 
stuff that's turned on you want to flip
to<00:00:47.969> something<00:00:48.480> else<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:48.930> like<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.350> repeater

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
to something else so like the repeater

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.400 
to something else so like the repeater
has<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.460> become<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:51.000> torch

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
has to become a torch

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.060 
has to become a torch
this<00:00:53.070> repeater<00:00:53.400> has<00:00:53.550> become<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> torch<00:00:54.180> you

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
this repeater has become a torch you

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.930 
this repeater has become a torch you
need<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.190> break<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.520> block<00:00:56.700> below<00:00:57.500> and<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:59.040> bit

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
need to break the block below and a bit

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.990 
need to break the block below and a bit
more<00:01:00.120> difficult<00:01:00.300> but<00:01:01.129> have<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.250> go<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.550> here

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
more difficult but have to go in here

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.939 
more difficult but have to go in here
and<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.600> could<00:01:03.720> do<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:03.960> without<00:01:04.110> noclip<00:01:04.739> but

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
and you could do this without noclip but

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.230 
and you could do this without noclip but
you<00:01:05.070> have<00:01:05.190> you<00:01:05.370> have<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.550> be<00:01:05.640> careful<00:01:06.180> with

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
you have you have to be careful with

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.620 
you have you have to be careful with
this<00:01:06.420> torch<00:01:10.670> all<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.850> sounds<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.360> stuff

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
this torch all the sounds and stuff

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.870 
this torch all the sounds and stuff
that's<00:01:12.780> making<00:01:13.020> getting<00:01:13.619> made<00:01:14.280> now's<00:01:14.520> not

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
that's making getting made now's not

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.100 
that's making getting made now's not
it's<00:01:15.420> not<00:01:15.570> important

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.130 

so<00:01:19.110> that's<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.770> first<00:01:20.250> one<00:01:20.550> and<00:01:21.300> we<00:01:21.990> have<00:01:22.080> to

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
so that's the first one and we have to

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.330 
so that's the first one and we have to
be<00:01:22.259> careful<00:01:22.650> now<00:01:22.740> because<00:01:22.979> we<00:01:23.100> have<00:01:23.220> some

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
be careful now because we have some

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.340 
be careful now because we have some
cross<00:01:23.580> connections<00:01:24.210> going<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.690> here<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.200> if

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
cross connections going on here so if

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.560 
cross connections going on here so if
you<00:01:25.530> had<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.340> flip<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.850> one<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.270> like<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
you had to flip this one this like the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.510 
you had to flip this one this like the
only<00:01:27.600> weird<00:01:28.050> thing<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.830> in<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.190> decoder

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
only weird thing in the in the decoder

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.680 
only weird thing in the in the decoder
but<00:01:30.210> if<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.539> had<00:01:30.690> to<00:01:31.100> reverse<00:01:32.100> or<00:01:32.460> change<00:01:33.390> this

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
but if you had to reverse or change this

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.980 
but if you had to reverse or change this
repeater<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.800> a<00:01:34.830> torch<00:01:35.479> you<00:01:36.479> actually<00:01:36.780> have<00:01:36.869> to

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
repeater to a torch you actually have to

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.969 
repeater to a torch you actually have to
make<00:01:37.130> tiny<00:01:38.130> adjustments<00:01:38.910> to<00:01:39.149> the<00:01:39.240> circuit

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
make tiny adjustments to the circuit

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.580 
make tiny adjustments to the circuit
which<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.479> if<00:01:42.479> they<00:01:42.720> move<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.080> repeater<00:01:43.410> one

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
which is if they move this repeater one

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.560 
which is if they move this repeater one
block<00:01:43.800> up

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:53.970 

and<00:01:46.660> then<00:01:49.080> you<00:01:50.080> will<00:01:50.260> have<00:01:50.470> to<00:01:52.560> replace<00:01:53.560> this

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
and then you will have to replace this

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.890 
and then you will have to replace this
with<00:01:54.690> closed<00:01:55.690> down

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.820 

and<00:01:58.990> then

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.090 

then<00:02:04.830> you<00:02:05.280> can<00:02:05.520> place<00:02:06.390> redstone<00:02:06.990> here<00:02:07.230> so

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
then you can place redstone here so

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.850 
then you can place redstone here so
that's<00:02:08.310> just<00:02:08.490> something<00:02:09.360> weird<00:02:09.750> with<00:02:10.110> with

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
that's just something weird with with

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.550 
that's just something weird with with
decoder<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.930> there<00:02:12.930> wasn't<00:02:13.050> really<00:02:13.140> any<00:02:13.410> way

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
decoder and there wasn't really any way

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.310 
decoder and there wasn't really any way
for<00:02:13.620> me<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:13.830> fix<00:02:14.160> that<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.930> now<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:15.990> cannot

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
for me to fix that and now you cannot

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.410 
for me to fix that and now you cannot
place<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.620> repeater<00:02:16.830> on<00:02:17.160> this<00:02:17.460> thing<00:02:17.700> but<00:02:18.150> you

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
place a repeater on this thing but you

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.860 
place a repeater on this thing but you
can<00:02:18.750> however<00:02:19.020> place<00:02:20.060> closed<00:02:21.060> down<00:02:21.090> straight

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
can however place closed down straight

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.560 
can however place closed down straight
on<00:02:21.990> top<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.410> so<00:02:23.130> that's<00:02:23.280> not<00:02:23.490> really<00:02:23.670> an

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
on top of it so that's not really an

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.440 
on top of it so that's not really an
issue<00:02:24.840> she<00:02:25.290> knows<00:02:25.950> there's<00:02:26.160> nothing<00:02:26.270> above<00:02:27.270> it

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
issue she knows there's nothing above it

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.730 

what<00:03:12.040> did<00:03:12.160> I<00:03:12.250> say<00:03:12.490> I<00:03:12.520> said<00:03:12.700> Brown<00:03:13.150> left<00:03:13.740> Brown

what did I say I said Brown left Brown
left<00:03:17.970> now<00:03:18.970> this<00:03:19.570> becomes<00:03:20.080> a<00:03:20.500> torch<00:03:20.950> doesn't<00:03:21.730> an

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
left now this becomes a torch doesn't an

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.960 
left now this becomes a torch doesn't an
issue<00:03:22.150> for<00:03:22.420> me<00:03:22.570> now<00:03:22.750> but<00:03:22.990> I<00:03:23.170> can<00:03:23.350> imagine<00:03:23.440> it

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
issue for me now but I can imagine it

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.190 
issue for me now but I can imagine it
could<00:03:24.970> become<00:03:25.150> an<00:03:25.360> issue<00:03:25.420> and<00:03:25.690> this<00:03:25.750> is<00:03:25.900> also<00:03:26.080> a

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
could become an issue and this is also a

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.720 
could become an issue and this is also a
torch<00:03:26.590> so<00:03:27.430> it's<00:03:27.550> the<00:03:27.670> second<00:03:28.060> one<00:03:28.710> then<00:03:29.730> what

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
torch so it's the second one then what

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.620 
torch so it's the second one then what
we<00:03:30.880> do<00:03:31.180> is<00:03:33.030> I'm<00:03:34.030> gonna<00:03:34.150> make<00:03:34.360> the<00:03:34.450> most

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
we do is I'm gonna make the most

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.270 
we do is I'm gonna make the most
horrible<00:03:34.930> looking<00:03:35.290> combination<00:03:35.890> ever<00:03:36.100> I'm

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
horrible looking combination ever I'm

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:47.460 
horrible looking combination ever I'm
gonna<00:03:36.460> do<00:03:36.580> pink<00:03:38.280> pink<00:03:39.280> right<00:03:45.840> so<00:03:46.840> okay<00:03:47.230> there

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
gonna do pink pink right so okay there

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.150 
gonna do pink pink right so okay there
we<00:03:47.530> go<00:03:47.590> pink<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:50.500> then<00:03:50.650> we<00:03:50.740> go<00:03:50.860> through<00:03:50.920> the

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
we go pink and then we go through the

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.860 
we go pink and then we go through the
third<00:03:51.520> latch<00:03:52.860> we're<00:03:53.860> gonna<00:03:54.010> replace<00:03:54.280> this

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.830 

place<00:03:58.870> this<00:03:59.530> as<00:03:59.740> well<00:03:59.980> I<00:04:00.390> am<00:04:01.390> actually<00:04:01.540> going

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
place this as well I am actually going

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.570 
place this as well I am actually going
to<00:04:01.930> make<00:04:02.050> the<00:04:02.230> fourth<00:04:02.620> color<00:04:02.860> pink<00:04:03.370> as<00:04:03.550> well

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
to make the fourth color pink as well

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.760 
to make the fourth color pink as well
pink<00:04:04.270> right<00:04:04.510> so<00:04:04.990> this<00:04:05.170> is<00:04:05.290> going<00:04:05.380> to<00:04:05.470> be<00:04:05.560> the

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
pink right so this is going to be the

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:06.330 
pink right so this is going to be the
same<00:04:05.980> color

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
same color

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.880 
same color
twice<00:04:08.820> makes<00:04:09.820> it<00:04:09.970> easier<00:04:10.360> to<00:04:10.710> input<00:04:11.710> it

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
twice makes it easier to input it

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.330 
twice makes it easier to input it
doesn't<00:04:12.550> take<00:04:12.700> as<00:04:12.850> well<00:04:13.030> as<00:04:13.180> much<00:04:13.360> time<00:04:14.340> so

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
doesn't take as well as much time so

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.890 
doesn't take as well as much time so
that<00:04:15.490> we<00:04:15.580> already<00:04:15.700> done<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:16.180> fourth<00:04:16.570> one<00:04:16.750> as

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
that we already done the fourth one as

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:17.690 
that we already done the fourth one as
well

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
well

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.940 
well
pink<00:04:18.700> right<00:04:18.910> pink<00:04:19.180> right<00:04:19.420> and<00:04:19.690> the<00:04:19.930> last<00:04:20.230> one<00:04:20.680> I

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
pink right pink right and the last one I

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:29.629 
pink right pink right and the last one I
am<00:04:21.670> going<00:04:21.940> to<00:04:22.150> do<00:04:23.670> black<00:04:24.670> left

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.809 

so<00:04:30.639> black<00:04:31.360> and<00:04:32.009> again<00:04:33.009> this<00:04:33.189> is<00:04:33.339> sort<00:04:33.699> of

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:33.819 
so black and again this is sort of

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:38.299 
so black and again this is sort of
somewhat<00:04:34.389> of<00:04:34.479> a<00:04:34.539> weird<00:04:35.369> decoder<00:04:36.599> you<00:04:37.599> have<00:04:37.689> to

00:04:38.299 --> 00:04:38.309 
somewhat of a weird decoder you have to

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:41.219 
somewhat of a weird decoder you have to
place<00:04:39.309> some<00:04:39.550> torches<00:04:40.330> there<00:04:40.689> so<00:04:40.899> you<00:04:40.960> can<00:04:41.110> see

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
place some torches there so you can see

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:43.739 
place some torches there so you can see
which<00:04:41.439> ones<00:04:41.680> are<00:04:41.830> on<00:04:42.009> now<00:04:42.819> the<00:04:43.240> ones<00:04:43.449> that<00:04:43.629> are

00:04:43.739 --> 00:04:43.749 
which ones are on now the ones that are

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:46.649 
which ones are on now the ones that are
on<00:04:44.249> you're<00:04:45.249> gonna<00:04:45.399> place<00:04:45.669> block<00:04:46.449> with

00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:46.659 
on you're gonna place block with

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:48.689 
on you're gonna place block with
redstone<00:04:46.809> dog's<00:04:47.259> neck<00:04:47.439> redstone<00:04:48.249> dust<00:04:48.399> next

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
redstone dog's neck redstone dust next

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:50.279 
redstone dog's neck redstone dust next
to<00:04:48.789> them<00:04:48.909> the<00:04:49.360> ones<00:04:49.539> that<00:04:49.719> are<00:04:49.839> I<00:04:50.020> mean<00:04:50.169> the

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:50.289 
to them the ones that are I mean the

to them the ones that are I mean the
ones<00:04:50.469> that<00:04:50.589> are<00:04:50.649> off<00:04:50.860> block<00:04:51.369> with<00:04:51.580> redstone

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
ones that are off block with redstone

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:52.769 
ones that are off block with redstone
dust<00:04:52.089> next<00:04:52.389> to<00:04:52.479> them

00:04:52.769 --> 00:04:52.779 
dust next to them

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:55.049 
dust next to them
the<00:04:53.169> torches<00:04:53.469> that<00:04:53.680> are<00:04:53.800> turned<00:04:53.979> on<00:04:54.189> you

00:04:55.049 --> 00:04:55.059 
the torches that are turned on you

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:56.579 
the torches that are turned on you
remove<00:04:55.389> the<00:04:55.569> block<00:04:55.779> and<00:04:56.050> you<00:04:56.199> make<00:04:56.409> the

00:04:56.579 --> 00:04:56.589 
remove the block and you make the

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:58.379 
remove the block and you make the
redstone<00:04:57.129> one<00:04:57.309> block<00:04:57.550> below<00:04:57.729> and<00:04:58.180> then<00:04:58.300> you

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
redstone one block below and then you

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.899 
redstone one block below and then you
remove<00:04:58.629> the<00:04:58.779> torches<00:04:59.229> so<00:04:59.649> this<00:04:59.830> one<00:05:00.009> destroy

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:00.909 
remove the torches so this one destroy

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:03.089 
remove the torches so this one destroy
it<00:05:01.029> is<00:05:01.149> one<00:05:01.509> block<00:05:01.689> below<00:05:01.899> the<00:05:02.680> reason<00:05:03.009> I'm

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:03.099 
it is one block below the reason I'm

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:05.040 
it is one block below the reason I'm
doing<00:05:03.219> it<00:05:03.399> like<00:05:03.459> that<00:05:03.610> is<00:05:04.029> because<00:05:04.209> there's<00:05:04.569> a

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
doing it like that is because there's a

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.779 
doing it like that is because there's a
torch<00:05:05.589> here<00:05:05.919> and<00:05:06.189> it's<00:05:06.369> going<00:05:06.550> to<00:05:06.610> cross

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789 
torch here and it's going to cross

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:09.779 
torch here and it's going to cross
connect<00:05:07.240> and<00:05:07.569> seeing<00:05:08.529> as<00:05:08.680> the<00:05:08.860> the<00:05:09.189> reads<00:05:09.430> like

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
connect and seeing as the the reads like

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.350 
connect and seeing as the the reads like
the<00:05:09.969> torch<00:05:10.240> that<00:05:10.539> sends<00:05:11.199> the<00:05:11.259> signal<00:05:11.289> up<00:05:11.919> is

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
the torch that sends the signal up is

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.609 
the torch that sends the signal up is
firing<00:05:13.360> into<00:05:13.629> this<00:05:13.719> block<00:05:13.959> I<00:05:14.169> can<00:05:14.319> just<00:05:14.469> read

00:05:14.609 --> 00:05:14.619 
firing into this block I can just read

00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:17.329 
firing into this block I can just read
it<00:05:14.770> here<00:05:14.979> and<00:05:15.129> there's<00:05:15.339> no<00:05:15.490> torch<00:05:15.789> there<00:05:16.119> so<00:05:16.330> no

00:05:17.329 --> 00:05:17.339 
it here and there's no torch there so no

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:21.019 
it here and there's no torch there so no
no<00:05:18.339> possibility<00:05:19.029> of<00:05:19.360> cross<00:05:19.959> connecting<00:05:20.439> wires

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:21.029 
no possibility of cross connecting wires

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:24.719 
no possibility of cross connecting wires
so<00:05:22.029> that's<00:05:22.149> the<00:05:22.270> whole<00:05:22.419> thing<00:05:23.399> then<00:05:24.399> what<00:05:24.610> you

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
so that's the whole thing then what you

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:27.029 
so that's the whole thing then what you
do<00:05:24.879> is<00:05:25.059> you<00:05:25.209> turn<00:05:25.479> this<00:05:25.719> back<00:05:25.959> off<00:05:26.169> and<00:05:26.529> fix

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 
do is you turn this back off and fix

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:31.409 
do is you turn this back off and fix
this<00:05:27.399> torch<00:05:27.699> again<00:05:27.999> and<00:05:28.899> I<00:05:29.709> guess<00:05:30.300> it<00:05:31.300> already

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
this torch again and I guess it already

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:35.519 
this torch again and I guess it already
reset<00:05:31.990> that's<00:05:32.319> good<00:05:32.939> I<00:05:34.080> guess<00:05:35.080> we're<00:05:35.439> gonna

00:05:35.519 --> 00:05:35.529 
reset that's good I guess we're gonna

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:38.779 
reset that's good I guess we're gonna
try<00:05:35.860> it<00:05:35.919> out<00:05:36.099> so<00:05:36.430> the<00:05:36.550> first<00:05:36.909> one<00:05:37.149> was<00:05:37.659> white

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
try it out so the first one was white

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:42.550 
try it out so the first one was white
right

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.880 

the<00:05:43.040> second<00:05:43.430> one<00:05:43.610> I<00:05:44.170> was<00:05:45.170> interested<00:05:45.560> by<00:05:45.830> the

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:45.890 
the second one I was interested by the

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.700 
the second one I was interested by the
way<00:05:46.010> you're<00:05:46.910> stepping<00:05:47.270> off<00:05:47.420> you<00:05:47.990> can<00:05:48.170> see<00:05:48.470> if

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
way you're stepping off you can see if

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:49.360 
way you're stepping off you can see if
it<00:05:48.830> worked

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
it worked

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.460 
it worked
by<00:05:49.850> checking<00:05:50.240> out<00:05:50.540> this<00:05:50.750> repeater<00:05:51.110> if<00:05:51.320> this

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
by checking out this repeater if this

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.050 
by checking out this repeater if this
repeaters<00:05:51.860> on<00:05:52.100> then<00:05:52.310> you<00:05:52.430> activated<00:05:52.880> the

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
repeaters on then you activated the

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.270 
repeaters on then you activated the
first<00:05:53.300> latch<00:05:53.540> the<00:05:54.260> second<00:05:54.620> the<00:05:54.830> second<00:05:55.160> latch

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
first latch the second the second latch

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.750 
first latch the second the second latch
is<00:05:55.580> this<00:05:55.790> redstone<00:05:56.210> here<00:05:56.470> so<00:05:57.470> it's<00:05:58.370> already<00:05:58.610> at

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
is this redstone here so it's already at

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.990 
is this redstone here so it's already at
Brown<00:05:59.060> so<00:05:59.570> Brown<00:05:59.840> left<00:06:00.230> and<00:06:00.700> this<00:06:01.700> redstone

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
Brown so Brown left and this redstone

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.240 
Brown so Brown left and this redstone
dust<00:06:02.240> should<00:06:02.450> activate<00:06:04.180> there<00:06:05.180> we<00:06:05.270> go<00:06:05.590> then<00:06:06.590> I

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
dust should activate there we go then I

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:13.230 
dust should activate there we go then I
was<00:06:07.910> saying<00:06:08.180> pink

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.010 

right<00:06:14.729> so<00:06:15.729> that<00:06:15.850> should<00:06:16.030> activate<00:06:16.449> another

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
right so that should activate another

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:22.350 
right so that should activate another
latch<00:06:17.350> here<00:06:19.169> and<00:06:20.169> it<00:06:21.130> just<00:06:21.160> pink<00:06:21.550> right<00:06:21.819> again

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 
latch here and it just pink right again

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.999 
latch here and it just pink right again
and<00:06:23.400> so<00:06:24.400> let's<00:06:24.580> flip<00:06:25.090> it<00:06:25.710> left<00:06:26.710> and<00:06:26.919> then

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:27.009 
and so let's flip it left and then

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:28.050 
and so let's flip it left and then
quickly<00:06:27.250> right<00:06:27.580> again

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060 
quickly right again

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.950 
quickly right again
and<00:06:28.150> then<00:06:28.569> it<00:06:28.690> should<00:06:28.840> activate<00:06:29.229> this

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
and then it should activate this

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.050 
and then it should activate this
repeater<00:06:31.960> there<00:06:32.620> we<00:06:32.680> go<00:06:32.860> and<00:06:33.280> then<00:06:33.880> we're<00:06:33.970> at

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 
repeater there we go and then we're at

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:40.999 
repeater there we go and then we're at
the<00:06:34.120> final<00:06:34.389> latch<00:06:34.750> which<00:06:35.440> is<00:06:36.120> black<00:06:37.120> left<00:06:39.930> and

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:41.009 
the final latch which is black left and

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:45.240 
the final latch which is black left and
now<00:06:42.009> it<00:06:42.280> should<00:06:43.530> turn<00:06:44.530> off<00:06:44.710> that<00:06:44.860> redstone

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:45.250 
now it should turn off that redstone

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.339 
now it should turn off that redstone
dust<00:06:45.400> there<00:06:45.820> we<00:06:45.910> go<00:06:46.060> so<00:06:46.810> there<00:06:47.110> you<00:06:47.169> have<00:06:47.199> it

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:47.349 
dust there we go so there you have it

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:49.680 
dust there we go so there you have it
that's<00:06:47.620> how<00:06:47.800> you<00:06:47.830> set<00:06:48.220> your<00:06:48.250> combination<00:06:49.060> this

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:49.690 
that's how you set your combination this

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.839 
that's how you set your combination this
is<00:06:49.810> the<00:06:49.900> output<00:06:50.289> now<00:06:50.500> if<00:06:51.340> you<00:06:51.430> want<00:06:51.610> the<00:06:51.669> signal

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:51.849 
is the output now if you want the signal

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:53.999 
is the output now if you want the signal
just<00:06:52.240> invert<00:06:52.570> this<00:06:52.840> they<00:06:53.349> have<00:06:53.590> it<00:06:53.740> that's

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:54.009 
just invert this they have it that's

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:58.170 
just invert this they have it that's
your<00:06:54.190> signal<00:06:54.550> and<00:06:54.910> if<00:06:55.750> you<00:06:56.020> wanna<00:06:56.400> if<00:06:57.400> you<00:06:58.000> want

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:58.180 
your signal and if you wanna if you want

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.779 
your signal and if you wanna if you want
to<00:06:58.300> reset<00:06:58.690> it<00:06:58.810> like<00:06:59.440> it<00:06:59.979> doesn't<00:07:00.190> matter<00:07:00.400> like

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:00.789 
to reset it like it doesn't matter like

00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:03.570 
to reset it like it doesn't matter like
any<00:07:01.120> color<00:07:01.509> you<00:07:01.840> do<00:07:02.229> now<00:07:02.440> is<00:07:02.800> gonna<00:07:03.070> reset<00:07:03.430> the

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:03.580 
any color you do now is gonna reset the

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.070 
any color you do now is gonna reset the
system<00:07:03.729> it<00:07:04.060> doesn't<00:07:04.210> matter<00:07:04.449> what<00:07:04.659> color<00:07:04.870> you

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.080 
system it doesn't matter what color you

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.279 
system it doesn't matter what color you
do<00:07:05.259> it's<00:07:05.500> always<00:07:05.889> always<00:07:06.669> wrong<00:07:07.000> so<00:07:07.449> and<00:07:08.110> I'm

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:08.289 
do it's always always wrong so and I'm

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:10.680 
do it's always always wrong so and I'm
just<00:07:08.440> gonna<00:07:08.530> flip<00:07:08.860> the<00:07:08.979> lever<00:07:09.130> pink<00:07:09.610> and<00:07:09.970> it

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:10.690 
just gonna flip the lever pink and it

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.610 
just gonna flip the lever pink and it
should<00:07:10.930> pull<00:07:11.409> back<00:07:11.650> this<00:07:11.919> block

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:13.620 
should pull back this block

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.010 
should pull back this block
there<00:07:14.310> we<00:07:14.400> go<00:07:14.580> and<00:07:14.790> activates<00:07:15.510> the<00:07:15.660> circuit

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:16.020 
there we go and activates the circuit

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.189 
there we go and activates the circuit
again<00:07:16.400> so<00:07:17.400> that<00:07:17.729> closes<00:07:18.030> your<00:07:18.419> door<00:07:18.600> or<00:07:18.900> hides

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 
again so that closes your door or hides

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:21.770 
again so that closes your door or hides
your<00:07:19.410> diamonds
