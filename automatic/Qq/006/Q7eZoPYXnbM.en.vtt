00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:02.960
 Here's for Koch on YouTube 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.830
 I thought briefly introduce my name is Nikolaus Risch 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.679
 in the game is for it was going and try for today 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:11.729
 through the piece 

00:00:11.729 --> 00:00:13.949
 passing through the first one is in Tennessee 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:16.949
 to join the rematch under pressure with some 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.970
 and suggestions 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.939
 right at the beginning 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.409
 But I think it should be first 

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:30.369
 are played as Bottrop ec cards meaning they grab the gates and 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.530
 pull the side of the handle Welbeck 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.460
 so that a hard-hitting Dr sound is created 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.460
 I'll make that short 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.750
 nobody would 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.750
 that should be SuS problem 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.970
 Suter 15 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.670
 make there percent with one stroke proposal 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.790
 try intact 15 to get smear so middle 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.410
 we're going to bring that 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.140
 nothing is used up 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.430
 21 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.050
 Then the sound should be very sonorous 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.440
 and be strong 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.440
 if, on the other hand, morning is like alcohol 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.510
 when they arrive then 21 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.110
 my suggestion would be percent 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.110
 the final sentence just to achieve my good education 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.460
 to exchange the fingers 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:14.370
 Nico's main street proposal 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.029
 also to start by 

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:19.329
 and then the 32 STA next to a descent to play 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:28.679
 Chur 

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:29.579
 this should 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:30.829
 greatest clarity 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.889
 for the rhythm 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:37.879
 Instock 51 will reach 8 set on that is right at the very beginning 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.579
 Unhappy about secondary market a consistently, Fischer pressure is playing too 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.579
 can 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.269
 b 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.449
 important is act 58 

00:02:57.449 --> 00:03:01.679
 played 16 please pay attention to the accents that is exactly the 

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:04.679
 not the usual place sense 

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:14.299
 the water watch says Hauke ​​62 finds Aktrice is coming 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.139
 that they still set the pace 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:20.089
 Well, and although I have a consistent crescendo about two 

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:23.229
 so that is not in the meantime whether the seal or 

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:26.899
 Prof 

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:31.409
 the next place which could be a bit more problematic 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:36.749
 is the pact change from day 81 to 82 from said Parton 7 16 said 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:38.829
 but 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.859
 when played through as a Veronika metronome, fear of death is no problem 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:42.639
 his 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.769
 eats the plus postponed 81 Beck 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.769
 Ambühl 

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:54.019
 m 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:54.849
 because here 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.979
 especially since Digão the Watsche come 98 the area 

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:00.819
 I would suggest in time 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.899
 beautiful 

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:05.849
 the second layer to slip 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.840
 the stock market remained 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.319
 Bremen 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:11.479
 APA 

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:13.349
 that's it 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:15.339
 new key love 

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:17.939
 already in the right one 

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:21.120
 his 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.120
 a stitch proposal for the Gemotze Optakt 110 

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:26.919
 the last two eighth 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.919
 each in the day which also follow 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.530
 So also play separately then in Mixed AK theme packages 1 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.439
 clear 

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:39.400
 the 60 percent 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.240
 in late summer 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.439
 Mr mm 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.199
 Bremen 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:51.199
 Emden 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.330
 Dr. 60 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.379
 because the SG around so the last big partner 32 units from it on the 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:07.699
 aim 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:09.219
 the 1 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:11.560
 Coates still play vibrated 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.060
 that is unacceptable 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.060
 and still a strong accent on the 2 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:29.059
 these eighth really all play on descent 

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:31.809
 as well as the last ones 

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:34.809
 of the piece 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:42.949
 that'll get through 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:44.639
 I hope to go upstairs 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:47.349
 Could give inspiration and too much fun
