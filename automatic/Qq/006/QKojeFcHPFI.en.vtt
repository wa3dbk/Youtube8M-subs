00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
that we're working with the 1dx so I'm

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.890 
that we're working with the 1dx so I'm
going<00:03:07.160> to<00:03:07.190> be<00:03:07.310> shooting<00:03:07.490> 12<00:03:07.910> frames<00:03:08.270> a<00:03:08.450> second

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
going to be shooting 12 frames a second

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.780

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
and our strobes are going to be able to

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.940 
and our strobes are going to be able to
keep<00:03:11.000> up<00:03:11.180> with<00:03:11.360> that<00:03:11.450> as<00:03:12.050> we<00:03:12.380> get<00:03:12.500> less<00:03:12.710> light

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
keep up with that as we get less light

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.010 
keep up with that as we get less light
in<00:03:13.130> the<00:03:13.220> sky<00:03:13.370> it's<00:03:14.120> much<00:03:14.330> easier<00:03:14.720> for<00:03:14.780> the

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
in the sky it's much easier for the

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.430 
in the sky it's much easier for the
throws<00:03:15.320> keep<00:03:15.680> up<00:03:16.090> I'm<00:03:17.090> always<00:03:17.480> surprised<00:03:18.110> in

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
throws keep up I'm always surprised in

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.410 
throws keep up I'm always surprised in
12<00:03:18.770> frames<00:03:19.040> there's<00:03:19.430> one<00:03:19.670> decisive<00:03:20.030> frame

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
12 frames there's one decisive frame

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.480 
12 frames there's one decisive frame
that's<00:03:20.660> always<00:03:20.840> the<00:03:21.020> best<00:03:21.200> so<00:03:21.590> it's<00:03:22.190> a<00:03:22.310> big

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
that's always the best so it's a big

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:23.920 
that's always the best so it's a big
deal<00:03:22.610> to<00:03:22.790> be<00:03:22.820> able<00:03:22.940> to<00:03:23.030> shoot<00:03:23.270> at<00:03:23.360> 12<00:03:23.570> frames<00:03:23.690> a
