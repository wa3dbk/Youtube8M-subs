but<00:07:12.139> there<00:07:12.319> in<00:07:12.440> split<00:07:12.770> time<00:07:12.949> as<00:07:13.099> well<00:07:13.310> when

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:14.180 
but there in split time as well when

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.790 
but there in split time as well when
changing<00:07:14.599> directions<00:07:14.840> with<00:07:15.229> this<00:07:15.349> movement

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:15.800 
changing directions with this movement

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.830 
changing directions with this movement
I<00:07:15.830> find<00:07:16.160> the<00:07:16.280> pivoting<00:07:16.699> footwork<00:07:17.150> style<00:07:17.330> works

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:17.840 
I find the pivoting footwork style works

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.290 
I find the pivoting footwork style works
most<00:07:18.139> effectively<00:07:18.639> this<00:07:19.639> pattern<00:07:20.090> while

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:20.300 
most effectively this pattern while

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.839 
most effectively this pattern while
extended<00:07:20.900> can<00:07:21.289> only<00:07:21.500> maintain<00:07:21.770> itself<00:07:22.310> on<00:07:22.580> the

00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:22.849 
extended can only maintain itself on the

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:25.600 
extended can only maintain itself on the
wall<00:07:23.000> planes<00:07:23.330> I<00:07:23.660> want<00:07:24.650> to<00:07:24.740> summarize<00:07:25.009> now<00:07:25.220> what

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:25.610 
wall planes I want to summarize now what

the<00:07:25.699> focus<00:07:26.060> of<00:07:26.150> this<00:07:26.270> lesson<00:07:26.569> is<00:07:27.099> first<00:07:28.099> is

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:28.340 
the focus of this lesson is first is

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.430 
the focus of this lesson is first is
knowing<00:07:28.639> the<00:07:28.669> wall<00:07:28.940> in<00:07:29.150> wheel<00:07:29.389> planes<00:07:29.780> in<00:07:30.080> the

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:30.440 
knowing the wall in wheel planes in the

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.809 
knowing the wall in wheel planes in the
four<00:07:30.620> combinations<00:07:30.830> of<00:07:31.310> direction<00:07:31.789> and

00:07:31.809 --> 00:07:31.819 
four combinations of direction and

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:34.150 
four combinations of direction and
timing<00:07:32.270> and<00:07:32.419> the<00:07:33.110> second<00:07:33.500> is<00:07:33.590> to<00:07:33.620> learn<00:07:33.889> how<00:07:34.130> to

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.160 
timing and the second is to learn how to

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.249 
timing and the second is to learn how to
turn<00:07:34.460> 180<00:07:35.090> degrees<00:07:35.270> with<00:07:35.810> each<00:07:35.990> of<00:07:36.169> these

00:07:36.249 --> 00:07:36.259 
turn 180 degrees with each of these

00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:39.219 
turn 180 degrees with each of these
movements<00:07:37.000> focus<00:07:38.000> on<00:07:38.150> the<00:07:38.270> TAM<00:07:38.479> fire<00:07:38.780> model

00:07:39.219 --> 00:07:39.229 
movements focus on the TAM fire model

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:41.770 
movements focus on the TAM fire model
the<00:07:39.470> four<00:07:39.710> points<00:07:40.190> this<00:07:41.090> is<00:07:41.270> to<00:07:41.419> build<00:07:41.569> your

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:41.780 
the four points this is to build your

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:42.999 
the four points this is to build your
foundation<00:07:42.409> and<00:07:42.590> will<00:07:42.740> be<00:07:42.860> the<00:07:42.979> most

00:07:42.999 --> 00:07:43.009 
foundation and will be the most

00:07:43.009 --> 00:07:46.740 
foundation and will be the most
important<00:07:43.819> Basics<00:07:44.389> in<00:07:44.569> all<00:07:44.840> of<00:07:45.020> the<00:07:45.110> lessons

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:46.750 
important Basics in all of the lessons

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.839 
important Basics in all of the lessons
future<00:07:47.750> lessons<00:07:48.139> will<00:07:48.500> focus<00:07:48.740> more<00:07:49.159> in<00:07:49.400> detail

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:49.849 
future lessons will focus more in detail

00:07:49.849 --> 00:07:52.360 
future lessons will focus more in detail
on<00:07:50.060> individual<00:07:50.810> movements<00:07:51.289> and<00:07:51.470> how<00:07:51.919> you<00:07:51.979> link

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:52.370 
on individual movements and how you link

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.969 
on individual movements and how you link
them<00:07:52.520> up<00:07:52.759> with<00:07:53.030> different<00:07:53.240> patterns<00:07:53.979> practice

00:07:54.969 --> 00:07:54.979 
them up with different patterns practice

00:07:54.979 --> 00:08:03.940 
them up with different patterns practice
hard<00:07:55.250> and<00:07:55.520> keep<00:07:55.940> it<00:07:56.090> lit
