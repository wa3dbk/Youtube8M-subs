whole list of celebrities up your sleeve
oh<00:00:37.710> we<00:00:37.920> were<00:00:38.040> looking<00:00:38.280> as<00:00:38.370> if<00:00:38.489> he's<00:00:38.579> about<00:00:38.670> to

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
oh we were looking as if he's about to

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.209 
oh we were looking as if he's about to
head<00:00:39.210> off<00:00:39.239> yes<00:00:39.690> here<00:00:39.989> we<00:00:40.079> go<00:00:40.260> see<00:00:40.500> right<00:00:40.800> this

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
head off yes here we go see right this

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.430 
head off yes here we go see right this
is<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:41.940> we've<00:00:42.390> got<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.840> throttles

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
is it so we've got the throttles

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.720 
is it so we've got the throttles
obviously<00:00:43.829> why<00:00:44.010> don't<00:00:44.250> now<00:00:44.489> in<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
obviously why don't now in the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.630 
obviously why don't now in the
afterburners<00:00:45.450> will<00:00:45.899> be<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.140> light<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:47.370> speed

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
afterburners will be a light the speed

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.760 
afterburners will be a light the speed
is<00:00:48.000> going<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.510> increase<00:00:49.020> not<00:00:49.260> quite<00:00:49.469> as<00:00:49.590> fast

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
is going to increase not quite as fast

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.619 
is going to increase not quite as fast
as<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.160> Edinburgh<00:00:50.850> flight<00:00:51.090> because<00:00:51.480> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
as the Edinburgh flight because the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.860 
as the Edinburgh flight because the
aeroplane<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.350> heavier<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.360> it's<00:00:54.360> probably

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
aeroplane is heavier and it's probably

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.290 
aeroplane is heavier and it's probably
reached<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.710> point<00:00:55.920> now<00:00:56.340> we<00:00:56.610> used<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:57.030> low

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
reached the point now we used a low

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.689 
reached the point now we used a low
decision<00:00:58.020> speed<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.739> runway<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.219> he's

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
decision speed on this runway so he's

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.450 
decision speed on this runway so he's
probably<00:01:00.030> committed<00:01:01.020> himself<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.559> continuing

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
probably committed himself to continuing

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.420 
probably committed himself to continuing
the<00:01:02.579> takeoff<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.860> when<00:01:04.860> we<00:01:04.979> get<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> look<00:01:05.309> at

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
the takeoff and when we get a look at

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.700 
the takeoff and when we get a look at
the<00:01:05.549> back<00:01:05.700> end<00:01:05.970> we'll<00:01:06.360> be<00:01:06.390> able<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.750> see<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.290> he's

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
the back end we'll be able to see I he's

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.170 
the back end we'll be able to see I he's
got<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.250> nose<00:01:08.400> off<00:01:08.670> already

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
got the nose off already

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.570 
got the nose off already
so<00:01:09.450> that's<00:01:10.170> accelerating<00:01:10.890> slower<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.460> the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
so that's accelerating slower so the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.370 
so that's accelerating slower so the
nose<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.939> raised<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.450> bit<00:01:12.600> slower<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.290> he's

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
nose is raised a bit slower and he's

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.740 
nose is raised a bit slower and he's
taking<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.189> up<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.340> 12<00:01:14.850> degrees<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.509> it's<00:01:15.630> now

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
taking it up to 12 degrees and it's now

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.749 
taking it up to 12 degrees and it's now
just<00:01:15.780> holding<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.560> at<00:01:16.740> 12<00:01:16.979> degrees<00:01:17.130> there<00:01:17.580> and

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
just holding it at 12 degrees there and

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:18.510 
just holding it at 12 degrees there and
there<00:01:17.880> we<00:01:17.970> go

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
there we go

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.340 
there we go
the<00:01:18.640> left-hand<00:01:19.030> turn<00:01:19.270> and<00:01:19.780> you<00:01:19.960> can<00:01:20.020> see

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
the left-hand turn and you can see

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.139 
the left-hand turn and you can see
Jamaica<00:01:20.680> Bay<00:01:20.920> there<00:01:21.220> up<00:01:21.579> comes<00:01:21.970> the

what can you feel well you feel a lot

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.660 
what can you feel well you feel a lot
more<00:02:39.609> vibration<00:02:40.420> but<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.470> noise<00:02:41.920> is<00:02:42.430> is

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
more vibration but the the noise is is

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.650 
more vibration but the the noise is is
just<00:02:43.060> quite<00:02:43.480> incredible<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:44.859> it<00:02:45.160> it

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
just quite incredible and and it it

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.750 
just quite incredible and and it it
generates<00:02:46.660> more<00:02:47.049> excitement<00:02:47.709> now<00:02:48.430> you<00:02:48.489> could

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
generates more excitement now you could

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.330 
generates more excitement now you could
see<00:02:49.030> now<00:02:49.209> he's<00:02:49.590> continuing<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.680> turn<00:02:50.890> now<00:02:51.160> so

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
see now he's continuing the turn now so

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.009 
see now he's continuing the turn now so
he's<00:02:51.489> passed<00:02:51.760> over<00:02:52.030> canal<00:02:52.269> sea<00:02:52.480> island<00:02:52.840> and

he's passed over canal sea island and

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.960 
he's passed over canal sea island and
he's<00:02:53.109> heading<00:02:53.410> out<00:02:53.530> towards<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.069> coast<00:02:54.280> and

he's heading out towards the coast and

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.259 
he's heading out towards the coast and
as<00:02:55.150> soon<00:02:55.420> as<00:02:55.540> he's<00:02:55.690> over<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.019> coast<00:02:56.260> he<00:02:56.530> can

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
as soon as he's over the coast he can

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.309 
as soon as he's over the coast he can
flatten<00:02:58.269> the<00:02:58.420> climb<00:02:58.630> a<00:02:58.660> bit<00:02:58.959> and<00:02:59.170> let<00:02:59.290> the

flatten the climb a bit and let the

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.699 
flatten the climb a bit and let the

speed wait we had a computer which would

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.650 
speed wait we had a computer which would
work<00:03:06.160> out<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.549> limiting<00:03:06.940> speed<00:03:07.269> for<00:03:07.540> any

work out the limiting speed for any

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.509 
work out the limiting speed for any
condition<00:03:08.139> and<00:03:08.350> Concorde<00:03:08.799> was<00:03:09.010> at<00:03:09.220> its<00:03:09.400> most

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
condition and Concorde was at its most

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.640 
condition and Concorde was at its most
economic<00:03:10.269> if<00:03:10.480> we<00:03:10.630> were<00:03:10.780> flying<00:03:11.079> on<00:03:11.290> that

limiting speed the whole time

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.700 
limiting speed the whole time
so<00:03:14.150> we<00:03:14.420> were<00:03:14.570> really<00:03:14.750> pushing<00:03:15.080> the<00:03:15.350> boundaries

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
so we were really pushing the boundaries

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.220 
so we were really pushing the boundaries
all<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.370> time<00:03:16.580> and<00:03:16.910> he'll<00:03:17.120> be<00:03:17.300> locking<00:03:17.630> on<00:03:17.900> to
