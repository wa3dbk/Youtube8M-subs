00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:11.769
 I everyone good morning key is the bird or painted oil 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:16.299
 I have not said anything 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:19.390
 I was surprised that there were a lot of people who noticed it was a birthday 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:27.460
 Thank you for the reaction comment 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:31.599
 The last break before the British Eastern birthday is the color a little super travel 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:34.390
 Although I cut it around Saitama Gunma 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:39.010
 It is not your salt damage but 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:42.420
 I have also actually excavated experience in that flow 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:49.790
 Say to discover a fossil 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:54.079
 Because it's a mountain , I dig up here and hit it with two layers of high hammers 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.490
 In in it was busy hanging that in the 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:01.310
 Of that sea 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:07.190
 Fossil Toka also been doing the fallen leaves of the fossil and Kagaa Rutteyuu and 2 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:10.250
 In addition, I use a hammer because I use a hammer that I could feel beans 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.130
 Oh yeah so recently excavated 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:17.479
 But can we have you fun 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:24.829
 I will post it on a photo or blog later 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:29.060
 Well then, it will be Victoria Mile. What are your expectations? 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:32.920
 I would like to announce my forecast, thank you 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.920
 Then I did something like this 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:45.430
 But say I know two horses axis of the 3-year Puku to do well yes 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:49.120
 Men always but we have to chart 2 This 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:54.040
 This time we decided to sink the total 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:58.990
 After all it is g 1 and there is a strong horse 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:03.060
 In the last year, the 11th most popular Virsina won 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:06.920
 Spots is also the 12th most popular whale capture 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:14.209
 We have come to the two pieces of the foot or Hana difference 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:15.270
 It is a race that is quite likely to be a disorder in one deployment , so here without squeezing halfway 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.970
 Is 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.360
 I think I want to go there 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:27.990
 With the most popular no Nouvole Corto with the expectation 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:34.000
 No. 5 the Well Straight Girl of popular expectations than we have in the shaft after the 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:39.760
 So we thought it good if me popular thin horses come if possible the other one animal 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.560
 First of all in the lower tray and the girl, but this race has many repeaters 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.590
 It has become days 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:51.280
 Capture that says 2 years ago 3 years ago 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:54.520
 It continues to decline, and the last year and Vilsina have won consecutive victory 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:59.300
 Both did not have the result of the near run 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:03.250
 Also conceived on behalf of this stage while dropping the heroism 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:07.360
 Among the members who will run this time 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.220
 Is there a straight song that entered the betting materials last year ? 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:15.050
 Become a Meisho Mambo 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:22.750
 Even though the compatibility with the usual is good I was quite lost 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:28.150
 After getting 2nd in Victoria Mile last year, everything is 10th in 2 digits 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:29.740
 I will choose, it is the same in a place called Na or slightly anxiety to the shaft if there 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.240
 Was 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:38.500
 Paste trait girl is said to have anxiety about distance 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:44.890
 Tashi had last year Amashi the last leg 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:48.340
 After that, it was the impression that Iwata jockey also stopped riding safely and was doing safe driving in the house 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:55.260
 It has entered the 3 wearing Among such 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:59.349
 I thought that I could fight even with miles, but it was 13 in the previous Takamatsu Palace Memorial. 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:02.680
 1st popular and marked 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:08.130
 After a break in the large frame 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.580
 Door a monopoly on the top horses went before pretty bad Baba 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.300
 Bad condition 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:16.930
 I have overlapped 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:19.840
 This time the 5th popular light will not make the mark even tight 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:25.600
 Tozaki jockey who becomes the first combination this time 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:27.950
 I think that if it is not the most popular you will start offensive 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.640
 It's not it Nouvole Corto 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:37.820
 It is likely to be overwhelmingly popular this time 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:39.120
 Although there may be three pieces in Once But if I wonder if incoming first within that 3 pieces are 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:45.630
 Masu Tei 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:52.199
 So far, if you have 10 battles and you don't get rid of only 4 of your debut match 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:55.289
 After becoming a combination with Iwata jockey, all seven rounds will use a heavy prize and all betting ticket areas 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:58.860
 Once and for all but once 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:03.169
 There is no sense of stability at this high level 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:07.099
 Bouncing Nakayama Gama Stakes As Chasse is Winning 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:10.159
 I think that the level of the 4-year-old mare is also high 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:19.849
 No matter what the log type or the labonaita 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:26.300
 We have complete victory because at the Zhongshan Memorial also recently and envisions that neither Stefano number and Nakatani 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:30.039
 I think that I want to trust here honestly and I want to go in threes for this two-headed axis 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.039
 Do you think 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:42.380
 Last week was also pretty good 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:44.560
 I think a horse of a kind is coming 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.289
 The place to say 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:54.920
 I arrived in 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:56.050
 I think it will be okay soon, but everyone is also doing well 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.260
 Give 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:04.389
 Please come in 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:11.639
 Thank you because there is another one of a building this week in 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:11.639
 Then there is still some unworked, thank you very much for your hard work and thank you Hashigami
