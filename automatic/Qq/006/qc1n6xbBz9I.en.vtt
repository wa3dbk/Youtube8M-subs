first<00:00:24.130> we're<00:00:24.310> gonna<00:00:24.370> check<00:00:24.580> in<00:00:24.760> see<00:00:25.000> that<00:00:25.180> we

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
first we're gonna check in see that we

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.350 
first we're gonna check in see that we
have<00:00:25.420> the<00:00:25.870> latest<00:00:26.440> version<00:00:26.830> of<00:00:26.980> Ubuntu<00:00:27.490> we

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
then once we've gone through that you

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.960 
then once we've gone through that you
see<00:03:47.220> it's<00:03:47.340> finished<00:03:47.459> here

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
see it's finished here

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.460 
see it's finished here
I<00:03:48.000> just<00:03:48.449> let<00:03:48.540> it<00:03:48.569> go<00:03:48.660> through<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:48.930> cycle<00:03:49.199> one<00:03:49.440> a

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
I just let it go through the cycle one a

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.839 
I just let it go through the cycle one a
bit<00:03:49.650> fast<00:03:49.859> for<00:03:49.949> me<00:03:50.160> because<00:03:50.400> I've<00:03:50.519> unlocked

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
bit fast for me because I've unlocked

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.220 
bit fast for me because I've unlocked
unlocked<00:03:51.239> the<00:03:51.359> bootloader<00:03:51.629> like<00:03:51.870> eight<00:03:52.049> times

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
unlocked the bootloader like eight times

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.259 
unlocked the bootloader like eight times
now<00:03:52.530> it<00:03:53.340> will<00:03:53.430> take<00:03:53.609> a<00:03:53.639> little<00:03:53.760> bit<00:03:53.910> longer<00:03:54.090> if

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
now it will take a little bit longer if

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:55.759 
now it will take a little bit longer if
you<00:03:54.359> have<00:03:54.480> stuff<00:03:54.720> actually<00:03:55.199> installed<00:03:55.590> on

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
you have stuff actually installed on

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.189 
you have stuff actually installed on

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
Nexus 7 should be the first thing that

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.259 
Nexus 7 should be the first thing that
pops<00:04:02.459> up<00:04:02.609> I<00:04:02.819> already<00:04:03.449> had<00:04:03.870> a<00:04:04.169> download<00:04:04.829> image

run through the processes of installing
on<00:04:32.729> your<00:04:32.880> device<00:04:33.060> this<00:04:33.300> actually<00:04:33.659> took<00:04:33.810> about

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
on your device this actually took about

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.110 
on your device this actually took about
10<00:04:34.349> to<00:04:34.470> 15<00:04:34.740> minutes<00:04:34.889> but<00:04:35.190> I<00:04:35.340> also<00:04:35.580> sped<00:04:35.880> this<00:04:36.060> up

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
10 to 15 minutes but I also sped this up

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.870 
10 to 15 minutes but I also sped this up
as<00:04:36.389> well<00:04:36.919> just<00:04:37.919> so<00:04:38.130> we<00:04:38.340> could<00:04:38.460> go<00:04:38.580> along<00:04:38.789> the

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
as well just so we could go along the

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.939 
as well just so we could go along the
tutorial<00:04:39.330> a<00:04:39.360> little<00:04:39.599> bit<00:04:39.720> quicker<00:04:39.870> and<00:04:40.289> once

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
tutorial a little bit quicker and once

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.460 
tutorial a little bit quicker and once
it<00:04:41.130> has<00:04:41.250> been<00:04:41.610> installed<00:04:41.669> in<00:04:42.150> your<00:04:42.180> device<00:04:42.380> we

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
it has been installed in your device we

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.780 
it has been installed in your device we
go<00:04:43.590> ahead<00:04:43.770> and<00:04:43.920> head<00:04:44.070> back<00:04:44.250> to<00:04:44.460> the<00:04:44.550> device

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
go ahead and head back to the device

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.310 
go ahead and head back to the device
because<00:04:45.480> at<00:04:45.600> this<00:04:45.690> point<00:04:45.900> we<00:04:45.990> don't<00:04:46.080> need<00:04:46.230> the

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
because at this point we don't need the

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.490 
because at this point we don't need the
computer<00:04:46.590> anymore<00:04:46.950> and<00:04:47.790> here<00:04:48.600> it<00:04:48.660> is<00:04:48.780> and<00:04:49.110> we

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
computer anymore and here it is and we
