00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
you've got your Xbox button you've got

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.270 
you've got your Xbox button you've got
your<00:00:47.760> hat<00:00:48.030> tick<00:00:48.300> button<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.200> off<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.800> obviously

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
your hat tick button so off is obviously

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.810 
your hat tick button so off is obviously
lights<00:00:50.520> off<00:00:50.820> on<00:00:51.420> his<00:00:51.930> lights<00:00:52.410> on<00:00:52.670> haptic<00:00:53.670> I

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
lights off on his lights on haptic I

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.819 
lights off on his lights on haptic I
believe<00:00:54.149> these<00:00:54.449> Xbox<00:00:55.020> one<00:00:55.230> doesn't<00:00:55.500> support

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
believe these Xbox one doesn't support

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.610 
believe these Xbox one doesn't support
or<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.520> doesn't<00:00:57.090> support<00:00:57.469> vibrations<00:00:58.469> and

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
or this doesn't support vibrations and

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.619 
or this doesn't support vibrations and
that's<00:00:58.770> why<00:00:58.980> when<00:00:59.760> you<00:00:59.789> get<00:01:00.090> hit<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.420> stuff

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
that's why when you get hit and stuff

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.360 
that's why when you get hit and stuff
and<00:01:00.840> pad<00:01:01.050> normally<00:01:01.469> vibrate<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.129> would

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
and pad normally vibrate this would

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.880 
and pad normally vibrate this would
obviously<00:01:02.609> vibrate<00:01:03.600> away<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:03.870> when<00:01:04.229> an<00:01:04.500> update

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
obviously vibrate away so when an update

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.170 
obviously vibrate away so when an update
does<00:01:05.100> come<00:01:05.280> out<00:01:05.369> for<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.640> believe<00:01:05.970> that

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
does come out for that I believe that

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.359 
does come out for that I believe that
will<00:01:06.659> then<00:01:06.750> support<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.439> button<00:01:07.799> otherwise

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
will then support that button otherwise

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.280 
will then support that button otherwise
its<00:01:08.729> functionality<00:01:09.420> at<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.750> moment<00:01:10.110> is

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
its functionality at the moment is

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.000 
its functionality at the moment is
useless<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:11.430> you've<00:01:11.909> got<00:01:11.939> your<00:01:12.150> lock<00:01:12.590> off<00:01:13.590> and

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
guess other than I could say what I

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.180 
guess other than I could say what I
really<00:03:33.200> liked<00:03:33.380> about<00:03:33.470> it<00:03:33.620> what<00:03:33.829> I<00:03:33.859> don't<00:03:34.130> like

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
really liked about it what I don't like

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.250 
really liked about it what I don't like

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
about it so what I do like about it is

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.629 
about it so what I do like about it is
everything<00:03:36.500> I've<00:03:36.739> just<00:03:36.769> said<00:03:37.010> it's<00:03:37.310> sturdy

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
everything I've just said it's sturdy

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.819 
everything I've just said it's sturdy
it's<00:03:38.329> got<00:03:38.480> a<00:03:38.510> lot<00:03:38.660> of<00:03:38.720> weight<00:03:38.959> behind<00:03:39.170> it<00:03:39.560> I

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
it's got a lot of weight behind it I

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.620 
it's got a lot of weight behind it I
will<00:03:40.280> say<00:03:40.459> it's<00:03:40.819> comfortable<00:03:41.209> it's<00:03:41.389> got<00:03:41.510> that

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
will say it's comfortable it's got that

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.020 
will say it's comfortable it's got that
real<00:03:41.870> good<00:03:42.139> Arkady<00:03:42.680> feel<00:03:43.069> it's<00:03:43.519> got<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:43.790> hand

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
real good Arkady feel it's got the hand

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.780 
real good Arkady feel it's got the hand
swirl<00:03:44.569> handler<00:03:45.200> buttons<00:03:45.920> I<00:03:46.160> believe<00:03:46.639> they're

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
swirl handler buttons I believe they're

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.400 
swirl handler buttons I believe they're
Japanese<00:03:47.239> rather<00:03:47.569> than<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:47.810> American<00:03:48.170> style

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
Japanese rather than the American style

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.379 
Japanese rather than the American style
so<00:03:48.769> sorry<00:03:49.099> Americans<00:03:49.519> we<00:03:49.730> get<00:03:49.849> upset<00:03:50.120> but<00:03:50.359> I

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
so sorry Americans we get upset but I

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:51.849 
so sorry Americans we get upset but I
don't<00:03:50.569> have<00:03:50.660> an<00:03:50.720> American<00:03:51.139> positional

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
don't have an American positional

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:54.250 
don't have an American positional
buttons<00:03:52.190> but<00:03:52.400> as<00:03:52.489> a<00:03:52.519> SAS<00:03:52.760> fully<00:03:53.510> customizable

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
buttons but as a SAS fully customizable

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.900 
buttons but as a SAS fully customizable
so<00:03:54.769> that's<00:03:55.069> no<00:03:55.220> problem<00:03:55.459> if<00:03:55.639> you<00:03:55.700> want<00:03:55.849> to

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
so that's no problem if you want to

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.539 
so that's no problem if you want to
change<00:03:56.120> it<00:03:56.269> change<00:03:56.510> it<00:03:56.660> and<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:58.190> only<00:03:58.310> thing<00:03:58.370> i

change it change it and the only thing i

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.370 
change it change it and the only thing i
don't<00:03:58.639> like<00:03:58.760> about<00:03:58.880> this<00:03:59.299> fighting<00:03:59.989> is<00:04:00.109> that

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
don't like about this fighting is that

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.839 
don't like about this fighting is that
there's<00:04:00.530> no<00:04:00.590> my<00:04:00.829> sport<00:04:01.190> and<00:04:01.370> for<00:04:01.609> the<00:04:01.730> price

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
there's no my sport and for the price

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:03.309 
there's no my sport and for the price
that<00:04:01.970> I<00:04:02.269> paid<00:04:02.299> for<00:04:02.540> it<00:04:02.780> seems<00:04:03.139> a<00:04:03.230> bit

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
that I paid for it seems a bit

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.530 
that I paid for it seems a bit
ridiculous<00:04:03.470> that<00:04:04.010> is<00:04:04.160> not<00:04:04.340> a<00:04:04.519> might<00:04:05.090> fall<00:04:05.329> for

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
ridiculous that is not a might fall for

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.729 
ridiculous that is not a might fall for
it<00:04:05.599> but<00:04:05.780> there<00:04:05.870> isn't<00:04:06.139> so<00:04:06.319> the<00:04:06.440> only<00:04:06.560> way<00:04:06.680> you
