00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:11.940
 Hi everyone, I'm here for a second 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.980
 video on layer 13470 7 pq because a 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.630
 about two weeks away from 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.510
 publication of the review received 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.460
 several questions regarding back light e 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.439
 on the presence of yellow pupils on one 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.250
 white screen this because more than that 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.640
 other 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.199
 some users who have the laws 34 m 95 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.630
 that to the same panel have 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.850
 found this anomaly now I will 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.700
 I show that by using this 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.670
 a white screen software is 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.239
 almost perfect for this at least 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.649
 exemplary and I do present that I have 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.469
 installed the color profile that is 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.390
 present on the site xtremehardware and the 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.280
 backlight is set 10 for 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.590
 have more or less than 120 candles on the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.980
 square meter for a black screen 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.930
 instead backlight is particularly good 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.079
 of which particularly good because the 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.270
 formed by 30 4 inches 21 noni is 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.100
 obviously one of the most disadvantaged by 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.979
 this point of view uniformity is 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.049
 quite good and maybe you can see right 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.700
 a little bleeding in the corner in 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.710
 lower right 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.570
 now the format so particularly wide 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.150
 may incur the problem of ps 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.799
 gruber or that glow that can be 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.200
 perceived towards the angles to the increase 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.880
 of the angle which is simpler 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.869
 find out when you are closer and 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.750
 obviously from the display now 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:36.000
 roughly the room 80 centimeters from the 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.670
 from the display 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.759
 so we say a condition more or less 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:45.619
 optimal use is obviously more yes 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.700
 and distant and less you will incur the 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.290
 ets problem of clubs I hope 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.540
 at least this video was helpful 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.950
 for some it is because if they would remain is 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.950
 all a greeting from Andrea
