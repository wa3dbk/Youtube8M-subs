this<00:03:55.610> is<00:03:55.850> so<00:03:56.810> many<00:03:56.930> companies<00:03:57.350> focus<00:03:57.680> on<00:03:57.800> the

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
this is so many companies focus on the

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.650 
this is so many companies focus on the
explosions<00:03:58.430> explosions<00:03:59.000> explosions<00:03:59.090> and<00:03:59.600> we

but it's also about sometimes that

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.630 
but it's also about sometimes that
implosion<00:04:03.840> moment<00:04:04.500> that<00:04:04.650> time<00:04:04.680> where<00:04:05.340> you

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
we have an early example in the

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.890 
we have an early example in the
scavenger<00:04:11.490> den<00:04:11.730> very<00:04:12.390> early<00:04:12.690> in<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.870> game

your<00:04:52.200> board<00:04:52.380> right<00:04:52.770> over<00:04:53.010> here<00:04:53.190> I'm<00:04:53.400> a<00:04:53.550> stats

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
your board right over here I'm a stats

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.430 
your board right over here I'm a stats
guy<00:04:53.940> right<00:04:54.360> okay<00:04:54.690> it's<00:04:54.840> got<00:04:55.020> to<00:04:55.140> be<00:04:55.200> like<00:04:55.320> the

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
guy right okay it's got to be like the

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.120 
guy right okay it's got to be like the
McNamara<00:04:55.950> version<00:04:56.310> of<00:04:56.400> reality<00:04:57.860> and<00:04:58.860> getting

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
McNamara version of reality and getting

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.920 
McNamara version of reality and getting
things<00:04:59.280> done<00:04:59.520> like<00:04:59.790> it's<00:04:59.970> very<00:05:00.150> NORAD<00:05:00.660> like

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
things done like it's very NORAD like

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.300 
things done like it's very NORAD like
with<00:05:01.140> update<00:05:01.500> on<00:05:01.620> where<00:05:01.740> we<00:05:01.860> are<00:05:01.890> with<00:05:02.010> blood

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
with update on where we are with blood

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.710 
with update on where we are with blood
counts<00:05:02.640> so<00:05:02.730> we<00:05:02.820> have<00:05:02.970> the<00:05:03.150> number<00:05:03.390> of<00:05:03.510> days

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
counts so we have the number of days

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.510 
counts so we have the number of days
that<00:05:03.750> we<00:05:03.990> want<00:05:04.140> to<00:05:04.200> count<00:05:04.410> down<00:05:04.590> for<00:05:04.980> the

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
that we want to count down for the

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.740 
that we want to count down for the
priorities<00:05:05.940> of<00:05:06.030> what<00:05:06.060> people<00:05:06.390> are<00:05:06.480> given

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.790 
her come on Kerry yeah ultimately we
have<00:05:15.510> to<00:05:15.630> figure<00:05:15.870> out<00:05:15.990> how<00:05:16.200> do<00:05:16.260> we<00:05:16.350> hit<00:05:16.650> the

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
have to figure out how do we hit the

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.620 
have to figure out how do we hit the
quality<00:05:17.160> on<00:05:17.190> a<00:05:17.310> predictable<00:05:17.940> timeline<00:05:18.390> so

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
quality on a predictable timeline so

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:19.970 
quality on a predictable timeline so
right<00:05:18.840> now<00:05:19.020> we're<00:05:19.200> trending<00:05:19.410> towards<00:05:19.800> being

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
right now we're trending towards being

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.720 
right now we're trending towards being
able<00:05:20.100> to<00:05:20.280> hit<00:05:20.460> that<00:05:20.670> in<00:05:20.850> 12<00:05:21.510> days<00:05:22.460> but<00:05:23.460> you<00:05:23.580> need

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
able to hit that in 12 days but you need

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.120 
able to hit that in 12 days but you need
to<00:05:23.790> deliver<00:05:24.000> in<00:05:24.210> four<00:05:24.360> and<00:05:24.420> a<00:05:24.480> half<00:05:24.540> correct<00:05:25.130> so

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
to deliver in four and a half correct so

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.320 
to deliver in four and a half correct so
what<00:05:26.250> does<00:05:26.340> that<00:05:26.460> mean<00:05:26.610> I<00:05:26.790> need<00:05:26.970> to<00:05:27.060> go<00:05:27.150> right

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
what does that mean I need to go right

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.380 
what does that mean I need to go right
now<00:05:28.280> where<00:05:29.280> is<00:05:29.400> your<00:05:29.430> head<00:05:29.760> out<00:05:29.940> right<00:05:29.970> now

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
now where is your head out right now
