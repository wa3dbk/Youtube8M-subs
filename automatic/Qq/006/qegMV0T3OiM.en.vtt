00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.340 
little bill that i'm working on recently
so<00:00:19.580> made<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:20.699> world<00:00:20.939> with<00:00:21.210> world<00:00:21.900> painter

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
so made this world with world painter

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.320 
so made this world with world painter
and<00:00:23.130> if<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.369> don't<00:00:23.519> know<00:00:23.609> what<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:23.910> it's

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
and if you don't know what that is it's

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.480 
and if you don't know what that is it's
pretty<00:00:25.199> much<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.350> program<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:27.019> lets<00:00:28.019> you

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
pretty much a program that lets you

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.030 
pretty much a program that lets you
design<00:00:29.490> your<00:00:29.730> world<00:00:30.439> as<00:00:31.439> if<00:00:31.590> you're<00:00:31.740> looking

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
design your world as if you're looking

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.889 
design your world as if you're looking
down<00:00:32.430> on<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.640> from<00:00:32.880> above<00:00:33.030> so<00:00:33.420> it's<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.660> 2g

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
down on it from above so it's the 2g

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.709 
down on it from above so it's the 2g
image<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:35.149> basically<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.360> have<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.570> whole

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
image and basically you have a whole

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.450 
image and basically you have a whole
bunch<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:37.079> different<00:00:37.350> brushes<00:00:37.559> which<00:00:38.040> raised

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
bunch of different brushes which raised

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.000 
bunch of different brushes which raised
and<00:00:38.730> lowered<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.059> ground<00:00:39.379> you<00:00:40.379> can<00:00:40.410> fill<00:00:40.890> it

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
and lowered the ground you can fill it

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.600 
and lowered the ground you can fill it
with<00:00:41.129> water<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:42.860> when<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.920> open<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.280> up<00:00:44.399> in

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
with water and when you open it up in

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.459 
with water and when you open it up in
Minecraft<00:00:45.059> it'll<00:00:45.360> all<00:00:45.539> be<00:00:45.690> three-dimensional

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
Minecraft it'll all be three-dimensional

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.350 
Minecraft it'll all be three-dimensional
so<00:00:47.160> that's<00:00:48.120> what<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.300> did<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:49.620> made<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:50.360> bridge

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
so that's what I did and I made a bridge

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.970 
so that's what I did and I made a bridge
going<00:00:51.690> over<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.930> canyon<00:00:52.410> which<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.710> going<00:00:52.890> to

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
going over a canyon which is going to

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.930 
going over a canyon which is going to
lead<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:55.579> do<00:00:56.579> some<00:00:56.879> sort<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.180> walled<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.930> city

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
lead to do some sort of walled in city

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.650 
lead to do some sort of walled in city
castle<00:00:59.940> or<00:01:00.590> village<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.739> town<00:01:01.980> or<00:01:02.190> something

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
castle or village of town or something

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.130 
castle or village of town or something
haven't<00:01:03.660> quite<00:01:03.780> decided<00:01:03.989> yet<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:05.990> this<00:01:06.990> is

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
haven't quite decided yet so this is

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.830 
haven't quite decided yet so this is
actually<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.590> bridge<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.369> goes<00:01:08.790> over<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
actually a bridge that goes over the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.399 
actually a bridge that goes over the
canyon<00:01:10.909> so<00:01:13.130> if<00:01:14.330> and<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.509> guys<00:01:15.659> have<00:01:15.960> an<00:01:16.080> idea

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
canyon so if and you guys have an idea

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.760 
canyon so if and you guys have an idea
about<00:01:16.650> what<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.820> should<00:01:17.939> try<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.240> build<00:01:18.600> if<00:01:19.470> I

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
about what I should try to build if I

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.580 
about what I should try to build if I
should<00:01:20.220> go<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.520> town<00:01:22.130> anything<00:01:23.130> like<00:01:23.280> that

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
should go to town anything like that

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.749 
should go to town anything like that
even<00:01:25.590> if<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.830> have<00:01:25.979> any<00:01:26.159> adventure<00:01:26.549> maps

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
even if you have any adventure maps

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.319 
even if you have any adventure maps

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
builds that I've decided to start

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.810 
builds that I've decided to start
showing<00:02:02.840> off<00:02:02.990> I've<00:02:03.950> been<00:02:04.130> playing<00:02:04.310> Minecraft

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
showing off I've been playing Minecraft

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.559 
showing off I've been playing Minecraft
for<00:02:05.000> a<00:02:05.030> long<00:02:05.240> time<00:02:05.479> and<00:02:06.189> i<00:02:07.189> haven't<00:02:08.119> uploaded

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
for a long time and i haven't uploaded

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.710 
for a long time and i haven't uploaded
videos<00:02:09.349> of<00:02:09.530> anything<00:02:09.769> i<00:02:09.860> built<00:02:10.069> so<00:02:10.369> i<00:02:10.720> thought

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
videos of anything i built so i thought

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.860 
videos of anything i built so i thought
i<00:02:12.050> might<00:02:12.349> as<00:02:12.470> well<00:02:12.620> start<00:02:12.860> and<00:02:13.150> my<00:02:14.150> blocks<00:02:14.660> to

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
i might as well start and my blocks to

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.030 
i might as well start and my blocks to
videos<00:02:15.170> got<00:02:16.069> a<00:02:16.099> decent<00:02:16.340> amount<00:02:16.519> of<00:02:16.790> views<00:02:16.970> and

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
videos got a decent amount of views and

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.390 
videos got a decent amount of views and
they've<00:02:19.040> been<00:02:19.340> doing<00:02:20.530> sort<00:02:21.530> of<00:02:21.650> well<00:02:21.860> i<00:02:22.099> guess

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
they've been doing sort of well i guess

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.100 
they've been doing sort of well i guess
i<00:02:22.610> don't<00:02:22.700> know<00:02:23.019> so<00:02:25.269> I'd<00:02:26.269> really<00:02:26.480> love<00:02:26.690> to<00:02:26.750> start

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
i don't know so I'd really love to start

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.620
