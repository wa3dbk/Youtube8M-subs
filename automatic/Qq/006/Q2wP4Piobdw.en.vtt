campuses brand-new ready to do is talk
about<00:00:04.319> taking<00:00:04.890> basic<00:00:05.490> rhythm<00:00:05.819> patterns<00:00:06.210> like

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
about taking basic rhythm patterns like

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.970 
about taking basic rhythm patterns like
your<00:00:06.509> sugar<00:00:06.720> push<00:00:06.930> under<00:00:07.230> our<00:00:07.350> basic<00:00:07.830> whip

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
your sugar push under our basic whip

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.009 
your sugar push under our basic whip
without<00:00:08.610> changing<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.540> rhythm<00:00:09.719> of<00:00:09.929> the

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
without changing the rhythm of the

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.230 
without changing the rhythm of the
pattern<00:00:10.380> without<00:00:10.710> changing<00:00:11.639> the

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
pattern without changing the

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.600 
pattern without changing the
transferring<00:00:12.960> of<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.230> weight<00:00:13.460> we're<00:00:14.460> going

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
transferring of the weight we're going

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.890 
transferring of the weight we're going
to<00:00:14.670> do<00:00:14.790> different<00:00:15.179> things<00:00:15.210> with<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.540> feet<00:00:15.750> so

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
to do different things with the feet so

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.120 
to do different things with the feet so
we're<00:00:16.020> going<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.170> just<00:00:16.350> place<00:00:16.619> our<00:00:16.830> feet<00:00:16.980> in

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
we're going to just place our feet in

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.859 
we're going to just place our feet in
two<00:00:17.250> different<00:00:17.430> places<00:00:17.730> on<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.090> floor<00:00:18.330> so<00:00:18.840> we

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
two different places on the floor so we

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.330 
two different places on the floor so we
have<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.109> different<00:00:19.529> effect<00:00:19.740> on<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.980> pattern

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
have a different effect on the pattern

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.260 
have a different effect on the pattern
so<00:00:20.460> we're<00:00:20.550> going<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.730> start<00:00:20.939> off<00:00:21.060> with<00:00:21.090> a

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
so we're going to start off with a

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.460 
so we're going to start off with a
couple<00:00:21.600> things<00:00:21.720> like<00:00:21.930> we'll<00:00:22.140> take<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.289> sugar

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
couple things like we'll take a sugar

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.710 
couple things like we'll take a sugar
purse<00:00:22.740> for<00:00:22.830> an<00:00:22.920> example<00:00:23.189> we<00:00:23.910> need<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.269> both<00:00:24.480> do

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
purse for an example we need to both do

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.120 
purse for an example we need to both do
the<00:00:24.840> same<00:00:25.080> thing<00:00:25.320> or<00:00:25.500> we<00:00:25.560> can<00:00:25.680> do<00:00:25.769> totally

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
the same thing or we can do totally

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.529 
the same thing or we can do totally
different<00:00:26.490> things<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.789> really<00:00:26.910> doesn't<00:00:27.420> make

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
different things it really doesn't make

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.700 
different things it really doesn't make
that<00:00:27.689> much<00:00:27.750> difference<00:00:27.900> as<00:00:28.349> long<00:00:28.470> as<00:00:28.590> it's

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
that much difference as long as it's

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.200 
that much difference as long as it's
complimentary<00:00:29.369> we're<00:00:29.820> going<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.029> maintain

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
complimentary we're going to maintain

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.389 
complimentary we're going to maintain
two<00:00:30.750> walking<00:00:31.140> steps<00:00:31.410> add<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.859> two<00:00:32.009> triple

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
two walking steps add the two triple

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.639 
two walking steps add the two triple
step<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:32.790> we're<00:00:32.910> not<00:00:32.969> doing<00:00:33.329> taps<00:00:33.600> or<00:00:33.930> fans<00:00:34.260> or

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
step so we're not doing taps or fans or

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.380 
step so we're not doing taps or fans or
stalls<00:00:34.980> everything<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.940> same<00:00:35.969> but<00:00:36.180> I'm

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
stalls everything is the same but I'm

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.760 
stalls everything is the same but I'm
going<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.600> place<00:00:36.840> my<00:00:36.870> first<00:00:37.290> triple<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:37.739> a

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
going to place my first triple in a

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.200 
going to place my first triple in a
different<00:00:38.010> position<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:38.760> instead<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.090> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
different position so instead of the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.880 
different position so instead of the
basic<00:00:39.629> walk<00:00:39.960> walk<00:00:40.800> three<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.030> four<00:00:42.780> five<00:00:43.590> and

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
basic walk walk three and four five and

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.040 
six I'm going to take my one two bag on
my<00:00:47.610> three<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.149> actually<00:00:48.300> going<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.629> cross<00:00:48.840> in

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
my three is actually going to cross in

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.029 
my three is actually going to cross in
front<00:00:49.399> three<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.820> four<00:00:51.809> mi5<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.829> going<00:00:52.980> to

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
front three and four mi5 is going to

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.569 
front three and four mi5 is going to
cross<00:00:53.190> behind<00:00:53.449> five<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.840> six<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.430> just

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
cross behind five and six so this just

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.369 
cross behind five and six so this just
puts<00:00:56.850> me<00:00:56.969> on<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.090> slight<00:00:57.420> angle<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.930> still<00:00:58.260> have

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
puts me on a slight angle I still have

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.349 
puts me on a slight angle I still have
the<00:00:58.469> same<00:00:58.620> compression<00:00:58.949> I'm<00:00:59.609> making<00:01:00.180> sure

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
the same compression I'm making sure

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.910 
the same compression I'm making sure
they<00:01:00.480> want<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.780> do<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.170> cross<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.620> front<00:01:01.829> that

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
they want to do that cross in front that

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.619 
they want to do that cross in front that
I'm<00:01:02.039> not<00:01:02.160> stepping<00:01:02.579> towards<00:01:03.180> her<00:01:03.270> because

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
I'm not stepping towards her because

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.270 
I'm not stepping towards her because
that<00:01:03.660> changes<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.439> compression<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.100> makes

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
that changes that compression it makes

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.399 
that changes that compression it makes
it<00:01:05.430> too<00:01:05.610> strong<00:01:05.939> stops<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.780> from<00:01:06.900> getting<00:01:07.020> over

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
it too strong stops it from getting over

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.649 
it too strong stops it from getting over
two<00:01:07.500> feet<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:07.860> I'm<00:01:07.979> dancing<00:01:08.369> one<00:01:08.700> two<00:01:09.450> and

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
two feet so I'm dancing one two and

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.359 
two feet so I'm dancing one two and
putting<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.049> tight<00:01:10.290> cross<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.860> there<00:01:11.130> and

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
putting the tight cross in there and

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.920 
putting the tight cross in there and
then<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.580> tight<00:01:11.880> hook<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:12.270> there<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.540> maintain

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
then a tight hook in there to maintain

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.770 
then a tight hook in there to maintain
my<00:01:13.080> anchor<00:01:13.409> position<00:01:13.729> okay<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.060> again<00:01:15.600> for

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
my anchor position okay and again for

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.210 
my anchor position okay and again for
the<00:01:15.840> ladies<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.170> don't<00:01:16.470> have<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.770> do<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.009> same

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
the ladies you don't have to do the same

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.200 
the ladies you don't have to do the same
thing<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.520> could<00:01:17.670> do<00:01:17.729> something<00:01:18.030> slightly

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
thing you could do something slightly

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.910 
thing you could do something slightly
different<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:19.049> for<00:01:19.229> let's<00:01:19.439> say<00:01:19.560> for<00:01:19.740> brining

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
different so for let's say for brining

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.130 
different so for let's say for brining
sake<00:01:20.220> here<00:01:20.430> she<00:01:20.549> comes<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:21.000> she<00:01:21.509> does<00:01:21.689> her<00:01:21.840> walk

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
sake here she comes in she does her walk

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.649 
sake here she comes in she does her walk
to<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.310> changes<00:01:23.670> her<00:01:23.820> over<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.420> front

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
to and it changes her over to a front

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.999 
to and it changes her over to a front
cross<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.350> do<00:01:25.409> want<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.650> mention<00:01:25.920> this

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.649 
ladies we have so many different angles
and<00:01:28.770> shapes<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.250> we<00:01:29.460> can<00:01:29.640> work<00:01:29.880> with<00:01:29.909> they

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
and shapes that we can work with they

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.480 
and shapes that we can work with they
don't<00:01:30.869> have<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.140> stay<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.680> same<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.280> we<00:01:32.460> can

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
don't have to stay the same and we can

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.039 
don't have to stay the same and we can
actually<00:01:33.000> change<00:01:33.299> up<00:01:33.450> in<00:01:33.540> fact<00:01:33.750> let<00:01:33.900> me<00:01:33.930> go

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
actually change up in fact let me go

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.420 
actually change up in fact let me go
ahead<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.320> turn<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.619> way<00:01:34.829> slightly<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.369> you

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
ahead and turn this way slightly so you

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.219 
ahead and turn this way slightly so you
can<00:01:35.610> see<00:01:35.729> I'm<00:01:35.850> talking<00:01:36.240> about<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.990> when<00:01:37.140> he

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
can see I'm talking about so when he

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.080 
can see I'm talking about so when he
brings<00:01:37.439> me<00:01:37.619> forward<00:01:37.920> into<00:01:38.130> my<00:01:38.220> sugar<00:01:38.520> push<00:01:38.729> one

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
brings me forward into my sugar push one

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.710 
brings me forward into my sugar push one
two<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.900> have<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.740> option<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.220> going<00:01:41.430> three<00:01:42.390> and

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
two I have the option of going three and

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.370 
two I have the option of going three and
four<00:01:43.409> five<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.340> six<00:01:44.759> my<00:01:45.570> other<00:01:45.750> option<00:01:46.290> is

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
four five and six my other option is

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.080 
four five and six my other option is
changing<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.829> angle<00:01:46.860> one<00:01:47.250> two<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:47.939> can

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
changing the angle one two and I can

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.679 
changing the angle one two and I can
take<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.329> out<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.600> way<00:01:49.009> three<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.340> four<00:01:50.939> five

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
take it out this way three and four five

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:52.760 
take it out this way three and four five
and<00:01:52.079> six

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
and six

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.889 
and six
so<00:01:53.100> that's<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.430> my<00:01:53.579> front<00:01:53.850> half<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.750> sugar

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
so that's on my front half of the sugar

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.109 
so that's on my front half of the sugar
push<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.439> can<00:01:55.860> also<00:01:56.009> do<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.399> on<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.520> back<00:01:56.790> half

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
push I can also do it on the back half

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.820 
push I can also do it on the back half
as<00:01:57.299> well<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.719> give<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.930> another<00:01:58.140> variation

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
as well to give you another variation

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.040 
as well to give you another variation
so<00:02:00.100> if<00:02:00.159> I<00:02:00.250> come<00:02:00.430> forward<00:02:00.760> one<00:02:00.970> to<00:02:01.330> see<00:02:01.659> I<00:02:01.690> use<00:02:01.900> an

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
so if I come forward one to see I use an

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.290 
so if I come forward one to see I use an
angle<00:02:02.320> here<00:02:02.500> three<00:02:02.920> and<00:02:03.159> four<00:02:03.640> well<00:02:04.210> I'm

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
angle here three and four well I'm

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.790 
angle here three and four well I'm
already<00:02:04.450> shaped<00:02:04.810> in<00:02:04.960> this<00:02:05.080> direction<00:02:05.260> so<00:02:05.710> I'm

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
already shaped in this direction so I'm

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.350 
already shaped in this direction so I'm
going<00:02:05.950> to<00:02:06.010> follow<00:02:06.130> through<00:02:06.520> on<00:02:06.550> my<00:02:06.820> five<00:02:07.120> and

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
going to follow through on my five and

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.109 
going to follow through on my five and
six<00:02:07.600> to<00:02:07.780> give<00:02:07.930> me<00:02:08.080> some<00:02:08.289> angulation<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.970> is<00:02:10.090> a

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
six to give me some angulation this is a

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.520 
six to give me some angulation this is a
pretty<00:02:10.390> common<00:02:10.750> problem<00:02:10.929> that<00:02:11.140> I<00:02:11.200> see<00:02:11.230> with<00:02:11.470> a

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
pretty common problem that I see with a

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.080 
pretty common problem that I see with a
lot<00:02:11.740> of<00:02:11.770> ladies<00:02:12.190> of<00:02:12.340> try<00:02:12.520> to<00:02:12.580> do<00:02:12.730> field<00:02:13.030> work

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
lot of ladies of try to do field work

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.300 
lot of ladies of try to do field work
because<00:02:13.390> they<00:02:13.569> believe<00:02:13.959> that<00:02:14.260> every<00:02:14.920> pattern

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
because they believe that every pattern

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.949 
because they believe that every pattern
is<00:02:15.400> supposed<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.850> end<00:02:16.030> perfectly<00:02:16.360> square<00:02:16.870> root

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
is supposed to end perfectly square root

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.020 
is supposed to end perfectly square root
of<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.110> guy<00:02:17.260> so<00:02:17.860> they're<00:02:18.010> so<00:02:18.190> afraid<00:02:18.520> that<00:02:18.640> in

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
the middle of what they're doing they'll

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.050 
the middle of what they're doing they'll
flip<00:02:20.230> it<00:02:20.410> right<00:02:20.530> back<00:02:20.740> to<00:02:20.920> face<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.280> guy<00:02:21.459> so
