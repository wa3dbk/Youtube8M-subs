here<00:00:00.480> in<00:00:00.570> part<00:00:00.719> 5<00:00:01.020> I'll<00:00:01.350> use<00:00:01.560> the<00:00:01.709> techniques

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
here in part 5 I'll use the techniques

here in part 5 I'll use the techniques
we've<00:00:02.220> gone<00:00:02.370> over<00:00:02.639> in<00:00:02.730> the<00:00:02.820> earlier<00:00:03.030> episodes

simply mitigate the entering we'll do

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.639 
simply mitigate the entering we'll do
that<00:00:39.000> by<00:00:39.180> keeping<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.600> exposed<00:00:39.989> edges<00:00:40.200> on<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
inside of our project to start with I'll

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.020 
inside of our project to start with I'll
cut<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.500> 24<00:00:43.950> inch<00:00:44.100> length<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.460> webbing<00:00:44.789> which<00:00:44.940> I

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
cut a 24 inch length of webbing which I

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.520 
cut a 24 inch length of webbing which I
know<00:00:45.090> from<00:00:45.300> experience<00:00:45.420> will<00:00:45.989> fit<00:00:46.140> my<00:00:46.289> dog's

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
know from experience will fit my dog's

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.830 
know from experience will fit my dog's
necks<00:00:46.860> unless<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.820> happen<00:00:48.090> on<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.360> same<00:00:48.539> size

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.420 
necks unless you happen on the same size
shape<00:00:49.050> as<00:00:49.200> as<00:00:49.320> me<00:00:49.469> you'll<00:00:49.829> have<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.070> experiment

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
shape as as me you'll have to experiment

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.819 
shape as as me you'll have to experiment
the<00:00:51.420> first<00:00:51.629> thing<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.870> do<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.170> loop<00:00:52.379> one<00:00:52.620> end

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
the first thing I do is loop one end

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.740 
the first thing I do is loop one end
through<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.160> webbing<00:00:53.520> slide<00:00:53.789> over<00:00:54.420> lapping

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
through the webbing slide over lapping

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.420 
through the webbing slide over lapping
at<00:00:54.840> about<00:00:55.050> two<00:00:55.260> inches<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.070> then<00:00:56.100> I'm<00:00:56.280> going

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
at about two inches and then I'm going

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.520 
at about two inches and then I'm going
to<00:00:56.520> stitch<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.789> shut<00:00:57.180> using<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.629> Box<00:00:57.870> X<00:00:58.199> stitch

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
to stitch it shut using the Box X stitch

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:16.240 
to stitch it shut using the Box X stitch
that<00:00:58.739> we<00:00:58.829> learned<00:00:59.039> last<00:00:59.250> time

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.010 

next<00:01:16.940> I<00:01:17.030> loop<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:17.360> long<00:01:17.540> end<00:01:17.750> through<00:01:17.990> the

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
next I loop the long end through the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:30.460 
next I loop the long end through the
male<00:01:18.230> part<00:01:18.500> of<00:01:18.590> the<00:01:18.710> buckle

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.230 

then<00:01:31.070> I<00:01:31.100> loop<00:01:31.340> it<00:01:31.490> once<00:01:31.700> again<00:01:31.850> through<00:01:32.150> the

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
then I loop it once again through the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:41.100 
then I loop it once again through the
webbing<00:01:32.510> slide

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.380 

now<00:01:41.680> we<00:01:41.740> have<00:01:42.010> a<00:01:42.040> measure<00:01:42.340> of<00:01:42.430> adjustability

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
now we have a measure of adjustability

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.390 
now we have a measure of adjustability
notice<00:01:44.230> that<00:01:44.350> I've<00:01:44.470> done<00:01:44.620> this<00:01:44.830> such<00:01:45.070> that<00:01:45.100> the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
notice that I've done this such that the

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.310 
notice that I've done this such that the
unfinished<00:01:45.970> and<00:01:46.150> is<00:01:46.330> now<00:01:46.450> sandwiched<00:01:47.080> inside

two layers of material this isn't just

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.450 
two layers of material this isn't just
aesthetic<00:01:50.260> but<00:01:50.440> will<00:01:50.620> minimize<00:01:50.980> any<00:01:51.010> friction

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460

aesthetic but will minimize any friction
and<00:01:51.730> rubbing<00:01:52.030> that<00:01:52.060> could<00:01:52.330> cause<00:01:52.510> the<00:01:52.690> end<00:01:52.840> to

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
and rubbing that could cause the end to

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.650 
and rubbing that could cause the end to
fray<00:01:53.520> next<00:01:54.520> we'll<00:01:54.640> put<00:01:54.790> the<00:01:54.820> d-ring<00:01:55.210> on<00:01:55.360> and

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
fray next we'll put the d-ring on and

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:05.200 
fray next we'll put the d-ring on and

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.000 

the<00:02:05.720> rookie<00:02:06.020> mistake<00:02:06.320> is<00:02:06.500> to<00:02:06.650> stitch<00:02:06.860> your

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
the rookie mistake is to stitch your

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.350 
the rookie mistake is to stitch your
webbing<00:02:07.280> shut<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:07.760> then<00:02:07.880> realize<00:02:08.179> you've

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
webbing shut and then realize you've

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.540 
webbing shut and then realize you've
forgotten<00:02:08.630> to<00:02:08.780> put<00:02:08.899> a<00:02:08.960> component<00:02:09.289> on<00:02:09.560> for

before<00:02:22.400> I<00:02:22.430> start<00:02:22.700> stitching<00:02:22.940> look<00:02:23.540> at<00:02:23.660> the

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
before I start stitching look at the

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.270 
before I start stitching look at the

through<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.730> hardware<00:02:26.030> in<00:02:26.330> and<00:02:26.570> ask<00:02:26.990> yourself

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
through the hardware in and ask yourself

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.560 
through the hardware in and ask yourself
why<00:02:27.560> this<00:02:28.520> is<00:02:28.640> where<00:02:28.790> it<00:02:28.880> pays<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.120> look<00:02:29.450> at

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
why this is where it pays to look at

why this is where it pays to look at
