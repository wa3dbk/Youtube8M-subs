00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.980
 stepping away from the shot 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.200
 the employee takes this starting one 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.780
 which he can quickly make 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.420
 hit the enemy taking him on the bar 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.940
 supplied by a kabul pistol unit 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.830
 tightly to the face of the ground floor of 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.830
 avoiding head-on fire 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.220
 if you need to get away from the bullet you can 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.940
 do it like this roll 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:45.070
 performed easier than you can imagine 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.870
 try it and you can do it 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:54.190
 do and here it is too easy 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:56.980
 get the above starting 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.379
 Manufacturing serves as the basis for movement in 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.720
 any directions from it can be done 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.390
 somersault forward or backward 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.970
 you can shoot a gun out of it 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.460
 god and in the end it can 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.930
 use for sharp carpentry 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.930
 throw forward run 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.270
 here so leaving from a bullet looks fighting 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.270
 setting 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.620
 Here is how the departure from the bullet looks like 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.090
 attention avoiding the bullet is better done then 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.060
 when the enemy almost raised the gun 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.150
 but not yet raised it completely and 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.890
 brings it to the top in such 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.290
 able to enemy inside not 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.110
 programmed only to lift the weapon 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.390
 it is difficult for him to even be able to restructure 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.580
 on the trigger is this little 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:16.730
 the distance when you have to leave 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:16.730
 from a shot here it is this gap 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:30.610
 it's still early now it's too early now 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.610
 now you can 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:42.159
 it's still early again 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:44.870
 the enemy can reorganize too early 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:47.530
 now we need to leave this one 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.530
 small gap 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:03:01.030
 the same thing with two hands when the opponent 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:03.250
 just started raising the gun he can 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.060
 reorganize and shoot a when he 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:11.170
 almost brought him up no longer here he 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:18.940
 this gap you have half a second 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:22.710
 to get away from the bullet now early now 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.710
 goods now need 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.220
 rearrange for a shot and carry 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:38.720
 movement shoot with two hands 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:42.040
 very hard slowly and most importantly it 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.040
 can't make a move 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:54.720
 With this method of shooting is very hard 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.720
 move horizontally at the same time 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:01.090
 the name of the enemy shoot out 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.000
 narrowed eyes you have as many as two 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.910
 tenths of a second second 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.620
 practice with you when 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.300
 trained observation can 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.570
 notice like a shooting finger 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:17.500
 stirring on the descent you have the same 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:20.310
 two seconds to practice going out and you 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.310
 will have time to leave 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.340
 the enemy can do the tychkovy movements 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.980
 a gun forward until he graduated 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.660
 you can go to the side here it is 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.460
 tychkovye movement he can not 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.460
 shoot before he graduated 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.590
 with cars down you can remove many 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.590
 roll 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:11.219
 it is the same but habits period two 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.219
 by hands 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.850
 It looks like this almost 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.169
 so it looks the other way 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.910
 you can leave this starting position 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.910
 roll 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.010
 like this 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.230
 counter duel 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:04.590
 green obviously loses duel too 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.590
 another perspective 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.100
 yes green loses 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.600
 counter duel in visual slow motion 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.600
 option
