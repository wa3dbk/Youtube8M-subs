go that route 24 pin there's your IDE I
thought<00:05:30.610> this<00:05:30.820> board<00:05:31.180> had<00:05:31.510> a<00:05:31.540> floppy<00:05:33.030> yeah<00:05:34.030> it

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
thought this board had a floppy yeah it

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.430 
thought this board had a floppy yeah it
does<00:05:35.010> floppy<00:05:36.010> if<00:05:36.310> you<00:05:36.490> still<00:05:36.850> use<00:05:36.880> a<00:05:37.060> floppy<00:05:37.440> to
