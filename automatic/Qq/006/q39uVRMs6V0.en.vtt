the galaxy tab is here at the Samsung
booth<00:00:09.740> and<00:00:09.950> I<00:00:10.010> have<00:00:10.160> my<00:00:10.610> first<00:00:10.790> hands-on<00:00:11.389> and

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290 
booth and I have my first hands-on and

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.060 
booth and I have my first hands-on and
there<00:00:12.530> it<00:00:12.650> is<00:00:12.740> very<00:00:13.280> sweet<00:00:13.690> 7-inch<00:00:14.690> under<00:00:15.500> 400

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
there it is very sweet 7-inch under 400

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.670 
there it is very sweet 7-inch under 400
grams<00:00:16.309> they<00:00:17.029> say<00:00:17.300> it's<00:00:17.480> cool<00:00:17.720> tix<00:00:17.960> a<00:00:18.140> nine<00:00:18.439> I'm

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
grams they say it's cool tix a nine I'm

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.440 
grams they say it's cool tix a nine I'm
not<00:00:18.770> so<00:00:18.950> sure<00:00:18.980> I<00:00:19.430> reckon<00:00:19.730> it's<00:00:19.849> cortex<00:00:20.240> a8

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:20.450 
not so sure I reckon it's cortex a8

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.089 
not so sure I reckon it's cortex a8
otherwise<00:00:21.230> they'd<00:00:21.410> be<00:00:21.500> talking<00:00:21.710> about<00:00:21.800> dual

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:22.099 
otherwise they'd be talking about dual

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.220 
otherwise they'd be talking about dual
core<00:00:22.369> anyway<00:00:22.910> it's<00:00:23.480> going<00:00:23.599> to<00:00:23.660> be<00:00:23.720> fast<00:00:23.989> with

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
core anyway it's going to be fast with

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.260 
core anyway it's going to be fast with
the<00:00:24.410> Samsung<00:00:24.650> hummingbird<00:00:25.579> processor<00:00:25.910> I

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
the Samsung hummingbird processor I

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.179 
the Samsung hummingbird processor I
think<00:00:26.570> docking<00:00:27.230> port<00:00:27.439> on<00:00:27.590> the<00:00:27.710> bottom<00:00:27.800> looks

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
think docking port on the bottom looks

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.690 
think docking port on the bottom looks
like<00:00:28.340> stereo<00:00:28.730> speakers<00:00:29.360> on<00:00:30.020> the<00:00:30.290> top<00:00:30.700> actually

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
like stereo speakers on the top actually

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.250 
like stereo speakers on the top actually
there's<00:00:31.880> a<00:00:31.939> little<00:00:32.060> bit<00:00:32.210> of<00:00:32.270> tape<00:00:32.780> over<00:00:32.960> some

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
there's a little bit of tape over some

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.810 
there's a little bit of tape over some
of<00:00:33.350> these<00:00:33.410> things<00:00:33.620> but<00:00:34.040> there's<00:00:34.190> a<00:00:34.250> mic<00:00:34.460> there

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
of these things but there's a mic there

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.319 
of these things but there's a mic there
and<00:00:35.600> we've<00:00:36.050> got<00:00:36.320> a<00:00:36.649> sim<00:00:36.890> card<00:00:36.920> slot<00:00:37.489> micro<00:00:37.879> SD

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
and we've got a sim card slot micro SD

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.669 
and we've got a sim card slot micro SD
slot<00:00:39.039> volume<00:00:40.039> button<00:00:40.370> and<00:00:40.579> power<00:00:40.850> button<00:00:41.030> and

00:00:41.669 --> 00:00:41.679 
slot volume button and power button and

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:45.610 
slot volume button and power button and
of<00:00:42.679> course<00:00:43.510> capacitive<00:00:44.510> touchscreen<00:00:45.320> so

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
of course capacitive touchscreen so

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.979 
of course capacitive touchscreen so
we're<00:00:45.920> on<00:00:46.160> 2.2<00:00:46.820> should<00:00:47.269> have<00:00:47.420> five<00:00:47.690> screens

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
we're on 2.2 should have five screens

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.740 
we're on 2.2 should have five screens
across<00:00:48.199> there<00:00:48.620> and<00:00:48.920> that's<00:00:49.789> pretty<00:00:50.000> fast<00:00:50.390> for

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
across there and that's pretty fast for

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.990 
across there and that's pretty fast for
the<00:00:50.809> applications<00:00:51.530> I'm<00:00:51.980> checking<00:00:52.250> for<00:00:52.460> google

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
the applications I'm checking for google

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.479 
the applications I'm checking for google
apps<00:00:53.269> here<00:00:53.719> has<00:00:54.320> it<00:00:54.350> got<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:54.859> google<00:00:55.160> a<00:00:55.250> so
