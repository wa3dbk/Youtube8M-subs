paste things in and do a command V then
you<00:01:20.070> can<00:01:20.220> see<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.580> will<00:01:20.670> paste<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.240> in

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
you can see that it will paste it in

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.280 
you can see that it will paste it in
instead<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.590> same<00:01:22.830> works<00:01:23.100> with<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:24.290> with

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
instead and the same works with the with

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.640 
instead and the same works with the with
a<00:01:26.390> just<00:01:27.390> partial<00:01:27.780> screen<00:01:28.049> capture<00:01:28.380> as<00:01:28.470> well

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
a just partial screen capture as well

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.460 
a just partial screen capture as well
where<00:01:28.860> if<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.070> do<00:01:29.220> ctrl<00:01:30.030> command<00:01:30.299> shift<00:01:30.810> +<00:01:31.110> 4

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
where if you do ctrl command shift + 4

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.130 
where if you do ctrl command shift + 4
instead<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:32.159> just<00:01:32.369> only<00:01:33.060> capture<00:01:33.750> part<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.079> the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
instead to just only capture part of the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.960 
instead to just only capture part of the
screen<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.590> then<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.189> pick<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.549> part<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.909> the
