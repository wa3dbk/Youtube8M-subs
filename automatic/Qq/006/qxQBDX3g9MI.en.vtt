00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello youtube I hope you are very 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.460
 well in this video I will teach you how to 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.220
 hit goals with your finger 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.440
 this application is called faith soccer and 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.900
 it's a pretty entertaining game the 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.970
 theme of the game is very simple to put 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.550
 the ball in the goal and the application 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.800
 It has 5 different modalities of 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.169
 game the first game mode is 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.200
 call quick chat you have to put the 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.820
 more goals in 60 seconds and 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.009
 every time apart from putting a goal 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.450
 you hit the target shooting they 'll give you 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.450
 extra time and points 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.610
 the second modality is called endurance 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.079
 we no longer have a certain time but 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.600
 now we have only three 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.879
 opportunities to fail if we score goals 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.790
 but we do not touch the target shot counts 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.710
 as a failure from time to time they will appear 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.360
 symbols that will give you double points 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.360
 or extra opportunities 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.230
 the third modality is my favorite one 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.510
 call challenge here you have to 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.400
 complete each of the challenges and in 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.140
 based on the number of points you achieve 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.140
 you will earn a medal of 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.510
 bronze silver or gold 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.960
 This is undoubtedly the most 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:20.420
 difficult of the game the fourth modality is 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.400
 rose bar here also accounts with time 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.590
 and all that needs to be done in it is 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.710
 hit the crossbar between more times 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.600
 consecutive you give more points you will have and 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.910
 the same as in other modalities in 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.740
 some occasions will appear symbols of 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.740
 double points and extra time 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.600
 the last modality is called snatch and 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.540
 here you go against the clock between faster 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.150
 destroy the glass better 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.310
 the more advances more pieces of glass 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.230
 You will have to break as you will have already 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.270
 realized the glass that you break in 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.760
 reality is an advertisement for other games 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.490
 of the company this idea seems very 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.560
 creative and I even liked it a lot 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.200
 better than having annoying banners of 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.390
 other games all the time 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.430
 flix or that is a game that first 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.649
 printing does not sound very exciting 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.750
 but give it a chance to prove 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.450
 to the simple the entertaining thing that is 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.069
 play it information about the price 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.680
 of the game is in the description at 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.690
