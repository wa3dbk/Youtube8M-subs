against<00:03:21.359> Everton<00:03:21.810> at<00:03:21.959> home<00:03:22.200> I'm<00:03:22.380> hoping<00:03:22.859> we

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
against Everton at home I'm hoping we

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.020 
against Everton at home I'm hoping we
can<00:03:23.010> get<00:03:23.310> away<00:03:23.430> with<00:03:24.389> more<00:03:24.660> I<00:03:25.850> want<00:03:26.850> to<00:03:26.880> get<00:03:26.970> a

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
can get away with more I want to get a

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.360 
can get away with more I want to get a
window<00:03:27.540> on<00:03:27.690> it<00:03:27.810> I<00:03:28.260> want<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:28.799> score<00:03:28.980> some<00:03:29.160> goals

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
window on it I want to score some goals

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.309 
window on it I want to score some goals
so<00:03:29.910> it's<00:03:30.269> just<00:03:30.389> bet<00:03:30.569> it's<00:03:30.720> just<00:03:30.870> those<00:03:30.989> drawers

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
so it's just bet it's just those drawers

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.319 
so it's just bet it's just those drawers
that<00:03:31.349> really<00:03:31.980> really<00:03:32.130> annoy<00:03:32.489> me<00:03:32.700> but<00:03:32.880> I<00:03:33.060> guess

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
that really really annoy me but I guess

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.120 
that really really annoy me but I guess
if<00:03:33.750> we're<00:03:34.200> all<00:03:34.349> getting<00:03:34.620> drawers<00:03:34.799> you've<00:03:34.980> got
