00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.140
 Hi, I'm Luis, we're going to learn 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.509
 this video tutorial to have a base of 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.089
 personal data and to see the 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:14.299
 image of each employee by the mere 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:15.949
 done by clicking on a cell to 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.019
 we have built a small base 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:20.869
 of example data with six with six 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:23.749
 employees with personal data of each 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.150
 one of them and also in each row of 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:28.939
 each of them is accompanied by a 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.329
 name as a picture a key to what 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:35.750
 what will your photo agree that for each 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:39.050
 one has its key and that is also 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.940
 key this name matches 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.039
 precisely the name of his photograph 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.550
 that we have it stored in this folder 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:48.800
 from here and how you can see these 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.340
 image names match these 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.250
 names that are here 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.750
 agree well 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.430
 for this the first thing we are going to do 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.000
 is insert 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.660
 an active image control would be this 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.879
 from here 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.700
 and we 're going to open it and draw it from 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.490
 this size more or less 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.530
 very well then what we do is 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.149
 that we enter into the properties of this 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.320
 control now that it is selected 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:21.399
 click here and on the property 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:24.170
 picture side mode is going to open it 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.939
 the combo and we chose the third 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.009
 according to this option fuck 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.020
 means that the image is going to adapt 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.450
 to this box because if the image is very 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.399
 big would look bad and then catching 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.649
 this option the image that we enter in the 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.760
 box will be adapted to its perfect size 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.280
 It is done 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.350
 and we leave this off the design mode 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.460
 so that it is like this is what we are going to 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.050
 to do is press alt 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:52.140
 f 11 to go to make the macro 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.400
 that is going to make the base work 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.890
 data 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.060
 for this we open the visual basic and we 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.800
 we realize that there is only one 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.890
 sheet 1 because the others we have 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.540
 removed and we're going to double- click is already 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.180
 done by double clicking and in the tab 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.700
 general we are going to open and we take the 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.910
 object works it 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.349
 because we want to create an event 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.760
 corresponding to the sachet object and in 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.560
 this case the first one that appears by 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.840
 defect is the word sheets sein selection 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.069
 this means that a macro will be a 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.569
 event that is going to shoot 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.930
 automatically at the moment 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.069
 let's click on some good cell then 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.340
 This is precisely what we want 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.620
 because if we realize in excel 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.170
 we want that when clicking on a cell 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.420
 of this column displays the 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.610
 photograph of the employee in this box is 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.640
 say only when we click on 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.840
 some cell of the column that is with 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.700
 one 1 2 3 4 and 5 is column 5 of excel 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.880
 Well then, let's start 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.880
 schedule we are going to do the following pib 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.930
 target.com is equal to 5 oden ie if 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.209
 the pulsation of the target belongs to the 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.400
 column 5 running the macro only 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.280
 in that case good now let's create the 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:13.470
 variable photo we will create with the value 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.150
 of the workshop well the saved query 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.090
 now we are going to create the sentence that 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.290
 It makes viewing the photo to be 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.290
 activate before id 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:32.900
 found image 1 and that's what it's called 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:35.810
 and point is equal to bad teacher 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.269
 we open parentheses and the dolphin asks us 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.980
 of jms refers to the putt the name 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.310
 together with your putt to open the photos 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.650
 in our case we have already seen that these 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.849
 photos we have here are the same 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.370
 names that are stored in the 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.140
 folder is here 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.409
 Well, we simply take the prat 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.560
 the parate exists and usher and is the 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:04:01.260
 to be good photos because we take it 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:03.490
 control c we 're going 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.650
 a visual basic 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.200
 we put quotes 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.629
 we wrote the path we closed the bar 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.560
 important the end bar we close 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:16.599
 the quotes ampersand variable photo that 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.500
 we have created before 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:23.990
 jpg quotes ampersand point since 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:28.320
 all the photos since all the 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:32.310
 photos are jpg is separate 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.710
 so there would be a photo linked to the pad and 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:38.490
 also concatenated the extension 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.480
 perfect now we close the lead and everything 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.350
 is in a position to start 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:46.290
 work if we go back to excel and we do 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.530
 click here we will see the photo of the 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:52.500
 employee 5 and with just one click 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:54.270
 in the cells we will see the photo of the 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.580
 determined person only with doing 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.680
 click 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.120
 yes, if we click on a cell 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.699
 that column where we look cause a 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.240
 error to debug what are we going to do what 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:05.270
 following 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.220
 we go into visual basic and at the beginning 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.630
 of the macro we put an error 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.100
 with the robot or output that means 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.290
 that if there is an error that is 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.900
 go to the health label well 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.940
 then let's stop the macro here the 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.310
 site so that if everything has worked 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.040
 well the macro comes out and after the success 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.320
 sub we put the exit label so that 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:30.160
 to send a message to the user to 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:36.790
 tell him that some error has occurred 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:40.280
 an error occurred, check the names of 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:44.260
 and the photos 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:46.660
 we put a slight criticism to a style 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.280
 and hey, he is now ready 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.470
 so that when we click inside 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.450
 work perfectly as long as 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.800
 the name of the photo is well written or 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.570
 if we press outside it will tell us that it has 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.850
 an error occurred, check the names of 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.770
 the photos or if in any of them there is a 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.450
 badly written name of photograph when 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.040
 let's click also this will occur 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.000
 error and it will tell us to review the 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.290
 Name (s 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.520
 then it works perfectly 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:11.270
 only with clicking 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.270
 this is all
