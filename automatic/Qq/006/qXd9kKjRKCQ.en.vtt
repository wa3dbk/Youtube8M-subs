the<00:00:29.310> field<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.760> think<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.269> actually<00:00:30.390> will<00:00:30.840> gel

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230

the field I think it actually will gel
pretty<00:00:31.560> quickly<00:00:31.800> for<00:00:32.070> this<00:00:32.160> team<00:00:32.369> because

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
there aren't going to be a lot of

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.530 
there aren't going to be a lot of
changes<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.200> terms<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.829> formation<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.000> style

the<00:00:37.050> changes<00:00:37.410> are<00:00:37.530> going<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.829> come<00:00:38.040> from

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
the changes are going to come from

having<00:00:38.399> super<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.329> superior<00:00:39.690> personnel<00:00:40.320> and

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
having super is superior personnel and

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.799 
having super is superior personnel and
it<00:00:40.829> does<00:00:41.040> come<00:00:41.309> down<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.579> Bradley<00:00:42.149> his<00:00:42.329> ability

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
it does come down to Bradley his ability

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.319 
it does come down to Bradley his ability
to<00:00:43.260> get<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.469> team<00:00:43.890> out<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.190> tough<00:00:44.820> spots<00:00:44.850> in

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
to get the team out of tough spots in

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.630 
to get the team out of tough spots in
into<00:00:45.690> advantageous<00:00:46.200> positions<00:00:47.039> quickly<00:00:47.460> as

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
into advantageous positions quickly as

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.430 
into advantageous positions quickly as
he<00:00:47.879> does<00:00:48.030> for<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.239> u.s.<00:00:48.420> national<00:00:48.450> team<00:00:48.809> to

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
he does for the u.s. national team to

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.529 
he does for the u.s. national team to
keep<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.829> simple<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.340> put<00:00:50.700> guys<00:00:50.940> into<00:00:51.390> good

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
keep it simple to put guys into good

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.180 
keep it simple to put guys into good
positions<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:52.110> think<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.559> will<00:00:52.739> be<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.010> key

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
positions I think that will be the key

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.770 
positions I think that will be the key
for<00:00:53.340> them<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.640> think<00:00:53.760> it'll<00:00:54.030> be<00:00:54.090> pretty

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
for them I think it'll be pretty

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.840 
for them I think it'll be pretty
standard<00:00:55.289> for<00:00:55.500> 42<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.460> think<00:00:56.670> it'll<00:00:56.789> work

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
standard for 42 and I think it'll work

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.880 
standard for 42 and I think it'll work
right<00:00:57.360> away<00:00:57.480> now<00:00:58.140> they<00:00:58.260> filled<00:00:58.530> some<00:00:58.710> holes

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
right away now they filled some holes

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.770 
right away now they filled some holes
this<00:00:59.070> offseason<00:00:59.579> obviously<00:01:00.120> they<00:01:00.270> got<00:01:00.449> some

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
this offseason obviously they got some

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.900 
this offseason obviously they got some
seriously<00:01:01.230> talented<00:01:01.469> players<00:01:02.039> but<00:01:02.670> are<00:01:02.789> there

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
seriously talented players but are there

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.579 
seriously talented players but are there
any<00:01:02.940> holes<00:01:03.539> still<00:01:03.899> left<00:01:04.170> over<00:01:04.290> maybe

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
any holes still left over maybe

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.010 
any holes still left over maybe
defensive<00:01:05.460> depth<00:01:05.729> perhaps<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.450> think<00:01:06.869> really

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
defensive depth perhaps I think really

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.870 
defensive depth perhaps I think really
all<00:01:07.229> around<00:01:07.530> depth<00:01:07.799> as<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.400> look<00:01:08.640> at<00:01:08.729> this

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
roster the only position where they go

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.880 
roster the only position where they go
to<00:01:11.909> solid<00:01:12.360> players<00:01:12.540> deep<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:12.990> left<00:01:13.260> back<00:01:13.500> of

yet another ligament area Achilles this

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.319 
yet another ligament area Achilles this
time<00:01:28.380> his<00:01:28.560> second<00:01:28.920> time<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.310> three<00:01:29.340> years<00:01:29.790> he

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
time his second time in three years he

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.410 
time his second time in three years he
was<00:01:30.360> their<00:01:30.659> ace<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.650> hole<00:01:31.890> on<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:33.030> forward

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
was their ace in the hole on the forward

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.630 
was their ace in the hole on the forward
line<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:34.020> really<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> different<00:01:35.250> look<00:01:35.430> from

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
line it really a different look from

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.359 
line it really a different look from
guys<00:01:35.880> like<00:01:35.909> Defoe<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:37.079> jail<00:01:37.320> Berto<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.950> maybe

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
guys like Defoe in jail Berto and maybe

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.160 
guys like Defoe in jail Berto and maybe
Dwayne<00:01:38.729> De<00:01:38.880> Rosario<00:01:39.000> if<00:01:39.479> he<00:01:39.570> plays<00:01:39.780> up<00:01:39.960> there

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
Dwayne De Rosario if he plays up there

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.800 
Dwayne De Rosario if he plays up there
as<00:01:40.290> well<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.650> do<00:01:41.100> think<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.119> team<00:01:42.450> that

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
as well I do think this is a team that

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.249 
as well I do think this is a team that
has<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:43.350> lot<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.799> talent<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.340> their<00:01:44.520> first<00:01:44.750> 13<00:01:45.750> 14

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
has a lot of talent in their first 13 14

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.350 
has a lot of talent in their first 13 14

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.120 
or 23 and MLS and I think that is a big
gap<00:01:53.579> right<00:01:53.850> now<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.659> TFC<00:01:55.229> has<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.649> figure<00:01:55.860> out

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
gap right now that TFC has to figure out

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.920 
gap right now that TFC has to figure out
how<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.549> manage<00:01:56.729> okay<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.450> maybe<00:01:57.719> they're<00:01:57.899> not
