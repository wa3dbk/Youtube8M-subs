00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
but regardless this is a microphone test

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.649 
but regardless this is a microphone test

give you a quick little you know just a
test<00:01:03.420> I'm<00:01:03.720> trying<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.080> say<00:01:04.199> as<00:01:04.290> many<00:01:04.589> random

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
test I'm trying to say as many random

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.550 
test I'm trying to say as many random
words<00:01:05.220> as<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.430> can<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.260> what<00:01:07.260> do<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.409> think<00:01:07.440> about

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
words as I can and what do I think about

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.100 
words as I can and what do I think about
the<00:01:07.740> headset<00:01:08.100> compared<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.760> my<00:01:08.909> 1500s<00:01:09.659> I'd<00:01:09.810> say

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
the headset compared to my 1500s I'd say

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.750 
the headset compared to my 1500s I'd say
the<00:01:10.229> microphone<00:01:10.500> probably<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.070> not<00:01:11.340> as<00:01:11.549> good

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
the microphone probably is not as good

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.080 
the microphone probably is not as good
but<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:13.410> advantage<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.340> having<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.700> wireless

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
but the advantage of having the wireless

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.800 
but the advantage of having the wireless
just<00:01:15.480> just<00:01:16.230> you<00:01:16.620> know<00:01:16.650> no<00:01:17.100> competition<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.300> love

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
just just you know no competition I love

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.770 
just just you know no competition I love
having<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.110> wireless<00:01:19.470> it's<00:01:19.650> super<00:01:20.070> handy<00:01:20.190> and

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
having the wireless it's super handy and

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.940 
having the wireless it's super handy and
yeah<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.810> think<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.170> microphones<00:01:22.560> good<00:01:22.740> enough

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
yeah I think the microphones good enough

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.910 
yeah I think the microphones good enough
to<00:01:23.130> use<00:01:23.340> still<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.590> yeah<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.620> think<00:01:25.740> that's

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
to use still so yeah I think that's

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.370 
to use still so yeah I think that's
basically<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.370> guys<00:01:26.400> I'm<00:01:26.610> gonna<00:01:26.760> wrap<00:01:26.940> it<00:01:26.970> up
