00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.250
 around beautiful hills that is 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.589
 there I started to like roasting and 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.139
 then now I m 2 this thing 2 standing 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.849
 then down a stone wall and after 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.059
 loose big rocks in the process of 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:19.100
 prepare the stone walls then I 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.100
 I started from an extruded polystyrene 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.090
 and the msn pole and the extruded polystyrene 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:30.390
 in fact I put stone patterns 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:31.710
 on top initially i was just using a 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.940
 pencil to make the effort but I believe 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.600
 that it's too big so now I'm doing 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.100
 that with a small screwdriver to 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.200
 be careful not to eat too much money 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.480
 otherwise it leaves big traces and 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.629
 that's what gives it to this effect with 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:51.420
 a pencil once these loaves I 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:55.410
 put a sublayer in fact with a 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:01:01.379
 under layer of white paint 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:04.830
 indoor latex at rona all hello 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:09.689
 everyone and it's a little tedious but 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.869
 that kind of thing I do not have good hands 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.869
 but 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.500
 already by big thing 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:38.070
 that's busy in the evenings and it's very 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:41.610
 ok ok ok I finished painting in 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.380
 white my wall there and that's it 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.270
 give it here I come little things get 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.259
 go wrong 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.970
 a little thing that bothers me is that 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.409
 done there are plenty of small cracks 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.170
 we see everywhere 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.869
 I do not have if we see well on the screen as 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.250
 if in his chances the painting is 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.470
 tended and then crackled a whole 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.210
 little bit is not dramatic but 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.369
 it's a bit boring thing that I wanted 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.740
 specify i put that on gp makes sure 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.759
 extruded polystyrene because after I 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.929
 to be able to follow curves and so that's 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.790
 still pretty rigid 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:17.820
 I made holes all over there and 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.890
 the goal after that is to be able to follow 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.630
 course like that I can not do any 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.260
 too strong cuts because otherwise it 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:31.170
 break it it broke so I had to 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:34.049
 pick up now I'm trying to apply 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.670
 the paintings so I did not find on 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:39.099
 internet of things 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.680
 my happiness I will try to do that 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:44.380
 that is to say I go from black very 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.349
 diluted to try to especially 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.380
 fill in the bottom then after i'm 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:54.209
 to tap with white to have some 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.209
 rocks that springs a little further forward 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.489
 I have acrylic paint 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:12.440
 because that's the result that it does not give 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:16.190
 if we see well but honestly I 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:18.710
 I'm pretty happy the thing actually 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:22.700
 it was mostly from that I realized 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:27.100
 it is to take the black painting the adulated 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.100
 10th enormously finally dilute it a lot 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:36.290
 impose nothing everywhere and especially after 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:38.120
 clusters and scratching it's not for 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.240
 try to push the paint that is 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:46.450
 on the rocks and to let the 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:50.270
 painting in the between euro that 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:51.800
 is like that we get a stone that 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.900
 still pretty white on the top 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:57.919
 and then between the stones it stays pretty 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.630
 black and arrange not nice I think 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:04.729
 after I added a little color 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:06.020
 kind or yellow or due to floods that 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:08.810
 just like that in a lighter way 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.610
 to not see that white stone 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.080
 but overall that's what I asked 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.669
 I 'm happy with myself because I saw 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.110
 on the internet a video of a guy who 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:16.400
 was the first Grand Duke month except 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.380
 that he initiators who I put 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.070
 just ten minutes so here is weight 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.070
 decreases very happy
