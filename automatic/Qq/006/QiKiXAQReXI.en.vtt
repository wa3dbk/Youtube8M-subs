00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:18.910
 Hello cable x policy I will introduce you to the guitar today 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:22.840
 Martin so hd from Divas DVD 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:28.660
 It's a 3.5 billion model. I'll do it all the same today as the second floor. Hello. 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:31.480
 For custom models indeyo hd 35 haedeuril introduced today simply something like one 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:37.059
 So what does d body mean? 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.720
 Oh yeah now this is made d when the big sound required immediately Diva 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:42.129
 Earth 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:46.539
 Gpa'll almost never a right or something that color is more eonseong past, 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:51.640
 Now the body when it was created as one example, a study should cover the situation and in particular to 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:56.109
 The taste of playing at high volume in the round and put the dew struck the right body d 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:01:00.640
 It's one of the best personalized benefits . 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:05.619
 The d-body is the best when you need the largest volume in the widest space 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:09.880
 In a larger space than any other body, 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:14.470
 After the body came out Joe Hye-mi, we picked out the myrtle, 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:19.509
 I tried to use it but the power from the strap from the pants stretches 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:23.080
 These parts of the book are a bit difficult to beat beyond the body. 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:26.979
 And this model is specially d- body and it costs hd 30. 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.799
 When a lot of people doing Izu di 35 t2 18 and stuck with front h 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:33.939
 There are people who are curious to see if there is a difference. 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:38.590
 In the case of general b, the biggest difference between us and courtesy is now h 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:40.420
 Perrin Vaughn Herringbone 4 As we can see, 4-line tee time 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:45.369
 Etc. with wine white 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.890
 This buiIding look haering then most now do not you even internally in 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:52.750
 But the biggest difference is the Aegis Keller 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.259
 Gotta have it in this world application of skills and a more modern settings Popular hansori 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.270
 It's strong. 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:02:03.369
 For example, if you think the sound is a little stuffy on the body, 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:06.880
 As you come to the model 10000 Let d pants much too filled with filler 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:10.780
 Yet have the characteristic body's d jeulgisilsu sound too 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:14.709
 To prevent frustration, the bass was so big that I felt a little frustrated. 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:18.720
 hd, a little more modern, yes. 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:22.570
 4 You can experience it. So fry it. 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:27.340
 Martin, you're up there. 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.810
 Hey wake up right now, for example, my machine I wanted something very type of Grover 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.140
 Not my gold now 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:38.110
 If the low-profile brother Carmelo'm out there in the product 4 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:43.000
 If you look like this again, give it a three-piece, 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:44.470
 Arts, this one I've got the bass gotta fit into the biggest feature is the dew Pit 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.400
 Emphasized 4 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:53.410
 The bass emphasized the Earth's very special rhythm 35 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:58.270
 Can be said one of the main feature, and in and on which both on the outside for the 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:03.580
 The door was put in the y-roud two-quarter test, 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:06.880
 Just one big attraction to the visual fun in it 35 all in Cannes View 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:11.050
 If your chin is like Jess Fix, it's divided in the middle and now it's a bookmark. 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:15.070
 Teach me to cut off from the tree, the attached aftermath is connected to each other 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:18.700
 Now, if you look at it, especially in the case of the same, 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:23.710
 I have that kind of feeling because it's Griffiths to me. 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:29.050
 Martin is another model m Celtics do it.I thought to model the three-piece 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:30.070
 Of the 4 models, I'm not worried by ì–œ 30 or so. 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.340
 I did it. 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:38.350
 It is very nice to have a little rose pattern. 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:41.710
 The consultation in the front is the most basic but the most basic 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:46.110
 But that's where it's plus model when Rose 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.110
 App 2 does not 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:55.300
 It's about the greatest difference between 28 and 35. 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:58.630
 Do not you think this is a site with 4 bindings? 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:04.240
 In the meantime, I can tell . 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:08.680
 It is called and arrives example let's now based on style rather than tankers 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:12.490
 Murray is as for the switch-term and remain in the patent DE Although the strap 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.640
 But the fact is that you can not think of d body . 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.680
 It requires preconception that room so gripping is something less than a minute you will not gatguyo 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.310
 L'll be rewarded with a good enough selection that 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:27.700
 I am the first person to be the first person and the difference is now 4 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:29.770
 The nut Weed heightened differ example a little more in what irradiation chamber 3 channel between 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.250
 I'm the director doeguyo ordinary Danawa 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:37.270
 Yes Usually 5m or 44.5 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:40.030
 4.5 This is how I see a little narrow fingers of pink disappearing 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:46.170
 There are twisted cases, 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:46.170
 There is such a difference, but if you die, 

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:55.149
 Uh, it 's not like a cannon. 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.870
 Can I spend less to write gabardine 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:13.840
 Pretty old tree on the road forward is not going to feel this multi-national professional 5m 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:18.790
 Like the model, water reactivity does not come straight away 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:22.120
 The pushing force comes from the knit leaf model or the Owen model. 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:24.940
 So it's a good summer in October, but it's good and bad. 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:28.360
 Possible rather than yes a little different so you see doeguyo 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:36.040
 If you try to play it yourself, this echo will sound through the bosom of the body 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:38.790
 Another rug Diva dwaeseo aquarium ll feel put out to give examples or negative lead 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.790
 Ah 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.180
 won 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:56.940
 Who gave introduce to you it is as if granted hd 35 very bad indentation 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:00.750
 It was really a guitar that made the sound of the circle. 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:05.840
 We then again we'll find you a nice guitar in trouble ah 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.840
 Thank you. 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:16.950
 Coming coming Oh Uhh 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:25.950
 Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:34.070

 Oh ha ah 5 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:43.600
 To be in the
