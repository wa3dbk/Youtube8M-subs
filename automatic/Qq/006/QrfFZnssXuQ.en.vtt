pretty<00:00:25.949> catchy<00:00:26.779> but<00:00:27.779> it's<00:00:27.960> probably<00:00:28.140> one<00:00:28.349> of

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
pretty catchy but it's probably one of

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.209 
pretty catchy but it's probably one of
the<00:00:28.500> more<00:00:28.650> difficult<00:00:28.890> ones<00:00:29.960> and<00:00:31.009> not<00:00:32.009> just

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
the more difficult ones and not just

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.560 
the more difficult ones and not just

where<00:01:39.649> you<00:01:39.740> have<00:01:39.799> all<00:01:39.920> this<00:01:40.219> stuff<00:01:40.399> coming<00:01:40.939> at

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
where you have all this stuff coming at

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.289 
where you have all this stuff coming at
you<00:01:41.950> yeah<00:01:42.950> then<00:01:43.729> you<00:01:43.819> have<00:01:43.909> to<00:01:43.969> destroy<00:01:44.210> this

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
you yeah then you have to destroy this

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.359 
you yeah then you have to destroy this
little<00:01:44.569> circular<00:01:45.259> things<00:01:45.799> as<00:01:45.950> you<00:01:46.039> go<00:01:46.100> through

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
little circular things as you go through

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.099 
little circular things as you go through
and<00:01:46.460> then<00:01:46.520> you<00:01:46.609> have<00:01:46.700> these<00:01:46.819> log<00:01:47.179> platforms<00:01:47.899> or

and then you have these log platforms or
vertical<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:48.679> they're<00:01:48.770> kind<00:01:48.920> of<00:01:49.069> hard<00:01:49.189> to

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
vertical and they're kind of hard to

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.709 
vertical and they're kind of hard to
stand<00:01:49.579> out<00:01:49.789> and<00:01:49.850> then<00:01:49.969> you<00:01:50.030> have<00:01:50.119> to<00:01:50.209> wall<00:01:50.479> kick

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
you're in a little box area so you just

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.569 
you're in a little box area so you just
have<00:02:56.329> to<00:02:56.420> go<00:02:56.540> around<00:02:56.840> and<00:02:57.019> destroy<00:02:57.290> stuff

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
have to go around and destroy stuff

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.240 
have to go around and destroy stuff
there<00:02:58.579> are<00:02:58.700> little<00:02:58.880> pathways<00:02:59.540> with<00:02:59.780> spikes

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
there are little pathways with spikes

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.789 
there are little pathways with spikes
and<00:03:01.250> unless<00:03:01.549> you<00:03:01.639> have<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:01.790> shadow<00:03:02.120> armor<00:03:02.799> but

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
you probably don't because the last

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.909 
you probably don't because the last
shadow<00:03:05.239> armor<00:03:05.599> piece<00:03:05.810> are<00:03:06.349> no<00:03:06.530> one<00:03:06.739> of<00:03:06.829> the
