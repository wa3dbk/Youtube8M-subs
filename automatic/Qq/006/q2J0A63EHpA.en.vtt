00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
advantages of an electric car is of

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.080 
advantages of an electric car is of
course<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.039> incredibly<00:00:53.579> cheap<00:00:53.879> to

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
course that it is incredibly cheap to

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.510 
course that it is incredibly cheap to
run<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.590> this<00:00:55.590> particular<00:00:55.800> case<00:00:56.280> we're

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
run in this particular case we're

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.950 
run in this particular case we're
talking<00:00:56.550> about<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.000> running<00:00:57.329> cost<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.719> three

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
talking about a running cost of three

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.049 
talking about a running cost of three
euros<00:00:58.410> per<00:00:58.620> hundred<00:00:58.949> kilometres<00:00:59.520> which

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
euros per hundred kilometres which

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.819 
euros per hundred kilometres which
equates<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.539> only<00:01:00.750> one<00:01:01.020> third<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> cost

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
equates to only one third of the cost

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.149 
equates to only one third of the cost
compared<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.460> diesel<00:01:03.439> another<00:01:04.439> advantage<00:01:04.979> is

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
compared to diesel another advantage is

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.100 
compared to diesel another advantage is
that<00:01:05.549> this<00:01:05.729> car<00:01:06.000> can<00:01:06.180> be<00:01:06.299> charged<00:01:06.720> from<00:01:07.020> a

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
that this car can be charged from a

completely normal power outlet in just
eight<00:01:10.380> hours<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:11.159> car<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.580> fully<00:01:11.880> charged

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
eight hours the car is fully charged

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.690 
eight hours the car is fully charged
again<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.900> if<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.680> car<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.010> charged<00:01:14.460> with

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
again and if the car is charged with

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.090 
again and if the car is charged with
electricity<00:01:14.939> from<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.659> renewable<00:01:16.110> source<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
electricity from a renewable source the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.969 
electricity from a renewable source the
environmental<00:01:17.850> gains<00:01:18.000> are<00:01:18.420> considerable<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
environmental gains are considerable the

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.679 
environmental gains are considerable the
biggest<00:01:20.159> advantage<00:01:20.850> with<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.150> car<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.540> of

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
biggest advantage with this car is of

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.320 
biggest advantage with this car is of
course<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.530> zero<00:01:22.830> emitting<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:24.180> it's

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
course that it's a zero emitting so it's

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.810 
course that it's a zero emitting so it's
not<00:01:24.450> emitting<00:01:25.020> either<00:01:25.290> carbon<00:01:26.040> dioxide<00:01:26.549> or

not emitting either carbon dioxide or

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.120 
not emitting either carbon dioxide or
other<00:01:27.150> components<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.229> city<00:01:28.439> traffic<00:01:28.740> and

other components in the city traffic and

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.770 
other components in the city traffic and
that<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.700> course<00:01:29.880> what<00:01:30.090> environment<00:01:30.659> the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
that is of course what environment the

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.039 
that is of course what environment the
fantastic<00:01:31.380> advantage<00:01:32.240> volvo<00:01:33.240> cars<00:01:33.540> chose<00:01:33.900> to

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
fantastic advantage volvo cars chose to

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.109 
fantastic advantage volvo cars chose to
use<00:01:34.200> an<00:01:34.380> existing<00:01:34.680> model<00:01:35.189> when<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:35.640> electric

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
use an existing model when this electric

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.719 
use an existing model when this electric
car<00:01:36.329> was<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.720> be<00:01:36.869> developed<00:01:37.610> partly<00:01:38.610> because

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
car was to be developed partly because

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.569 
car was to be developed partly because
the<00:01:39.030> volvo<00:01:39.360> c30<00:01:39.810> functions<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:40.950> well<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.400> big

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
the volvo c30 functions so well in big

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.760 
the volvo c30 functions so well in big
city<00:01:41.850> traffic<00:01:42.119> where<00:01:42.869> electric<00:01:43.290> car<00:01:43.500> traffic

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.770 
city traffic where electric car traffic
is<00:01:44.040> expected<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.670> increase<00:01:44.909> most<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.600> near

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
is expected to increase most in the near

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.560 
is expected to increase most in the near
future<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.439> also<00:01:47.220> because<00:01:47.729> volvo<00:01:48.149> wants<00:01:48.450> to
