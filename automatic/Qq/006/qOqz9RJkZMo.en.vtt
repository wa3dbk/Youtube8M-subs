okay so far the frames are not doing so
good<00:00:22.830> because<00:00:22.980> I'm<00:00:23.190> recording<00:00:23.340> in

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
good because I'm recording in

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:34.170 
good because I'm recording in
simultaneous<00:00:24.930> simultaneity

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.790 

those<00:00:35.180> hidden<00:00:35.450> triplets

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
those hidden triplets

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.480 
those hidden triplets
and<00:00:37.370> not<00:00:37.760> the<00:00:37.910> past<00:00:38.090> frames<00:00:38.570> I<00:00:39.160> got<00:00:40.160> way<00:00:40.310> better

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:40.490 
and not the past frames I got way better

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.580 
and not the past frames I got way better
before<00:00:41.320> but<00:00:42.320> I<00:00:42.830> want<00:00:43.130> to<00:00:43.220> try<00:00:43.370> it<00:00:43.430> out<00:00:44.500> just<00:00:45.500> to

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
before but I want to try it out just to

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:46.690 
before but I want to try it out just to
see<00:00:45.620> what<00:00:45.860> it<00:00:45.920> looks<00:00:46.040> like<00:00:46.160> I<00:00:46.250> don't<00:00:46.310> see<00:00:46.610> if

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
see what it looks like I don't see if

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:56.770 
see what it looks like I don't see if
it's<00:00:46.820> even<00:00:46.970> possible

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.980 

strange<00:00:57.380> with<00:00:57.830> little<00:00:58.040> glitches<00:00:58.250> like<00:00:58.520> that

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:58.990 
strange with little glitches like that

strange with little glitches like that
okay<00:00:59.990> let's<00:01:00.230> do<00:01:00.350> a<00:01:00.380> race<00:01:01.270> to<00:01:02.270> do

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.630

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
okay so you can see should be a split

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.390 
okay so you can see should be a split

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
people seem again as a base I don't know

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.010 
people seem again as a base I don't know
how<00:01:21.910> well<00:01:22.030> you<00:01:22.060> can<00:01:22.180> see<00:01:22.270> because<00:01:22.600> of<00:01:22.810> course

you<00:01:27.690> know<00:01:27.780> I'm<00:01:28.110> doing<00:01:28.380> protein<00:01:28.830> for<00:01:28.979> intersect

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
you know I'm doing protein for intersect

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.690 
you know I'm doing protein for intersect

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.149

yeah<00:01:32.180> recording<00:01:32.680> two<00:01:33.680> things<00:01:33.920> at<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:34.100> same

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
yeah recording two things at the same

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.190 
yeah recording two things at the same
time

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:46.600 

I'll<00:01:37.620> work

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.110 

but<00:01:47.150> I<00:01:47.180> was<00:01:47.330> never<00:01:47.390> to<00:01:47.570> do<00:01:47.690> this<00:01:47.870> a<00:01:48.200> lot<00:01:49.430> I<00:01:49.460> would

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
but I was never to do this a lot I would

00:01:50.120 --> 00:02:04.660 
but I was never to do this a lot I would
probably<00:01:50.450> set<00:01:51.140> my<00:01:51.260> resolution<00:01:52.300> setting<00:01:53.300> 70

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:20.559 

stop<00:02:05.299> listen

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.780 

because<00:02:21.319> those<00:02:21.500> a<00:02:21.530> drag<00:02:21.799> race<00:02:21.980> isn't<00:02:22.310> using

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
because those a drag race isn't using

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:31.830 
because those a drag race isn't using
more<00:02:22.939> buttons

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:42.910 

so<00:02:32.380> my<00:02:32.560> friends<00:02:32.860> are<00:02:32.950> open<00:02:33.190> 24

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.090 

this<00:02:43.250> is<00:02:43.370> a<00:02:43.400> pretty<00:02:43.610> good<00:02:44.230> off-road<00:02:45.230> car<00:02:45.560> as

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
this is a pretty good off-road car as

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:54.140 
this is a pretty good off-road car as
compared<00:02:46.460> to<00:02:46.490> their<00:02:46.670> was

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.940 

yeah<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:55.019> wasn't<00:02:55.409> too<00:02:55.500> worried<00:02:55.680> about<00:02:55.799> hitting

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
yeah I wasn't too worried about hitting

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.030 
yeah I wasn't too worried about hitting
a<00:02:56.099> car<00:02:56.280> wrong<00:02:56.610> what<00:02:56.849> I<00:02:56.909> was<00:02:57.060> worried<00:02:57.239> about<00:02:57.299> was

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
a car wrong what I was worried about was

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.910 
a car wrong what I was worried about was
spitting<00:02:59.040> out<00:02:59.129> afterwards<00:02:59.909> not<00:03:00.150> being

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
spitting out afterwards not being

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.650 
spitting out afterwards not being
maintained<00:03:01.920> Lightspeed

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.550 

I<00:03:05.800> can't<00:03:06.800> actually<00:03:06.950> see<00:03:07.810> like<00:03:08.810> my<00:03:09.050> percentage

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
I can't actually see like my percentage

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.590 
I can't actually see like my percentage
and<00:03:09.740> whatnot<00:03:10.040> because<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:11.090> cameras<00:03:11.480> are

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
and whatnot because the cameras are

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.110 
and whatnot because the cameras are
clean<00:03:11.840> in<00:03:11.930> front<00:03:11.960> of<00:03:12.260> a<00:03:12.320> screen<00:03:12.560> for<00:03:13.100> me<00:03:13.220> but

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
clean in front of a screen for me but

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.600 
clean in front of a screen for me but
that<00:03:14.240> doesn't<00:03:14.480> hurt<00:03:14.600> you<00:03:14.780> guys<00:03:14.930> because

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
that doesn't hurt you guys because

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.470 
that doesn't hurt you guys because
approachable

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.530

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.899 

hopefully<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.349> footage<00:03:27.590> looks<00:03:27.769> okay<00:03:28.040> both

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:28.909 
hopefully the footage looks okay both

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:36.840 
hopefully the footage looks okay both
ways

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.339

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.700

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:10.949 

128<00:04:02.909> of<00:04:03.180> best-trained<00:04:04.019> that's<00:04:04.319> pretty<00:04:04.530> good
