00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.379
 cold night 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:05.379
 The genetic linkage test called golden rice 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.010
 It is likely that the Philippines will soon be completed. 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.499
 The golden rice is the beta carotene 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:16.980
 Genetics that isolate and associate genes with killing 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.140
 It is food. 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.170
 Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in the end of last month 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.029
 I decided to invest $ 3 million in wealth every year. 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.909
 Since the last year in the Philippines, the golden rice 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:29.439
 Test cultivation 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.439
 It looks like it can be done soon. 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.660
 When the test is done with the help of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.240
 Registration of varieties and seed propagation. 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.240
 It is expected to be distributed in late 2012 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.830
 The characteristics of construction are usually unanswered, with a lot of teams 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.890
 So the new car is golden. 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.650
 Beta carotene is a component that enters the body and turns into vitamin a 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.660
 Incheon can not make vitamin a by itself. 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.580
 You have to take vitamin A or beta carotene. 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.450
 If you eat rice wrapped immediately in the future of a normal person, you need vitamins a 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.610
 I can fill it. 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.610
 Because of this, vitamin a is lacking, 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.310
 Alternative to people suffering from malnutrition 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.310
 It's a prospect that you can help with the diet directly. 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.020
 On the other hand, 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.520
 And the stability and the environmental impact of the 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.740
 The controversy surrounding the pros and cons is going well. 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.300
 People who support Korean rice supply are 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.300
 Emphasizing that it was developed for profit and 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.120
 Many people suffering from malnutrition become healthier with golden rice. 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.420
 It is argued that it can be disrupted. 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.470
 But the opposite is that genetic modification 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.040
 It's not the only alternative. 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.370
 No matter the purpose of the public interest, 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.600
 It is the first thing to discuss various ways to achieve 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.600
 Do not try to solve technology unilaterally. 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.939
 Countries undernourished can choose their own food 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.510
 He said. 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.750
 And even if they were developed for public purposes, 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.290
 The revenue generated through the use of genetic 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.840
 To large-scale biotechnology companies with 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.419
 And 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:21.529
 Genetically modified rice would threaten Asia's food sovereignty 

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:22.129
 I am insisting
