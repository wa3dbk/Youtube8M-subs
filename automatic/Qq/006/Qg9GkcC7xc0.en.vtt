00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680
 beautiful girls here I am with another 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:11.940
 video in which I'll let you look how 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:14.280
 expand the memory to undertake the 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.830
 your mobile by moving all the 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.570
 apply as many applications as possible 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:23.910
 in yours in your sd card 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:27.060
 etc. in the external memory in this 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.800
 we will use as you see a samsung 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:35.130
 galaxy knicks turbo and you've got it you've got 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.690
 did you have tweets and I don't feel like making a 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.600
 video with for how nothing is done because 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.230
 the application because it is a process 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.170
 very serious where there are gods 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.379
 advantages, however , in the event of yours 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:57.300
 cell phone went to break and the 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.820
 guarantee would certainly not be valid there 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.590
 pa are also ways to uninstall it but I 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.300
 I don't do it for the moment 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.710
 then for this application then 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:12.479
 we need a struggling cell phone 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:17.090
 and we expect to learn how how why 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.290
 you see it immediately pink then 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:24.900
 the application 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:28.950
 here it is and link2 sd that you will find it is 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:32.000
 very easily and free of charge 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:36.689
 on google play then we start to see 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.690
 as the application then and vi 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.220
 All applications will appear here 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:48.210
 casey and that are in yours 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:55.680
 mobile phone and that are on the sd card or 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:58.590
 that I do n't know, I put it as far as possible 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.130
 put only sd cards 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.510
 but now let's go and vote for example 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.510
 with this application 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:13.800
 we come with any application and with 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:21.650
 which madou them at the pole and we move it 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:21.650
 here in the phone 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.810
 ok let's go into the settings 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:46.140
 ok let's go on asu applications 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.600
 manages applications as you can 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.110
 speak 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.210
 here is how you can see which ones 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:03:01.110
 animated wall papa can't move 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:07.530
 on the sd card and therefore we hear instead 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:13.340
 on that if you had to and let's go up 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:15.330
 that application itself is lo 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:23.720
 we can see that it can be moved 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:28.580
 on the sd card the process will be a bit 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.580
 but it won't take long 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.790
 one minute stuff we saw since 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.750
 he had already put it, he wanted less 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.380
 time 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:44.370
 however I advise you to inform yourself 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.950
 before doing it all and and inform 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:53.390
 also on this application because el 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:56.300
 very useful application but it is also is 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:04:00.540
 dangerous and let's say because if you are not 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:04.080
 very experienced and remove yours 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:07.590
 sd card with the applications of 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:10.440
 system and system settings yes 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.299
 It could ruin the device and then 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.360
 as I said the warranty you can 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:17.640
 bring the assistance but the guarantee does not 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.280
 is more valid in boys for this 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.019
 video is all subscribe commented 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.740
 put I like look at all the well 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.740
