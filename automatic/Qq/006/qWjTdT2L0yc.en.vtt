00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
that were just not tight enough and on

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.830 
that were just not tight enough and on

learning how to end the twist and so a
lot<00:01:13.050> of<00:01:13.110> times<00:01:13.380> they<00:01:13.500> would<00:01:13.590> unravel<00:01:14.090> also<00:01:15.090> i

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
lot of times they would unravel also i

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.330

of<00:01:17.400> tiny<00:01:18.090> ones<00:01:18.450> instead<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.870> doing<00:01:19.110> really

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
of tiny ones instead of doing really

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.929 
of tiny ones instead of doing really
really<00:01:19.439> big<00:01:19.770> ones<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:20.250> can<00:01:20.520> get<00:01:20.610> away<00:01:20.700> with

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
to look more realistic but I should have

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.679 
to look more realistic but I should have
done<00:01:52.770> more<00:01:52.829> twist<00:01:53.579> because<00:01:53.909> as<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.479> see<00:01:54.659> right

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
done more twist because as you see right

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.249 
done more twist because as you see right
here<00:01:56.000> this<00:01:57.000> whole<00:01:57.240> area<00:01:57.479> doesn't<00:01:57.930> have<00:01:58.229> a

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
here this whole area doesn't have a

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.230 
here this whole area doesn't have a
twist<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.859> and<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.579> would<00:01:59.640> have<00:01:59.850> liked<00:02:00.090> to

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
twist in it and I would have liked to

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.359 
twist in it and I would have liked to
have<00:02:00.299> had<00:02:00.570> some<00:02:00.930> twists<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.740> right<00:02:01.920> here<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:02.340> I

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
have had some twists and right here so I

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.359 
have had some twists and right here so I
I<00:02:02.549> just<00:02:02.759> think<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:03.000> should<00:02:03.030> have<00:02:03.270> done<00:02:03.420> more

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
I just think I should have done more

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.609 
I just think I should have done more
it's<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.520> super<00:02:05.909> cute<00:02:06.149> hairstyle<00:02:06.630> super<00:02:07.229> dope<00:02:07.409> I

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
it's a super cute hairstyle super dope I

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.070 
it's a super cute hairstyle super dope I
love<00:02:08.130> love<00:02:08.490> love<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.910> hair<00:02:09.060> style<00:02:09.360> but<00:02:09.600> I<00:02:09.750> need

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
love love love the hair style but I need

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.930 
love love love the hair style but I need
to<00:02:10.170> be<00:02:10.289> able<00:02:10.380> to<00:02:10.590> get<00:02:10.740> it<00:02:10.770> right<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.880> think

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
to be able to get it right and I think

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.810 
to be able to get it right and I think
that<00:02:12.450> with<00:02:13.320> the<00:02:13.350> twist<00:02:13.710> looking<00:02:14.040> like<00:02:14.250> twist

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
that with the twist looking like twist

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.120 
that with the twist looking like twist
and<00:02:15.180> not<00:02:15.450> like<00:02:15.660> locks<00:02:16.080> it<00:02:16.500> doesn't<00:02:16.950> make<00:02:17.070> it

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
and not like locks it doesn't make it

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.130 
and not like locks it doesn't make it
look<00:02:17.490> realistic<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.600> so<00:02:18.780> it's<00:02:18.960> kind<00:02:19.110> of

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
look realistic and so it's kind of

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.990 
look realistic and so it's kind of
pointless<00:02:19.290> so<00:02:19.740> I<00:02:19.800> will<00:02:20.040> come<00:02:20.220> back<00:02:20.400> trust<00:02:20.850> and

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
pointless so I will come back trust and

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.760 
pointless so I will come back trust and
believe<00:02:21.030> I<00:02:21.390> will<00:02:21.540> be<00:02:21.630> back<00:02:21.810> with<00:02:22.140> another<00:02:22.170> set

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
believe I will be back with another set

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.430 
believe I will be back with another set
of<00:02:23.070> bollocks<00:02:23.670> next<00:02:24.630> time<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:24.930> will<00:02:25.020> be<00:02:25.080> smaller

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
of bollocks next time it will be smaller

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.250 
of bollocks next time it will be smaller
I'll<00:02:25.800> probably<00:02:26.070> a<00:02:26.280> little<00:02:26.490> bit<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.760> color

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
I'll probably a little bit of color

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.589 
I'll probably a little bit of color
a<00:02:27.290> little<00:02:27.560> more<00:02:27.650> funky<00:02:27.860> and<00:02:28.189> stuff<00:02:28.489> so<00:02:29.180> look

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
a little more funky and stuff so look
