00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.600
 circus people and welcome to 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.390
 my very first last loyal today 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.730
 we destroy this old screen 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.429
 because the unboxing video of my old 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.439
 new screen has you the 500 likes 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:27.720
 I believe I already reached almost 600 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.210
 i promised if that unboxing 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.579
 video which reaches 500 likes then becomes 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.530
 he screens all the screen here on the floor 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.420
 equalized and we will do it now 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.879
 In any case , our location 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.520
 and then hopefully in the 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.559
 screen very badly hurt and deep 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.910
 lying on the ground and I have that too 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.309
 video from two different 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.640
 We have filmed here 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.930
 what do you call the dolby video rough and 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.519
 somehow definitely have two 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.899
 I always have different perspectives 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:57.090
 will change again 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.789
 to give her a really right feeling 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.840
 for the death the screen is too 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.880
 and I would say that 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.380
 do not talk any longer about the hot 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.140
 porridge I want to say we say 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.720
 Just start the old one 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.220
 throwing things down is so high 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.630
 Incidentally, about the same height as me 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.000
 believe it is about three meters 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.890
 fifty or so not the world though 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.420
 a lot and really should 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.820
 however, the screen is every moment 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.980
 we'll let him be destroyed 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.150
 By the way, theater is mine 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.340
 so do not be surprised 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:35.520
 that definitely belongs to this one 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:38.899
 agree and now one would say 321 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.899
 because the height 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.850
 So if that is not no 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.470
 it was not destructions then either 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.660
 So the fields easy and remains 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.800
 steady like a cow in the storm so that 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.930
 it's fascinating here 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.210
 and so I think after my 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.530
 crash a bit more with fierce 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.870
 help stones 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.479
 Only stones help here 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.300
 So to climb from her to me 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.280
 and if you now after the fall throughout 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.050
 close ran then you can see everywhere 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.450
 small scraps not at all 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.550
 Of course, there is nothing at all 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.620
 there may be a bit too 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.800
 a lot of sunshine the beam 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.660
 literally literally but otherwise he is 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.040
 nothing and that's why it comes here now 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.040
 stone number one 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.230
 oh yes and he has at least right times 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.959
 purely here in the backward slow motion 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.850
 you can see how beautiful each one is again 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.970
 lower part of the screen ever 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.350
 but it is not broken 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.520
 if not another one 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.520
 stone would exist 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.420
 but somehow what do you mean so me 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.280
 think the screen can be 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.690
 still pretty good and that's why 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.730
 I say all good things are 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.010
 three here is definitely one 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:15.890
 third scream then finally 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:17.300
 I will do the garaus 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.370
 Now really do not say that 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.530
 screen still looks good destroyed 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.930
 is definitely but somehow wants 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.700
 I nevertheless times I perfectly solo 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.200
 again out there have more stones ago 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.480
 you can hear it before we say it 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.000
 Give the right fun kick foam 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.709
 interest what the three big stones on 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.290
 screen you have seen 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.000
 In any case, our stand is the 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.010
 Definitely gone but it also has it here 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.470
 really fat in the electronics 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.000
 so it's not working outright 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.730
 more I think it would even be 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.240
 go because the board is all still 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.890
 in it 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.240
 maybe if you still connect 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.240
 would probably still go but 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.670
 I think I prefer to prevent it 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.310
 then always prefer a few stones and 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.570
 digits again on the back 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.570
 ass away from the screen out 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:31.189
 so I think for today have enough 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.780
 screens always the same floor 

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:34.669
 I found it really cool me personally 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.560
 was really fun now 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:38.599
 all the aggression out here too 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.099
 leave on this screen sometimes 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:41.990
 but just a few more circles up 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:43.669
 the screen on it must be art 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.560
 in any case also there must he his 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.389
 artistic masterpiece be this 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.169
 destruction and I believe with this 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:52.520
 beautiful painter's work of 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.560
 ugliness thank you very much 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.360
 still wish for your attention 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.159
 a wonderful day no matter if you 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.080
 Look at this video and I hope we 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:02.080
 hear us in the next video again 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.409
 everyone goes
