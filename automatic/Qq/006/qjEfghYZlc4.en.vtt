00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.160
 only two years after the death of more time did someone imagine how to do the 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.359
 recreation 

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:15.759
 today or used for many things including to have new insights in the 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:18.759
 fight against air pollution 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.750
 what we do is use a beam of energy said that when traveling through 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.410
 atmosphere and reach small particles that are generally invisible to 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.550
 eyes have a health part scattered say port 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.030
 there we look and salustiano pollution discount exists and where it is 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.650
 so it's a high resolution target every three meters from the ground up to 12 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:40.620
 kilometers 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.680
 can expect this to begin to understand things with the world this was the 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.800
 factor activity that brought air pollution transportation we 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.540
 we have long-range transport of peace and love for europe I think they cross the 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.440
 that we are asking is that jorge jesus so this gives an idea of ​​the 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.850
 complexity of the atmosphere and what to do 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.740
 the mobile laboratory is a unique instrument that we develop is one of the six 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.080
 years with him we can go to any agency or remodeling totally 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.850
 self-catering afp we operate looking atmosphere about 10 to 15 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.740
 kilometers of a vehicle 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.650
 so it allows us to make three-dimensional images of the atmosphere combining 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:22.040
 leisure in the system we made here in fact he points the finger to the lengths that 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.799
 we do not see I'm just a game to lusa have disclosed that allows us to give a 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.000
 look at various particles in the air I think we can differentiate the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 chronic diseases 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.970
 the perception of the leader in the mutant atmosphere 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.320
 take on greater importance in the world that is waiting for the threat of a 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.320
 rapid climate change 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.890
 leisure as well as all the rest of the technology that derives from the very 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.870
 1905 einstein theorists changed our world in various ways 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.670
 but this is nothing compared to the changes that are coming soon. 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.670
 forward 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.500
 the computers of today and fed on an almost endless process of 0 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.549
 x 1 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:14.150
 the computer revolution is the result of this simple yet powerful 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.769
 binary logic 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.949
 in a handful of centers around the world, researchers have already 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:22.949
 departure for the next computer revolution 

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:32.289
 spain has opened the door to the wonderland of physics for the world 

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:33.229
 quantum 

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:37.879
 but a century later scientists continue to explore a strange 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.159
 new landscape 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:44.789
 on a day when, for example, a particle of light with a photo 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:47.789
 can be in two places at once 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:54.499
 and this idea that was impossible could contain jade for a kind of conclusion 

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:57.499
 brand new 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:02.189
 because what people are trying to do with 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:05.499
 physical condition is to go beyond this landscape 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:09.260
 because what we are perceiving is that this world is different but 

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:12.909
 extremely powerful as the manipulation of information and in another 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.279
 technology 

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:19.329
 Now you can think we can use these novelties of the mechanical 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.799
 phenomenon can be in two places at the same time for 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.049
 technological 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.659
 and until very recently the answer seemed to me not to call 6 5 we had not 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.030
 intuition of what to do with it has to act in a certain way that we are 

00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:36.549
 learning to use this new behavior in something useful the list of 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.509
 risk 

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:40.769
 over white suitcase 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.769
 it's hot on the trail of a new type of computer 

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:49.129
 because quantum effects allow the logic of cycereal computers 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.789
 has arrived 

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:53.259
 be replaced by a very different type of logic 

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:58.129
 these two-month particles photos 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:02.620
 can be in two places at the same time we can think of it winning being 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.649
 a little 

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:05.909
 This can be done same time. 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:11.849
 then one day we may have no information as it is today. 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.849
 it was the end at the same time 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:17.999
 it's not just a theory 

00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:22.469
 refusing enormous powerful sisters the prototype computer of work of 

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:25.729
 Lapp can actually take an atom and make it 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:30.330
 while pointing up is another to point down these devices to 0 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.319
 quantum physics has argued that the promised computer is far beyond 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:37.780
 today's supercomputers just as they are way beyond the old 

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:40.779
 point calculator 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:45.229
 are guilherme 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:46.340
 So 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.000
 if we say that the system is incredibly more powerful it is 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 incomprehensible more powerful 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:58.300
 to details the einstein publications began in the extraordinary in 1905 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:03.039
 with their entire career their public price accompanied by studies 

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:07.589
 if each opened the way for technologies that continued with the 

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:10.589
 transform our daily life 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:27.270
 the other teams is one of the biggest bets that form the vision 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.259
 of the world 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:31.169
 I have a vision shared by the Scottish scientist who also 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:32.240
 politicians 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.699
 pete wentz de einstein 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:37.520
 was very difficult for the posted and neither believed in rats 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.289
 we have given us proof that these invisible particles that are 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:42.550
 real 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.509
 he picked up a timely space possible time space time 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:50.860
 before hitting with miscellaneous of physics was static and until years after it 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.860
 became dynamic is the devil's reason to come back 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.160
 students' parents and the einstein equations of general relativity in 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.030
 have shown that the creative universe luis that changes everything if we live in a universe 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.289
 which is dynamic 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:20.310
 young days that have a history that is always changing that is 

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:24.840
 psychologically very different is very different and philosophically than 

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:28.639
 studying at a university is eternally home and I think this is 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:31.689
 part of this revolutionary transformation by which we are 

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:35.289
 passing this change of seeing things as absolutely tournament 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:39.529
 structured to live in a system of relationships that evolved yesterday the beginning 

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:43.180
 has a story and you have to know how it fits into this story. 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.180
 referring to the registration 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.569
 einstein who modeled our image of the universe 

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:57.279
 and although it started from a journey of pure discovery 

00:06:57.819 --> 00:07:03.330
 now more than a century later are ideas continued to reshape the world to 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.669
 our return 

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:09.669
 the gas quarterback 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:14.910
 bundle 

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:22.439
 Brazilian version 

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:23.629
 I demand a studio
