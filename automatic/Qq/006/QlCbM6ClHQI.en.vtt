them but I never have so I'll try to try
my<00:01:34.560> best<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.979> describe<00:01:35.250> how<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.640> rate<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.000> up

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
my best to describe how you rate it up

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.310

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
but it is a little confusing so it comes

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.010 
but it is a little confusing so it comes
in<00:01:40.619> with<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> treble<00:01:41.340> hook<00:01:41.460> separate<00:01:42.020> basically

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
in with a treble hook separate basically

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.090
