are serious from the studies we've seen

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.220 
are serious from the studies we've seen
almost<00:03:51.849> eight<00:03:52.180> to<00:03:52.389> fifteen<00:03:52.750> percent<00:03:53.019> of<00:03:53.170> those

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
assume that those eight percent take it

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.309 
assume that those eight percent take it
on<00:04:00.340> to<00:04:00.579> their<00:04:00.700> adult<00:04:00.970> life<00:04:01.200> absolutely<00:04:02.200> if
