00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.690
 where the dark brown color ends 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:19.140
 we blur in movement without ocular or 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.140
 of lathes as you see in the tutorial 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:29.550

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.550
 outer eyes with black or matte 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:43.540

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:49.270
 under the eyebrows points of light in the 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:52.780
 lacrimal pan sting and pancakes to base 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.360
 of water will use in women of color 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.630
 Chantilly and for the rest of the face 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.260
 use the vanilla color of our 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.260
 Paula model 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:13.440
 and we apply it generously for all the 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.440
 face 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:25.810
 then we could with this 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:28.690
 have been using these two van steen to 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.940
 candy knife we will start in the 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.780
 outline of the face as you see it 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.780
 in the tutorial 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.110
 we will begin to blur it in 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.110
 circular 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:03:07.849
 until it disappears completely look 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.849
 how are we sculpting our lime 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:20.760
 remember to blur it very well in the 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:24.879
 nose to where the sixths begin 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:28.150
 with this black waterproof pencil what 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:35.250
 you are going to apply inside and outside of 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:38.319
 the eyelashes to avoid points of light 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.530
 it's time for the eyelashes 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:44.109
 I'm going to apply this simple here to 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.989
 give more effect of dramas I will put 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:49.510
 half in the outer angles of 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:52.750
 the eyes to give more drama to the 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.659
 look of paula and with this marker to 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.359
 Black water proof we will remove 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:02.650
 all the white spots of the eyelashes 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:06.010
 false with this palette of powders we go 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.970
 to give a little more brazen in the face 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.970
 from paula 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:28.970
 we take the contour of the face with 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:31.820
 this palette very subtly because I already 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:43.190
 we had done primarily with the 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:46.400
 Palestinians we return to the pencil to proof of 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:49.040
 water and we apply it very carefully in 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.530
 the water line without coming together with the 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.860
 coffee color in the outer corners of 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:58.120
 the eyes of the same palette of shadows 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:02.150
 we choose the color cope and we blur it 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:05.240
 on top of the brown eyeliner for 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.920
 eyebrows with this compact color to test 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.550
 of waters 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:14.740
 and the eyebrows are never the same just follow 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.740
 its shape for a natural finish 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:49.569
 we remark with black color and retouch and 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:52.650
 we lengthen more the more expensive coffee delineated 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:52.650
 waterproof 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:08.220
 loose pearl powder for lighting 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.220

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:39.680
