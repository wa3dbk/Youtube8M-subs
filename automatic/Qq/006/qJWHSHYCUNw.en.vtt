alphabet is one of those things that if
you've<00:00:13.799> never<00:00:14.070> played<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.790> guitar<00:00:14.880> you<00:00:15.269> have

very little experience with music you're

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.880 
very little experience with music you're
probably<00:00:18.270> going<00:00:18.510> well<00:00:18.840> what<00:00:18.990> what's<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.410> sharp

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
probably going well what what's a sharp

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.670 
probably going well what what's a sharp
what's<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.160> flat<00:00:20.430> why<00:00:21.330> do<00:00:21.420> i<00:00:21.600> why<00:00:22.080> do<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.230> care

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
what's a flat why do i why do I care

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.140 
what's a flat why do i why do I care
first<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.250> all<00:00:23.369> let<00:00:23.519> me<00:00:23.550> say<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:23.880> we're<00:00:24.000> not

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
first of all let me say that we're not

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.519 
first of all let me say that we're not
going<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.330> get<00:00:24.420> into<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.660> ton<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:24.960> music<00:00:25.140> theory

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
going to get into a ton of music theory

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.740 
going to get into a ton of music theory
today<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:26.039> just<00:00:26.699> want<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.910> explain<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.449> very

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
today I just want to explain the very

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.490 
today I just want to explain the very
basics<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:29.130> musical<00:00:29.550> alphabet<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.500> help

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
basics of the musical alphabet and help

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.709 
basics of the musical alphabet and help
you<00:00:31.619> relate<00:00:31.920> those<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.030> guitar<00:00:33.300> neck<00:00:33.450> in<00:00:33.630> a

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
you relate those to the guitar neck in a

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.590 
you relate those to the guitar neck in a
very<00:00:33.870> simple<00:00:34.230> way<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:34.940> first<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.059> all<00:00:36.180> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
very simple way so first of all the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.459 
very simple way so first of all the
musical<00:00:37.020> alphabet<00:00:37.460> ranges<00:00:38.460> from<00:00:38.640> letter<00:00:39.270> A<00:00:39.510> to

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
musical alphabet ranges from letter A to

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.869 
musical alphabet ranges from letter A to
the<00:00:40.559> letter<00:00:40.739> G<00:00:41.040> we<00:00:41.969> don't<00:00:42.210> have<00:00:42.450> any<00:00:42.870> other

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
the letter G we don't have any other

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.299 
the letter G we don't have any other
letter<00:00:44.879> names<00:00:45.180> for<00:00:45.870> notes<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.800> we<00:00:46.920> start<00:00:47.219> with

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
letter names for notes so we start with

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.470 
letter names for notes so we start with
a<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.670> b<00:00:48.600> c<00:00:48.780> d<00:00:49.230> e<00:00:49.620> f<00:00:49.920> g<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.760> then<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.000> just<00:00:51.149> starts

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
a a b c d e f g and then it just starts

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.990 
a a b c d e f g and then it just starts
over<00:00:51.840> again<00:00:51.870> as<00:00:52.230> we<00:00:52.410> go<00:00:52.590> higher<00:00:52.860> or<00:00:52.890> lower<00:00:53.399> when

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
over again as we go higher or lower when

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.750 
over again as we go higher or lower when
we're<00:00:54.180> counting<00:00:54.570> backward<00:00:55.640> meaning<00:00:56.640> we're

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
we're counting backward meaning we're

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.459 
we're counting backward meaning we're
playing<00:00:57.000> lower<00:00:57.210> on<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.510> guitar<00:00:57.809> below<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.289> a

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
playing lower on the guitar below and a

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.590 
playing lower on the guitar below and a
you<00:00:59.190> might<00:00:59.370> see<00:00:59.760> something<00:01:00.000> like<00:01:00.180> b<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:01.050> g<00:01:01.500> f<00:01:02.600> so

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
you might see something like b a g f so

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.299 
you might see something like b a g f so
you<00:01:03.660> just<00:01:04.170> reversed<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.650> order<00:01:04.769> but<00:01:05.189> we've

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
you just reversed the order but we've

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.490 
you just reversed the order but we've
only<00:01:05.400> got<00:01:05.580> those<00:01:06.119> letters<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.140> musical

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
only got those letters in the musical

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.649 
only got those letters in the musical
alphabet<00:01:07.650> we<00:01:08.490> do<00:01:08.670> have<00:01:08.850> other<00:01:09.000> notes<00:01:09.360> though

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
alphabet we do have other notes though

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.000 
alphabet we do have other notes though
sharps<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.770> flats<00:01:11.510> describe<00:01:12.510> other<00:01:12.900> notes<00:01:13.710> in

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
sharps and flats describe other notes in

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.480 
sharps and flats describe other notes in
the<00:01:14.340> musical<00:01:14.700> alphabet<00:01:14.930> for<00:01:15.930> example<00:01:16.490> between

the musical alphabet for example between
a<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.479> B<00:01:19.580> there<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.610> an<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.150> sharp<00:01:21.920> what<00:01:22.920> we<00:01:23.009> were

which<00:01:48.030> we<00:01:48.180> just<00:01:48.420> refer<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.140> as<00:01:49.410> a<00:01:49.560> sharp<00:01:49.860> as<00:01:50.070> a

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
which we just refer to as a sharp as a

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.249 
which we just refer to as a sharp as a
b-flat<00:01:51.770> what<00:01:52.770> we're<00:01:52.920> saying<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.460> here's<00:01:54.060> B<00:01:54.300> on

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
b-flat what we're saying is here's B on

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.710 
b-flat what we're saying is here's B on
the<00:01:55.350> guitar

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
the guitar

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.420 
the guitar
we're<00:01:57.720> simply<00:01:58.080> lowering<00:01:58.500> B<00:01:59.430> one<00:02:00.390> fret<00:02:01.160> if<00:02:02.160> we

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
we're simply lowering B one fret if we

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.650 
we're simply lowering B one fret if we
lower<00:02:02.700> B<00:02:03.000> one<00:02:03.210> fret<00:02:03.479> we<00:02:04.200> call<00:02:04.410> it<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.590> b-flat<00:02:04.979> if

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
lower B one fret we call it a b-flat if

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.979 
lower B one fret we call it a b-flat if
we<00:02:06.660> raise<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:07.259> one<00:02:07.530> fret<00:02:08.270> we<00:02:09.270> call<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.600> an<00:02:09.780> a

we raise a one fret we call it an a

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.110 
we raise a one fret we call it an a
sharp<00:02:10.380> and<00:02:10.640> that<00:02:11.640> is<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.920> very<00:02:13.920> basic<00:02:14.220> way<00:02:14.730> to

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
sharp and that is a very basic way to

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.229 
sharp and that is a very basic way to
look<00:02:15.420> at<00:02:15.630> sharps<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.590> flats<00:02:16.820> it's<00:02:17.820> a<00:02:18.000> note

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
look at sharps and flats it's a note

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.180

must be a sharp well you can call it a

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.900 
must be a sharp well you can call it a
sharp<00:04:48.560> there<00:04:49.560> are<00:04:49.680> two<00:04:49.979> exceptions<00:04:50.460> in<00:04:50.820> the

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
sharp there are two exceptions in the

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.230 
sharp there are two exceptions in the
musical<00:04:51.330> alphabet<00:04:51.919> when<00:04:53.030> referring<00:04:54.030> to

musical alphabet when referring to

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:01.969 
musical alphabet when referring to

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
naming notes between notes E and F and B

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.300 
naming notes between notes E and F and B
and<00:05:02.310> C<00:05:03.320> because<00:05:04.320> of<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:04.560> way<00:05:04.680> the<00:05:04.919> notes<00:05:05.070> have

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
and C because of the way the notes have

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.340 
and C because of the way the notes have
been<00:05:05.460> laid<00:05:05.669> out<00:05:05.699> on<00:05:06.030> a<00:05:06.060> piano<00:05:06.630> and<00:05:06.810> if<00:05:07.110> you<00:05:07.199> go

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
been laid out on a piano and if you go

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.339 
been laid out on a piano and if you go
look<00:05:07.590> at<00:05:07.800> a<00:05:07.830> piano<00:05:08.190> you'll<00:05:08.520> see<00:05:08.729> this<00:05:09.349> between

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 
look at a piano you'll see this between

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:13.870 
look at a piano you'll see this between
those<00:05:10.770> two<00:05:11.039> sets<00:05:11.310> of<00:05:11.430> notes<00:05:11.990> there<00:05:12.990> is<00:05:13.169> no<00:05:13.380> note

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
those two sets of notes there is no note

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.770 
those two sets of notes there is no note
so<00:05:14.880> we<00:05:15.240> say<00:05:16.200> when<00:05:16.500> we<00:05:16.620> go<00:05:16.710> from<00:05:16.860> E<00:05:17.190> to<00:05:17.550> the<00:05:18.510> note

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
so we say when we go from E to the note

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.300 
so we say when we go from E to the note
just<00:05:19.500> one<00:05:19.770> fret<00:05:20.039> higher

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
just one fret higher

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.410 
just one fret higher
we<00:05:21.880> go<00:05:22.030> to<00:05:22.090> F<00:05:23.370> likewise<00:05:24.370> when<00:05:24.700> we<00:05:24.730> are<00:05:24.970> on<00:05:25.120> our<00:05:25.150> B

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
we go to F likewise when we are on our B

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.710 
we go to F likewise when we are on our B
string<00:05:26.520> and<00:05:27.520> we<00:05:27.640> go<00:05:27.760> one<00:05:27.940> fret<00:05:28.210> up<00:05:28.330> we<00:05:28.510> don't<00:05:28.660> go

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
string and we go one fret up we don't go

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.600 
string and we go one fret up we don't go
to<00:05:28.780> be<00:05:28.960> sharp<00:05:29.290> you<00:05:29.770> could<00:05:29.950> call<00:05:30.130> it<00:05:30.250> be<00:05:30.370> sharp

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
to be sharp you could call it be sharp

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.510 
to be sharp you could call it be sharp
in<00:05:30.760> certain<00:05:31.000> situations<00:05:31.540> but<00:05:32.470> it's<00:05:33.100> easiest

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
in certain situations but it's easiest

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.880 
in certain situations but it's easiest
and<00:05:33.820> most<00:05:33.880> normal<00:05:34.840> to<00:05:35.110> call<00:05:35.290> it<00:05:35.500> C<00:05:37.350> okay<00:05:38.350> the

and most normal to call it C okay the

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
and most normal to call it C okay the
rest<00:05:39.130> of<00:05:39.340> these<00:05:39.750> can<00:05:40.750> be<00:05:40.870> referred<00:05:41.230> to<00:05:41.260> as

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
rest of these can be referred to as

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.490 
rest of these can be referred to as
sharps<00:05:42.910> or<00:05:43.270> flats<00:05:43.300> depending<00:05:44.110> on<00:05:44.200> which<00:05:44.350> way

sharps or flats depending on which way

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.910 
sharps or flats depending on which way
you're<00:05:44.620> going

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:44.920 
you're going

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:53.840 
you're going
so<00:05:45.100> we<00:05:45.220> have<00:05:45.370> e<00:05:45.640> to<00:05:46.200> F<00:05:48.360> we<00:05:49.360> have<00:05:49.390> a<00:05:50.430> to<00:05:51.430> a<00:05:51.460> sharp

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
so we have e to F we have a to a sharp

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.920 
so we have e to F we have a to a sharp
to<00:05:54.850> d<00:05:55.000> sharp<00:05:56.760> to<00:05:57.760> G

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
to d sharp to G

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:08.080 
to d sharp to G
then<00:05:59.919> we<00:06:00.040> have<00:06:00.190> B<00:06:00.460> to<00:06:01.300> C<00:06:01.600> and<00:06:04.919> to<00:06:05.919> F

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.140 

all<00:06:08.690> right<00:06:08.840> so<00:06:09.080> you<00:06:09.980> could<00:06:10.190> you<00:06:10.580> could<00:06:10.760> go<00:06:10.910> down

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
all right so you could you could go down

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.240 
all right so you could you could go down
and<00:06:11.540> if<00:06:12.080> you<00:06:12.410> were<00:06:12.500> approaching<00:06:12.950> those<00:06:13.040> notes

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
and if you were approaching those notes

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.820 
and if you were approaching those notes
from<00:06:13.520> from<00:06:13.970> higher<00:06:14.180> on<00:06:14.360> the<00:06:14.450> neck<00:06:14.680> that<00:06:15.680> would

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
from from higher on the neck that would

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.379 
from from higher on the neck that would
be<00:06:15.950> considered<00:06:16.400> a<00:06:16.639> flat<00:06:17.330> here<00:06:18.940> if<00:06:19.940> this<00:06:20.060> is<00:06:20.120> a

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:20.389 
be considered a flat here if this is a

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:22.270 
be considered a flat here if this is a
sharp<00:06:20.690> we<00:06:21.440> know<00:06:21.590> that<00:06:21.770> it<00:06:21.889> could<00:06:22.010> also<00:06:22.160> be

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 
sharp we know that it could also be

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.530 
sharp we know that it could also be
considered<00:06:22.610> B<00:06:22.880> flat<00:06:23.120> so<00:06:23.300> you've<00:06:23.419> already

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:23.540 
considered B flat so you've already

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.050 
considered B flat so you've already
learned<00:06:23.840> another<00:06:24.530> name<00:06:24.800> another<00:06:25.040> note<00:06:25.880> name

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
learned another name another note name

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.550 
learned another name another note name
on<00:06:26.210> the<00:06:26.270> neck<00:06:26.419> you<00:06:26.570> know<00:06:26.690> that<00:06:26.840> second<00:06:27.169> fret<00:06:27.350> a

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 
on the neck you know that second fret a

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:34.020 
on the neck you know that second fret a
string<00:06:27.590> is<00:06:27.980> a<00:06:28.010> B<00:06:28.190> the<00:06:29.120> B<00:06:29.900> flat<00:06:30.200> or<00:06:30.440> a<00:06:30.470> sharp<00:06:30.590> or<00:06:31.040> a

particular note
we're<00:06:50.900> on<00:06:50.990> a<00:06:51.020> we<00:06:51.740> go<00:06:51.889> to<00:06:51.950> a<00:06:52.100> sharp<00:06:52.700> we're<00:06:53.389> on<00:06:53.479> b

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:53.750 
we're on a we go to a sharp we're on b

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.280 
we're on a we go to a sharp we're on b
we<00:06:54.740> go<00:06:54.889> to<00:06:54.950> B<00:06:55.190> flat

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:57.290 
we go to B flat

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:02.570 
we go to B flat
there<00:06:58.290> are<00:06:58.500> no<00:06:58.860> notes<00:06:59.780> in<00:07:00.780> between<00:07:01.740> E<00:07:02.010> and<00:07:02.430> F

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:02.580 
there are no notes in between E and F

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.629 
there are no notes in between E and F
and<00:07:02.820> B<00:07:03.479> and<00:07:03.720> C<00:07:04.050> another<00:07:04.889> way<00:07:05.040> of<00:07:05.160> saying<00:07:05.430> that

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:05.639 
and B and C another way of saying that

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:09.650 
and B and C another way of saying that
is<00:07:05.820> that<00:07:07.160> from<00:07:08.160> E<00:07:08.310> to<00:07:08.340> F<00:07:08.520> and<00:07:08.820> from<00:07:09.090> B<00:07:09.210> to<00:07:09.240> C<00:07:09.479> is<00:07:09.510> a

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:09.660 
is that from E to F and from B to C is a

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.210 
is that from E to F and from B to C is a
half<00:07:09.870> step<00:07:10.020> and<00:07:10.380> not<00:07:10.500> a<00:07:10.560> whole<00:07:10.710> step<00:07:10.949> because

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.220 
half step and not a whole step because

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.790 
half step and not a whole step because
there<00:07:11.460> are<00:07:11.550> no<00:07:11.639> notes<00:07:11.880> in<00:07:12.060> between<00:07:12.620> so<00:07:13.620> I<00:07:13.650> hope

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 
there are no notes in between so I hope

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.500 
there are no notes in between so I hope
this<00:07:13.949> gives<00:07:14.040> you<00:07:14.280> a<00:07:14.310> good<00:07:14.580> start<00:07:15.000> on<00:07:15.180> the
