because<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.240> tank<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.570> massive

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.120 

so<00:01:48.900> this<00:01:49.020> ghulami<00:01:49.290> wants<00:01:49.650> to<00:01:49.740> be<00:01:49.829> in<00:01:49.920> every

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
so this ghulami wants to be in every

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.410 
so this ghulami wants to be in every
shot<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.610> do<00:01:52.729> tanks<00:01:53.729> got<00:01:53.850> very<00:01:54.119> good<00:01:54.180> water

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
shot that I do tanks got very good water

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.090 
shot that I do tanks got very good water
flow<00:01:54.860> it's<00:01:55.860> got<00:01:56.040> lots<00:01:56.220> of<00:01:56.369> oxygen<00:01:57.950> got<00:01:58.950> some

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
flow it's got lots of oxygen got some

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.350 
flow it's got lots of oxygen got some
wonderful<00:01:59.790> fish<00:02:02.869> does<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.020> get<00:02:04.140> very<00:02:04.170> dirty

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
wonderful fish does it get very dirty

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.800 
wonderful fish does it get very dirty
stay<00:02:06.360> never<00:02:07.110> how<00:02:07.740> often<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.039> clean<00:02:08.220> it

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.560 

the<00:02:11.900> water<00:02:12.709> times<00:02:13.010> every

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.970 

so<00:02:16.570> quarter<00:02:16.900> water<00:02:17.080> change<00:02:17.380> every<00:02:17.500> couple<00:02:17.950> of

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
so quarter water change every couple of

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.060 
so quarter water change every couple of
months<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.520> a<00:02:18.750> big<00:02:19.750> clean<00:02:20.020> once<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.410> year<00:02:20.650> and

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
that's the joy of having a tank so big

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.070 
that's the joy of having a tank so big
is<00:02:25.510> it<00:02:25.780> they<00:02:26.020> stay<00:02:26.320> so<00:02:26.680> stable<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:27.990> there's<00:02:28.990> a

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
is it they stay so stable and there's a

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.470 
is it they stay so stable and there's a
lot<00:02:29.350> of<00:02:29.500> very<00:02:29.740> big<00:02:30.010> fish<00:02:30.250> in<00:02:30.430> this<00:02:30.520> tank<00:02:30.580> but

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
lot of very big fish in this tank but

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.440 
lot of very big fish in this tank but
because<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.930> tanks<00:02:32.290> so<00:02:32.500> big<00:02:32.740> it's<00:02:33.700> just

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
because the tanks so big it's just

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.360 
because the tanks so big it's just
supporting<00:02:34.990> that<00:02:35.140> volume<00:02:35.530> of<00:02:35.830> fish<00:02:36.010> without<00:02:36.310> a

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
supporting that volume of fish without a

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.090 
supporting that volume of fish without a
problem<00:02:36.640> in<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:36.970> world<00:02:37.560> you<00:02:38.560> could<00:02:38.770> cut<00:02:38.980> your

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
problem in the world you could cut your

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.890 
problem in the world you could cut your
food<00:02:39.340> down<00:02:39.610> a<00:02:39.640> bit<00:02:39.880> by<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.090> way<00:02:40.180> they're<00:02:40.510> fat

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
food down a bit by the way they're fat

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.640 
food down a bit by the way they're fat
as<00:02:41.080> hell<00:02:42.450> but<00:02:43.450> healthy<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.020> happy<00:02:44.170> that's<00:02:44.470> for

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
as hell but healthy and happy that's for

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.820 
as hell but healthy and happy that's for
sure

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.770 

so<00:02:51.370> all<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.580> filtrations<00:02:52.240> in<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:52.510> bottom

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
so all the filtrations in the bottom

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.960 
so all the filtrations in the bottom
here<00:02:54.750> okay

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.630 

so<00:03:00.930> it's<00:03:01.050> got<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.230> large<00:03:01.470> Sun<00:03:01.800> filter<00:03:02.070> in<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.400> in

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
so it's got a large Sun filter in the in

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.610 
so it's got a large Sun filter in the in
the<00:03:02.790> bottom<00:03:02.910> so<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.840> water<00:03:03.990> comes<00:03:04.260> in<00:03:04.440> goes

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
the bottom so the water comes in goes

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.130 
the bottom so the water comes in goes
past<00:03:04.980> some<00:03:05.220> filter<00:03:05.580> wall<00:03:05.730> goes<00:03:06.630> past<00:03:06.930> some

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
past some filter wall goes past some

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.130 
past some filter wall goes past some
heaters<00:03:07.550> goes<00:03:08.550> past<00:03:08.850> some<00:03:09.120> biological<00:03:09.390> media

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
heaters goes past some biological media

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.540 
heaters goes past some biological media
and<00:03:10.530> then<00:03:11.460> into<00:03:11.670> a<00:03:11.700> massive<00:03:12.180> sump<00:03:13.370> which<00:03:14.370> is

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
and then into a massive sump which is

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.760 
and then into a massive sump which is
literally<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.110> length<00:03:16.110> of<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.350> whole<00:03:16.470> tank

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
literally the length of the whole tank

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:29.490 
literally the length of the whole tank
on<00:03:17.460> almost<00:03:18.450> like<00:03:18.600> that<00:03:18.960> the<00:03:19.080> zinc

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.140 

and<00:03:29.980> these<00:03:30.130> fish<00:03:30.340> will<00:03:30.490> just<00:03:30.700> continue<00:03:30.970> to

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
and these fish will just continue to

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:39.020 
and these fish will just continue to
grow<00:03:31.420> and<00:03:31.600> grow

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.670 

so<00:03:39.570> I<00:03:39.630> think<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.870> star<00:03:40.140> of<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.320> show<00:03:40.350> is<00:03:40.650> the

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
so I think the star of the show is the

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.930 
so I think the star of the show is the
venosus<00:03:41.310> and<00:03:41.960> this<00:03:42.960> big<00:03:43.490> silver<00:03:44.490> shark<00:03:44.730> I

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
venosus and this big silver shark I

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.710 
venosus and this big silver shark I
reckon<00:03:46.940> Saratoga<00:03:47.940> is<00:03:48.090> up<00:03:48.240> there<00:03:48.420> he's<00:03:48.540> pretty

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
reckon Saratoga is up there he's pretty

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:57.410 
reckon Saratoga is up there he's pretty
cool<00:03:48.960> oh<00:03:54.440> there<00:03:55.440> we<00:03:55.500> go<00:03:55.620> got<00:03:55.860> a<00:03:55.890> big<00:03:56.130> miss<00:03:57.000> oboe

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
cool oh there we go got a big miss oboe

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.410 
cool oh there we go got a big miss oboe
too<00:04:01.310> which<00:04:02.310> is<00:04:02.459> quite<00:04:02.700> a<00:04:02.730> rare<00:04:02.940> little<00:04:03.150> fish

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
too which is quite a rare little fish

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.670 
too which is quite a rare little fish
they<00:04:03.600> go<00:04:03.780> at<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:03.959> back<00:04:04.110> there<00:04:06.410> I've<00:04:07.410> got<00:04:07.470> no

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
they go at the back there I've got no

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:25.530 
they go at the back there I've got no
idea<00:04:07.709> how<00:04:08.010> you<00:04:08.070> ended<00:04:08.310> up<00:04:08.400> with<00:04:08.550> that<00:04:08.640> guy

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.700 

on<00:04:26.050> a<00:04:26.200> pulley<00:04:26.500> stigma<00:04:28.200> so<00:04:29.200> you<00:04:29.350> don't<00:04:29.530> see<00:04:29.680> very

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
on a pulley stigma so you don't see very

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:38.999 
on a pulley stigma so you don't see very
often

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:39.009 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.059 

awesome<00:04:39.849> tank
