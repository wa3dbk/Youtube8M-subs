00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.490
 Harry Potter began to grow up 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.490
 Strange changes began to happen in Hogwarts 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.490
 What is Harry? 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.900
 Ah, why do you have this strange stick? 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.490
 Warm coffee, only ah... (mantra) 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.490
 No, this cannot be used. 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.630
 The students at Hogwarts are changing 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.630
 look at me! 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.900
 What is Harry? 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.230
 What happened to me? 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.230
 It is adolescence! Brother! 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.750
 There are menstruation for Lian Miao Li. 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.700
 Let me down! 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.200
 Really angry... 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.660
 just now! 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.740
 This is really outrageous! 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.650
 enough! 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.150
 Harry Potter will find out this summer... 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.150
 How difficult is the life of teenagers in Hogwarts 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.750
 You all know why we are here. 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.750
 We need to know the truth of the rumors! 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.300
 Is Harry Potter big there? 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.300
 Yes! 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.600
 I have seen.. 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.600
 I don't know my Harry! 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.400
 listen... 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.400
 What you just said sounds good, but in fact... 

00:01:06.505 --> 00:01:07.405
 He is just modest 

00:01:07.405 --> 00:01:08.405
 No! Miao Li, I am not... 

00:01:08.905 --> 00:01:10.004
 you are! 

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:14.004
 Is there a small amount of Rongâ€™s that is true? 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.500
 Be prepared to face the threat of adolescence to the magical world 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.500
 Not Harry is going to be like this... 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.500
 Sliding past 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.500
 Sliding over again 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.500
 Sliding over 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.450
 Sliding over again 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.220
 Further to the left 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.220
 Further to the right 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.310
 Then raise your hands up and down... 

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:42.049
 Harry Potter abandoned Hogwarts 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:43.049
 Magical adolescence 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.520
 Coming soon 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.849
 Rong En, I love you... 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:52.000
 Just kidding!
