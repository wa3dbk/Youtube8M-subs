really any car that's modeled on the
lykan<00:01:20.040> Hypersport<00:01:20.070> but<00:01:20.880> I'm<00:01:20.970> going<00:01:21.120> to<00:01:21.180> use

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
lykan Hypersport but I'm going to use

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.820 
lykan Hypersport but I'm going to use
the<00:01:21.360> pegassi<00:01:21.690> zentorno<00:01:21.810> for<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.620> bill

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
the pegassi zentorno for this bill

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.350 
the pegassi zentorno for this bill
because<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.190> think<00:01:23.250> it's<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.550> closest<00:01:24.000> current

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
because I think it's the closest current

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.970 
because I think it's the closest current
terms<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.660> appearance<00:01:25.080> anyway<00:01:25.650> once<00:01:25.860> you've

exhaust<00:01:38.760> and<00:01:39.000> I've<00:01:39.150> selected<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:39.660> twin<00:01:39.900> ball

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.990 
exhaust and I've selected the twin ball
for<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.770> hood<00:01:40.920> I've<00:01:41.070> chosen<00:01:41.310> slippy<00:01:41.730> to<00:01:41.880> give

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
for the hood I've chosen slippy to give

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.060 
for the hood I've chosen slippy to give
us<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.270> nice<00:01:42.450> flat<00:01:42.780> appearance<00:01:43.230> for<00:01:44.010> the

us that nice flat appearance for the

us that nice flat appearance for the
skirts<00:01:44.400> I've<00:01:44.580> selected<00:01:44.730> the<00:01:45.060> streets<00:01:45.360> carbon

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
skirts I've selected the streets carbon

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.420 
skirts I've selected the streets carbon
which<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.560> going<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.830> give<00:01:46.980> us<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.220> nice

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
which is going to give us that nice

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.790 
which is going to give us that nice
black<00:01:47.790> line<00:01:48.090> underneath<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.720> car<00:01:48.960> we're<00:01:49.680> not

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
black line underneath the car we're not

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.110 
black line underneath the car we're not
going<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.010> stick<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.160> spoiler<00:01:50.580> on<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:50.820> car<00:01:51.090> I

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
going to stick a spoiler on this car I

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.610 
going to stick a spoiler on this car I
haven't<00:01:51.450> actually<00:01:51.540> seen<00:01:51.720> any<00:01:52.080> pictures<00:01:52.440> of<00:01:52.560> a

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
haven't actually seen any pictures of a

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.410 
haven't actually seen any pictures of a
lykan<00:01:52.920> Hypersport<00:01:52.950> with<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.670> spoiler<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.180> I

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
lykan Hypersport with a spoiler so I

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.570 
lykan Hypersport with a spoiler so I
don't<00:01:55.110> even<00:01:55.200> know<00:01:55.380> if<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.560> has<00:01:55.740> one<00:01:55.950> for<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
don't even know if it has one for the

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.040 
don't even know if it has one for the
wheel<00:01:56.730> type<00:01:56.970> I've<00:01:57.240> chosen<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.750> cheater

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
wheel type I've chosen the cheater

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.900 
wheel type I've chosen the cheater
carbon<00:01:58.530> arm<00:01:58.800> there<00:01:59.340> isn't<00:01:59.550> anything<00:01:59.700> that

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
carbon arm there isn't anything that

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.100 
carbon arm there isn't anything that
matches<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.300> rims<00:02:00.510> that<00:02:00.630> I've<00:02:00.720> seen<00:02:00.900> on<00:02:01.020> the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
matches the rims that I've seen on the

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.080 
matches the rims that I've seen on the
real-life<00:02:01.410> car<00:02:01.680> all<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.130> much<00:02:02.340> but<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.880> think

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
real-life car all that much but I think

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.580 
real-life car all that much but I think
this<00:02:03.150> is<00:02:03.300> pretty<00:02:03.450> close<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.230> put<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.470> ball

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
this is pretty close and put the ball

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.900 
this is pretty close and put the ball
color<00:02:04.830> we're<00:02:04.980> gonna<00:02:05.070> go<00:02:05.250> with<00:02:05.400> carbon<00:02:05.700> black

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
color we're gonna go with carbon black

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.100 
color we're gonna go with carbon black
for<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.690> window<00:02:06.960> Tim<00:02:07.200> I've<00:02:07.410> put<00:02:07.710> this

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
for the window Tim I've put this

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.570 
for the window Tim I've put this
limo<00:02:08.530> I<00:02:08.710> know<00:02:08.890> this<00:02:09.039> makes<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.369> car<00:02:09.550> more

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
limo I know this makes the car more

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.310 
limo I know this makes the car more
difficult<00:02:10.149> to<00:02:10.240> drive<00:02:10.450> in<00:02:10.630> first-person<00:02:11.290> mode

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
difficult to drive in first-person mode

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.500 
difficult to drive in first-person mode
but<00:02:11.710> it<00:02:11.830> does<00:02:12.010> match<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.550> super<00:02:12.880> black<00:02:13.120> window

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
but it does match the super black window

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.360 
but it does match the super black window
tinters<00:02:13.870> found<00:02:14.140> in<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.320> movie<00:02:14.560> but<00:02:15.250> the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
tinters found in the movie but the

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.770 
tinters found in the movie but the
chassis<00:02:15.580> I'm<00:02:15.850> actually<00:02:15.970> gonna<00:02:16.210> leave<00:02:16.330> this<00:02:16.570> is

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
chassis I'm actually gonna leave this is

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.570 
chassis I'm actually gonna leave this is
stock<00:02:17.170> because<00:02:17.530> it<00:02:17.650> makes<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:17.980> side<00:02:18.250> blades

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
stock because it makes the side blades

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.220 
stock because it makes the side blades
black<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:19.270> this<00:02:19.360> is<00:02:19.480> very<00:02:19.630> important<00:02:20.110> I<00:02:20.170> think

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
black and this is very important I think

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.470 
black and this is very important I think
now<00:02:21.010> for<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.340> primary<00:02:21.670> color<00:02:21.880> I've<00:02:22.120> gone<00:02:22.240> for

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
now for the primary color I've gone for

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.210 
now for the primary color I've gone for
red<00:02:22.660> which<00:02:22.870> is<00:02:23.050> listed<00:02:23.230> under<00:02:23.470> classic<00:02:24.040> and

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
red which is listed under classic and

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.950 
red which is listed under classic and
for<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.640> secondary<00:02:25.000> color<00:02:25.270> I've<00:02:25.450> also<00:02:25.660> chosen

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
for the secondary color I've also chosen

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.110 
for the secondary color I've also chosen
the<00:02:26.170> same<00:02:26.380> red<00:02:26.620> we're<00:02:27.340> gonna<00:02:27.460> cut<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.820> springs

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
the same red we're gonna cut the springs

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.280 
the same red we're gonna cut the springs
and<00:02:28.330> drop<00:02:28.450> this<00:02:28.570> thing<00:02:28.750> as<00:02:28.870> low<00:02:29.050> to<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.200> ground

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
and drop this thing as low to the ground

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.840 
and drop this thing as low to the ground
as<00:02:29.560> we<00:02:29.710> can<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.190> with<00:02:30.580> all<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.820> other

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
as we can and with all the other

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.280 
as we can and with all the other
performance<00:02:31.420> upgrades<00:02:31.750> we're<00:02:31.900> gonna<00:02:31.990> max

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
performance upgrades we're gonna max

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.720 
performance upgrades we're gonna max
these<00:02:32.470> out<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:32.830> make<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.070> car<00:02:33.220> as<00:02:33.340> fast<00:02:33.490> as

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
these out to make the car as fast as

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.480 
these out to make the car as fast as
possible<00:02:34.209> now<00:02:35.170> obviously<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.680> zentorno<00:02:35.920> is

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
possible now obviously the zentorno is

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.430 
possible now obviously the zentorno is
modeled<00:02:36.880> on<00:02:37.000> a<00:02:37.060> Lamborghini<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:37.930> I'm<00:02:38.290> not

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
modeled on a Lamborghini and I'm not

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.930 
modeled on a Lamborghini and I'm not
gonna<00:02:38.560> get<00:02:38.740> into<00:02:38.980> an<00:02:39.100> argument<00:02:39.310> over<00:02:39.670> which

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
gonna get into an argument over which

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.790 
gonna get into an argument over which
car<00:02:40.209> this<00:02:40.360> is<00:02:40.480> supposed<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:40.930> be<00:02:41.020> but<00:02:41.500> I<00:02:41.560> think

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
car this is supposed to be but I think

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.050 
car this is supposed to be but I think
with<00:02:41.920> this<00:02:42.040> build<00:02:42.280> this<00:02:42.400> is<00:02:42.580> as<00:02:42.670> close<00:02:42.880> as

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
with this build this is as close as

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.040 
with this build this is as close as
you're<00:02:43.209> gonna<00:02:43.270> get<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.630> a<00:02:43.660> lykan<00:02:44.020> Hypersport

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
you're gonna get to a lykan Hypersport

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.770 
you're gonna get to a lykan Hypersport
