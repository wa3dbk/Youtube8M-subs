 heroes with the audience this technique 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.879

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:16.479
 most interesting for a child before he 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.710
 can not only look but make 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.780

 initial base of Kazakh language 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.990
 when you do animation there and 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.820
 life is completely new 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.159
