00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
neatly stored into the ends of each side

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.859 
neatly stored into the ends of each side
you'll<00:01:14.400> then<00:01:14.580> want<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.880> adjust<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.390> pads<00:01:15.659> and

that to your own and then tighten each

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.510 
that to your own and then tighten each
pad<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:27.000> each<00:01:27.210> symbol<00:01:28.130> so<00:01:29.130> I'm<00:01:29.220> going<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.400> show

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
pad and each symbol so I'm going to show

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.880 
pad and each symbol so I'm going to show
you<00:01:29.549> how<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.729> do<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.060> now<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.390> very<00:01:30.659> simple

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
you how to do that now it's very simple

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.920 
you how to do that now it's very simple
you<00:01:31.890> have<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.310> simple<00:01:32.909> wingnut<00:01:33.360> adjustment

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
you have a simple wingnut adjustment

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.140 
you have a simple wingnut adjustment
here<00:01:34.229> you'll<00:01:35.159> want<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.430> then<00:01:35.640> extend<00:01:35.909> the

here you'll want to then extend the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.569 
here you'll want to then extend the
height<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.600> symbol<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.200> then<00:01:38.130> tighten

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
height of the symbol and then tighten

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.270 
height of the symbol and then tighten
and<00:01:39.020> you'll<00:01:40.020> do<00:01:40.140> exactly<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.650> same<00:01:40.680> on<00:01:41.100> the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
pad you'll loosen the wingnut adjust the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.300 
pad you'll loosen the wingnut adjust the
pad<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.579> then<00:01:45.149> time

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.399

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
you'll then want to do the same with the

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.020 
you'll then want to do the same with the
module<00:01:50.740> which<00:01:50.860> is<00:01:51.040> exactly<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.670> same<00:01:51.700> as

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
module which is exactly the same as

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.000 
module which is exactly the same as
you've<00:01:52.150> done<00:01:52.330> on<00:01:52.570> the<00:01:52.810> pads<00:01:53.049> you'll<00:01:53.860> just

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
you've done on the pads you'll just

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.130 
you've done on the pads you'll just

itself and tighten each clamp the next

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.660 
itself and tighten each clamp the next
stage<00:02:24.970> is<00:02:25.269> to<00:02:25.330> connect<00:02:25.989> the<00:02:26.350> snake<00:02:26.890> which<00:02:27.400> is

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
stage is to connect the snake which is

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.210 
stage is to connect the snake which is
handli<00:02:28.180> attached<00:02:28.780> to<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.320> stand<00:02:29.560> itself<00:02:29.920> out

of the box via velcro straps if you'll

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.890 
of the box via velcro straps if you'll
just<00:02:33.160> simply<00:02:33.370> plug<00:02:33.730> that<00:02:33.910> in<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.239> use<00:02:34.720> the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
just simply plug that in and use the

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.530 
just simply plug that in and use the
screws<00:02:35.200> provided<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:36.250> tighten<00:02:36.550> that<00:02:36.640> up<00:02:39.540> and
