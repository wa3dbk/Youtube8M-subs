00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:57.479
 I see I do not quickly remember that does not care about the money money money money 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:02.639
 as a child i found a decision to get the hang of osn 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.369
 well what a split 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:10.579
 he looks more 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.609
 You see after three times I already have a quarter triathlon is still could turn 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.739
 this sounds like it was with the bus 

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:21.349
 but i can't get it 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:24.349
 I have 13,000 

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:28.859
 in ciwidey it is the turn of a crisis cell i get once 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.889
 that you naturally look out 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.889
 do you have fun 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.069

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.249
 if the weather is not good 

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:46.439
 got mikati and you can keep doing that 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:50.400
 and in the end we see that you yourself have done well with sita in never 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.019
 more the same 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.409
 I would have had a typical media 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:57.899
 and not us seriously 

00:03:57.899 --> 00:04:00.899
 for once so then we say of course 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:02.809
 not in a long time 

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:05.239
 and then we see yes me here 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.349
 j down the books 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:08.749
 do you want 

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:11.819
 seems simple to say you are shocked 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.049
 Of course a total is very complex so the SCP shows nothing 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.229
 less where the holes and some other people 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.129
 very unfortunate this tough toddler 

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:25.550
 because hey there are very much more the rest too 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.509
 also the attention 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:27.559
 and alone 

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:29.190
 all kinds of personal 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.669
 not with people 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.440
 together
