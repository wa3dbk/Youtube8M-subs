do<00:01:37.860> make<00:01:38.009> mistakes<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.600> fact<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.049> did

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
do make mistakes and the fact that I did

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.620 
do make mistakes and the fact that I did
actually<00:01:40.470> fall<00:01:40.860> it's<00:01:41.670> not<00:01:41.880> deniable<00:01:42.270> fact<00:01:42.479> I

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
actually fall it's not deniable fact I

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.539 
actually fall it's not deniable fact I
have<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.110> accept<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.470> perhaps<00:01:43.649> but<00:01:44.340> having

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
have to accept it perhaps but having

have to accept it perhaps but having
said<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:44.970> think<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.530> people<00:01:46.530> don't<00:01:46.829> want

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
said this I think that people don't want

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.200 
said this I think that people don't want
to<00:01:47.369> fail<00:01:47.579> people<00:01:47.850> don't<00:01:48.119> want<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.420> fall<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:50.210> so

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
to fail people don't want to fall and so

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.480 
to fail people don't want to fall and so
my<00:01:51.540> first<00:01:51.720> reaction<00:01:51.960> was<00:01:52.290> isn't<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.100> not

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
my first reaction was isn't that not

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.280 
my first reaction was isn't that not
really<00:01:53.729> exactly<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.420> thing<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.750> he<00:01:55.259> should

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
really exactly the thing that he should

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.230 
really exactly the thing that he should
have<00:01:55.740> said<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.189> isn't<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.670> little<00:01:56.820> different

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
have said it isn't it a little different

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.010 
have said it isn't it a little different
from<00:01:57.659> what<00:01:57.750> should<00:01:57.990> be<00:01:58.110> said<00:01:59.090> so<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:00.899> the

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
from what should be said so that is the

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.709 
from what should be said so that is the
