00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
this clay into some chunks wrap it in a

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.240 
this clay into some chunks wrap it in a
wet<00:00:56.879> t-shirt<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:58.019> put<00:00:58.650> it<00:00:58.739> back<00:00:58.830> in<00:00:59.040> the<00:00:59.100> bag

and<00:00:59.550> tie<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.760> up<00:00:59.909> really<00:01:00.180> tight<00:01:00.390> now<00:01:01.080> for<00:01:01.470> this

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
and tie it up really tight now for this

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.649 
and tie it up really tight now for this
clay<00:01:02.040> here<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.610> anticipate<00:01:03.269> it's<00:01:03.420> going<00:01:03.479> to

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
clay here I anticipate it's going to

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:06.380 
clay here I anticipate it's going to
take<00:01:03.839> about<00:01:04.080> three<00:01:04.710> days<00:01:04.920> for<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.460> water<00:01:06.240> to

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
take about three days for this water to

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.450 
take about three days for this water to
absorb<00:01:06.840> into<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.350> clay<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.890> for<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.190> to<00:01:08.310> get

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
absorb into the clay and for it to get

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.440 
absorb into the clay and for it to get
to<00:01:08.760> about<00:01:09.690> the<00:01:10.020> right<00:01:10.290> consistency<00:01:10.590> for<00:01:11.490> what

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
to about the right consistency for what

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.810

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
more plastic so we need to cut this clay

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:27.670 
more plastic so we need to cut this clay
into<00:02:14.990> some<00:02:15.170> chunks<00:02:25.780> now<00:02:26.780> you<00:02:26.840> see<00:02:27.080> I<00:02:27.110> tried<00:02:27.530> to

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
into some chunks now you see I tried to

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.920 
into some chunks now you see I tried to
use<00:02:27.830> this<00:02:28.040> but<00:02:28.280> this<00:02:28.430> was<00:02:28.580> just<00:02:28.610> way<00:02:29.450> too<00:02:29.480> hard

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
use this but this was just way too hard

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:40.540 
use this but this was just way too hard
to<00:02:30.020> deal<00:02:30.230> with<00:02:38.800> one<00:02:39.800> thing<00:02:39.830> to<00:02:40.160> think<00:02:40.280> about

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
to deal with one thing to think about

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.699 
to deal with one thing to think about
when<00:02:40.700> you're<00:02:40.820> making<00:02:40.970> these<00:02:41.150> chunks<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:42.500> more

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
when you're making these chunks the more

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.350 
when you're making these chunks the more
surface<00:02:43.250> area<00:02:43.490> that<00:02:43.730> comes<00:02:44.060> into<00:02:44.270> contact

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
surface area that comes into contact

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.250 
surface area that comes into contact
with<00:02:45.140> that<00:02:45.650> wet<00:02:45.860> t-shirt<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:47.510> more<00:02:47.720> evenly

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
with that wet t-shirt the more evenly

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.530 
with that wet t-shirt the more evenly
the<00:02:48.920> moisture<00:02:49.310> is<00:02:49.430> going<00:02:49.520> to<00:02:49.610> get<00:02:49.760> into<00:02:50.060> clay

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
the moisture is going to get into clay

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.070 
the moisture is going to get into clay
and<00:02:51.550> to<00:02:52.550> some<00:02:53.090> degree<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.540> less<00:02:53.720> time<00:02:54.020> that

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
and to some degree the less time that

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.270 
and to some degree the less time that
you're<00:02:54.410> going<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.620> need<00:02:54.709> to<00:02:54.800> leave<00:02:54.920> it<00:02:55.040> in<00:02:55.160> the

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
you're going to need to leave it in the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.190 
you're going to need to leave it in the
bag<00:02:56.260> rehydrating<00:02:58.090> will<00:02:59.090> consider<00:02:59.540> that<00:02:59.810> and

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
bag rehydrating will consider that and

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
bag rehydrating will consider that and
then<00:03:00.700> afterwards<00:03:01.700> you<00:03:02.620> are<00:03:03.620> going<00:03:03.800> to<00:03:03.890> need<00:03:04.010> to

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
then afterwards you are going to need to

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.830 
then afterwards you are going to need to
wedge<00:03:04.490> this<00:03:04.850> quite<00:03:05.270> a<00:03:05.300> bit

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
wedge this quite a bit

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.479 
wedge this quite a bit
once<00:03:06.770> it<00:03:07.070> is<00:03:07.130> rehydrated<00:03:08.120> to<00:03:09.070> get<00:03:10.070> it<00:03:10.190> even

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
once it is rehydrated to get it even

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.430 
once it is rehydrated to get it even
because<00:03:10.760> it<00:03:10.790> will<00:03:10.970> be<00:03:11.030> more<00:03:11.630> wet<00:03:11.930> on<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.260> outer

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
because it will be more wet on the outer

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.430 
because it will be more wet on the outer
surfaces<00:03:13.070> than<00:03:13.400> on<00:03:13.550> the<00:03:13.700> inside<00:03:14.239> so<00:03:15.080> you'll

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
surfaces than on the inside so you'll

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.560 
surfaces than on the inside so you'll
want<00:03:15.680> to<00:03:15.709> wedge<00:03:15.860> it<00:03:16.010> up<00:03:16.130> really<00:03:16.400> well<00:03:16.790> so<00:03:17.239> you

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
want to wedge it up really well so you

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.320 
want to wedge it up really well so you
could<00:03:18.170> think<00:03:18.350> about<00:03:18.910> cutting<00:03:19.910> this<00:03:20.030> into

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
could think about cutting this into

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:32.030 
could think about cutting this into
chunks<00:03:20.600> of<00:03:20.930> a<00:03:21.739> convenient<00:03:22.220> size<00:03:22.459> to<00:03:22.850> wedge

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.899 

you

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:34.909 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:39.020 

okay<00:03:35.909> I'm<00:03:36.150> going<00:03:36.239> to<00:03:36.329> go<00:03:36.540> with<00:03:37.049> this<00:03:37.639> so<00:03:38.639> what

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030

days<00:05:38.259> so<00:05:39.069> you'll<00:05:39.280> want<00:05:39.460> to<00:05:39.520> check<00:05:39.729> on<00:05:39.909> this

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
days so you'll want to check on this

days so you'll want to check on this
like<00:05:41.470> I<00:05:41.650> said<00:05:41.680> you'll<00:05:42.550> have<00:05:42.610> to<00:05:42.759> do<00:05:42.909> a<00:05:42.940> little

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
like I said you'll have to do a little

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.110 
like I said you'll have to do a little
bit<00:05:43.270> of<00:05:43.300> trial<00:05:43.629> and<00:05:43.810> error<00:05:44.370> to<00:05:45.370> see<00:05:45.580> how<00:05:45.789> long

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
bit of trial and error to see how long

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.710 
bit of trial and error to see how long
you<00:05:46.539> want<00:05:46.750> to<00:05:46.810> leave<00:05:46.960> it<00:05:47.110> in<00:05:48.240> wrapped<00:05:49.240> in<00:05:49.449> the

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
wet fabric to get it to the right

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.520 
wet fabric to get it to the right
consistency<00:05:51.879> for<00:05:52.300> where<00:05:52.659> you<00:05:52.810> want<00:05:53.020> to<00:05:53.110> use<00:05:53.289> it

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.330 
consistency for where you want to use it
but<00:05:54.370> you<00:05:54.699> can<00:05:55.360> tell<00:05:55.509> pretty<00:05:55.750> easily<00:05:56.050> just<00:05:56.500> with

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.340 
but you can tell pretty easily just with

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.149 
but you can tell pretty easily just with
checking<00:05:57.610> on<00:05:57.879> it<00:05:58.060> say<00:05:58.360> once<00:05:58.599> a<00:05:58.720> day<00:05:58.870> and<00:05:59.159> this

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:00.159 
checking on it say once a day and this

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:01.800 
checking on it say once a day and this
one<00:06:00.430> I<00:06:00.699> anticipate<00:06:01.270> it's<00:06:01.419> going<00:06:01.479> to<00:06:01.659> take

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
one I anticipate it's going to take

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.850 
one I anticipate it's going to take
three<00:06:02.710> to<00:06:02.740> four<00:06:03.099> days<00:06:04.289> but<00:06:05.289> that's<00:06:05.530> basically

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
three to four days but that's basically

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.730 
three to four days but that's basically
yet<00:06:06.310> once<00:06:06.610> you<00:06:06.759> take<00:06:06.970> it<00:06:07.120> out<00:06:07.289> you<00:06:08.289> will<00:06:08.500> want

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
yet once you take it out you will want

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.860 
yet once you take it out you will want
to<00:06:08.860> wedge<00:06:09.759> it<00:06:10.030> really<00:06:10.419> well<00:06:10.630> and<00:06:12.690> don't<00:06:13.690> be

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
to wedge it really well and don't be

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.050 
to wedge it really well and don't be
afraid<00:06:14.139> to<00:06:14.319> add<00:06:14.470> a<00:06:14.500> little<00:06:14.889> bit<00:06:15.009> more<00:06:15.099> water<00:06:15.639> to

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
afraid to add a little bit more water to

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.960 
afraid to add a little bit more water to
it<00:06:16.090> as<00:06:16.900> the<00:06:17.259> days<00:06:17.409> go<00:06:17.680> by<00:06:17.710> just<00:06:18.250> pour<00:06:18.699> it<00:06:18.789> in<00:06:18.849> the

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:18.970 
it as the days go by just pour it in the

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.689 
it as the days go by just pour it in the
bag<00:06:19.150> and<00:06:19.449> it'll<00:06:20.440> absorb<00:06:20.620> throughout<00:06:21.550> the

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:21.699 
bag and it'll absorb throughout the

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:25.649 
bag and it'll absorb throughout the
fabric<00:06:22.150> and<00:06:22.560> you<00:06:23.560> know<00:06:23.919> wick<00:06:24.219> and<00:06:24.550> get<00:06:25.449> into

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:25.659 
fabric and you know wick and get into

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:28.050 
fabric and you know wick and get into
contact<00:06:26.050> with<00:06:26.229> your<00:06:26.349> clay<00:06:26.620> so<00:06:27.310> hopefully<00:06:27.879> this

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060 
contact with your clay so hopefully this

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.490 
contact with your clay so hopefully this
will<00:06:28.150> help<00:06:28.210> you<00:06:28.449> there<00:06:29.139> are<00:06:29.229> lots<00:06:29.379> of

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
will help you there are lots of

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.350 
will help you there are lots of
different<00:06:29.770> ways<00:06:29.800> rehydrate<00:06:30.520> clay<00:06:30.729> of<00:06:31.120> course

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
different ways rehydrate clay of course

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.930 
different ways rehydrate clay of course
you<00:06:31.479> could<00:06:31.659> slack<00:06:32.590> it<00:06:32.830> down<00:06:33.219> into<00:06:33.580> some<00:06:33.759> water

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
you could slack it down into some water

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.540 
you could slack it down into some water
and<00:06:34.419> kind<00:06:35.229> of<00:06:35.349> completely<00:06:35.710> liquefy<00:06:36.250> it<00:06:36.280> and

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
and kind of completely liquefy it and

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.020 
and kind of completely liquefy it and
then<00:06:36.639> dry<00:06:36.849> it<00:06:36.880> out<00:06:37.030> on<00:06:37.270> plaster<00:06:37.780> and<00:06:38.139> then

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030 
then dry it out on plaster and then

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.089 
then dry it out on plaster and then
reconstitute<00:06:40.030> it<00:06:40.150> by<00:06:40.300> wedging<00:06:40.719> the<00:06:41.440> log<00:06:41.740> of

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:42.099 
reconstitute it by wedging the log of

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:44.730 
reconstitute it by wedging the log of
work<00:06:42.389> to<00:06:43.389> me<00:06:43.509> this<00:06:43.870> is<00:06:44.020> an<00:06:44.139> easier<00:06:44.469> approach

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:44.740 
work to me this is an easier approach

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.719 
work to me this is an easier approach
and<00:06:46.229> obviously<00:06:47.229> if<00:06:47.590> you<00:06:47.710> have<00:06:47.830> a<00:06:47.860> pug<00:06:48.159> mill<00:06:48.400> and

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:48.729 
and obviously if you have a pug mill and

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:50.519 
and obviously if you have a pug mill and
you<00:06:49.210> can<00:06:49.360> rehydrate<00:06:49.659> it<00:06:50.020> that<00:06:50.169> way

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:50.529 
you can rehydrate it that way

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:54.059 
you can rehydrate it that way
that's<00:06:51.250> a<00:06:51.580> really<00:06:51.909> great<00:06:52.509> approach<00:06:52.930> but<00:06:53.469> hope

00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:54.069 
that's a really great approach but hope

00:06:54.069 --> 00:06:55.890 
that's a really great approach but hope
