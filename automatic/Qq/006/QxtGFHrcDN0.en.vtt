Ichiko<00:05:17.419> okay<00:05:18.419> so<00:05:18.479> this<00:05:19.050> is<00:05:19.290> a<00:05:19.320> cutting<00:05:19.620> machine

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
Ichiko okay so this is a cutting machine

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.650 
Ichiko okay so this is a cutting machine
actually<00:05:20.850> the<00:05:21.470> designs<00:05:22.470> for<00:05:22.830> the<00:05:22.890> cuts<00:05:23.190> are

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
actually the designs for the cuts are

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.110 
actually the designs for the cuts are
loaded<00:05:24.660> into<00:05:24.960> a<00:05:25.140> computer<00:05:25.530> and<00:05:25.830> then<00:05:26.760> those

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
loaded into a computer and then those

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.760 
loaded into a computer and then those
different<00:05:27.479> cuts<00:05:27.720> there<00:05:27.990> could<00:05:28.169> be<00:05:28.200> many

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
different cuts there could be many

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.800 
different cuts there could be many
different<00:05:28.890> types<00:05:29.550> of<00:05:29.700> cuts<00:05:29.970> are<00:05:30.540> then

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
different types of cuts are then

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.290 
different types of cuts are then
activated<00:05:31.169> and<00:05:31.979> the<00:05:32.430> Machine<00:05:32.790> goes<00:05:33.030> out<00:05:33.210> and

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
activated and the Machine goes out and

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.200 
activated and the Machine goes out and
actually<00:05:33.450> cuts<00:05:33.810> the<00:05:33.960> metal<00:05:34.350> or<00:05:34.680> the<00:05:34.740> steel<00:05:35.210> so

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
actually cuts the metal or the steel so

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.810 
actually cuts the metal or the steel so
this<00:05:36.600> is<00:05:37.640> actually

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
this is actually

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.200 
this is actually
sanding<00:05:40.690> down<00:05:40.870> the<00:05:41.140> sides<00:05:41.380> or<00:05:42.090> shaving<00:05:43.090> down

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
sanding down the sides or shaving down

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.870 
sanding down the sides or shaving down
the<00:05:43.450> sides<00:05:43.720> of<00:05:44.140> this<00:05:44.890> particular<00:05:45.400> piece<00:05:45.580> to

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
the sides of this particular piece to

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.400 
the sides of this particular piece to
make<00:05:45.970> it<00:05:46.150> smoother<00:05:46.540> is<00:05:46.690> that<00:05:46.840> correct

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
make it smoother is that correct
