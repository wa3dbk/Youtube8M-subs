00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.920
 hello what data but are very good 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.929
 eating the video well today we are going to open 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.490
 a new attack with a is pigs already 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:18.820
 I've seen that they liked the previous 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.699
 so I decide to do another one this time 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.260
 let's take the same army here what 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.550
 can see 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.439
 let's finish the queen because more 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.260
 in the castle I will not take anything to see what 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.650
 so it goes to me that there was 400 healing and 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.350
 Rage 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.420
 and then nothing we are going to make a revenge 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.660
 since they have attacked me of this same 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.000
 way and I'm going to come back here that you see 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.780
 that is being attacked but really 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.780
 not here again 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.760
 the village 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.250
 it's pretty strong it only has the queen 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.300
 wake up so let's get it out let's go 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.300
 to take it to these constructions 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.110
 ok let's try to also take out the 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.370
 clan castle with pig spots 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.880
 here you can see that the queen was 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:11.520
 distracts and here and it comes out completely 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.770
 we are going to launch another so that they can see that 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.950
 it was complete outside and we're going to call 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.689
 all here are all the magicians 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.939
 and the weird together so they go 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.789
 destroying everyone 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:25.350
 all these archers and when you want to reign 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:28.020
 my queen is behind so that 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.300
 also go helping them destroy 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.420
 these little arcs that are left here 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.250
 and once we got rid of this 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.560
 let's go through this part 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.440
 we released two rows of pigs 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.420
 so that each one goes to different 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.490
 parts for example an onion towards the 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.470
 left electricity right here it 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.870
 are going to the center and pal 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.690
 rage something that not of that nation to 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.520
 that are cleaning this area and stay 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.310
 cleared for kings and henchmen 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.979
 and nothing to see here as we go down life 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.360
 my pigs ride on the left 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.850
 so I've decided to throw another joke 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.790
 of healing here will happen again 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.970
 pigs and healing are going to go 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.190
 few defenses and kings just like 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.230
 the sighs that I am letting go will go 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.970
 destroying everything little by little see the 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.980
 three fall fast like this 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.459
 tower of archers 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.409
 here some of my mountain pigs are going 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.180
 flying but nothing more want 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:29.290
 destroy what warehouses are 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.390
 some constructions and the town hall 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.670
 basically the village is destroyed at 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.560
 100 since you see the time and the amount to 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.290
 ports are very fast destroying 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.900
 constructions see the stores that 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.180
 they have enough life and as they are several 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.970
 destroying the van is very quick to 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.590
 just like the city council here they go 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.739
 towards the town hall and ready 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.349
 the queen gets stuck the king and a 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.269
 full turn and I do not know why of a 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:59.660
 full turn and also the sighs 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:02.709
 they are helping a little and quickly 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.709
 does 100% 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:10.319
 ok ok see that the village was not so 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.629
 weak I have removed 51 drinks since it was 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.110
 a revenge and had not done to me 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:19.410
 also 100% and I'll return it to 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.910
 see the repetition so we can see that in 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.739
 this case I have not failed 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.349
 I think that nothing has thrown very well 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.800
 spells and pulling the troops out of 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.860
 castle maybe yes 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.780
 in the castle there would be magicians if 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.620
 they are a bit more difficult but I do not think 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:39.350
 so much here also lacked the barbarian king 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.660
 to make it a bit more complicated here 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.330
 see how the troops are taken out of 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.560
 castle with some pigs 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.450
 publishing them come the defenses for 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.160
 little by little, the 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.680
 castle and enter the range both 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.170
 because the barbarians to distract 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.150
 to the queen and the archers while the 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.490
 magicians with their splash attack were 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.120
 destroying them all but in this 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:04.970
 case the queen destroyed me all and see 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.150
 my archer queen starts shooting 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:11.000
 the surplus bows and the senator who 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.830
 it was not very good to defend here 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.560
 I remember throwing pigs 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.390
 and little by little they leave as I expected 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.220
 that left one social to the left and 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.740
 others to the right 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.740
 benach and that they went towards the center 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.870
 that yes I did not expect it but that beyond 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.040
 I clean here all see the mountains 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.320
 pigs on the right and on the left 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.510
 they are cleaning the area little by little and go 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.570
 activating the traps so that after 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.670
 my kings go destroying everything here 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.590
 these two wizard towers 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.290
 I had lost enough life my saint 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.450
 pigs and if they did not cast that spell 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.190
 had already lost that the amounts 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.000
 pigs on the right would not have been 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:53.070
 enough I'm jumping the minions 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.200
 behind the constructions so that the 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.260
 go destroying here good in some 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.180
 of my pigs and ready 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.630
 they only have to destroy buildings and 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.850
 take me all the resources this tactic 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.540
 I know how to use it well I hope that you 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:11.640
 let's see how I finally handle it 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:15.320
 that you liked it and see you the 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.320
 next video bay
