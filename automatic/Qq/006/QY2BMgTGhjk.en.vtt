00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.000

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.899

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.390
 let 1500 I'm happy it's word 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:33.130
 next review with more happiness 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.539
 even if I will do it immediately for friends among the 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.149
 feet must leave anyway we pass 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:40.090
 immediately the decision is the mod 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.739
 ok this is the most beautiful fad here 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.840
 I have ever seen after the bike I have 

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:44.979
 made me modestly put me guys 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.539
 but slowly among other things we have 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.270
 reached 3000 returned in that 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:52.929
 residential but no comment is the boys 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.700
 I read fashions that is I read it on a 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:56.500
 cubed world 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.410
 ok you say it doesn't make sense that it's here 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.520
 meanwhile, the great arts artist 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:06.009
 krommer expresses in a work of art 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.179
 modern in the construction of a castle 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.560
 to fuck up I put it there 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.209
 half an hour because I wanted to build a 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.400
 castle said no boys too 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.879
 meanwhile the sun is setting then 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.580
 times to one bella 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:20.410
 ok look how nice then this one 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.750
 sometimes it adds a few things but 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.459
 meanwhile we start with the ces 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.260
 basic and meanwhile we have here the 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.280
 emeralds but there is a because we lose the 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.280
 emeralds 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.800
 then we have these blocks blocks 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.510
 predefined we will tell you how I do 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.019
 get the building blocks 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.510
 just go here take them though using 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.840
 this billund hoarder forum 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.510
 bob we click the button we put ourselves 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.849
 like here look at the site that cool 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.069
 guys, wait for the site video so then 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:54.849
 put the tempa wso of interest 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.790
 so the lidi sid ok this is yes 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:00.489
 of the boys if you are interested I copy 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.019
 ok said hello guys well us pressing 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.560
 with the right button we can order 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.329
 different pack Default pack-colored 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.970
 what you have seen them there and then we 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.379
 there are many other obviously 10 emeralds 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.019
 all of these and we take of course 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:16.450
 what he called play order 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.099
 we have now ordered and between 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.459
 a few seconds should fall 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:23.680
 chest doesn't do us much anyway 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.209
 we remove them waiting for the ces that then 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.980
 I don't even know where it will fall in this but 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.290
 may be the corpse in the sea, okay 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.909
 does nothing we take the blocks from here 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.849
 construction we take to not everyone 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:36.129
 blacks that suck then the black toner 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:38.260
 berdych for with then to exploit themselves 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:41.079
 forms because rightly I am pro ok 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.579
 guys this mode and not kraft I think 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.019
 but I ab crafting them as always 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.209
 they put fashions because I'm a 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:49.030
 cool fucking and new studies and fashions 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.230
 then you are hacked against crafting then 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.769
 you have to do worse things for 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.299
 get 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.970
 look in a diamond block how much 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:57.790
 there is space to put the 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.500
 we read so we can do the 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.840
 perimeter for example, correctly I 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.760
 I'm wrong right away the fantastic shape 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.650
 I said the perimeter of different colors 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.459
 typology we can make hypotheses 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:13.090
 even guys ok then we do so 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.010
 pressing shift is blind they are a must but 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.949
 down 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.180
 ok guys not great I don't want to do 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:20.910
 what is square I read why 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.889
 they will really fire me there is a job 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.699
 I do n't know what they place I said one 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:28.800
 crap but as always close ok I'm not 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.699
 saying minchiate still enough I have to 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.740
 stop girls 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:34.110
 look at what a cool way stop when 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.680
 I read everywhere except where I owe them 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.030
 placing ok is as you can see 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.010
 do a lot of things then there are 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.539
 lots of forms 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.090
 then we can travel neither one above 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:49.199
 the other so valued and we can create 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.539
 a fantastic a fantastic expected on 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.949
 king of May 20th 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:55.250
 this is a per se we can 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.250
 to pray 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.780
 maybe we do a better thing than me 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.370
 I 'm ready to fuck at this point 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.710
 we do things right 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:08.610
 if we have to do a process where here it is 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:10.740
 here ice we do things well laga 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.199
 here now you can also pray 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.090
 the ice so we pray together the 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:17.340
 ice however was made of blue and 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.840
 we do the upper part of hard 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.620
 fantastic blue look at that beautiful 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:25.889
 this one had been preserved 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.780
 in our hearts and we always remember 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.210
 to be nice I like so you do 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.770
 he will understand the ice you hold him for 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.050
 he is happy when you look good here 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.539
 we want the blue coach and he is a cross 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.099
 very well ok said hello guys here it is 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:41.250
 our order which by the way is 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:43.320
 arrived and I gave only now and see 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.770
 in fact it should be like inside 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.500
 you see 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:49.830
 oh God broke something here don't put it in 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.199
 place for this audience as you see there 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:55.380
 the order we have comes from this 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:58.110
 done before this was the read mode 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.479
 guys, I recommend we get to 1500 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.610
 I like it I really care about it no 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:05.130
 since you criticized me in 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.320
 going back to say 1500 instead you have to say 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.780
 that's why I say to Mr. 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.250
 I always say shit we get 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.430
 at the number 20 years number a 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:16.730
 this time it is a billion with 363 thousand 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.990
 272 cubic roots of 67 to the second 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.870
 obviously because if it's not the second one 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.160
 there is no taste 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.840

 tried let me see yours 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.860
 construction constructors posting sea 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.830
 on facebook I don't know I'm saying what a 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.540
 case award beautiful ideas boys built 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.180
 something with this fashion and posted in the 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:41.180
