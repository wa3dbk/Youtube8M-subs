00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.820
 very good the kids I am virus and os 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.350
 I bring a new tutorial this time 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.260
 it's about a tutorial on how to decorate 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.240
 our house in minecraft and for this I have 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.760
 prepared this little house is nothing 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.590
 another world is a wooden house and 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.109
 let's go in to continue with the 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.599
 tutorial and as you can see the first point 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.759
 to decorate our house to decorate it 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:25.039
 well it would be the soil as you see in this 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.130
 case I have made a striped floor with 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:32.460
 the different types of refined wood 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:34.710
 the one of the snow and the normal one of the white one 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.230
 that's very important since it gives a good 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.059
 aspect to our house that is not everything 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.860
 of the same color of wood because it is 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.040
 a little bland and we can finish 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.829
 tired and it is of two types because it is 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.870
 fairly good 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.659
 also the walls to not leave us 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.729
 all of the same type of wood or 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:54.710
 stone we can also put them 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:56.839
 pictures like this do not have to be 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.850
 so big but we can put them 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:02.640
 pictures that give 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.070
 a little life to the house to the walls 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.050
 since if they are not very dull and like 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.520
 put torches because they are a bit ugly 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.710
 on the banks and let's look at the 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.710
 rooms for example that I have 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.470
 a room that is the bedroom and 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.810
 we can put a bed and a few blocks 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.290
 what would be the tables and where could we 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.400
 put also cakes or a torch 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.900
 because that is already your thing 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.150
 then also in the bedroom 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.850
 we could also put shelves like 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.890
 I have done here since they give 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.650
 they are not given more joy room 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.710
 you go in and say 'it's not nonsense 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.750
 they were more life because if it would not be very 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.640
 dirty room 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.220
 also if we continue a bit here 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.040
 I have the kitchen where I have put some 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.140
 ovens for if I have to cook something I've 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.990
 done with these wooden ones like 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.790
 if it was the kitchen bar and with a 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.010
 trunk and a cake that the cakes 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.990
 they always look good to decorate and here 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.960
 I've done a refrigerator with a door 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.930
 iron an iron block with a button 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.539
 and under a dispenser and when 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.610
 press the button the door opens and the 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.850
 dispenser releases something that we have 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.550
 inside as you see also put the slaps 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.900
 we can do yes and place things at 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.900
 dispenser as I say before 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.980
 I want my diamond 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.980
 Diamond 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.550
 that more can also be put windows 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.680
 what's in the windows is already optional 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.930
 If you want to put pictures, do not put 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.180
 too many windows if we like the 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.610
 pictures we put windows that's already something 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.380
 your 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.150
 I for example have put a few 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.790
 windows and a few pictures 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.379
 If we continue down here we go to the bathroom 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.370
 I also like bathroom very much 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:52.049
 has stayed here I made a bathtub 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.460
 being on top of the normal blocks 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:59.020
 that they would be from the ground being slaps of 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:03.430
 of stone bricks and here stairs 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:06.220
 you can if you like us you could do well 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.310
 to make the bathtub look better but 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.739
 so if you want to make a 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.690
 a battle then it would not be too 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.060
 because the toilet looks good with those apps 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.040
 because as you can see this is a cauldron with 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.720
 two blocks and one carries a trapdoor 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.640
 then this looks like a toilet if the 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.459
 severe blocks under the card of the 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.819
 cauldron and it's not too good for 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.530
 that I have put these ice creams and if 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.950
 you want to make flames the chain you can 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:39.550
 put levers or the tripod I think it 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.920
 call of the 1.3 and I have also put a 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:46.150
 lever as if it were as if it were 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.150
 what the morning where over water 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.650
 if we continue here 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.590
 I made a single small one with a bar 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.940
 with cakes because this room is the one 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.010
 it goes up to the roof 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.950
 but of naphtha we could save 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.000
 trunks with our diamonds our 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.000
 iron our gold 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.010
 and basically that's it too 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.840
 we could put here some other 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.630
 window 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.680
 put sofas if you want to see how they are made 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.360
 the sofas I will make one 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.360
 here it was now at a time is 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.949
 It 's very easy, we just have to catch 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.949
 for example, wooden stairs 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.690
 and where are some posters here and if 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.420
 we want this is already optional if 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.550
 we want to make corners as the block 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.780
 of the ladder and we put for example 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.500
 This here 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.110
 we can write is like this 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.110
 and so for example and we now put a 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.169
 poster here 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:59.499
 and a poster here I will not 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.879
 here we already have our sofa so 

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:02.830
 easy 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:05.740
 we can also do with carpets 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.070
 we could do now if we take a little 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.040
 from landa 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:12.220
 yellow 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:15.520
 we take the yellow one and we put here in the 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.500
 floor of the sofa so wins and we already have the 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.180
 carpet and we could put around here 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.840
 It's also wooden raps like it's 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.280
 a table that is already your imagination 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.400
 so nothing I hope you liked 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.730
 this tutorial that now decorate better 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.370
 your minecraft houses that you believe 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:35.220
 very nice houses and if you want some 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.540
 very nice house and you want to teach me 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.030
 you make a screenshot and I 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:43.120
 you pass the link of the capture or any 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:45.160
 thing or your video and nothing I hope that 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.960
 have you liked the iv favorites and up 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.370
 the next video 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:53.100
 in a little house that I made in a moment 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.009
 if I take 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.840
 a lighter 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:06:06.090
 I could burn it 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:06.090
 and the low costs
