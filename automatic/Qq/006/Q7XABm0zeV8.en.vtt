00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
silver with a bronze and we were six on

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.110 
silver with a bronze and we were six on
the<00:02:15.180> table<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.099> of<00:02:17.099> the<00:02:17.280> competition<00:02:17.580> so<00:02:18.090> I

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
the table and of the competition so I

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.300 
the table and of the competition so I
feel<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.599> was<00:02:18.720> good<00:02:18.900> for<00:02:19.049> us<00:02:19.110> because<00:02:19.410> we

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
feel that was good for us because we

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.680 
feel that was good for us because we
didn't<00:02:20.519> have<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:20.670> two<00:02:20.910> years<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.330> prepare<00:02:21.480> for

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
didn't have a two years to prepare for

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.960 
didn't have a two years to prepare for
that<00:02:22.049> particular<00:02:22.440> competition<00:02:23.099> and<00:02:23.880> the

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
that particular competition and the

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.670 
that particular competition and the
reason<00:02:24.330> is<00:02:24.450> because<00:02:24.480> we<00:02:24.870> be<00:02:24.989> competing<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.500> lot

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
reason is because we be competing a lot

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.800 
reason is because we be competing a lot
of<00:02:25.769> other<00:02:25.950> things<00:02:26.040> we<00:02:26.430> need<00:02:27.120> more<00:02:27.299> time<00:02:27.510> and

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
of other things we need more time and

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.880 
of other things we need more time and

continue to mix martial arts so we

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.759
