what<00:01:07.049> you're<00:01:07.229> doing<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:08.270> taking<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.930> genetic

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
what you're doing is taking the genetic

they're very concerned that these

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.520 
they're very concerned that these
genetically<00:05:08.740> engineered<00:05:09.670> fish<00:05:10.120> may<00:05:10.900> end<00:05:11.230> up

genetically engineered fish may end up
in<00:05:12.370> the<00:05:12.790> ocean<00:05:13.420> and<00:05:13.600> could<00:05:14.760> escape<00:05:15.760> and<00:05:16.240> cause

we've looked extensively at the

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
the reasons why the Food Drug

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.640 
the reasons why the Food Drug

communities urging is using a veterinary
drug<00:05:44.200> approach<00:05:44.680> is<00:05:45.040> because<00:05:45.700> it<00:05:45.880> triggers<00:05:46.720> an

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
drug approach is because it triggers an

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.730 
drug approach is because it triggers an
a<00:05:47.320> mandatory<00:05:47.970> environmental<00:05:48.970> assessment<00:05:49.740> so

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
a mandatory environmental assessment so

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.040 
a mandatory environmental assessment so
that<00:05:50.890> we've<00:05:51.040> looked<00:05:51.280> extensively<00:05:51.610> at<00:05:52.120> what

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
that we've looked extensively at what

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.659 
that we've looked extensively at what
would<00:05:53.200> happen<00:05:53.530> if<00:05:53.620> these<00:05:53.740> fish<00:05:54.010> did<00:05:54.310> escape

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
would happen if these fish did escape

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:57.090 
would happen if these fish did escape
into<00:05:54.880> the<00:05:55.030> wild<00:05:55.360> it<00:05:56.200> turns<00:05:56.500> out<00:05:56.740> that<00:05:56.919> they're

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
into the wild it turns out that they're

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.860 
into the wild it turns out that they're
much<00:05:57.370> more<00:05:57.580> interested<00:05:57.640> in<00:05:58.120> eating<00:05:58.570> than<00:05:58.750> they

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
much more interested in eating than they

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.420 
much more interested in eating than they
are<00:05:58.900> in<00:05:59.200> breeding<00:05:59.650> so<00:05:59.830> the<00:05:59.950> likelihood<00:06:00.160> of

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
are in breeding so the likelihood of

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.180 
are in breeding so the likelihood of
passing<00:06:00.669> on<00:06:01.090> their<00:06:01.300> genes<00:06:01.360> to<00:06:01.930> wild<00:06:02.530> salmon<00:06:02.860> is

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
passing on their genes to wild salmon is

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.460 
passing on their genes to wild salmon is
next<00:06:04.120> to<00:06:04.240> nothing<00:06:04.480> you<00:06:04.900> know<00:06:05.020> I<00:06:05.080> think<00:06:05.140> you

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
next to nothing you know I think you

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.640 
next to nothing you know I think you
have<00:06:05.680> to<00:06:05.890> look<00:06:06.130> at<00:06:06.640> what<00:06:06.940> happens<00:06:07.419> in<00:06:07.780> in<00:06:08.140> the

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
have to look at what happens in in the

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.550 
have to look at what happens in in the
future<00:06:08.919> and<00:06:09.580> you<00:06:10.210> can't<00:06:10.480> just<00:06:10.810> look<00:06:11.050> today<00:06:11.500> you

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
future and you can't just look today you

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.350 
future and you can't just look today you
have<00:06:11.980> to<00:06:12.100> look<00:06:12.280> at<00:06:12.460> what's<00:06:12.669> going<00:06:12.820> to<00:06:12.910> happen

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
have to look at what's going to happen

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:19.350 
have to look at what's going to happen
