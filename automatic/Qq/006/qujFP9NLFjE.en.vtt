00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.830
 Cult two Leipziger fits 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.840
 Costs are down here document 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.400

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.760
 antichristian she breaks it way 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.750
 and now 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.470
 Talla that's great 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.000
 it's the last harvest ever but 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.480
 I think it is correct 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.700
 Tons per year 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.200
 pa I'm so deceiving the blank of her 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.600
 black pepper Sara Goller black-white-red 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.350
 Wortmann inventory so I still watch this video today 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.329

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:25.000
 Percent the Chile and innovations tangible young I have in the last 

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:26.990
 Weeks months here 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.200
 I'm not doing anything but I have so many new add-ons and the whole thing 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.500
 Show should 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.430
 I would like to present this briefly so that not everywhere Straub on rooftops 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.410
 yes also in the next tests you can build woman in extremis the tests too 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.100
 explain and so 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.100
 The decision is honest without having to think twice 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.140
 Two trends look at the other 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.140
 Guilt were mentally blog 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.830
 Error message 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.600
 her arms land not much Thaksin at Arber nor Seitz Khattak goes to solve the 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.290
 PvP from 60 regularly on that makes me so happy 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.509
 I always wanted to show PvP before and now 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.109
 which i can not go out on purpose because dumb that the new one 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:17.889
 Dalaran that means if here two meters Eighth Phonak is interesting to lay 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:19.489
 as would degrees 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.769
 I do not know how I should decorate the whole but it says hello Recke 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:27.559
 so I want to briefly the artists 

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:30.969
 I have new ones because the 1 Hauer East 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:34.059
 bookable that is especially important for companies 

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:35.289
 but p 4 p 

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:38.059
 These are such smoking here 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:40.330
 they will be displayed if certain 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.190
 the a8 conditions are met let me say this is for example the OTE 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.579
 rough 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.579
 it's when I'm under 30% at Faller 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:52.969
 The blue smoker tells me that I put Crowd Control into them 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:56.619
 the blue smoker lights up I know APA right away I'm kind of confessed 

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:58.609
 Guest Blog Square what do I know 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:02.469
 then I press the 8 with almost one hundred percent then I know immediately and 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:05.469
 for that especially important in PvP 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:11.129
 until very very essential PvP though good for Maria he clicks you 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:11.829
 but 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.400
 Especially since we are currently on it that I'm not a corner us if it is known to us 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.289
 danced 

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:20.089
 the two you do no that completely doubt so much like theirs 

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.829
 doing 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.189
 Master just like that Scheerer 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:29.760
 Eisler 1 percent as plant as country percent cold KPI's lance as a whole 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.299
 Prof sucks through the PvP setup 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:39.769
 who does not Chrome 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.829
 Maybe Tom Thomas Vennemann does not worry about Map Rooms 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.040
 then you do that 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.860
 and there you just have to be corrosive draft horse that's demanding with your face 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.639
 about the keyboard roles 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:52.899
 and maybe that hits more than 20 percent 

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:56.019
 and Dieter Stolte I did not want to demonstrate that it was the new one 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.689
 How to play the Frost Matches but he understands what had declared My Soul 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:05.389
 Diaz you have to just St 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:09.939
 I mean with my cat, I've been here so far, so Cazes truly the Ferrari 

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:14.709
 50 also in Dinant Sector not shredding active but not at all 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.759
 do not shred actively but not 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:21.000
 AZ meat net not active but devastating is disturbed when percent 

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:25.680
 was not below 30 percent easily the ball is not her reason enough hawk place 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.240
 30 conditions her 50 also in those screen fullest 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.460
 but I can handle it Niekisch 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.120
 I do not know what I'm talking about in Malsch 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.979
 could define exactly here 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:41.729
 March Crowd Control and Lola IMF could not really bother me 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:44.650
 well i could still make over year 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.650
 you could quickly show new power because so dazed 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:51.090
 in the video 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.090
 this is felt by the keys and Lolo set up v 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:57.889
 Euro bit bigger 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:59.219
 so 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:02.219
 Zitzmann Bachfest as technical help 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:06.259
 and and pm 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.150
 the US is your opera 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.559
 because when her is not active 

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:18.559
 works great again St 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.490
 in the fight for roughly 44 already 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.599
 Prolimatech Sun that means we can fix a bend here now 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:31.680
 the BAFTA is at her 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.760
 Percent if this is not active, therefore, the condition around core will be with 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:37.210
 this also displayed 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.580
 What does it mean when I'm not active in her I always have this one 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.939
 Year many smokers 

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:44.939
 and then suddenly ice barrier 

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:48.319
 He is back, too 

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:49.270
 SÃ¶der 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.159
 that is, for example, calls this function in PvP 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:54.279
 there you have yours 

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:55.210
 Yes 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.330
 now escorts percent my as stands on their way i should maybe 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.069
 not to the NSC of all the front races that could do a bit of PID 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.780
 that the op was good or the same could be done and only veins 

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:11.400
 trier 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.119
 because today too hectic 

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:16.869
 because they are about to clear year 

00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:18.589
 that Sido Bellucci 

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:20.050
 do there 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.419
 more and more titles 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:24.270
 every year 30 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.639
 winner 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:28.639
 Ortner

 Set tax office 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.699
 wonderful it is totally useless actually 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:38.389
 and animation exactly make year 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:41.289
 that does not mean that it is to guide players in the descent 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:42.529
 absolutely not on 

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:45.529
 Dublin Tants sometimes useful but that's all 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.520
 Euro pro with sponsor 

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:53.029
 Although is active in their and now takes on victories but Nati we 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.460
 of course, but not forgetting the aura then would now 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.930
 it also lights up and we could 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.610
 then everyone would have to be on deck again 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.470
 that's called e-tron poet and up here Copenhagen seven seconds to 6 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.090

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:17.199
 wonderful no that works degree powerful becomes the subject 

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:20.069
 Ida she in 

00:07:20.069 --> 00:07:23.069
 I hope it sounds like that 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.900
 well that it fits perfectly I use it so I have to do it all 

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:28.469

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.879
 He fasted too 

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:36.620
 It's just about frost 

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:37.809
 in PvP 

00:07:37.809 --> 00:07:39.559

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:42.960
 what gets in your way is dead that can fail 

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.529
 that's just how it is 

00:07:44.529 --> 00:07:46.919
