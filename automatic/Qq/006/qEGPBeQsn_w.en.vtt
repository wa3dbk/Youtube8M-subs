00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.729 
manual mode of course it blips the
throttle<00:02:35.680> smoothly<00:02:39.900> it's<00:02:40.900> also<00:02:41.110> a<00:02:41.290> very

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
throttle smoothly it's also a very

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.890 
throttle smoothly it's also a very
smooth<00:02:42.280> quiet<00:02:43.120> refined<00:02:43.989> engine<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:45.900> think

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
smooth quiet refined engine I think

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.390 
smooth quiet refined engine I think
overall<00:02:47.230> it's<00:02:47.769> one<00:02:47.950> of<00:02:48.069> the<00:02:48.129> best

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
overall it's one of the best

00:02:48.400 --> 00:03:01.920 
overall it's one of the best
four-cylinder<00:02:49.060> motor<00:02:49.209> around<00:02:49.840> today<00:03:00.930> the

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
four-cylinder motor around today the

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.500 
four-cylinder motor around today the
2-liter<00:03:02.440> diesel<00:03:02.879> makes<00:03:03.879> the<00:03:04.030> same<00:03:04.269> path

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
2-liter diesel makes the same path

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.880 
2-liter diesel makes the same path
before<00:03:04.840> 140<00:03:05.590> bhp<00:03:06.269> very<00:03:07.269> nice<00:03:07.569> linear<00:03:08.200> power

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
before 140 bhp very nice linear power

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.069 
before 140 bhp very nice linear power
delivery<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:09.670> that's<00:03:10.180> what<00:03:10.569> we<00:03:10.720> like<00:03:10.900> about

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
delivery and that's what we like about

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.759 
delivery and that's what we like about
it<00:03:11.400> what's<00:03:12.400> not<00:03:12.760> so<00:03:13.000> great<00:03:13.180> is<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:13.599> drone<00:03:14.530> you

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
it what's not so great is the drone you

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.470 
it what's not so great is the drone you
still<00:03:15.010> get<00:03:15.220> quite<00:03:15.459> a<00:03:15.519> bit<00:03:15.760> of<00:03:15.790> drone<00:03:16.060> from<00:03:16.269> the

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
still get quite a bit of drone from the

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.180 
still get quite a bit of drone from the
diesel<00:03:16.690> especially<00:03:17.349> when<00:03:17.500> you<00:03:17.590> have<00:03:17.799> it<00:03:17.950> hot

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
diesel especially when you have it hot

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.110 
diesel especially when you have it hot
still<00:03:18.970> it's<00:03:19.510> a<00:03:19.660> nice<00:03:19.840> long-legged<00:03:21.120> travelling

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
still it's a nice long-legged travelling

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.690 
still it's a nice long-legged travelling
kind<00:03:22.359> of<00:03:22.480> car

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.699 

this<00:03:25.060> one<00:03:25.239> comes<00:03:25.510> with<00:03:25.629> the<00:03:25.840> 6-speed<00:03:26.530> DSG

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
this one comes with the 6-speed DSG

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.190 
this one comes with the 6-speed DSG
rather<00:03:27.310> than<00:03:27.550> the<00:03:27.640> petrol<00:03:28.030> 7-speed<00:03:28.870> with<00:03:29.050> it

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
rather than the petrol 7-speed with it

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.650 
rather than the petrol 7-speed with it
but<00:03:29.739> I<00:03:29.890> think<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.580> torque<00:03:31.180> of<00:03:31.330> the<00:03:31.390> diesel

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
but I think the torque of the diesel

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.020 
but I think the torque of the diesel
makes<00:03:32.140> up<00:03:32.319> for<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.920> other<00:03:32.950> big<00:03:33.340> difference<00:03:33.519> is

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
makes up for the other big difference is

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.070 
makes up for the other big difference is
that<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.860> diesel<00:03:35.860> has<00:03:36.340> a<00:03:36.700> non<00:03:37.420> independent

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
that the diesel has a non independent

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.080 
that the diesel has a non independent
suspension<00:03:38.590> setup<00:03:38.950> whereas<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.459> petrol<00:03:39.819> has

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
suspension setup whereas the petrol has

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.750 
suspension setup whereas the petrol has
the<00:03:40.300> independent<00:03:40.840> one<00:03:41.040> what<00:03:42.040> this<00:03:42.190> means<00:03:42.459> is

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
the independent one what this means is

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.000 
the independent one what this means is
that<00:03:42.819> at<00:03:43.299> high<00:03:43.599> speeds<00:03:43.959> the<00:03:44.230> diesel<00:03:44.590> is<00:03:44.950> a

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
that at high speeds the diesel is a

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.390 
that at high speeds the diesel is a
little<00:03:45.459> more<00:03:45.670> stable<00:03:46.060> than<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:47.049> petrol<00:03:47.400> what

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
little more stable than the petrol what

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.220 
little more stable than the petrol what
you<00:03:48.489> also<00:03:48.640> notice<00:03:48.910> is<00:03:49.269> that<00:03:49.299> the<00:03:49.750> diesel<00:03:50.080> is<00:03:50.200> a

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
you also notice is that the diesel is a

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.170 
you also notice is that the diesel is a
bit<00:03:50.500> more<00:03:50.709> stiffly<00:03:51.190> sprung<00:03:51.250> so<00:03:51.670> you<00:03:51.760> get<00:03:51.940> more

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
bit more stiffly sprung so you get more

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.080 
bit more stiffly sprung so you get more
of<00:03:52.239> a<00:03:52.450> wriggly<00:03:53.230> right<00:03:53.500> most<00:03:54.370> of<00:03:54.549> the<00:03:54.610> time<00:03:54.700> or

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
of a wriggly right most of the time or

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.809 
of a wriggly right most of the time or
most<00:03:55.360> surfaces<00:03:55.930> it<00:03:56.709> kind<00:03:56.920> of<00:03:56.980> flattens<00:03:57.280> out<00:03:57.640> at

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
most surfaces it kind of flattens out at

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.009 
most surfaces it kind of flattens out at
higher<00:03:57.970> speeds<00:03:58.360> which<00:03:58.540> is<00:03:58.690> a<00:03:58.720> good<00:03:58.989> thing

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
higher speeds which is a good thing

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.170 
higher speeds which is a good thing
which<00:03:59.620> is<00:03:59.799> why<00:03:59.950> I<00:03:59.980> said<00:04:00.280> it<00:04:00.549> makes<00:04:00.790> for<00:04:00.940> a<00:04:01.000> great

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
which is why I said it makes for a great

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:09.589 
which is why I said it makes for a great
I<00:04:01.480> wake<00:04:01.780> up

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.020 

the<00:04:10.079> Octavia<00:04:10.409> seems<00:04:10.799> grown-up<00:04:11.250> and<00:04:11.459> by<00:04:11.790> that

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
the Octavia seems grown-up and by that

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.729 
the Octavia seems grown-up and by that
we<00:04:12.209> mean<00:04:12.239> it's<00:04:12.540> bigger<00:04:12.810> and<00:04:13.140> far<00:04:13.560> more

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
we mean it's bigger and far more

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.619 
we mean it's bigger and far more
sophisticated<00:04:13.950> while<00:04:14.939> the<00:04:15.090> engines<00:04:15.450> and
