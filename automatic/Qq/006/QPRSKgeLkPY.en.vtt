 beyond the metamorphosis we can cite 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.820
 other great books I have 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.300
 interest and led I want to read later 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.949
 which is the process of the house of cards to the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.539

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.640
 origin and Jewish and write in the language 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.170
 with metamorphosis is a book 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.930
 already considered classic of the literature 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.460
 world that history is about 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.439
 start talking I just wanted to quote 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.009
 the first paragraph that is famous for 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.450
 who knows this interaction when 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.580
 one morning 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.119
 gregor samsa cut off from dreams 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.329
 uneasy found himself in his bed 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.430
 metamorphosis of the monstrous insect 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:37.799
 was lying on his hard back 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.750
 as a breastplate and when raising a little 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.140
 head saw your belly 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.079
 shaken or brown / arched veins in the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.799
 top of which the deck hurry to use 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.560
 for once 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.750
 still ill if you frighten me it's logical 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.290
 that this fiction is a metaphor, but it is 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.360
 very very cool then gregor samsa 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.630
 he is a traveling salesman who is 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.500
 very bored with your everyday life 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.140
 he is 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.640
 he supports the whole family with his 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.100
 work and his family does not give much 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.530
 attention the fact that he is the great 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.600
 retaining them they largely responsible 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:18.030
 for example then from the moment 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.319
 that he turns and wakes up is 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.900
 transformed metamorphosed from these 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.970
 gigantic insects and begin to find a 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.430
 a great absurdity what happened to me 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.620
 Why did you put it this way, afraid? 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.720
 to leave the room and his family starts 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.010
 to get worried early on that 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.450
 You'll talk because you do not want to leave inside. 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.580
 the room and said that it is solving 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.220
 some things and he can barely walk 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.010
 and became a giant cockroach 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.900
 until in the course of these 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.360
 the first hours of the morning that do not 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.959
 they always leave in launches in the same 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.420
 schedule 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.820
 to the head of the company's managers where 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.030
 Work ends up going to his house . 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.160
 know why he can not get out of the 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.350
 room because he did not go to work and then 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.700
 begins a dialogue with him inside and 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.010
 family outside trying 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.610
 understand why he's in that way 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.290
 he trying to give an explanation one 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.420
 Sorry to say that you will be able to 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.860
 work later but his sister starts 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.530
 to realize that by actually showing 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.750
 wrong only anyone who spends a few days 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.049
 and does not really leave the room 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.209
 Until one day the door opens I will not 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.820
 go into detail but could family 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.579
 discover an unlimited way and in the 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.070
 start and call the gigantic talma and 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:33.850
 You understand why you're so afraid of him. 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:35.440
 It is even close to being afraid of 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.440
 accept that she had that situation 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.380
 he 's the only one who can really 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.480
 You should keep a contact even if you do not 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.000
 physical or not even if it is not 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.730
 eyes in the eyes this flag 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.549
 the most interesting of this story as 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.350
 the family is getting used to the fatec 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:55.120
 have been transformed or 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.700
 family always needed his money. 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.310
 to be able to sustain and suddenly not 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.100
 can more promise money they get 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.329
 to be scared first 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.880
 expected results and from a given 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:09.190
 but not be annoyed by the fact that 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.070
 contain more with some sustaining 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.079
 family or if he was guilty of having 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.630
 if transformed into that then the message 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:18.380
 I want to tell you a lot about this book. 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.390
 well I just wanted to enjoy 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.670
 a lot of sport here but suddenly it starts 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:25.910
 to feel right so there is 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:28.550
 this image this metaphor and begins 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.740
 to feel uncertain because nobody 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.690
 But the ball to him happens some 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.180
 things that aggravate his situation 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.060
 criticism and is very heavy on this 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:42.560
 how people are able to 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:44.540
 simply judge another because one day 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.910
 that person helped and today she can not 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.320
 more help then it passes if the duck or 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.300
 villain of history 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.880
 this also reminds me a little of 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.790
 Moisture Believe Even Protected Mode 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.260
 to the protector or even a little prince 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.240
 you become responsible for 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.830
 the text is rather raw 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.910
 quite straightforward 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:08.900
 despite being a book from the beginning of 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:11.180
 20th century is a person who was born before 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.830
 of the 20th century and the 19th century 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.690
 the language is fairly current enough 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.370
 simple to understand and looks very good 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.980
 for you to see I do not want to extend 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.660
 much in relation to the book because it is 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.550
 short but worth it 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.800
 there are already people who are sitting here 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.420
 I only read the three days I was there. 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.160
 traveling law during travel moments 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.350
 moment that I could be a little bit 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.170
 read I recommend later people 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:37.010

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:39.350

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.090
 kafka to be able to comment here as well 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.220
