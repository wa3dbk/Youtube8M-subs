00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
angle till I get to the center piece

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.810 
angle till I get to the center piece
these<00:01:55.460> edges<00:01:56.149> and<00:01:56.920> you<00:01:57.920> can<00:01:58.070> kind<00:01:58.340> of<00:01:58.399> see<00:01:58.579> it's

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
these edges and you can kind of see it's

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.980 
these edges and you can kind of see it's
just<00:01:58.969> going<00:01:59.119> right<00:01:59.360> through<00:01:59.659> everything

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
just going right through everything

it<00:04:15.109> doesn't<00:04:15.260> fall<00:04:15.380> apart<00:04:15.680> on<00:04:16.039> us<00:04:16.479> or<00:04:17.479> tip<00:04:17.930> over

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
it doesn't fall apart on us or tip over

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.510 
it doesn't fall apart on us or tip over
or<00:04:18.289> something<00:04:18.829> like<00:04:18.979> that<00:04:21.160> which<00:04:22.160> would<00:04:22.370> be

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
or something like that which would be

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.770 
or something like that which would be
just<00:04:22.760> a<00:04:22.910> disaster<00:04:24.130> but

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
just a disaster but

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.230 
just a disaster but
and<00:04:27.500> so<00:04:28.100> that's<00:04:28.250> why<00:04:28.430> sometimes<00:04:28.880> I<00:04:29.060> like

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
and so that's why sometimes I like

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.140 
and so that's why sometimes I like
carving<00:04:29.720> better<00:04:30.200> than<00:04:30.680> using<00:04:31.130> an<00:04:31.340> already

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
carving better than using an already

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.100 
carving better than using an already
shaped<00:04:32.510> pan<00:04:32.950> just<00:04:33.950> because<00:04:34.280> they<00:04:34.460> tend<00:04:34.790> to<00:04:35.110> get

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
shaped pan just because they tend to get

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.730 
shaped pan just because they tend to get
too<00:04:36.350> small<00:04:36.650> on<00:04:36.950> their<00:04:37.100> bases<00:04:37.550> and<00:04:38.530> things<00:04:39.530> can

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
too small on their bases and things can

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.680 
too small on their bases and things can
fall<00:04:39.950> apart<00:04:40.070> on<00:04:40.340> you<00:04:40.400> so<00:04:40.850> you<00:04:41.360> want<00:04:41.510> to<00:04:41.570> make

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
fall apart on you so you want to make

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.010 
fall apart on you so you want to make
sure<00:04:42.340> that<00:04:43.340> you<00:04:43.970> have<00:04:44.150> a<00:04:44.180> very<00:04:44.420> nice<00:04:44.690> sturdy

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
sure that you have a very nice sturdy

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.090 
sure that you have a very nice sturdy
base<00:04:45.140> to<00:04:45.530> this<00:04:45.910> and<00:04:46.910> then<00:04:47.030> all<00:04:47.210> your<00:04:47.390> work<00:04:47.600> and

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
base to this and then all your work and

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.440 
base to this and then all your work and
effort<00:04:49.100> is<00:04:49.280> not<00:04:50.290> not<00:04:51.290> undone<00:04:52.060> okay<00:04:53.060> so<00:04:53.120> we're

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
effort is not not undone okay so we're

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.320 
effort is not not undone okay so we're
almost<00:04:53.630> done<00:04:53.990> here<00:04:54.730> carving<00:04:55.730> all<00:04:55.940> the<00:04:56.210> way

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330

even more detail I'm just kind of

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.719 
even more detail I'm just kind of
Shaving<00:05:43.910> it<00:05:44.030> some<00:05:44.300> more<00:05:44.510> here<00:05:45.580> getting<00:05:46.580> these

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:46.729 
Shaving it some more here getting these

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:51.430 
Shaving it some more here getting these
edges<00:05:47.300> that<00:05:47.510> just<00:05:47.720> really<00:05:49.300> want<00:05:50.300> to<00:05:50.600> not<00:05:51.140> be

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
edges that just really want to not be

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.020 
edges that just really want to not be
rounded<00:05:51.890> but<00:05:52.040> we're<00:05:52.190> going<00:05:52.370> to<00:05:52.430> make<00:05:52.790> them

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
rounded but we're going to make them

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.450 
rounded but we're going to make them
rounded<00:05:53.510> and<00:05:54.080> then<00:05:54.740> we<00:05:54.830> can<00:05:54.979> always<00:05:55.280> go<00:05:55.430> back

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
rounded and then we can always go back

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.870 
rounded and then we can always go back

cover things up exactly how we want it
to<00:06:02.060> be<00:06:03.340> okay<00:06:04.340> we<00:06:04.550> are<00:06:04.760> almost<00:06:05.060> there

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
to be okay we are almost there

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.590 
to be okay we are almost there

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
can pull them out a little bit take some

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.010 
can pull them out a little bit take some
of<00:06:18.080> your<00:06:18.110> icing<00:06:18.740> from<00:06:18.890> your<00:06:19.070> bag<00:06:19.310> and<00:06:19.810> pipe<00:06:20.810> it

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
of your icing from your bag and pipe it

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
in there and then stick that back in

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.480 
in there and then stick that back in
there<00:06:22.700> the<00:06:23.120> only<00:06:23.270> thing<00:06:23.630> that<00:06:24.470> I<00:06:24.560> will<00:06:24.620> the

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
there the only thing that I will the

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.530 
there the only thing that I will the
only<00:06:25.640> reason<00:06:25.910> why<00:06:26.000> I<00:06:26.030> really<00:06:26.330> wouldn't

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:26.540 
only reason why I really wouldn't

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.690 
only reason why I really wouldn't
recommend<00:06:26.600> that<00:06:27.169> is<00:06:27.380> because<00:06:28.100> later<00:06:28.250> when<00:06:28.580> you

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:28.700 
recommend that is because later when you

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.110 
recommend that is because later when you
go<00:06:28.880> to<00:06:29.140> to<00:06:30.140> cut<00:06:30.380> the<00:06:30.530> cake<00:06:30.740> and<00:06:30.770> serve<00:06:31.190> it<00:06:31.400> it's

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
go to to cut the cake and serve it it's

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.210 
go to to cut the cake and serve it it's
going<00:06:32.390> to<00:06:32.450> fall<00:06:32.690> apart<00:06:33.080> when<00:06:33.500> you<00:06:33.560> cut<00:06:33.950> it<00:06:34.070> up

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:34.220 
going to fall apart when you cut it up

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.930 
going to fall apart when you cut it up
and<00:06:34.520> you<00:06:35.510> really<00:06:35.810> don't<00:06:35.990> want<00:06:36.200> that<00:06:36.260> either<00:06:36.940> so

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:37.940 
and you really don't want that either so

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.570
