I guess that's why I'm sweating out here
everyday<00:01:05.380> trying<00:01:05.830> to<00:01:05.920> learn<00:01:06.070> as<00:01:06.340> much<00:01:06.490> as<00:01:06.670> I

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
everyday trying to learn as much as I

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:07.730 
everyday trying to learn as much as I
can

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
can

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.260 
can
so<00:01:08.130> you're<00:01:08.280> out<00:01:08.400> something<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:08.909> nobody<00:01:09.180> else

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
so you're out something that nobody else

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.510 
so you're out something that nobody else
can<00:01:09.510> figure<00:01:09.750> out

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
can figure out

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.100 
can figure out
and<00:01:11.700> then<00:01:11.820> for<00:01:12.000> them<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.210> see<00:01:12.390> me<00:01:12.509> as<00:01:12.600> an<00:01:12.750> expert

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
and then for them to see me as an expert

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.270 
and then for them to see me as an expert
in<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.229> topic<00:01:13.290> is

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.760 

it's<00:01:16.700> a<00:01:16.760> lot<00:01:16.880> to<00:01:17.030> live<00:01:17.150> up<00:01:17.330> to<00:01:17.410> these<00:01:18.410> may<00:01:18.710> be

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
it's a lot to live up to these may be

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.370 
it's a lot to live up to these may be
the<00:01:19.100> abandoned<00:01:20.090> cabins<00:01:20.600> that<00:01:20.690> someone<00:01:21.170> on<00:01:21.200> my

the abandoned cabins that someone on my

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.220 
the abandoned cabins that someone on my
form<00:01:21.650> had<00:01:21.800> spoken<00:01:22.100> about<00:01:22.390> so<00:01:23.390> that<00:01:23.570> uh<00:01:23.600> him<00:01:24.200> and

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:31.630 
these abandoned Kant cabins I guess
somewhere<00:01:30.710> off<00:01:30.830> in<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:31.010> distance<00:01:31.220> is

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
somewhere off in the distance is

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.350 
somewhere off in the distance is
supposedly<00:01:32.060> a<00:01:32.360> mind<00:01:33.369> with<00:01:34.369> these<00:01:34.820> guardians

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
that are protecting the mine and fees

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.440
