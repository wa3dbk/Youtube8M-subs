shoemaker<00:01:28.500> fan<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:29.009> see<00:01:29.189> him<00:01:29.310> quit<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.700> sport

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880

shoemaker fan to see him quit the sport
again<00:01:30.150> but<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.110> think<00:01:31.350> overall<00:01:31.619> it's<00:01:31.890> probably

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
again but I think overall it's probably

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.649 
again but I think overall it's probably
best<00:01:32.280> for<00:01:32.369> him<00:01:32.549> at<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.700> moment<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.119> hardly

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
best for him at the moment I hardly
