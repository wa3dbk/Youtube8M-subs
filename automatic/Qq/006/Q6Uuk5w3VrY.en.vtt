00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:10.050
 and then the people here welcome to lÃ©o 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.360
 tech news is today microsoft announced a 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.839
 new device with android is a second 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.550
 nokia device running between quotation marks 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.520
 android 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.100
 his name is nokia is x 2 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.430
 a few months ago nokia announced ox 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.070
 mallorca x which theoretically runs android 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.969
 It's not quite the android people you know right? 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.790
 that runs on mobile phones like motorola lg 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.190
 samsung is a totally android 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.700
 modified much like windows 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.390
 phone and also the android that is not have 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.129
 google play in google's store and not 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.020
 have the apps that google 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.520
 available in her shop then 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.289
 applications that Nokia itself will 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:59.329
 available and this new nokia x2 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.739
 is practically an x in a new x 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.860
 It has a slightly improved configuration 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.740
 The best thing that will leave the appliance is 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.860
 fast but flows better in the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.640
 nokia x7 had a button I want to button 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.930
 come back 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.080
 The taste I press if I do not 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.119
 mistake is once to go back and two 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.759
 times for him to the home of the device now 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.150
 no nokia x1 has two buttons one for 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:27.509
 back and to go to the home 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.340
 device to make life much easier 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.930
 who will use this device 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.310
 remembering that it is not a top gadget 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.710
 even though it has a good 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.460
 configuration is a 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.130
 input 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.200
 're there from what I understand is a device to 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.649
 to draw the attention of consumers to 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.810
 then buy and also windows was already 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.229
 that this modified android pressure is 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.259
 very similar to windows phone 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.399
 the configuration is is basically one of the 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:02:01.829
 1 2 ghz core snapdragon with 1 gb of 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:04.649
 ram and a 4.3-inch screen that I 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:08.399
 I'm not mistaken in x was a processor 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:12.120
 weaker and had only 512 memory 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.380
 so I think it's a nifty device is 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.560
 despite being a 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.330
 android and fully modified 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.960
 anyone who wants more information will have a 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:25.350

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.040
 click and take a look there I get by 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.450

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.450
