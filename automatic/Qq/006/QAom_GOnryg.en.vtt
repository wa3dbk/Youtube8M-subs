footage or news on it at all once so

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.140 
footage or news on it at all once so
ever<00:01:40.560> by<00:01:40.740> Triarch<00:01:41.159> but<00:01:41.670> i<00:01:41.700> just<00:01:41.970> feel<00:01:42.119> that

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
ever by Triarch but i just feel that

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.670 
ever by Triarch but i just feel that
it's<00:01:42.360> going<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.509> be<00:01:42.630> fantastic<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.470> only

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
it's going to be fantastic the only

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.920 
it's going to be fantastic the only
downside<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.250> when<00:01:45.060> I've<00:01:45.329> been<00:01:45.570> reading<00:01:45.720> on

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
downside is when I've been reading on

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.149 
downside is when I've been reading on
the<00:01:45.990> internet<00:01:46.020> I'm<00:01:46.500> not<00:01:46.649> sure<00:01:46.860> if<00:01:46.950> it's<00:01:47.130> a

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
the internet I'm not sure if it's a

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.130 
the internet I'm not sure if it's a
hundred<00:01:47.280> percent<00:01:47.490> official<00:01:48.149> here<00:01:48.390> but<00:01:48.990> it's

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
hundred percent official here but it's

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.020 
hundred percent official here but it's
being<00:01:49.350> developed<00:01:49.530> by<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> different<00:01:50.460> developer

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
being developed by a different developer

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.359 
being developed by a different developer
called<00:01:51.299> Raven<00:01:51.600> Software<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:53.070> only<00:01:53.220> thing

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
called Raven Software the only thing

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.859 
called Raven Software the only thing
that<00:01:53.490> I've<00:01:53.610> heard<00:01:53.820> about<00:01:53.909> Raven<00:01:54.299> Software<00:01:54.509> is

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
that I've heard about Raven Software is

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.359 
that I've heard about Raven Software is
they<00:01:55.020> developed<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.530> game<00:01:55.710> called<00:01:55.950> singularity

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
they developed a game called singularity

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.399 
they developed a game called singularity
okay<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.420> there's<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.780> pretty<00:01:57.960> big<00:01:58.140> possibility

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
okay so there's a pretty big possibility

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.139 
okay so there's a pretty big possibility
that<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.100> may<00:01:59.219> not<00:01:59.369> actually<00:01:59.579> be<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.880> letdown

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
that it may not actually be a letdown

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.999 
that it may not actually be a letdown
after<00:02:00.509> all<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:01.020> can<00:02:01.110> either<00:02:01.229> go<00:02:01.469> both<00:02:01.710> ways

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
after all it can either go both ways

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.190 
after all it can either go both ways
it's<00:02:02.280> pretty<00:02:02.520> simple<00:02:02.790> actually<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.869> design

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
it's pretty simple actually the design

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.139 
it's pretty simple actually the design
for<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.469> maps<00:02:04.649> can<00:02:04.890> either<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.310> suck<00:02:05.880> horribly

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
for the maps can either a suck horribly

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.450 
for the maps can either a suck horribly
or<00:02:06.570> BB<00:02:07.140> freakin<00:02:07.500> amazing

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
or BB freakin amazing

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.760 
or BB freakin amazing
I'm<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:08.850> try<00:02:09.120> born<00:02:09.540> in<00:02:09.720> raven<00:02:10.080> software<00:02:10.320> for<00:02:10.740> a

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
I'm so try born in raven software for a

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.930 
I'm so try born in raven software for a
reason<00:02:11.100> I'm<00:02:11.190> sure<00:02:11.370> they<00:02:11.490> know<00:02:11.610> what<00:02:11.760> they<00:02:11.880> do

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
reason I'm sure they know what they do

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.820 
reason I'm sure they know what they do
how<00:02:12.510> they<00:02:12.540> do<00:02:12.720> their<00:02:12.930> work<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.350> all<00:02:13.470> that<00:02:13.620> kind

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
how they do their work and all that kind

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.380 
how they do their work and all that kind
of<00:02:13.860> stuff<00:02:13.920> I'm<00:02:14.580> sure<00:02:14.880> they<00:02:15.000> don't<00:02:15.150> suck

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
of stuff I'm sure they don't suck

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.690 
of stuff I'm sure they don't suck
horribly<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:16.500> only<00:02:16.740> main<00:02:16.920> concern<00:02:17.310> for<00:02:17.550> me<00:02:17.670> is

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
horribly the only main concern for me is

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.820 
horribly the only main concern for me is
you<00:02:18.360> know<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.750> Raven<00:02:19.200> soft<00:02:19.440> we're<00:02:19.620> going<00:02:19.740> to

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
you know is Raven soft we're going to

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.980 
you know is Raven soft we're going to
show<00:02:20.010> us<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.190> huge<00:02:20.580> difference<00:02:20.940> apart<00:02:21.870> from

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
show us a huge difference apart from

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.720 
show us a huge difference apart from
trax<00:02:22.470> development<00:02:23.010> in<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.310> multiplayer

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
trax development in the multiplayer

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.580 
trax development in the multiplayer
itself<00:02:24.240> I<00:02:24.480> hope<00:02:25.020> it's<00:02:25.170> not<00:02:25.320> you<00:02:25.560> know

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
itself I hope it's not you know

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.500 
itself I hope it's not you know
different<00:02:25.920> in<00:02:26.190> a<00:02:26.250> negative<00:02:26.460> way<00:02:26.670> but<00:02:27.270> in<00:02:27.420> a

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
different in a negative way but in a

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.540 
different in a negative way but in a
positive<00:02:27.690> way<00:02:28.080> hopefully<00:02:28.470> when<00:02:29.220> I<00:02:29.250> would

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
positive way hopefully when I would

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.550 
positive way hopefully when I would
actually<00:02:29.670> like<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.060> see<00:02:30.420> in<00:02:30.630> Raven<00:02:30.990> software's

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
actually like to see in Raven software's

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.010 
actually like to see in Raven software's
take<00:02:31.950> on<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.250> coal<00:02:32.460> duty<00:02:32.730> black<00:02:32.940> ops<00:02:33.150> DLC<00:02:33.840> is

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
take on the coal duty black ops DLC is

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.560 
take on the coal duty black ops DLC is
of<00:02:34.260> course<00:02:34.500> adding<00:02:35.430> in<00:02:35.610> new<00:02:35.850> weapons<00:02:36.330> that

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
of course adding in new weapons that

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.600 
of course adding in new weapons that
would<00:02:36.690> be<00:02:36.810> unlazy<00:02:37.200> you<00:02:37.530> know<00:02:37.650> if<00:02:38.160> they<00:02:38.310> add<00:02:38.460> it

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
would be unlazy you know if they add it

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.000 
would be unlazy you know if they add it
in<00:02:38.730> say<00:02:39.090> like<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.600> know<00:02:39.630> an<00:02:39.900> update<00:02:40.230> an<00:02:40.350> m16

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
in say like you know an update an m16

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.460 
in say like you know an update an m16
that's<00:02:41.250> automatic<00:02:42.000> or<00:02:42.420> maybe<00:02:42.780> even<00:02:42.870> add<00:02:43.230> in<00:02:43.380> a

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
that's automatic or maybe even add in a

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.230 
that's automatic or maybe even add in a
famas<00:02:43.830> that's<00:02:44.160> burst<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.700> know<00:02:44.820> a<00:02:44.940> lot<00:02:45.210> of

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
famas that's burst I know a lot of

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.520 
famas that's burst I know a lot of
people<00:02:45.360> out<00:02:45.690> there<00:02:45.720> didn't<00:02:46.140> like<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:46.440> in

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
people out there didn't like it in

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.440 
people out there didn't like it in
modern<00:02:46.770> warfare<00:02:46.800> 2<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.580> they<00:02:47.970> liked<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.360> lot

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
modern warfare 2 and they liked it a lot

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.730 
modern warfare 2 and they liked it a lot
better<00:02:48.630> in<00:02:48.840> black<00:02:49.050> ops<00:02:49.320> because<00:02:49.590> it's

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
better in black ops because it's

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.130 
better in black ops because it's
automatic<00:02:50.310> now<00:02:50.460> but<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.090> know<00:02:51.210> what<00:02:51.420> a<00:02:51.630> change

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
automatic now but you know what a change

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.140 
automatic now but you know what a change
is<00:02:52.320> always<00:02:52.470> fun<00:02:52.800> you<00:02:53.160> know<00:02:53.310> they<00:02:53.580> can<00:02:53.760> have<00:02:53.910> two

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
is always fun you know they can have two

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.580 
is always fun you know they can have two
different<00:02:54.180> from<00:02:54.570> losses<00:02:54.930> or<00:02:55.110> just<00:02:55.410> add<00:02:55.560> a

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
different from losses or just add a

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.010 
different from losses or just add a
switch<00:02:55.950> on<00:02:56.100> the<00:02:56.160> gun<00:02:56.400> cool<00:02:57.240> updates<00:02:57.630> like<00:02:57.840> that

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
switch on the gun cool updates like that

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.990 
switch on the gun cool updates like that
would<00:02:58.200> be<00:02:58.320> really<00:02:58.530> amazing<00:02:58.830> and<00:02:59.190> also<00:02:59.760> I

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
would be really amazing and also I

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.850 
would be really amazing and also I
really<00:03:00.660> hope<00:03:00.870> that<00:03:01.020> they<00:03:01.170> add<00:03:01.350> in<00:03:01.560> at<00:03:01.710> least

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
really hope that they add in at least

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.550 
really hope that they add in at least
three<00:03:02.040> maps<00:03:02.520> not<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.210> one<00:03:03.870> thing<00:03:04.110> I<00:03:04.200> don't<00:03:04.260> want

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
three maps not to one thing I don't want

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.500 
three maps not to one thing I don't want
raven<00:03:04.860> software<00:03:05.100> to<00:03:05.400> do<00:03:05.550> is<00:03:05.820> of<00:03:06.000> course<00:03:06.240> the

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510
