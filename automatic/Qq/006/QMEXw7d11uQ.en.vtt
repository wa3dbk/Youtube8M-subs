 good fingers welcome to solutions 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.530
 online computers in this new video 

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:14.199
 I'll explain something that many already 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.660
 you were waiting and that's how you can 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:18.640
 have the whatsapp on the computer 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.949
 recently whatsapp have created a 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.269
 extension for google chrome at the moment 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.539
 It's only available for Google Chrome 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:28.779
 that allows you to have whatsapp in the 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:31.179
 in the pc then the process is very 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.640
 simple over is available to 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.110
 them for android for windows phone and 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.050
 The first thing we have to do is go to 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.030
 the whatsapp website then in 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.970
 instead of putting whatsapp dotcom we have 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:46.360
 that put the first web point whatsapp 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:50.020
 puntocom is worth as you are seeing there in 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:53.610
 the url then here we are created in the 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.450
 a web with a code of these of qr 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.880
 so what we have to do is 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.890
 scan this code with the application 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.450
 of whatsapp and automatically it 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.280
 will associate the session that we have here in 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.439
 the computer with our session that 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.480
 We have whatsapp on the phone 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:10.330
 then here here 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.740
 it says how you have to do it to 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.659
 android for windows phone for 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.749
 blackberry etc 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.819
 then always step is to take the 

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:21.130
 phone and we have to scan that 

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:22.990
 qr code that appears behind in the 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.840
 computer we just open the 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:29.259
 whatsapp application we are going here you 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.890
 we give whatsapp web worth here this 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:34.509
 option and it opens up is worth a scanner 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.179
 code then what we have to do 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.369
 is to point to the code that is worth more 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.290
 it is marked educated the code qr what 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.030
 authorized 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.260
 or anything we adjust 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.260
 the phone to the computer 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:55.500
 ok and as you can see it has already detected 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:58.830
 is worth going to the bottom is my whatsapp 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.540
 then it is simply this process not 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.640
 there is much more to do 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.330
 you can close session in different 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.270
 browsers 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.929
 that's done by going back to the phone 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.680
 again we go to the options we are going to 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.050
 whatsapp web and here we have the session in 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.450
 the one that is active with currently 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.580
 active in windows 7 we have can 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.650
 have several open sessions in 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.690
 different computers and giving this 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.640
 button we can close all the all 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.319
 sessions then if we want to close 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.540
 you and we give you here to close all the 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.200
 sessions closes the session and in the 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.569
 computer you have seen that disappears 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.640
 again the application we would have to 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.130
 re-scan the qr code and 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.299
 again we would have access to the web 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.299
 I'm going to do it again 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.110
