a<00:02:31.730> crossing<00:02:32.060> it's<00:02:32.390> been<00:02:32.569> my<00:02:33.110> life<00:02:33.409> for<00:02:33.709> the

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
a crossing it's been my life for the

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.670 
a crossing it's been my life for the
last<00:02:33.799> 40<00:02:34.280> years<00:02:34.510> our<00:02:35.510> mantra<00:02:36.110> is<00:02:36.200> looking

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
last 40 years our mantra is looking

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.710 
last 40 years our mantra is looking
ahead<00:02:36.799> so<00:02:37.370> we're<00:02:37.489> gonna<00:02:37.579> work<00:02:37.849> with<00:02:38.090> that<00:02:38.239> but

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
ahead so we're gonna work with that but

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.630 
ahead so we're gonna work with that but
also<00:02:38.930> sometimes<00:02:39.409> folks<00:02:40.220> will<00:02:40.310> think<00:02:40.579> that

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
also sometimes folks will think that

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.670 
also sometimes folks will think that
like<00:02:40.940> smoking<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.510> tires<00:02:41.540> is<00:02:41.959> fast<00:02:42.230> when<00:02:42.560> it

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
like smoking the tires is fast when it

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.920 
like smoking the tires is fast when it
isn't<00:02:43.040> it's<00:02:43.400> not<00:02:43.519> a<00:02:43.670> lot<00:02:43.940> unlike<00:02:44.269> drag<00:02:44.569> racing

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
isn't it's not a lot unlike drag racing

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.199 
isn't it's not a lot unlike drag racing
when<00:02:45.049> the<00:02:45.170> guys<00:02:45.349> lights<00:02:45.829> his<00:02:46.010> tires<00:02:46.250> up<00:02:46.519> it

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
when the guys lights his tires up it

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.390 
when the guys lights his tires up it
doesn't<00:02:47.510> go<00:02:47.810> and<00:02:48.110> he<00:02:48.230> gets<00:02:48.409> a<00:02:48.500> low<00:02:48.680> ET<00:02:49.069> same

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
doesn't go and he gets a low ET same

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.099 
doesn't go and he gets a low ET same
with<00:02:49.579> Auto<00:02:49.760> crossings<00:02:50.209> if<00:02:50.450> we're<00:02:50.720> gonna<00:02:50.870> make

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:51.109
