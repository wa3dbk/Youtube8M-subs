00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
of course good giving might lead off and

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.780 
of course good giving might lead off and
pump<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.939> no<00:01:39.380> I<00:01:40.380> don't<00:01:40.650> think<00:01:40.710> got<00:01:41.340> it

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790
