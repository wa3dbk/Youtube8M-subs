okay<00:01:52.150> so<00:01:52.690> as<00:01:52.810> you<00:01:52.960> can<00:01:53.080> see<00:01:53.320> it's<00:01:53.440> see-through

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
okay so as you can see it's see-through

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.200 
okay so as you can see it's see-through
kind<00:01:54.370> of<00:01:54.520> like<00:01:54.670> a<00:01:55.230> one<00:01:56.230> of<00:01:56.320> those<00:01:56.410> windows<00:01:57.210> that

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
kind of like a one of those windows that

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.800 
kind of like a one of those windows that
plays<00:01:59.200> with<00:01:59.500> your<00:01:59.650> eye<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:01.270> looks<00:02:01.480> really

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
plays with your eye it looks really

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.740 
plays with your eye it looks really
weird<00:02:02.020> but<00:02:02.800> it<00:02:02.920> is<00:02:03.070> see-through<00:02:03.670> and<00:02:03.850> again<00:02:04.510> it

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
weird but it is see-through and again it

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.570 
weird but it is see-through and again it
is<00:02:04.930> it's<00:02:05.830> hard<00:02:06.190> enough<00:02:07.709> to<00:02:08.709> be<00:02:08.890> considered<00:02:09.039> I

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
is it's hard enough to be considered I

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.360 
is it's hard enough to be considered I
guess<00:02:10.149> a<00:02:10.179> hard<00:02:10.539> case<00:02:10.780> it's<00:02:11.380> not<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.830> silicone

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
guess a hard case it's not a silicone

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.630 
guess a hard case it's not a silicone
really<00:02:12.760> floppy<00:02:13.720> around<00:02:14.170> case<00:02:14.440> but<00:02:14.920> at<00:02:15.520> the

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
really floppy around case but at the

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.010 
really floppy around case but at the
same<00:02:15.850> time<00:02:16.060> it's<00:02:16.270> not<00:02:16.330> really<00:02:17.730> soft<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:19.900> can

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
same time it's not really soft you can

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.820 
same time it's not really soft you can
squeeze<00:02:20.440> it<00:02:20.709> it's<00:02:21.190> just<00:02:21.670> it's<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.330> perfect

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
squeeze it it's just it's the perfect

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.449 
squeeze it it's just it's the perfect
hardness<00:02:24.030> that's<00:02:25.030> what<00:02:25.360> she<00:02:25.540> said<00:02:26.130> so<00:02:27.130> anyway

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
hardness that's what she said so anyway

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.210 
hardness that's what she said so anyway
so<00:02:27.520> you<00:02:27.880> can<00:02:28.030> twist<00:02:28.300> it<00:02:28.570> around<00:02:29.100> pull<00:02:30.100> it

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
so you can twist it around pull it

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.870 
so you can twist it around pull it
around<00:02:30.370> a<00:02:30.640> little<00:02:30.670> bit<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:33.190> sides<00:02:33.430> just<00:02:33.700> kind

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
around a little bit the sides just kind

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.479 
around a little bit the sides just kind
of<00:02:33.910> snap<00:02:34.270> back<00:02:34.540> in<00:02:34.840> it's<00:02:35.709> not<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:36.070> software

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
of snap back in it's not to software

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.970 
of snap back in it's not to software
it's<00:02:36.640> just<00:02:36.820> flopping<00:02:37.209> out<00:02:37.450> like<00:02:37.690> that<00:02:37.980> so

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
it's just flopping out like that so

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:47.630 
it's just flopping out like that so
let's<00:02:39.340> put<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.330> iphone<00:02:40.870> 4<00:02:41.380> in<00:02:43.500> buttons<00:02:44.500> first

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.990 

and<00:02:48.959> snap<00:02:49.959> it<00:02:49.989> in<00:02:50.350> all<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.650> way<00:02:50.830> around<00:02:54.000> okay

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
and snap it in all the way around okay

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.720 
and snap it in all the way around okay
