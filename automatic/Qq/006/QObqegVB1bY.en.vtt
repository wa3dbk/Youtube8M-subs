 my channel today i want with you 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.630
 talk about skin care again and 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.460
 today we talk about natural care 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.609
 for the skin I already started to be with you 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.170
 talk continue and I want to 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.380
 stop on masks 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.920
 natural and probably worth me of course 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:37.219
 same note what is specific in mask 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.370
 does so i put a blog post about 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.680
 masked 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.090
 about each clay masks that i am now 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.590
 I will tell you exactly what each 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.030
 length does so if interesting then 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.950
 be sure to go to my blog 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.149
 the link will be down now just super 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.010
 death number because i have in 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.680
 the boxes all this clay I I bought in 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.890
 the pharmacy and she crumbles me around 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.480
 pass the bed and because I already have it 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.000
 naturally used the suit all 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.559
 the bags are open so in general everything 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.810
 fray at me now I am very dependent 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.630
 show you 1 thing that at least 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.140
 talk it blue clay blue 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.720
 clay became my salvation then 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.040
 when i see my skin is dehydrated 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.610
 very dry after thermonuclear washes 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.930
 before or after some kind of super different 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.490
 situations can happen just skin 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.130
 I wanted to prank she became 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.600
 such a blue clay it normalizes 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.790
 the appearance of the skin and it improves the skin it 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.729
 improves the complexion the only thing i'm talking about 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.439
 I would like to talk to you from the minuses 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.799
 here such home cook 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.610
 cooked homemade glen this is what 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.320
 you need to very well dilute them with water and 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.420
 stir once visited me 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.700
 it happened that a piece of small 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.829
 lengths huddled at my time I had 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:01.560
 open head right here on the cheek and there 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.270
 hit one piece fly away clay and she 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.890
 there everything began to fester shorter of course 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.390
 this is all pull out then imagine all 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.780
 any inflammation was very unpleasant 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.490
 especially when 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.590
 doing the mask wants to be then 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.230
 beautiful written and you here such here 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.790
 unpleasant moment so watch out for 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.459
 this because it is really difficult 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.260
 avoid this one just stirred 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:24.220
 in a quick and smeared well there already 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.080
 dried up somewhere here but assuming that 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.280
 it is very budgetary and very 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.860
 effective yet you advise him 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.560
 you can just be a little more careful 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.270
 so that's blue clay she seemed to me 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.430
 very very gentle very well 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.260
 caring if your skin is very tender 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.760
 very sensitive and stick a little 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.769
 problematic and or you just want 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.570
 refresh the appearance of the face, I like you very much 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.670
 advised precisely blue clay 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.470
 more information about each 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.810
 I will remind you how long you will find in my 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.610
 blog next this is green long 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:56.170
 green clay is my favorite 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.370
 just for the care of problem skin 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.590
 it is for pimples 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.250
 I have green clay here 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.640
 himalaya mask with neem I adore her 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:10.150
 Some bloggers wrote to me about what 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.280
 she is not very like but many bloggers 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.989
 many people say the opposite is that 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.480
 budget find and here I have it 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.970
 just my love green clay she 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.150
 It is precisely for the care 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.670
 pimples for inflammations and here 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.640
 here it is, and all sorts of antioxidants 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.480
 that remove bacteria 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.140
 antibacterial generally act 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:35.760
 so I really like the green 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:39.340
 clay and I highly recommend it to all of you 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.670
 now of the most mediocre for 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.709
 i am black and pink say 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.680
 that black clay is very very 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.709
 so same and vicious clay and steel and 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.230
 that it can even damage the skin 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:56.500
 she is very thermonuclear of all those damn 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:59.440
 which I listed though everyone has different 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.350
 as if opinions but for me she is not at all 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.290
 It works I did not notice no moisture 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.000
 skin does not improve the complexion sometimes for 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.190
 Diversity I use black clay 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.350
 but advising you the menu as my favorite I 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.900
 just will not become like pink clay 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.819
 Many times I used it seems to me 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.039
 that it moisturizes the skin well and is suitable 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:21.340
 more for dry skin for 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:23.560
 possibly aged skin or as such 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.140
 know mediocre skin care then 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.470
 of when you don't need to improve quickly 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:31.200
 complexion quickly improve skin in general 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.430
 skin conditions and you just 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.590
 pamper yourself 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.659
 pretty uses pink clay either 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.400
 use pink greek as a base 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:42.250
 for some kind of mask then there is still put 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.250
 there some more nuclear weapons and 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.280
 then the ruins will help you about it 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.650
 In general, the boy is a lot of recipes 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.599
 I will try to find the best ones too 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.900
 leave in the block and remember that i 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:57.700
 the cause itself and we are the favorite white 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.740
 white clay will suit girls 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.960
 which problem skin which 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:05.080
 some pigmentation stains or 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.430
 just specks the elevator then the scar or you 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.159
 just want to even out the complexion 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.050
 a little bleach face gives you 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:13.090
 it is white clay white clay just 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.710
 my love all the masks that i have 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.349
