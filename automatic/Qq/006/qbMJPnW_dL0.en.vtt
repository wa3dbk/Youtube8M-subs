00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.360 

it<00:00:54.110> would<00:00:54.260> have<00:00:54.320> been<00:00:54.440> really<00:00:54.680> easy<00:00:54.800> to<00:00:55.190> walk

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370

it would have been really easy to walk
away<00:00:55.670> after<00:00:55.880> Beijing<00:00:56.240> and<00:00:56.660> call<00:00:57.140> it<00:00:57.290> a<00:00:57.380> day

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:57.560

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.430 
away after Beijing and call it a day
there<00:00:57.760> but<00:00:58.760> I<00:00:59.090> just<00:00:59.300> felt<00:00:59.630> like<00:00:59.720> I<00:00:59.840> had<00:00:59.870> so<00:01:00.320> much

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
there but I just felt like I had so much

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.250 
there but I just felt like I had so much
more<00:01:00.650> to<00:01:00.770> prove<00:01:01.070> as<00:01:01.610> an<00:01:01.760> athlete<00:01:02.150> and<00:01:02.360> had<00:01:03.230> I

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
more to prove as an athlete and had I

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.750 
more to prove as an athlete and had I
known<00:01:03.560> what<00:01:03.860> I<00:01:03.890> was<00:01:04.070> going<00:01:04.309> to<00:01:04.370> go<00:01:04.520> through

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
known what I was going to go through

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.150 
known what I was going to go through
with<00:01:05.030> three<00:01:05.540> shoulder<00:01:05.900> operations<00:01:06.560> and<00:01:06.920> a

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
with three shoulder operations and a

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.690 
with three shoulder operations and a
load<00:01:07.940> more<00:01:08.240> ups<00:01:08.420> and<00:01:08.630> downs<00:01:08.860> I<00:01:09.860> probably<00:01:10.280> would

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
load more ups and downs I probably would

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.270 
load more ups and downs I probably would
have<00:01:10.729> but<00:01:11.510> I'm<00:01:11.780> so<00:01:12.170> glad<00:01:12.320> that<00:01:12.440> I<00:01:12.650> really<00:01:13.010> stuck

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
have but I'm so glad that I really stuck

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.880 
have but I'm so glad that I really stuck
through<00:01:13.550> it<00:01:13.700> and<00:01:13.910> I<00:01:14.479> can<00:01:14.990> kind<00:01:15.260> of<00:01:15.380> now<00:01:15.590> say

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
through it and I can kind of now say

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.590 
through it and I can kind of now say
that<00:01:16.220> I've<00:01:16.370> learned<00:01:16.670> about<00:01:16.850> myself<00:01:16.940> and<00:01:17.540> my

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
that I've learned about myself and my

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.020 
that I've learned about myself and my
character<00:01:18.260> and<00:01:18.500> really<00:01:19.280> appreciate<00:01:19.850> the

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
character and really appreciate the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.790 
character and really appreciate the
support<00:01:20.210> system<00:01:20.780> that<00:01:20.870> I've<00:01:21.020> had<00:01:21.229> to<00:01:21.500> get<00:01:21.650> me

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
support system that I've had to get me

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.260 
support system that I've had to get me
through<00:01:22.040> so<00:01:22.370> he<00:01:22.430> definitely<00:01:22.610> couldn't<00:01:23.180> have

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
through so he definitely couldn't have

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.740 
through so he definitely couldn't have
done<00:01:23.390> it<00:01:23.450> without<00:01:23.600> them

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
done it without them

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.020 
done it without them

emotional<00:01:46.910> about<00:01:47.150> the<00:01:47.450> whole<00:01:47.479> preparation

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
emotional about the whole preparation

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.090 
emotional about the whole preparation
that<00:01:48.410> I'd<00:01:48.530> just<00:01:48.710> been<00:01:48.950> through<00:01:49.280> I<00:01:50.800> felt<00:01:51.800> a<00:01:51.979> lot

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
that I'd just been through I felt a lot

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.830 
that I'd just been through I felt a lot
of<00:01:52.160> pressure<00:01:52.460> to<00:01:52.610> live<00:01:52.910> up<00:01:53.000> to<00:01:53.060> everyone's

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
of pressure to live up to everyone's

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.350 
of pressure to live up to everyone's
expectations<00:01:54.290> and<00:01:55.070> fulfill<00:01:55.580> their<00:01:55.760> answers

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
expectations and fulfill their answers

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.719 
expectations and fulfill their answers
but<00:01:56.720> I<00:01:56.930> knew<00:01:57.650> that<00:01:57.680> I<00:01:57.860> really<00:01:58.040> had<00:01:58.310> to<00:01:58.340> take<00:01:58.610> the

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
but I knew that I really had to take the

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.580 
but I knew that I really had to take the
time<00:01:58.970> for<00:01:59.210> myself<00:01:59.690> to<00:01:59.960> get<00:02:00.080> to<00:02:00.229> the<00:02:00.320> point

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
time for myself to get to the point

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.430 
time for myself to get to the point
where<00:02:00.770> I<00:02:00.800> knew<00:02:01.460> 100%<00:02:01.720> what<00:02:02.720> I<00:02:02.750> wanted<00:02:03.110> to<00:02:03.260> do

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
where I knew 100% what I wanted to do

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.399 
where I knew 100% what I wanted to do
and<00:02:03.909> I<00:02:04.909> never<00:02:05.000> wanted<00:02:05.630> to<00:02:05.690> make<00:02:05.900> it<00:02:06.020> come<00:02:06.200> back

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
and I never wanted to make it come back

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.009 
and I never wanted to make it come back
so<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.760> decision<00:02:08.149> that<00:02:08.179> I<00:02:08.360> wanted<00:02:08.690> to<00:02:08.840> make

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
so the decision that I wanted to make

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.220 
so the decision that I wanted to make
was<00:02:09.380> definitely<00:02:10.130> final<00:02:10.610> and<00:02:10.959> coming<00:02:11.959> to<00:02:12.110> that

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
was definitely final and coming to that

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.259

definitely feel like you're losing a
part<00:02:19.820> of<00:02:19.880> myself<00:02:20.060> but<00:02:20.780> I'm<00:02:21.470> really<00:02:21.709> excited

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
part of myself but I'm really excited

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.970 
part of myself but I'm really excited
for<00:02:22.250> what's<00:02:22.549> to<00:02:22.700> come

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.740 

I'll<00:02:27.220> never<00:02:27.519> forget<00:02:27.849> when<00:02:28.030> someone<00:02:28.390> said<00:02:28.599> to

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
I'll never forget when someone said to

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.809 
I'll never forget when someone said to
me<00:02:28.900> what<00:02:29.739> if<00:02:29.860> something<00:02:30.250> is<00:02:30.400> just<00:02:30.640> the

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
me what if something is just the

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.479 
me what if something is just the
platform<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.540> something<00:02:31.959> else<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.470> I<00:02:33.310> guess

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
platform to something else and I guess

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.110 
platform to something else and I guess
I've<00:02:33.640> never<00:02:33.760> thought<00:02:34.030> about<00:02:34.090> it<00:02:34.390> that<00:02:34.450> way<00:02:34.739> so

it's safe to say that that's the new
goal<00:02:38.709> and<00:02:39.040> new<00:02:39.189> passion<00:02:39.610> for<00:02:39.819> me<00:02:39.909> is<00:02:39.970> to<00:02:40.269> prove
