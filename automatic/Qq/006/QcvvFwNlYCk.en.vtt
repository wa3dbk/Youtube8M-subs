00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.930

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.880

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.679
 pack up here're writing the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.480
 very cool simpsons 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.790
 the car here is also identical to the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.050
 thumbnail I was looking at years in all 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.210
 details here 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.379
 the one of romeu written in one side is 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.739
 written on the side of the car 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.260
 It's also the details here hot wheels 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.850
 here in the corner is also here then 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.579
 all the details 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.219
 The coolest part of the card is the 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.829
 homer stamped on it that give a detail 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.719
 so cool, I even know why 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.129
 but I 'm going to do a boxing because I 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.520
 like hell from eating here in 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:07.490
 good card this is the car number 89 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.990
 of 250 is part of the hot wheels ine 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.229
 so come on let's make a box 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:22.170
 then I'll give more details on the table has 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:24.619
 very cool this time she's gone 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.619
 rosemary 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:33.110
 good people then here from the mining company and I 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.110
 I'll be right back with the details. 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.850
 first this miniature was 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.210
 sodium 15 from the second series of 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:47.030
 of the simpsons series and what happens in 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:50.700
 streets is as follows if you can read from the series 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.130
 well, Homer 's going to the hospital in 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.979
 state of life or death and was still 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.490
 counting romer that he has my brother 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.380
 and then he goes after what happens 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.119
 This brother of mine is very rich then. 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.000
 a company that makes cars but does not 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.740
 He's giving so much money there, his brother. 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.020
 asks the Romanian to create a car after 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.629
 of a time so it goes really sums up 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.500
 finally the volume ends up sputtering and 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.810
 by olympique 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.060
 I did not get the rest of the series the 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.920
 car does not succeed his brother finishes 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.870
 bankrupt and transient from evil 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.400
 now talking about the car man 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.290
 I was saying that I should not like it that way. 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.630
 reminiscent of rolls royce 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.930
 because it reminds the Czech luxury car 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.000
 because he remembers that the old 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.770
 and from the children since separated 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.570
 from the front so as not to disturb 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.940
 moreover it had to have an input 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.730
 air to show an aggressive car 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.510
 here on the roof of a megaphone that 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.980
 would horn is very nice here 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.709
 steppe it also resembles cars 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.600
 ancient 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:54.209
 good the miniature also nice the headlights 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.470
 detailed information on the entry of 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.720
 take out the front 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.959
 really has a hole is married has 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.239
 four boys here that will be cylinders 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.250
 four-cylinder engine 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.220
 so I've written from robert on the side 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.860
 How can you see the betrayal here? 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.420
 left if the chassis is very simple 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.750
 even without much freshness 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:19.200
 I think it's cool to bring something here. 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:22.670
 seems to be a flashlight here and the steppe there 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.620
 in the middle has a step each side of the car 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.350
 so here the ceiling action two bubbles ne 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.459
 to tell the truth 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:34.019
 very cool I really liked it 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.660
 the wheels are the most typical of hot 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.450
 wheels even though it was really cool always 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.420
 the car combines a lot with the whole 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.950
 now then the good points 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.600
 his negative point 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.060
 The only thing I 've seen is that it's 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.280
 will not paint that part of the megaphone 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.090
 in that upper part that was meant to be 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.400
 green 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.530
 the televisions are also detailed 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.299
 here the taillights also do not 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.760
 are detailed no time here 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.380
 so I guess that's just it always negative 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.820
 that the grid that is not black in the middle 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.910
 as in the packaging 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.950
 but that's all I can not see anymore 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.329
 if he's in another series, what I 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.510
 I believe that change is going to be only 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:14.549
 these paintings even very basic type 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.030
 here on top of the ceiling here in a megaphone 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.930
 in the rear by maximum in the grid 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.770
 wheels right 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.599
 and here in the back but nothing much to leave 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.680
 any consumer can do is already going 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:28.509
 give a nice detail to damn 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.430
 Good people, I hope you have 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:31.870
 liked the video so 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.940
 that I advise you all have a 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.199
 collection that's really cool 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.610
 if you have not bought purchase is the 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:39.430
 As fast as you can because it's too 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.289
 mass and that's what liked the video 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.060
