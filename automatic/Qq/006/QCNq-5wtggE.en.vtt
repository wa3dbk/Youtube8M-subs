00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
is a little update on the cabin re on

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.299 
is a little update on the cabin re on
the<00:00:12.240> do<00:00:12.509> site<00:00:12.719> Orkut<00:00:13.170> since<00:00:13.799> there<00:00:13.950> isn't<00:00:14.099> a

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
the do site Orkut since there isn't a

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.980 
the do site Orkut since there isn't a
lot<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.490> information<00:00:14.670> on<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.420> internet<00:00:15.780> about

lot of information on the internet about
happen<00:00:16.440> area<00:00:16.740> or<00:00:16.949> kids<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.430> decided<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.150> make<00:00:18.300> a

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
happen area or kids I decided to make a

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.200 
happen area or kids I decided to make a
sort<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:19.020> log<00:00:19.740> on<00:00:20.070> how<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.609> will<00:00:20.970> care<00:00:21.180> for

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
sort of a log on how I will care for

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.509 
sort of a log on how I will care for
mine<00:00:21.600> now<00:00:22.020> this<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.560> first<00:00:22.800> time<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.220> have

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
mine now this is the first time I have

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.330 
mine now this is the first time I have
this<00:00:23.789> orchid<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:25.080> am<00:00:25.199> trying<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.740> learn<00:00:25.920> as<00:00:26.220> I

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
this orchid so I am trying to learn as I

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.060 
this orchid so I am trying to learn as I
go<00:00:26.609> but<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.970> results<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:27.750> far<00:00:27.779> are<00:00:28.260> promising

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
go but the results so far are promising

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.040 
go but the results so far are promising
I<00:00:29.189> have<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.490> say<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.179> am<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.330> little<00:00:30.660> bit<00:00:30.840> more

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
I have to say and I am a little bit more

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.260 
I have to say and I am a little bit more
confident<00:00:31.800> with<00:00:32.399> this<00:00:32.610> orchid<00:00:33.000> which

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
confident with this orchid which

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.260 
confident with this orchid which
supposedly<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.380> not<00:00:35.010> an<00:00:35.250> easy<00:00:35.460> Orkut<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.000> keep

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
supposedly is not an easy Orkut to keep

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.180 
supposedly is not an easy Orkut to keep
but<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.170> think<00:00:37.469> with<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.739> right<00:00:37.980> information

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
but I think with the right information

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.840 
but I think with the right information
it's<00:00:38.820> really<00:00:38.910> not<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.570> hard<00:00:40.100> so<00:00:41.100> right<00:00:41.579> now

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
it's really not that hard so right now

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.459 
it's really not that hard so right now
the<00:00:41.910> circuit<00:00:42.450> isn't<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.899> stage<00:00:43.200> of

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
the circuit isn't the stage of

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.799 
the circuit isn't the stage of
vegetative<00:00:44.160> growth<00:00:44.309> if<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.210> remember<00:00:45.600> we<00:00:45.780> did

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
vegetative growth if you remember we did

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.690 
vegetative growth if you remember we did
a<00:00:45.989> video<00:00:46.200> on<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.559> when<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.070> was<00:00:47.250> starting<00:00:47.670> to

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
a video on it when it was starting to

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.330 
a video on it when it was starting to
break<00:00:48.000> dormancy<00:00:48.300> we<00:00:49.200> saw<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.440> quorum<00:00:49.950> or<00:00:50.100> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
break dormancy we saw the quorum or the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.700 
break dormancy we saw the quorum or the
tuber<00:00:50.760> not<00:00:51.000> sure<00:00:51.239> how<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.539> call<00:00:51.719> it

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
tuber not sure how to call it

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.160 
tuber not sure how to call it
we<00:00:53.010> saw<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.340> starting<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.910> sprout<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.719> new

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
we saw it starting to sprout a new

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.069 
we saw it starting to sprout a new
growth<00:00:55.530> or<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.399> growing<00:00:56.820> tip<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.329> right<00:00:57.780> now

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
growth or the growing tip and right now

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.799 
growth or the growing tip and right now
it<00:00:58.379> has<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:59.070> broken<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.760> top<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.449> media

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
it has just broken the top of the media

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.319 
it has just broken the top of the media
the<00:01:01.379> actual<00:01:01.770> quorum<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.340> actually<00:01:02.670> potted<00:01:03.120> not

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
the actual quorum is actually potted not

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.350 
the actual quorum is actually potted not
too<00:01:03.539> deep<00:01:03.719> maybe<00:01:04.170> three<00:01:04.559> or<00:01:04.619> four<00:01:04.710> centimeters

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
too deep maybe three or four centimeters

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.210 
too deep maybe three or four centimeters
in<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.540> pot<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:07.080> have<00:01:07.110> read<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.860> they<00:01:08.010> can

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
in the pot I have read that they can

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.609 
in the pot I have read that they can
produce<00:01:08.369> or<00:01:08.820> they<00:01:09.060> usually<00:01:09.240> produce<00:01:09.689> multiple

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
produce or they usually produce multiple

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.039 
produce or they usually produce multiple
tubers<00:01:11.220> within<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.700> growing<00:01:12.119> season<00:01:12.570> with<00:01:12.780> good

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
tubers within a growing season with good

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.010 
tubers within a growing season with good
care<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:13.950> should<00:01:14.460> provide<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:15.150> taller<00:01:15.540> pot

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
care so you should provide a taller pot

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.710 
care so you should provide a taller pot
so<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.950> tuber<00:01:17.490> has<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.090> new<00:01:18.240> tuber<00:01:18.540> will

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
so that the tuber has the new tuber will

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.870 
so that the tuber has the new tuber will
have<00:01:18.900> more<00:01:19.140> space<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.740> develop<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.520> actually

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
have more space to develop so actually

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.940 
have more space to develop so actually
potted<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.299> tuber<00:01:21.750> about<00:01:22.320> three<00:01:22.680> or<00:01:22.770> four

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
potted the tuber about three or four

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.969 
potted the tuber about three or four
centimeters<00:01:23.369> under<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.750> soil<00:01:25.170> or<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.530> media

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
centimeters under the soil or the media

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.090 
centimeters under the soil or the media
for<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.729> circuit<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.150> chose<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.960> use<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.650> swag<00:01:28.950> no

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
for the circuit I chose to use a swag no

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.770 
for the circuit I chose to use a swag no
mass<00:01:29.250> media<00:01:29.610> because<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.360> terrestrial

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
mass media because it is a terrestrial

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.649 
mass media because it is a terrestrial
orchid<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.979> can<00:01:32.130> easily<00:01:32.460> use<00:01:32.700> peat<00:01:33.030> moss<00:01:33.270> and

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
orchid you can easily use peat moss and

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.130 
orchid you can easily use peat moss and
perlite<00:01:34.200> there<00:01:35.189> are<00:01:35.310> various<00:01:35.930> media<00:01:36.930> as<00:01:37.020> you

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
perlite there are various media as you

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.109 
perlite there are various media as you
can<00:01:37.320> use<00:01:37.530> but<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.920> opted<00:01:38.340> for<00:01:38.369> sphagnum<00:01:38.790> Moss

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
can use but I opted for sphagnum Moss

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.359 
can use but I opted for sphagnum Moss
because<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.840> kind<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.320> know<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.159> does

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
because I I kind of know it and it does

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.580 
because I I kind of know it and it does
stay<00:01:41.670> moist<00:01:41.970> for<00:01:42.270> quite<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.600> while<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:43.140> orchid

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
stay moist for quite a while this orchid

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.249 
stay moist for quite a while this orchid
is<00:01:43.740> not<00:01:44.130> supposed<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.729> dry<00:01:45.060> off<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.840> at<00:01:46.049> this

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
is not supposed to dry off so at this

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.289 
is not supposed to dry off so at this
point<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.860> am<00:01:47.040> actually<00:01:47.220> starting<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.090> water

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
point I am actually starting to water

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.749 
point I am actually starting to water
it's<00:01:48.570> full<00:01:48.930> watering<00:01:49.470> but<00:01:49.860> because<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.520> in

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
it's full watering but because it is in

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.149 
it's full watering but because it is in
this<00:01:50.909> fog<00:01:51.149> no<00:01:51.329> moss<00:01:51.509> media<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:52.020> am<00:01:52.170> not<00:01:52.590> soaking

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
this fog no moss media I am not soaking

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.310 
this fog no moss media I am not soaking
the<00:01:53.310> orchid<00:01:53.640> also<00:01:54.240> if<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.479> notice<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:55.020> did<00:01:55.290> not

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
the orchid also if you notice I did not

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.590 
the orchid also if you notice I did not
provide<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.979> ventilation<00:01:56.579> hose<00:01:56.759> this<00:01:57.390> is

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
provide the ventilation hose this is

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.469 
provide the ventilation hose this is
because<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.380> do<00:01:58.500> have<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.920> bit<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.430> bark<00:02:00.420> chips

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
because I do have a bit of bark chips

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.560 
because I do have a bit of bark chips
here<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.380> keep<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.860> media<00:02:02.310> more<00:02:02.729> Airy<00:02:02.969> also<00:02:03.540> I

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
here to keep the media more Airy also I

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.539 
here to keep the media more Airy also I
did<00:02:03.899> not<00:02:04.049> pack<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.590> sphagnum<00:02:04.799> Moss<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.399> is

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
did not pack the sphagnum Moss it is

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.910 
did not pack the sphagnum Moss it is
pretty<00:02:05.820> loosely<00:02:06.180> packed<00:02:06.509> maybe<00:02:07.380> doesn't<00:02:07.829> look

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
pretty loosely packed maybe doesn't look

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.249 
pretty loosely packed maybe doesn't look
that<00:02:07.950> way<00:02:08.099> but<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.759> if<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.420> press<00:02:09.720> down<00:02:09.750> on<00:02:10.110> it

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
that way but it is if I press down on it

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.920 
that way but it is if I press down on it
I<00:02:10.410> would<00:02:10.560> probably<00:02:11.060> compact<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.300> up<00:02:12.480> until

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
I would probably compact it up until

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.790 
I would probably compact it up until
this<00:02:13.110> level<00:02:13.560> so

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
this level so

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.400 
this level so
that's<00:02:14.010> how<00:02:14.190> Airy<00:02:14.520> it<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:14.880> so<00:02:15.630> how<00:02:15.810> my<00:02:15.930> water<00:02:16.200> it

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
that's how Airy it is so how my water it

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.650 
that's how Airy it is so how my water it
is<00:02:16.590> actually<00:02:17.010> at<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.220> sink<00:02:17.670> I<00:02:17.880> pour<00:02:18.360> a<00:02:18.390> little

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
is actually at the sink I pour a little

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.980 
is actually at the sink I pour a little
bit<00:02:18.840> of<00:02:18.900> water<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.560> then<00:02:19.770> let<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.460> media<00:02:20.990> soak

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
bit of water and then let the media soak

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.990 
bit of water and then let the media soak
in<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.350> moisture<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:23.040> don't<00:02:23.250> soak<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:23.880> in

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
in the moisture I don't soak it in

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.270 
in the moisture I don't soak it in
anyway<00:02:24.360> so<00:02:24.930> when<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.200> water<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.710> I<00:02:25.890> make<00:02:26.130> sure

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
anyway so when I water it I make sure

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.280 
anyway so when I water it I make sure
that<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:26.490> don't<00:02:27.000> get<00:02:27.180> any<00:02:27.390> water<00:02:27.630> in<00:02:27.930> this<00:02:28.110> new

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
that I don't get any water in this new

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.070 
that I don't get any water in this new
growth<00:02:28.620> they<00:02:29.100> are<00:02:29.370> presumably<00:02:30.300> prone<00:02:30.840> to

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
growth they are presumably prone to

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.770 
growth they are presumably prone to
rotting<00:02:31.620> if<00:02:31.860> water<00:02:32.580> is<00:02:32.700> stuck<00:02:33.120> in<00:02:33.300> this<00:02:33.480> new

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
rotting if water is stuck in this new

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.690 
rotting if water is stuck in this new
growth<00:02:34.110> right<00:02:34.410> here<00:02:34.680> hopefully<00:02:35.280> you<00:02:35.310> can<00:02:35.490> see

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
growth right here hopefully you can see

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.280 
growth right here hopefully you can see
there's<00:02:35.880> a<00:02:35.940> little<00:02:36.120> bit<00:02:36.240> of<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.450> tunnel<00:02:36.750> so<00:02:37.050> what

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
there's a little bit of a tunnel so what

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.650 
there's a little bit of a tunnel so what
I<00:02:37.320> can<00:02:37.620> get<00:02:37.770> trapped<00:02:38.130> right<00:02:38.670> here<00:02:39.030> that's<00:02:39.570> what

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
I can get trapped right here that's what

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.470 
I can get trapped right here that's what
I'm<00:02:39.780> trying<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:40.200> avoid<00:02:40.590> so<00:02:41.580> I'm<00:02:41.700> just<00:02:41.940> watering

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
I'm trying to avoid so I'm just watering

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.110 
I'm trying to avoid so I'm just watering
on<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.930> sides<00:02:43.200> of<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.740> pot<00:02:44.040> in<00:02:44.340> this<00:02:44.490> area<00:02:44.880> and

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
on the sides of the pot in this area and

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.600 
on the sides of the pot in this area and
actually<00:02:45.210> let<00:02:45.960> the<00:02:46.140> sphagnum<00:02:46.380> Moss<00:02:46.740> soaking

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
actually let the sphagnum Moss soaking

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.400 
actually let the sphagnum Moss soaking
the<00:02:48.000> water<00:02:48.210> and<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.630> moisture<00:02:48.960> in<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.110> pot

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
the water and the moisture in the pot

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.650 
the water and the moisture in the pot
I'll<00:02:49.800> also<00:02:50.070> start<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:50.670> fertilize<00:02:51.090> this<00:02:51.300> orchid

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
I'll also start to fertilize this orchid

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.660 
I'll also start to fertilize this orchid
pretty<00:02:52.110> soon<00:02:52.380> maybe<00:02:52.680> in<00:02:52.920> about<00:02:53.010> two<00:02:53.340> or<00:02:53.460> three

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
pretty soon maybe in about two or three

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.180 
pretty soon maybe in about two or three
weeks<00:02:53.910> but<00:02:54.540> I<00:02:54.570> will<00:02:54.960> use<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.260> more<00:02:55.650> diluted

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
weeks but I will use a more diluted

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.940 
weeks but I will use a more diluted
solution<00:02:56.520> than<00:02:57.060> I<00:02:57.330> use<00:02:57.810> for<00:02:58.050> my<00:02:58.200> other<00:02:58.380> orchids

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
solution than I use for my other orchids

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.120 
solution than I use for my other orchids
this<00:02:59.550> is<00:02:59.700> what<00:02:59.850> I<00:02:59.880> read<00:03:00.210> somewhere<00:03:00.540> so<00:03:01.170> yeah<00:03:01.860> I

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
this is what I read somewhere so yeah I

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.640 
this is what I read somewhere so yeah I
have<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.490> try<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:02.760> first<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.360> actually<00:03:04.230> presume

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
have to try it first to actually presume

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.920 
have to try it first to actually presume
it's<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.340> case<00:03:05.610> so<00:03:06.030> I<00:03:06.060> will<00:03:06.420> start<00:03:06.720> to

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
it's the case so I will start to

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.260 
it's the case so I will start to
fertilize<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.770> every<00:03:08.130> three<00:03:08.400> weeks<00:03:08.580> or<00:03:08.910> a

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
fertilize it every three weeks or a

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.850 
fertilize it every three weeks or a
month<00:03:09.420> or<00:03:09.780> something<00:03:10.320> like<00:03:10.440> that<00:03:10.500> with<00:03:10.830> a

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
month or something like that with a

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.550 
month or something like that with a
diluted<00:03:11.490> fertilizer<00:03:12.270> solution<00:03:12.570> I<00:03:13.020> intend<00:03:13.500> to

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
diluted fertilizer solution I intend to

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.430 
diluted fertilizer solution I intend to
use<00:03:13.650> a<00:03:13.800> high<00:03:14.160> nitrogen<00:03:14.580> fertilizer<00:03:15.300> maybe<00:03:16.200> up

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
use a high nitrogen fertilizer maybe up

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.110 
use a high nitrogen fertilizer maybe up
until<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:17.040> middle<00:03:17.220> of<00:03:17.370> summer<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:17.940> then

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
until the middle of summer and then

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.090 
until the middle of summer and then
switch<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:18.450> a<00:03:18.660> bloom<00:03:18.989> booster<00:03:19.410> because<00:03:19.650> in<00:03:19.980> the

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
switch to a bloom booster because in the

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.120 
switch to a bloom booster because in the
fall<00:03:20.340> presumably<00:03:20.970> this<00:03:21.270> orchid<00:03:21.660> should<00:03:22.470> bloom

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
fall presumably this orchid should bloom

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.190 
fall presumably this orchid should bloom
so<00:03:23.700> if<00:03:23.970> in<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.270> fall<00:03:24.480> we<00:03:24.690> will<00:03:24.840> get<00:03:24.989> some

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
so if in the fall we will get some

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.680 
so if in the fall we will get some
blooms<00:03:25.440> from<00:03:25.920> this<00:03:26.190> orchid<00:03:26.670> I<00:03:26.790> will<00:03:27.120> do<00:03:27.300> a<00:03:27.330> more

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
blooms from this orchid I will do a more

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.840 
blooms from this orchid I will do a more
extensive<00:03:28.080> video<00:03:28.410> and<00:03:28.860> I<00:03:29.130> will<00:03:29.340> be<00:03:29.370> able<00:03:29.700> to

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
extensive video and I will be able to

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.240 
extensive video and I will be able to
tell<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.209> more<00:03:30.239> about<00:03:30.450> its<00:03:30.930> care<00:03:31.320> if<00:03:31.830> it<00:03:32.070> does

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
tell you more about its care if it does

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.800 
tell you more about its care if it does
good<00:03:32.520> so<00:03:33.000> far<00:03:33.270> so<00:03:33.510> good

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
good so far so good

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.900 
good so far so good
