inspired<00:03:33.260> in<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:33.709> 80s<00:03:34.160> so<00:03:35.060> at<00:03:35.360> the<00:03:35.480> physiques

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
inspired in the 80s so at the physiques

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.080 
inspired in the 80s so at the physiques
in<00:03:36.110> the<00:03:36.200> 80s<00:03:36.530> because<00:03:36.709> I<00:03:37.040> looked<00:03:37.220> at<00:03:37.340> it<00:03:37.489> that's

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
in the 80s because I looked at it that's

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.960 
in the 80s because I looked at it that's
how<00:03:38.269> I<00:03:38.299> can<00:03:38.660> look<00:03:38.840> like<00:03:39.079> if<00:03:39.350> I<00:03:39.860> look<00:03:40.040> at<00:03:40.190> today<00:03:40.579> I

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
how I can look like if I look at today I

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.610 
how I can look like if I look at today I
think<00:03:41.329> if<00:03:41.450> a<00:03:41.480> lot<00:03:41.630> of<00:03:41.870> people<00:03:42.170> have<00:03:42.290> a<00:03:42.380> hard

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
think if a lot of people have a hard

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.880 
think if a lot of people have a hard
time<00:03:42.799> looking<00:03:43.010> at<00:03:43.340> some<00:03:43.579> of<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:43.850> guys<00:03:44.060> today

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
time looking at some of the guys today

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.650 
time looking at some of the guys today
you<00:03:45.890> know<00:03:46.040> you<00:03:46.730> have<00:03:46.820> to<00:03:46.880> understand<00:03:47.299> people

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
you know you have to understand people

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.380 
you know you have to understand people
were<00:03:47.810> big<00:03:48.049> when<00:03:48.230> they<00:03:48.380> were<00:03:48.440> 220<00:03:49.340> 230<00:03:49.730> pounds

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
were big when they were 220 230 pounds

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.569 
were big when they were 220 230 pounds
now<00:03:50.810> people<00:03:51.260> actually<00:03:51.410> shorter<00:03:52.220> and<00:03:52.400> they

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
now people actually shorter and they

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.900 
now people actually shorter and they
weigh<00:03:52.790> already<00:03:53.120> 260<00:03:54.019> pounds<00:03:54.440> so<00:03:54.920> I<00:03:54.950> think<00:03:55.130> for

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
weigh already 260 pounds so I think for

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.030 
weigh already 260 pounds so I think for
some<00:03:56.090> people<00:03:56.480> sometimes<00:03:56.720> they<00:03:56.930> they<00:03:57.320> they

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
some people sometimes they they they

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.220 
some people sometimes they they they
don't<00:03:58.250> they<00:03:58.880> they<00:03:59.180> cannot<00:03:59.420> relate<00:03:59.840> to<00:04:00.079> that

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
don't they they cannot relate to that

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.009 
don't they they cannot relate to that
look<00:04:00.650> all<00:04:00.890> the<00:04:01.220> time<00:04:01.430> because<00:04:01.630> there's<00:04:02.630> a<00:04:02.720> time

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
look all the time because there's a time

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.500 
look all the time because there's a time
when<00:04:03.170> I<00:04:03.320> could<00:04:03.560> say<00:04:03.739> when<00:04:04.310> I<00:04:04.489> train<00:04:04.850> hard<00:04:05.150> I<00:04:05.299> can

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
when I could say when I train hard I can

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.020 
when I could say when I train hard I can
look<00:04:05.660> like<00:04:05.720> this<00:04:06.110> so<00:04:06.829> I<00:04:06.859> don't<00:04:07.250> think<00:04:07.519> today<00:04:07.850> a

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
look like this so I don't think today a

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.080 
look like this so I don't think today a
lot<00:04:08.359> of<00:04:08.510> young<00:04:09.350> people<00:04:09.769> can<00:04:09.950> say<00:04:10.190> even<00:04:10.820> without

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
lot of young people can say even without

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.479 
lot of young people can say even without
training<00:04:11.480> they<00:04:11.900> think<00:04:12.170> I<00:04:12.380> can't<00:04:12.769> look<00:04:13.220> like

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
training they think I can't look like

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.670 
training they think I can't look like
that<00:04:13.730> you<00:04:14.209> have<00:04:14.420> to<00:04:14.540> understand<00:04:14.959> that<00:04:15.079> to<00:04:15.500> keep

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
that you have to understand that to keep

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.860 
that you have to understand that to keep
poram<00:04:16.100> people<00:04:16.640> motivated<00:04:17.239> you<00:04:17.419> have<00:04:17.570> to<00:04:17.750> have

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
poram people motivated you have to have

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.839 
poram people motivated you have to have
a<00:04:17.900> look<00:04:18.200> where<00:04:18.650> people<00:04:18.950> can<00:04:19.130> relate<00:04:19.459> to<00:04:19.640> and

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:19.849 
a look where people can relate to and

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:20.509 
a look where people can relate to and
where<00:04:20.299> they

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
where they

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.089 
where they
get<00:04:20.910> inspired<00:04:21.299> to<00:04:21.509> that<00:04:22.049> they<00:04:22.199> can<00:04:22.470> reach<00:04:22.800> it

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
get inspired to that they can reach it

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:25.909 
get inspired to that they can reach it
was<00:04:23.370> hard<00:04:23.610> work<00:04:23.940> and<00:04:24.270> you<00:04:25.169> know<00:04:25.319> I<00:04:25.650> don't<00:04:25.710> know

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
was hard work and you know I don't know

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.710 
was hard work and you know I don't know
some<00:04:26.250> people<00:04:26.280> think<00:04:26.729> first<00:04:27.210> thing<00:04:27.449> when<00:04:27.599> they

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
some people think first thing when they

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.450 
some people think first thing when they
come<00:04:28.020> to<00:04:28.199> work<00:04:28.349> is<00:04:28.500> like<00:04:28.590> oh<00:04:28.830> that's<00:04:29.190> all

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
come to work is like oh that's all

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.170 
come to work is like oh that's all
supplements<00:04:30.360> oh<00:04:30.479> it's<00:04:30.659> chemicals<00:04:31.500> so<00:04:32.190> even

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
supplements oh it's chemicals so even

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.270 
supplements oh it's chemicals so even
though<00:04:33.270> it's<00:04:33.449> hard<00:04:33.659> work<00:04:34.020> but<00:04:34.680> I<00:04:34.740> think<00:04:34.889> that

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
though it's hard work but I think that

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.070 
though it's hard work but I think that
sometimes<00:04:35.699> a<00:04:35.819> problem<00:04:36.180> that<00:04:36.360> people<00:04:36.539> relate

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
sometimes a problem that people relate

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.450 
sometimes a problem that people relate
to<00:04:37.110> body<00:04:37.560> building<00:04:37.860> today<00:04:38.220> you<00:04:39.060> know<00:04:39.240> so<00:04:40.460> you

know<00:04:41.490> I<00:04:41.819> mean<00:04:42.060> I<00:04:42.180> think<00:04:42.240> that<00:04:42.449> is<00:04:42.690> good<00:04:42.870> just<00:04:43.080> a

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
know I mean I think that is good just a

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:44.749 
know I mean I think that is good just a
difference<00:04:43.620> and<00:04:43.800> people<00:04:43.830> have<00:04:44.220> a<00:04:44.280> hard<00:04:44.550> time

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 
difference and people have a hard time

know just hard work I think you know
that's<00:04:51.330> a<00:04:51.539> problem<00:04:51.900> as<00:04:52.020> a<00:04:52.050> sport<00:04:52.379> today<00:04:52.560> what's

resolved<00:05:15.659> genetics<00:05:16.050> will<00:05:16.199> get<00:05:16.409> there<00:05:16.590> and

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
resolved genetics will get there and

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.080 
resolved genetics will get there and
there's<00:05:16.979> nothing<00:05:17.370> in<00:05:17.430> a<00:05:17.550> world<00:05:17.759> what<00:05:17.880> gives

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
there's nothing in a world what gives

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.749 
there's nothing in a world what gives
you<00:05:18.240> that<00:05:18.270> I've<00:05:18.930> seen<00:05:19.379> people<00:05:19.889> with<00:05:19.919> no

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 
you that I've seen people with no

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:22.700 
you that I've seen people with no
genetic<00:05:21.300> trying<00:05:21.659> everything<00:05:22.080> they<00:05:22.319> can<00:05:22.650> in

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
genetic trying everything they can in

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.350 
genetic trying everything they can in
their<00:05:22.919> life<00:05:23.099> they<00:05:23.280> almost<00:05:23.460> killed<00:05:23.819> themselves

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
their life they almost killed themselves

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.749 
their life they almost killed themselves
and<00:05:24.509> that<00:05:25.020> is<00:05:25.440> obviously<00:05:25.979> I<00:05:26.069> think<00:05:26.400> the<00:05:26.520> worst

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 
and that is obviously I think the worst

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:28.879 
and that is obviously I think the worst
you<00:05:27.000> know<00:05:27.060> you<00:05:27.180> really<00:05:27.479> have<00:05:27.690> to<00:05:27.810> see<00:05:28.020> ok<00:05:28.620> where

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
you know you really have to see ok where

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:29.659 
you know you really have to see ok where
are<00:05:29.009> my<00:05:29.130> limits

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
are my limits

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.370 
are my limits
you<00:05:29.789> know<00:05:29.909> how<00:05:30.090> far<00:05:30.360> can<00:05:30.599> I<00:05:30.719> go<00:05:30.900> and<00:05:31.050> how<00:05:31.169> far

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
you know how far can I go and how far

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.010 
you know how far can I go and how far
can<00:05:31.560> I<00:05:31.650> take<00:05:31.889> it<00:05:31.919> and<00:05:32.310> then<00:05:32.880> obviously<00:05:33.090> in<00:05:33.630> my

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
can I take it and then obviously in my

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.279 
can I take it and then obviously in my
opinion<00:05:34.500> 70%<00:05:35.400> is<00:05:35.610> definitely<00:05:36.090> nutrition<00:05:36.719> I

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.289 
opinion 70% is definitely nutrition I

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:40.430 
opinion 70% is definitely nutrition I
would<00:05:37.800> say<00:05:37.949> maybe<00:05:38.279> 60/40<00:05:39.240> 70/30<00:05:39.750> percent

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
would say maybe 60/40 70/30 percent

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.100 
would say maybe 60/40 70/30 percent
around<00:05:40.740> that<00:05:40.889> area<00:05:41.159> that<00:05:41.310> is<00:05:41.490> ok<00:05:42.180> it's<00:05:42.419> like<00:05:42.659> 60

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
around that area that is ok it's like 60

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.749 
around that area that is ok it's like 60
70<00:05:43.469> percent<00:05:43.949> true<00:05:44.900> food<00:05:46.099> nutrition<00:05:47.099> and<00:05:47.130> then

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 
70 percent true food nutrition and then

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:51.110 
70 percent true food nutrition and then
40<00:05:48.659> to<00:05:48.900> 30<00:05:49.259> percent<00:05:49.710> or<00:05:49.949> 30<00:05:50.219> to<00:05:50.400> 40<00:05:50.639> percent<00:05:50.759> is

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
40 to 30 percent or 30 to 40 percent is

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.659 
40 to 30 percent or 30 to 40 percent is
probably<00:05:51.810> working<00:05:52.500> out<00:05:52.860> and<00:05:53.159> you<00:05:53.340> know<00:05:53.460> the

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
probably working out and you know the

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.969 
probably working out and you know the
intensity<00:05:54.150> obviously<00:05:54.569> but<00:05:54.990> I<00:05:55.229> definitely

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
intensity obviously but I definitely

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:57.920 
intensity obviously but I definitely
have<00:05:56.250> a<00:05:56.279> big<00:05:56.520> thing<00:05:56.819> with<00:05:57.000> the<00:05:57.150> nutrition<00:05:57.630> you

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
have a big thing with the nutrition you

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.809 
have a big thing with the nutrition you
can<00:05:58.139> train<00:05:58.409> as<00:05:58.560> hard<00:05:58.590> if<00:05:58.889> you<00:05:59.009> want<00:05:59.190> if<00:05:59.460> you

00:05:59.809 --> 00:05:59.819 
can train as hard if you want if you

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:01.909 
can train as hard if you want if you
don't<00:06:00.000> eat<00:06:00.389> right<00:06:00.419> don't<00:06:01.080> have<00:06:01.259> the<00:06:01.380> nutrition

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
don't eat right don't have the nutrition

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.189 
don't eat right don't have the nutrition
right<00:06:02.069> and<00:06:02.370> everything<00:06:02.759> set<00:06:03.090> perfectly

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:04.199
