00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.920 

you

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.199 

now<00:03:43.590> we<00:03:43.650> got<00:03:43.890> our<00:03:44.010> power<00:03:44.280> supply<00:03:44.670> screw<00:03:45.030> back

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
now we got our power supply screw back

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.410 
now we got our power supply screw back
in<00:03:45.450> or<00:03:45.989> get<00:03:46.439> started<00:03:46.829> on<00:03:46.920> connectors<00:03:47.430> first

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
in or get started on connectors first

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.270 
in or get started on connectors first
there's<00:03:48.989> a<00:03:49.109> 2010<00:03:49.650> man<00:03:50.189> connector<00:03:51.379> and<00:03:52.379> then<00:03:53.159> we

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
there's a 2010 man connector and then we

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.899 
there's a 2010 man connector and then we
got<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.579> fork<00:03:53.879> in<00:03:54.090> auxiliary<00:03:55.609> let's<00:03:56.609> start

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
got the fork in auxiliary let's start

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:01.899 
got the fork in auxiliary let's start
out<00:03:57.090> with<00:03:58.049> the<00:03:58.109> 20<00:03:58.650> pin<00:03:59.180> it<00:04:00.180> goes<00:04:00.389> right<00:04:01.019> in

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:01.909 
out with the 20 pin it goes right in

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:06.979 
out with the 20 pin it goes right in
here<00:04:03.409> and<00:04:05.180> there's<00:04:06.180> really<00:04:06.329> only<00:04:06.450> one<00:04:06.659> way<00:04:06.840> you

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
here and there's really only one way you

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.520 
here and there's really only one way you
can<00:04:07.200> put<00:04:07.409> these<00:04:07.560> in<00:04:07.859> so<00:04:08.819> if<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.150> mess<00:04:09.329> up<00:04:09.540> let's

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
can put these in so if you mess up let's

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.770 
can put these in so if you mess up let's
take<00:04:10.709> it<00:04:10.859> out<00:04:11.010> and<00:04:11.310> put<00:04:11.400> it<00:04:12.329> right<00:04:12.359> back<00:04:12.599> in

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.999 

it's<00:04:15.780> kind<00:04:16.079> of<00:04:16.169> hard<00:04:16.410> to<00:04:16.519> damage<00:04:17.519> or<00:04:17.729> anything

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:19.009 
it's kind of hard to damage or anything

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:23.390 
it's kind of hard to damage or anything
so<00:04:20.009> only<00:04:20.220> fit<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:20.699> one<00:04:20.880> way<00:04:21.889> and<00:04:22.889> we<00:04:23.099> got<00:04:23.250> this

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
so only fit the one way and we got this

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:30.980 
so only fit the one way and we got this
one<00:04:23.550> over<00:04:23.849> here<00:04:26.509> and<00:04:29.389> it<00:04:30.389> just<00:04:30.419> maybe<00:04:30.780> get

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
one over here and it just maybe get

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:45.800 
one over here and it just maybe get
power<00:04:31.789> going<00:04:32.789> back<00:04:33.180> to<00:04:34.160> the<00:04:35.160> DVD<00:04:35.699> drive<00:04:35.880> here

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:56.080 

you

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:10.610 

your<00:04:57.090> eyes<00:05:08.689> kind<00:05:09.689> of<00:05:09.719> put<00:05:09.870> all<00:05:09.960> the<00:05:10.080> wires<00:05:10.289> back

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
your eyes kind of put all the wires back

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.600 
your eyes kind of put all the wires back
together<00:05:12.050> have<00:05:13.050> an<00:05:13.199> extra<00:05:13.620> value<00:05:13.889> that's<00:05:14.340> not

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
together have an extra value that's not

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:20.589 
together have an extra value that's not
being<00:05:14.849> used<00:05:15.469> just<00:05:16.469> stuff<00:05:16.860> right<00:05:17.159> in<00:05:17.370> there<00:05:19.340> and

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:20.599 
being used just stuff right in there and

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:23.959 
being used just stuff right in there and
that<00:05:21.599> is<00:05:21.810> basically<00:05:22.020> hit<00:05:22.740> that's<00:05:23.610> all<00:05:23.819> you

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:23.969 
that is basically hit that's all you

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:25.760 
that is basically hit that's all you
have<00:05:24.180> to<00:05:24.330> do<00:05:24.479> to<00:05:24.719> replace<00:05:25.020> your<00:05:25.199> cars<00:05:25.379> flying

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
have to do to replace your cars flying

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:33.409 
have to do to replace your cars flying
through<00:05:26.159> here<00:05:27.229> so<00:05:28.229> you<00:05:28.529> will<00:05:32.090> the<00:05:33.090> side

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
through here so you will the side

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:40.610 
through here so you will the side
backbone<00:05:37.189> and<00:05:38.300> we're<00:05:39.300> finished<00:05:39.719> let's<00:05:40.349> power

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
backbone and we're finished let's power

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.269 
backbone and we're finished let's power
it<00:05:40.830> up<00:05:40.919> and<00:05:41.129> see<00:05:41.279> how<00:05:41.430> it<00:05:41.520> works<00:05:42.409> all<00:05:43.409> right<00:05:43.620> we

got<00:05:44.430> everything<00:05:44.699> fixed<00:05:45.089> on<00:05:45.360> computer<00:05:45.870> let's

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
got everything fixed on computer let's

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.739 
got everything fixed on computer let's
fire<00:05:46.349> it<00:05:46.379> up<00:05:46.680> and<00:05:46.860> see<00:05:46.949> if<00:05:47.129> it<00:05:47.219> works<00:05:50.749> let's

lighten up it lives we got a working

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:02.529 
lighten up it lives we got a working
computer<00:05:56.099> again<00:06:00.169> HP<00:06:01.169> Pavilion<00:06:01.740> is<00:06:02.039> working

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:02.539 
computer again HP Pavilion is working

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:09.050 
computer again HP Pavilion is working
the<00:06:03.539> pun<00:06:03.750> smart<00:06:04.610> we<00:06:05.610> run<00:06:05.759> on<00:06:05.849> windows<00:06:06.180> XP<00:06:08.060> so

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
the pun smart we run on windows XP so

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.139 
the pun smart we run on windows XP so
that's<00:06:09.330> all<00:06:09.539> from<00:06:10.379> AES<00:06:10.680> computers<00:06:11.310> remember

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:12.149 
that's all from AES computers remember

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:17.000 
that's all from AES computers remember
in<00:06:12.750> computer<00:06:13.199> suck<00:06:13.550> see<00:06:14.550> you<00:06:14.639> next<00:06:14.789> time
