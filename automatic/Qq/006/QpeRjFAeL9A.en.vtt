00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.810
 And then Maroca said Marola, beauty galera. 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.800
 this is video 3 of the series 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.660
 demystifying popular beliefs about 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.620
 academy and today we will talk about 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.629
 symmetry 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.420
 Come on, guys, without wasting any time. Come on. 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:41.660
 know what the symmetry of the body symmetry 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.089
 the word that comes from the Greek and means 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.879
 proportion of harmonies resulting from 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.890
 combinations and proportions 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.650
 on one side as the other being more 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.140
 of course a medical object is one that is 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.109
 identical to its reflection already the object 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.660
 asymmetric is an object different from your 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.649
 reflected image is our body is well 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.510
 asymmetrical 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.850
 if you take a picture of your face for 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.380
 example of dividing in half you will see 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.929
 which from one side to the other does not exist 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.500
 a huge difference and that's no problem 

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:15.330
 face what will say then the rest of the body 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.490
 pectoral arm and legs are well 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.340
 different from each other visually 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.039
 as in the ratio of size and this 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.990
 results in its ultimate strength and endurance 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:27.210
 of each arm and each leg 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.430
 and that's why you have more strength in 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.229
 one arm than in the other and that is why 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.479
 you have more strength in the grip 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.430
 because their proportions are 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.380
 different but rest assured that this 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.360
 is normal and asymmetry of the body 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.759
 It's very difficult for you to get a 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.979
 balance between one side and another to 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.720
 This happens, you're going to have to be years old. 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.119
 and years of training there you are 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.070
 asking how it is possible to correct 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.350
 these differences of my body 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.240
 good first of all you have to know 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.740
 which side of your body is your weak point 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.930
 in the mirror gives you a sense 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.899
 but it is very common if you are a test in the 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.770
 Your Shoulder Arm Shoulder Right You Greater 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.640
 stronger 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.200
 in the same way for the right-handed leg 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.799
 consequently your 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.650
 support will be stronger greater knowing which 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:15.900
 It is your weak point that you must do is 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.910
 back a training that priorities 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.560
 show starts the week training 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.800
 first your point muscles 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.870
 weak and left 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.850
 because you have more volume for the rest 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.980
 of the week the importance of starting 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.350
 week with weaknesses is due to 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.190
 next you get the total energy in the 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.350
 Monday 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.740
 on the weekend you analyzed well 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.570
 rest well then your body recovered 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.210
 So, you have to get in 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.130
 head repeat showed weak first 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.530
 at the end of the week 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.730
 how much longer are you wearing 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.980
 plays the musicians and already has a 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.990
 development and so you 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.950
 gets balance in your body 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.660
 leaving spoke 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.720
 each passing day his income 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.420
 It's coming down on Friday, on Saturday. 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.740
 you'll just busted text from downtown and 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.960
 you can not have that performance 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.580
 more in training and consequently can 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.770
 make sure that your recovery 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.690
 muscle will be much slower and 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.450
 the best way for you to develop these 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.150
 muscles is more upset by using 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.820
 unilateral machines because you will have to 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.310
 use individual strength on each side 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.100
 each muscle then forcing its muscle 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.920
 weak to turn around to lift him 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.380
 He made alone without help from the foundation not 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.280
 are then recommended for the simple fact 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.200
 of your body 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.420
 use your much stronger to 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.670
 compensate the strength of the weaker motor and 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.800
 so your strongest muscle will always be 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.360
 greater by the simple fact of it is always 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.400
 doing more strength than others 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.739
 another interesting tip would also be 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.110
 Do you do more reps your looking for? 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.480
 For example, you have a weak bishop. 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.400
 weaker than the other do so with 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.950
 repeat first with it 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.220
 then you start the normal series now 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:57.610
 If you reach the tenth repetition you will 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.950
 feel much more bampi and will have forced 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.080
 much more and slave service then where 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.830
 you will match in strength and size 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.140
 like this this way 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.660
 to the bar know that the best workout 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.250
 For you, it 's neither sweet nor sweet. 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.920
 You have to look in the mirror and see 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.560
 where you need the proportion for your 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.420
 smell in your symmetry looks good gives a 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.340
 good structure of your body you have to 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.019
 see where you have a weak spot where you do not have 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.420
 that 's' start had always gives 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.010
 importance what he says is worth more 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.170
 you gain two pounds on your points 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.370
 weak you gain 10 pounds in the 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.620
 general in your body 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.200
 that is some forms will continue 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.630
 concentration continues the phrase 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.180
 coins and almost no difference 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.550
 I find the training that works for you in 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.770
 workout you recover faster 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.780
 The workout you feel most gains does not 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.360
 Believe it is done you have to train with 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.420
 The Triceps Coast In Training With Addictions 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.090
 There is no such thing as isolation. 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:57.120
 muscle grouping is impossible in the 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.730
 bodybuilding you went to insulate only the like 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.340
 you use a lot of muscle doing a 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:05.220
 simple movement example pulling apras 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.340
 Shore handle for developing breast 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.300
 shoulder grips triceps a squat grip 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.550
 nominal 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.010
 then there is no such thing as sounding the 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.740
 grouping muscle zola the bust you 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.840
 You think you 're just using a musician, you're not 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.750
 Are you using various muscles? 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.850
 musician then invent training that does 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.700
 favoring your weak muscles does not 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:29.340
 has this biceps coast and sells a 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.470
 workout that plays very weak for you and 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.460
 balance and make a good symmetry in the 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.220
 your shape 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.050
 So you start the week as weak. 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.610
 In the end you put the songs that 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.740
 you already have a better development 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.870
 now another important point is that the 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.850
 symmetry does not mean having arms and 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.010
 same size same legs on 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.930
 bodybuilders for example athletes are 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.120
 played by its overall development 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.220
 For example, it's no use having a 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.330
 huge platter in the time of antónio as well 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.390
 developed 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.420
 it's no use having a huge chest 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:00.860
 I'm not back that adds meaning 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.870
 You have to develop your body. 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.390
 proportionally in full by 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.160
 to see the harmony between the 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.960
 muscles and has no negative points 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.000
 of the population 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.460
 even if you are not an athlete you 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.560
 should seek balance corporation in 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.960
 gym what else is it you think 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.760
 in the cultural forum giants screens knows the 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.630
 workshop that only comes back in 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.030
 ridiculous 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.980
 You are now a beginner in this event. 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.470
 business that wants to correct 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.540
 body wants to correct what I hear fucking 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:32.270
 first will create a carcass goes 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.190
 gain a legal mass develops won 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.900
 arrive for everyone and see where it has point 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.360
 weak for you to correct 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.280
 we are already making clear correction 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.170
 asymmetry is not for beginners 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.870
 beauty you 're a beginner should think 

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:47.120
 first guy on a diet will learn 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.220
 training in search and research in our 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.810
 summer you will learn to train and that's it 

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.000
 there ball forward then you will 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.800
 learn to correct the asymmetry of your 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.930
 body we're talking about then 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.090
 People, this video is more for us to have. 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.950
 a notion of what asymmetry is what 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.810
 correct the asymmetry a weaker side 

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:05.000
 on the other is what we mean 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:07.760
 this video was already the video of today is 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.800
 This is what we expect to help you 

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.240
 who accompanies us and that we are 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.520
 preparing a good material still 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.040
 processes the series that goes there 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:20.120
 help a lot you beauty is so if you 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:23.010
 Enjoyed the mobile web video that good there.

 help us there strengthen that the more 

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.520
 far more enrolled for us 

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.240
 It is better but recognition of our 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.800
 job 

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.890
 we thank heart are 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:35.130
 together in this fucking europe we sworn 

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:36.870
 the same pension there in Nassau fighting 

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:39.410
 against the time for much 

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.410
 parsley
