in<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.350> vigilance<00:00:19.770> it's<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.490> previous

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
in the vigilance it's a the previous

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.720 
in the vigilance it's a the previous
movie<00:00:21.210> as<00:00:21.600> I've<00:00:22.350> added<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.800> strong<00:00:23.160> back<00:00:23.400> into

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
movie as I've added a strong back into

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.000 
movie as I've added a strong back into
here<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.269> give<00:00:24.750> some<00:00:24.960> more<00:00:25.080> stiffness<00:00:25.470> because

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
here to give some more stiffness because

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.589 
here to give some more stiffness because
we're<00:00:26.160> only<00:00:26.279> clamped<00:00:26.789> back<00:00:26.970> in<00:00:27.210> this<00:00:27.359> section

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
we're only clamped back in this section

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.870 
we're only clamped back in this section
so<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.410> was<00:00:28.769> when<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.130> touched<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.640> there

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
so that was when I touched that there

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.820 
so that was when I touched that there
was<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.000> bit<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.359> wobble<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.380> brought<00:00:31.679> the

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
was a bit of a wobble so I brought the

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.819 
was a bit of a wobble so I brought the
other<00:00:31.949> bar<00:00:32.520> from<00:00:32.940> from<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.690> table<00:00:33.930> I've<00:00:34.620> added

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
other bar from from the table I've added

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.860 
other bar from from the table I've added
a<00:00:35.100> strong<00:00:35.399> back<00:00:35.610> onto<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.540> we<00:00:36.690> know

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
a strong back onto it so that we know

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.069 
a strong back onto it so that we know
deflection<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.059> see<00:00:39.059> there<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.600> not

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
deflection and see there this is not

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.799 
deflection and see there this is not
even<00:00:40.230> touching<00:00:40.620> on<00:00:41.010> there<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.180> that's<00:00:42.329> working

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
even touching on there so that's working

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.250 
even touching on there so that's working
beautifully<00:00:43.050> I've<00:00:43.530> sinned<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.460> up<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:45.260> we're

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
beautifully I've sinned it up and we're

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.190 
beautifully I've sinned it up and we're
about<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.530> progress<00:00:47.489> with<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:47.989> drilling<00:00:48.989> so

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
about to progress with that drilling so

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.850 
about to progress with that drilling so
here<00:00:49.350> we<00:00:49.440> go<00:00:49.610> and<00:00:50.610> we<00:00:50.820> were<00:00:51.030> running<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.390> high

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
here we go and we were running on high

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.439 
here we go and we were running on high
so<00:00:52.860> we're<00:00:53.070> running<00:00:53.340> on<00:00:53.460> about<00:00:53.670> all<00:00:54.149> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
so we're running on about all the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.549 
so we're running on about all the
maximum<00:00:55.730> is<00:00:57.530> 510<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:59.780> we<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:00.960> hand<00:01:01.199> feeding

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
maximum is 510 and we just hand feeding

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:16.590 
maximum is 510 and we just hand feeding
it

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.750 

all<00:01:16.950> have<00:01:17.950> a<00:01:17.979> bird

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.740 

these<00:01:38.660> are<00:01:38.870> the<00:01:38.960> bushes<00:01:39.320> that<00:01:39.350> ago<00:01:39.740> idea

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.270 

sort<00:01:43.990> of<00:01:44.050> a<00:01:44.140> strip

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
sort of a strip

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.600 
sort of a strip
let's<00:01:47.280> really<00:01:47.490> fit<00:01:47.730> in<00:01:47.850> there<00:01:48.060> beautifully

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
let's really fit in there beautifully

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.550 
let's really fit in there beautifully
that's<00:01:50.610> exactly<00:01:50.760> what<00:01:51.300> we<00:01:51.480> want<00:01:51.660> so<00:01:52.380> we'll

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
that's exactly what we want so we'll

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.500 
that's exactly what we want so we'll
continue<00:01:52.770> onwards<00:01:53.400> or<00:01:53.700> complete<00:01:54.330> that
