00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
the San Antonio Spurs I think it was a

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.670 
the San Antonio Spurs I think it was a
well-deserved<00:01:06.180> win<00:01:06.420> even<00:01:06.720> though<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.470> heat

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
well-deserved win even though the heat

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.440 
well-deserved win even though the heat
lost<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.070> very<00:01:08.340> embarrassing<00:01:08.939> fashion<00:01:09.150> which

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
lost in very embarrassing fashion which

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.630 
lost in very embarrassing fashion which
is<00:01:09.570> fine<00:01:09.780> I'm<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.020> cowboy<00:01:10.320> fan<00:01:10.400> rolled<00:01:11.400> off<00:01:11.610> of

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.030 
is fine I'm a cowboy fan rolled off of
me<00:01:11.909> like<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.210> wasn't<00:01:12.390> nothing<00:01:12.540> but<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.650> will<00:01:13.830> say

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
me like it wasn't nothing but I will say

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.620 
me like it wasn't nothing but I will say
this<00:01:14.070> i<00:01:14.400> think<00:01:14.580> every<00:01:15.060> team<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.420> NBA

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
this i think every team in the NBA

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.810 
this i think every team in the NBA
really<00:01:16.259> needs<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.590> take<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.799> look<00:01:17.130> at<00:01:17.310> how<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
really needs to take a look at how the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.810 
really needs to take a look at how the
Spurs<00:01:18.420> played<00:01:19.020> their<00:01:19.770> game<00:01:20.070> because<00:01:20.670> it

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
Spurs played their game because it

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.060 
Spurs played their game because it
wasn't<00:01:21.240> about<00:01:21.330> just<00:01:21.540> having<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.320> star<00:01:22.680> on<00:01:22.710> their

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
wasn't about just having a star on their

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.399 
wasn't about just having a star on their
team<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.460> was<00:01:23.549> definitely<00:01:23.880> about<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:25.170> team

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
team it was definitely about the team

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.080 
team it was definitely about the team
and<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.740> way<00:01:26.040> they<00:01:26.250> moved<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.610> ball<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.030> then

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
and the way they moved the ball and then

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.910 
and the way they moved the ball and then
Miami<00:01:27.420> was<00:01:27.600> completely<00:01:28.259> incapable<00:01:28.530> of

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
Miami was completely incapable of

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.310 
Miami was completely incapable of
contesting<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.880> threes<00:01:30.150> or<00:01:30.360> dealing<00:01:31.110> with

any of the movement that they had that

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.850 
any of the movement that they had that
