probably done a hair felt like or so I
decided<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.410> try<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.710> try<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.920> switch<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.370> up<00:01:14.610> a

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
decided to try and try to switch it up a

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.150 
decided to try and try to switch it up a
little<00:01:15.300> bit<00:01:15.510> so<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.350> one<00:01:16.560> side<00:01:16.590> I'm<00:01:16.920> braiding

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
little bit so on one side I'm braiding

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.560 
little bit so on one side I'm braiding
one<00:01:17.490> braid<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:17.940> then<00:01:18.030> on<00:01:18.120> the<00:01:18.180> other<00:01:18.210> side<00:01:18.390> I

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
one braid and then on the other side I

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.540 
one braid and then on the other side I
did<00:01:18.840> three<00:01:19.260> braids<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.950> then<00:01:20.130> I'm<00:01:20.220> gonna<00:01:20.340> take

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
did three braids and then I'm gonna take

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.310 
did three braids and then I'm gonna take
those<00:01:20.760> three<00:01:21.120> braids<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.690> braid<00:01:22.080> them

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
those three braids and braid them

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.780 
those three braids and braid them
together<00:01:22.620> so<00:01:23.840> that's<00:01:24.840> pretty<00:01:25.050> simple<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.740> mean

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
together so that's pretty simple I mean

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.430 
together so that's pretty simple I mean
it's<00:01:26.790> really<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.300> really<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.660> it<00:01:27.960> looks<00:01:27.990> more

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
it's really it really is it looks more

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.810 
it's really it really is it looks more
difficult<00:01:28.830> than<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.160> but<00:01:29.369> it's<00:01:29.520> really<00:01:29.670> not

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
difficult than it is but it's really not

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.060 
difficult than it is but it's really not
so<00:01:30.690> I'm<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:30.900> braiding<00:01:31.110> those<00:01:31.350> together<00:01:31.590> and

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
so I'm just braiding those together and

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.999 
so I'm just braiding those together and
then<00:01:32.820> I'm<00:01:33.180> going<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.509> take<00:01:33.840> both<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.410> those<00:01:34.560> and

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
then I'm going to take both of those and

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.670 
then I'm going to take both of those and
pull<00:01:35.640> them<00:01:35.820> back<00:01:35.850> on<00:01:36.479> either<00:01:36.900> side<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.229> my<00:01:37.470> head

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
pull them back on either side of my head

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.280 
pull them back on either side of my head
and<00:01:37.920> pin<00:01:38.280> them<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.729> across<00:01:39.390> motions<00:01:39.960> now<00:01:40.259> I

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
and pin them in across motions now I

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.140 
and pin them in across motions now I
couldn't<00:01:40.650> really<00:01:40.770> see<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.369> match<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:41.970> the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
couldn't really see the match so the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.389 
couldn't really see the match so the
pins<00:01:42.360> don't<00:01:42.810> need<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.050> sec<00:01:43.320> good<00:01:43.470> but<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.280> guys

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
pins don't need a sec good but you guys

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.120 
pins don't need a sec good but you guys
get<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.670> gist<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.210> spouts<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:48.950> now<00:01:49.950> I'm

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
taking my hair and pulling it all to one
