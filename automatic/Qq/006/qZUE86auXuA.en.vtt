hair<00:01:39.680> is<00:01:39.890> protein<00:01:40.460> sensitive<00:01:41.270> so<00:01:41.480> even<00:01:41.810> though

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
hair is protein sensitive so even though

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.280 
hair is protein sensitive so even though
that<00:01:42.650> was<00:01:42.890> a<00:01:43.070> light<00:01:43.610> protein<00:01:44.270> treatment<00:01:44.840> my

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
that was a light protein treatment my

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.740 
that was a light protein treatment my
hair<00:01:45.500> couldn't<00:01:45.800> take<00:01:45.980> it<00:01:46.060> when<00:01:47.060> I<00:01:47.270> have<00:01:47.570> too

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
hair couldn't take it when I have too

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.860 
hair couldn't take it when I have too
much<00:01:47.780> protein<00:01:48.200> in<00:01:48.860> my<00:01:49.070> hair<00:01:49.660> that's<00:01:50.660> when<00:01:50.840> I

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
much protein in my hair that's when I

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.080 
much protein in my hair that's when I
get<00:01:51.140> tangles<00:01:51.980> that's<00:01:52.520> when<00:01:52.670> i<00:01:52.730> get<00:01:52.910> that

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
get tangles that's when i get that

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.120 
get tangles that's when i get that
coarse<00:01:53.570> texture<00:01:54.170> that's<00:01:54.650> when<00:01:54.890> i<00:01:54.950> get

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
coarse texture that's when i get

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.850 
coarse texture that's when i get
breakage<00:01:55.790> so<00:01:56.300> i<00:01:56.600> tend<00:01:57.050> to<00:01:57.200> stay<00:01:57.470> away<00:01:57.500> from

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
breakage so i tend to stay away from

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.660 
breakage so i tend to stay away from
protea<00:01:58.580> other<00:01:58.940> than<00:01:59.180> that

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
protea other than that

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.230 
protea other than that
it<00:01:59.970> has<00:02:00.180> been<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:00.869> simple<00:02:01.380> like<00:02:02.090> everything<00:02:03.090> is

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
it has been so simple like everything is

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.740 
it has been so simple like everything is
going<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:03.840> smooth<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.729> treat<00:02:05.729> my<00:02:05.970> hair<00:02:06.240> as<00:02:06.450> if

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750

it's<00:02:07.020> one<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.710> don't<00:02:08.220> think<00:02:08.459> oh<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.270> my

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
it's one I don't think oh this is my

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.600 
it's one I don't think oh this is my
natural<00:02:09.479> texture<00:02:10.380> let<00:02:10.560> me<00:02:10.679> be<00:02:10.860> extra<00:02:11.280> sense

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
natural texture let me be extra sense
