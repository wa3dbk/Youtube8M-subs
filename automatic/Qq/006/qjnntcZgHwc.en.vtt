00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.790
 with this video what I'm trying to do is put 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.590
 in relief a series of practices or 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.390
 interesting and important issues 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.730
 that we have to take into account at the time of 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.869
 perform a cutting independently 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.960
 of the species that we are using 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:28.539
 to remove those cuttings or cuttings 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:32.040
 in this case I have a branch of a branch 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:34.930
 love a blackberry with a couple of leaves 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.660
 and this is the size because it would be more or less 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.720
 the appropriate about 10 centimeters between 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.519
 10 and 15 centimeters would not be bad either 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.420
 first of all what should we do 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:50.080
 eliminate the lower leaves if taking 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.530
 in mind that we should never harm that 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.920
 bud 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:58.309
 and we can also make the cut of 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.969
 this other top sheet and also 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.430
 taking into account not to damage that yolk 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:05.869
 we should leave about two centimeters 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.540
 even a little bit more like in this case 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.670
 about three centimeters above the 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.860
 terminal bud that will be the one that gives 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.610
 origin to that new plant in the part 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.500
 aerial of course and below the yolk 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.840
 lower we could find that 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.230
 there are more yolks within the piece that we have 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.750
 chosen one 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.570
 well as I say below the yolk 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.330
 lower we will also leave about 23 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.760
 centimeters at the top always 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.000
 the cut a little inclined to 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:39.030
 prevent water from accumulating in 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.610
 If it gets wet or even dew 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:46.430
 and we will make the improvement of the cut 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.910
 with the blade of a low graft 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.790
 and in the lower part as I was saying 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:56.240
 to make a bevel cut for in 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:59.640
 first place increase the amount of 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.280
 surface on which it can emit 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.700
 the roots are new lockers and 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.579
 this way to root is much better 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.850
 the cut with a tool that is 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:13.880
 very sharp that is disinfected 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.730
 and always 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.560
 that not leaving some wood in this 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.599
 other part 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.739
 you have to be careful if you do not give us the 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:27.140
 first we are increasing the distance and 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.220
 whenever I go for more amount of 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.080
 wood minus 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.980
 and with this it would be practically 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.980
 enough 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.420
 a kind of wedge would be what we 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.330
 must stay and this is where I want 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:47.110
 highlight the importance of having 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:49.300
 account this detail a lot of caution in 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.980
 do not touch the wood that we just 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.840
 cut with our hands are very 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.720
 clean that are always going to 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.180
 deposit grease particles 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.000
 basically grease the dust the environment 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.040
 it will not influence us much either 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.290
 we always know that there are bacteria and 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.150
 microorganisms and are therefore 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.110
 fungal spores that can develop 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.070
 rot 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.630
 inside this box office but the fat 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.360
 that it contains in our hands and that 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.460
 We can leave deposited on this 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.650
 surface can realize that the 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:24.520
 scarring and the emission of roots are 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.410
 obstructed or even that is not 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.570
 can emit as a result of these fats 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.340
 and oils that contain our hands and 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.820
 particularly the microorganisms that 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.890
 can damage this this surface that 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.860
 we want you to issue as much 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.860
 possible roots because basically this is 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.260
 the advice I wanted 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.830
 jump and the importance of having in 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.320
 account this detail so that our 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:52.410
 Lockers catch and root quickly 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.420
 and with the assurance that they are going to broadcast 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.520
 those roots and it's going to take root very well 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.190
 plant 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.820
 nothing more than this, a greeting and even 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.820
 the next video
