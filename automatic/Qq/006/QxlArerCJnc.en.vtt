00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
point of view reishi is a premier immune

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.660 
point of view reishi is a premier immune
tonic<00:01:33.930> meaning<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.829> doesn't<00:01:34.979> stimulate<00:01:35.400> our

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
tonic meaning it doesn't stimulate our

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.340 
tonic meaning it doesn't stimulate our
immune<00:01:36.030> system<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.689> isn't<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.229> know

immune system and it isn't you know
dampen<00:01:37.860> our<00:01:37.979> immune<00:01:38.189> system<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:39.060> just

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
dampen our immune system it just

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.050 
dampen our immune system it just
restores<00:01:40.439> balance<00:01:40.590> restores<00:01:41.460> homeostasis

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
restores balance restores homeostasis

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.440 
restores balance restores homeostasis
and<00:01:42.479> then<00:01:42.600> over<00:01:42.840> time<00:01:43.079> acts<00:01:43.950> like<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> tonic<00:01:45.060> for

and then over time acts like a tonic for
our<00:01:45.570> immune<00:01:45.780> system<00:01:46.140> meaning<00:01:46.380> over<00:01:46.680> time<00:01:46.710> it

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
our immune system meaning over time it

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.490 
our immune system meaning over time it
can<00:01:47.280> strengthen<00:01:47.759> our<00:01:48.149> immune<00:01:48.390> system<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:49.380> can

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
these battles our immune system is

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.539 
these battles our immune system is
constantly<00:02:03.540> fighting<00:02:04.079> on<00:02:04.290> an<00:02:05.100> energetic

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
constantly fighting on an energetic

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.249 
constantly fighting on an energetic

and<00:02:07.530> that's<00:02:07.680> going<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.860> wear<00:02:08.069> us<00:02:08.220> down<00:02:08.250> that's

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
and that's going to wear us down that's

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.719 
and that's going to wear us down that's
going<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:08.910> cause<00:02:09.090> us<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.360> have<00:02:09.479> less<00:02:09.780> energy

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
going to cause us to have less energy

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.400 
going to cause us to have less energy
and<00:02:10.819> have<00:02:11.030> less<00:02:11.360> energy<00:02:11.569> to<00:02:11.750> do<00:02:11.989> what<00:02:12.140> we<00:02:12.200> want

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
and have less energy to do what we want

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.809

fight-or-flight are always feeling like
we're<00:02:20.450> threatened<00:02:20.900> because<00:02:21.319> our<00:02:21.650> immune

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
we're threatened because our immune

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.619 
we're threatened because our immune
system<00:02:22.190> is<00:02:22.220> just<00:02:22.430> always<00:02:22.700> fighting<00:02:23.239> all<00:02:23.390> these

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
system is just always fighting all these

system is just always fighting all these
different<00:02:24.019> battles<00:02:24.379> and<00:02:24.680> it's<00:02:24.980> such<00:02:25.670> a<00:02:25.700> drain

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
different battles and it's such a drain

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.620 
different battles and it's such a drain
on<00:02:26.390> our<00:02:26.450> energetic<00:02:27.260> reserves<00:02:27.800> and<00:02:28.069> stores<00:02:28.630> so

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
on our energetic reserves and stores so

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.190 
on our energetic reserves and stores so
reishi<00:02:29.930> comes<00:02:30.410> in<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:30.950> it<00:02:31.010> helps<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.430> just

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
reishi comes in and it helps to just

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.449 
reishi comes in and it helps to just
re-educate<00:02:33.200> our<00:02:33.349> immune<00:02:33.530> system<00:02:33.920> it<00:02:34.099> helps<00:02:34.220> to

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
re-educate our immune system it helps to

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.000 
re-educate our immune system it helps to
say<00:02:34.700> hey<00:02:35.540> maybe<00:02:35.810> you<00:02:36.260> in<00:02:36.560> this<00:02:36.709> autoimmune

it's<00:02:58.459> time<00:02:58.640> to<00:02:58.760> wake<00:02:58.910> up<00:02:58.940> it's<00:02:59.360> time<00:02:59.569> to<00:02:59.690> get

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
it's time to wake up it's time to get

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.630 
it's time to wake up it's time to get
moving<00:03:00.170> it's<00:03:00.319> time<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.620> go<00:03:00.950> over<00:03:01.130> here<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.549> you

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
moving it's time to go over here and you

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.580 
moving it's time to go over here and you
know<00:03:02.360> start<00:03:02.690> fighting<00:03:02.959> the<00:03:03.049> battle<00:03:03.319> and<00:03:03.410> start

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
know start fighting the battle and start

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.830 
know start fighting the battle and start
clean<00:03:03.829> this<00:03:04.010> place<00:03:04.190> up

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
clean this place up

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.199 
clean this place up
