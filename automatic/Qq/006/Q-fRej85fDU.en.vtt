00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.620
 hello boys and girls comrades 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.120
 comrades with you, Ivan, I will look for him 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.849
 talk about french hard 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.470
 tank 10 level m 50 b 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.449
 when i just started playing this 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.179
 I managed to tank if statistics on them 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.669
 up to thirty percent and all for what 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:29.519
 because I did not know the purpose of the game on this 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:32.279
 tank and tried to play it like on t57 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.120
 heavy but as it turned out it was big 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.359
 big mistake and so what is 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.609
 mtlb in my opinion and multi set b it 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:43.920
 certainly one of her best heavy 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:47.010
 tanks in the heat of all thanks to the magic 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.469
 french drum and of course if 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.309
 compare it with t57 heavy especially 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.469
 compare it t57 heavy there in patch 091 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.920
 that and all team have been over all 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.140
 the parameters are better 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.739
 developers are finally many years this 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.290
 have understood 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.689
 decided that probably amx 50b is necessary 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.450
 a little apnut and t57 heavy a little 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:15.600
 to noger what they basically did in 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.829
 fingers 09 2093 when comparing guns 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.670
 these two tanks 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:22.710
 in principle, almost all 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.770
 parameters gun t57 heavy 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.500
 ears than amx 50b guns 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.520
 as for the recharge time of one 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.680
 projectile in the store then at mx and she two 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.049
 half a second in type system shock 2 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.590
 seconds it means in melee course 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.079
 the same t57 heavy is much more efficient 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.530
 he can shoot his projectile faster 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.359
 ki is less substituted for the response 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.469
 fire the enemy faster go on 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:54.689
 recharge and in principle how much 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:58.520
 to be more effective in melee 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:02.179
 recharge time of the whole drum at mx 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.549
 also somehow worse than t57 heavy low 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:07.759
 max 30 seconds t57 heavy 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:10.190
 passport time is 25 seconds and again 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.069
 I can say that it is also very, very 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.080
 strongly felt in the game although of course 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.500
 not as much as recharge time 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.250
 one projectile inside the drum and 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.590
 naturally time information which 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:28.700
 developers have changed this tank in 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:33.069
 92 - 93 in the amx 50b two with 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:36.349
 half a second in t57 heavy 2.9 seconds 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:39.769
 in principle, as it were, given that t57 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.720
 we have a heavy idea 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.430
 developers should play at near 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.799
 the distance for it is small on 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.440
 in fact, the problem I basically did 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.030
 vidosik ipsy want heavy you can 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.430
 see it there by clicking on the active 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.190
 a button at the end of this video to my 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.310
 look t57 heavy failed somehow strongly 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.319
 Zerfit in principle, I believe that these 50 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.810
 b much up too 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:07.329
 developers somehow failed me 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.829
 it is surprising that the spread of these guns 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:12.139
 two of these different tanks absolutely 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:15.290
 the same while the developers 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:17.690
 do you think you got t57 heavy yes you should 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.760
 play melee yes there beat 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.560
 shells their ricochet armor and all 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.870
 is she 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.030
 repairing 50b you have to play on 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.819
 the distance would have affected if you play 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.819
 at a distance you obviously need a gun 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:34.519
 More precisely, but for some reason, here we cannon 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.819
 such further with the same precision that 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.560
 that one that the other differ of course 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.160
 these tanks including by their 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.400
 dimensions 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.829
 your booking 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.629
 that's all 2 huge absolutely there was 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.060
 really very very big and 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.140
 Sasha's cardboard only to solid 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.209
 his place is 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.250
 upper frontal part which by the way 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.200
 practically nothing in the game does not break through 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.000
 i'm not using nobody to go there ever 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.890
 there struck but really i 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.379
 no one will specifically target 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.799
 ie umbro something accidental or 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:07.590
 ignorance can send and snaryadik 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:10.019
 Basically this tank loves the enemy 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.150
 artillery love and its cardboard boards 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:15.690
 loves his cardboard tower that is in 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:18.000
 principle here are artillery mines m x 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:21.329
 50 would suffer very much t57 heavy 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.610
 suffers much, much less well and in 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.130
 principle as you understand what 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.250
 developers have tried to make of watermelon 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:32.010
 50b such know some kind of tower 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.080
 Fri-Sau and they succeeded 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.810
 really play the tower fri-sau 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.580
 stand 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.950
 shoot some distance by 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.790
 opponents on this tank is obtained 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:46.040
 most effectively that is if t57 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.910
 heavy after all he is very effective in 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.419
 melee 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.220
 the mix 50 b in this plan sits like 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:55.160
 Fri-Sau know this kind 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.080
 Wafentrager au100 e100 100 version only 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.990
 the difference is that vafftreger auf e100 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:03.190
 very convenient for the game that is it 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.600
 really unpleasant feeling 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.880
 remain after playing waffentrager 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.250
 the fact that all of you focus if you punch 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.590
 very quickly go there is destroyed him 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.700
 enough little kitty because 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.180
 after all this is by. 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:19.130
 Here 50b in this regard is much more comfortable 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.450
 because the enemy as a do not care for 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.880
 70b machine 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.520
 that is, they love him for cardboard 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.639
 French is choosing between 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.130
 somehow I do not know t110 5 which 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:33.560
 most likely there the enemy will not break through 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.340
 torn 50b frame breaks through almost 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.650
 everywhere 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:39.050
 not likely to choose you but in 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.180
 principle special media who bite not 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:44.090
 will be such that the whole team focus 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.950
 Only you this in the game will not be 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.680
 for example if you play waffentrager 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.539
 and this is completely and near the top where I 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.330
 raised 30 did not break naturally 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:53.870
 top bronelist where else could he 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.810
 Fire 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:06:02.300
 That is the principle that I can say 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:04.669
 so you know summarizing already about amx 50b amx 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.729
 50b is a typical p. 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:10.280
 that is, you need to amuse everything so let's say 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:12.650
 the first part is the initial phase of the fight that is 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.780
 how I played here in lasville you are standing 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.729
 on the standards of accurate position throws 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.580
 from the drum everything is great that she 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:22.039
 nutritionally sweat when already your team 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.630
 starts winning so let's say you just 

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:25.400
 Coming forward due to the fact that you have 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.190
 very good speed good 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.750
 dynamic indicators just 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:32.330
 suck and damage that's basically all 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:36.250
 secret games on tyymy 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:39.409
 b that is how much such a gameplay 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:42.530
 interesting ulam is another question then 

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:45.680
 is there for example you choose between t57 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:48.740
 heavy and m70 would like to choose a stage 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:51.020
 drum heavy tank for the future then i 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.120
 how can i say if you like 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:57.080
 stand in the bushes if you like gutting 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:59.389
 Well, 50 would be a good option at the very 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.520
 If you like a vigorous tank 

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:03.800
 rubilovo at close range then 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.500
 uniquely 57 heavy will be much 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:11.449
 much better yes and actually writes 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:16.219
 on t57 heavy not much worse than m x 50 b 

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:18.650
 In principle, today everything if you have not 

00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:21.710
 watched my video patek sit imho better 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:24.979
 more than once the war, I recommend to see 1 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:27.379
 Appreciate how developers ponerfili T57 

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:30.439
 heavy not me i'm still going to become a corner 

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:32.629
 than show another video in the face 50b 

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:34.819
 so as they say do not switch 

00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:39.379
 there we will look like 

00:07:34.819 --> 00:07:41.330
 and he 50b feels in melee in 

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:42.979
 city ​​battle but for today everything is not 

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.729
 forget to subscribe to the channel like 

00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:45.729
 video and all bye
