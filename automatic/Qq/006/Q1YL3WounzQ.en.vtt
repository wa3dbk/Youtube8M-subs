are things that can be created in five
minutes<00:00:27.119> i<00:00:27.300> have<00:00:27.449> four<00:00:27.720> different<00:00:27.869> projects

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
minutes i have four different projects

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.579 
minutes i have four different projects
each<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.429> can<00:00:29.580> be<00:00:29.699> created<00:00:30.089> in<00:00:30.419> five<00:00:31.289> minutes

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:31.589 
each that can be created in five minutes

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:34.730 
each that can be created in five minutes
and<00:00:32.510> this<00:00:33.510> one<00:00:33.750> did<00:00:33.960> take<00:00:34.110> just<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.410> tiny<00:00:34.620> bit

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:34.740 
and this one did take just a tiny bit

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.340 
and this one did take just a tiny bit
longer<00:00:35.010> but<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.570> majority<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.960> was<00:00:37.110> done

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
longer but the majority of it was done

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.620 
longer but the majority of it was done
in<00:00:37.590> five<00:00:37.800> minutes<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.280> mean<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:39.000> max<00:00:39.240> it<00:00:39.450> took

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:39.630 
in five minutes I mean the max it took

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.240 
in five minutes I mean the max it took
with<00:00:39.810> six<00:00:40.050> minutes<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.710> these<00:00:40.860> are<00:00:40.920> really

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
with six minutes so these are really

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.400 
with six minutes so these are really
great<00:00:41.520> things<00:00:41.910> I'm<00:00:42.780> not<00:00:42.960> going<00:00:43.080> to<00:00:43.140> speed

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
great things I'm not going to speed

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.230 
great things I'm not going to speed
through<00:00:43.650> it<00:00:43.800> at<00:00:43.950> all<00:00:44.370> i'm<00:00:44.730> going<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.030> show<00:00:45.210> you

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:45.240 
through it at all i'm going to show you

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.080 
through it at all i'm going to show you
each<00:00:45.600> step<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.980> project<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.700> there's

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
each step of the project and there's

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.460 
each step of the project and there's
going<00:00:48.240> to<00:00:48.300> be<00:00:48.330> a<00:00:48.390> separate<00:00:48.780> video<00:00:48.900> for<00:00:49.320> each

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
going to be a separate video for each

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.280 
going to be a separate video for each
just<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.970> the<00:00:51.180> video<00:00:51.420> doesn't<00:00:51.630> go<00:00:51.870> on<00:00:52.050> too

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
just so that the video doesn't go on too

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.000 
just so that the video doesn't go on too

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:24.719 
stamping with this and I didn't really

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:27.410 
stamping with this and I didn't really
like<00:02:25.019> how<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.349> turned<00:02:25.379> out<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.340> this<00:02:27.120> is<00:02:27.180> the

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:35.189 
bottom but it left some lines and I

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:36.319 
bottom but it left some lines and I
really<00:02:35.400> didn't<00:02:35.609> like<00:02:35.639> that<00:02:35.879> so<00:02:36.090> I'm<00:02:36.150> going<00:02:36.299> to

with how the green showed up over the
red<00:03:30.000> I<00:03:30.269> had<00:03:30.829> contemplated<00:03:31.829> not<00:03:32.400> using<00:03:32.849> it<00:03:33.049> to

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
red I had contemplated not using it to

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.069 
red I had contemplated not using it to
begin<00:03:34.169> with<00:03:34.349> to<00:03:34.530> just<00:03:34.709> using<00:03:35.220> black<00:03:35.629> for<00:03:36.629> all

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
begin with to just using black for all

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.909 
begin with to just using black for all
of<00:03:37.379> my<00:03:37.530> stamping<00:03:38.040> but<00:03:38.669> really<00:03:39.359> as<00:03:39.629> it<00:03:40.290> tried<00:03:40.650> I

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
of my stamping but really as it tried I

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.110 
of my stamping but really as it tried I
think<00:03:41.220> you<00:03:41.400> could<00:03:41.579> tell<00:03:41.699> it<00:03:41.819> was<00:03:41.909> a<00:03:41.939> little

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
think you could tell it was a little

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.569 
think you could tell it was a little
more<00:03:42.239> green<00:03:42.599> in<00:03:43.590> real<00:03:43.799> life<00:03:44.040> you<00:03:44.250> can<00:03:44.400> really

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
more green in real life you can really

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.640 
more green in real life you can really
see<00:03:44.849> it<00:03:44.970> so<00:03:45.150> I'm<00:03:45.299> very<00:03:45.689> glad<00:03:45.900> I<00:03:45.989> ended<00:03:46.319> up<00:03:46.379> using

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:08.699 
black but as it dries it really in real

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:10.249 
black but as it dries it really in real
life<00:04:08.879> it<00:04:09.060> does<00:04:09.209> show<00:04:09.449> up<00:04:09.629> that<00:04:09.810> it's<00:04:09.930> green
