different volume levels with being the
guitar<00:01:08.330> down<00:01:08.510> a<00:01:08.570> little<00:01:08.780> bit

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.429 

okay<00:01:32.060> you<00:01:32.509> can<00:01:32.659> hear<00:01:32.840> there's<00:01:33.020> a<00:01:33.079> little<00:01:33.320> bit

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
okay you can hear there's a little bit

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:34.749 
okay you can hear there's a little bit

break up now I'm going to turn the

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.179 
break up now I'm going to turn the
bottom<00:01:38.719> of<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:38.869> guitar<00:01:38.929> pretty<00:01:39.799> much<00:01:39.920> all<00:01:40.069> the

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
bottom of the guitar pretty much all the

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:59.830 
bottom of the guitar pretty much all the
way<00:01:40.280> up<00:01:41.079> and<00:01:42.079> listen<00:01:42.289> to<00:01:42.380> what<00:01:42.469> that<00:01:42.500> sounds

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:15.620 

you

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.040 

okay<00:02:23.710> so<00:02:23.770> that's<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.250> pig<00:02:24.430> nose<00:02:24.780> all<00:02:25.780> by

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
okay so that's the pig nose all by

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.710 
okay so that's the pig nose all by
itself<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:28.060> now<00:02:28.180> we're<00:02:28.360> going<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:28.510> show<00:02:28.690> you

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
itself so now we're going to show you

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:36.230 
itself so now we're going to show you
the<00:02:28.900> modification<00:02:29.760> inside<00:02:30.760> of<00:02:30.850> the<00:02:30.910> amplifier

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.240 

right<00:02:37.240> here<00:02:37.390> you<00:02:37.480> can<00:02:37.600> see<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.960> new<00:02:38.680> external

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
right here you can see the new external

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.910 
right here you can see the new external
speaker<00:02:39.730> jack<00:02:41.010> plug<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:42.070> cable<00:02:42.340> into<00:02:42.730> there

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
speaker jack plug a cable into there

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.190 
speaker jack plug a cable into there
which<00:02:44.920> will<00:02:45.160> connect<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:47.380> 12-inch<00:02:47.800> Celestion

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
which will connect the 12-inch Celestion

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.130 
which will connect the 12-inch Celestion
to<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.320> amplifier<00:02:51.450> since<00:02:52.450> there's<00:02:52.690> no<00:02:52.840> sound

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
to the amplifier since there's no sound

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.720 
to the amplifier since there's no sound
coming<00:02:53.560> out<00:02:53.710> of<00:02:53.770> the<00:02:53.890> pig<00:02:54.070> nose<00:02:54.250> anymore<00:02:54.670> it

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
coming out of the pig nose anymore it

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.250 
coming out of the pig nose anymore it
doesn't<00:02:54.790> matter<00:02:55.180> that<00:02:55.300> the<00:02:55.510> case<00:02:55.720> is<00:02:55.930> open

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
doesn't matter that the case is open

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.540 
doesn't matter that the case is open
because<00:02:56.380> we're<00:02:56.560> just<00:02:56.590> using<00:02:56.800> the<00:02:57.070> amplifier

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
because we're just using the amplifier

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.730 
because we're just using the amplifier
but<00:02:58.420> I'll<00:02:58.510> keep<00:02:58.690> it<00:02:58.840> closed<00:03:01.380> volume<00:03:02.380> on<00:03:02.560> the

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
but I'll keep it closed volume on the

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.150 
but I'll keep it closed volume on the
pig<00:03:02.920> nose<00:03:03.100> is<00:03:03.370> still<00:03:03.670> set<00:03:04.000> at<00:03:04.440> 3/4<00:03:05.440> just<00:03:06.010> like

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
pig nose is still set at 3/4 just like

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.260 
pig nose is still set at 3/4 just like
before<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:08.650> now<00:03:08.890> we're<00:03:09.070> going<00:03:09.160> to<00:03:09.220> move<00:03:10.120> this

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
before and now we're going to move this

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:18.170 
before and now we're going to move this
down<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:14.550> there<00:03:15.550> is<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:17.530> speaker<00:03:17.890> cabinet

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
down and there is the speaker cabinet

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.600 
down and there is the speaker cabinet
I'm<00:03:19.180> going<00:03:19.360> to<00:03:19.420> keep<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.980> camera<00:03:20.980> in<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:21.400> same

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
I'm going to keep the camera in the same

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.090 
I'm going to keep the camera in the same
orientation<00:03:21.820> as<00:03:22.360> before<00:03:22.720> though<00:03:22.900> so<00:03:23.830> we<00:03:23.980> get

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
orientation as before though so we get
