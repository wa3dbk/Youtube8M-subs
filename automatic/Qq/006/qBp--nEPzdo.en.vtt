00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
it down this fabric has stripes so we

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.039 
it down this fabric has stripes so we
want<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.520> make<00:02:02.670> sure<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:03.119> we<00:02:03.329> Center<00:02:03.869> the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
board in one of the stripes so we're

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.050 
board in one of the stripes so we're
marking<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.799> center<00:02:08.069> of<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.280> board<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.940> then

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
marking the center of the board and then

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.790 
marking the center of the board and then
we're<00:02:09.179> gonna<00:02:09.300> use<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.840> white<00:02:10.110> stripe<00:02:10.500> there

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800

is a center stripe
right<00:02:13.220> there<00:02:13.550> so<00:02:13.850> it<00:02:13.970> matches<00:02:14.300> up<00:02:14.630> from<00:02:14.840> both

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
right there so it matches up from both

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.380 
right there so it matches up from both
top<00:02:15.320> and<00:02:15.350> bottom<00:02:15.590> then<00:02:16.490> just<00:02:16.790> take<00:02:16.970> an<00:02:17.150> arrow

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
to try to keep them straight that

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.909 
to try to keep them straight that
ensures<00:04:57.289> that<00:04:57.319> the<00:04:57.800> pressure<00:04:58.190> is<00:04:59.530> even<00:05:00.530> all

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
ensures that the pressure is even all
