mission from that the flak tower is

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.050 
mission from that the flak tower is
actually<00:01:47.950> modeled<00:01:48.280> on<00:01:48.369> the<00:01:48.399> real<00:01:48.610> flak<00:01:48.880> tower

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
actually modeled on the real flak tower

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.969 
actually modeled on the real flak tower
that<00:01:49.209> was<00:01:49.299> positioned<00:01:49.810> in<00:01:50.020> berlin<00:01:50.530> zoo<00:01:50.709> during

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
the war known to the local was a zoo

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.340 
the war known to the local was a zoo
bunker<00:01:53.369> we<00:01:54.369> set<00:01:54.729> off<00:01:54.850> and<00:01:55.090> researched<00:01:56.049> what

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
bunker we set off and researched what

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.990 
bunker we set off and researched what
were<00:01:56.470> the<00:01:56.560> actual<00:01:56.709> dimensions<00:01:57.399> what<00:01:57.759> was<00:01:57.880> the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
were the actual dimensions what was the

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.180 
were the actual dimensions what was the
construction<00:01:58.409> how<00:01:59.409> thick<00:01:59.649> the<00:01:59.770> walls<00:01:59.799> were

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
construction how thick the walls were

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.340 
construction how thick the walls were
and<00:02:00.580> we<00:02:00.700> began<00:02:01.090> building<00:02:01.330> our<00:02:01.509> own<00:02:01.539> factor

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
and we began building our own factor

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.710 
and we began building our own factor
model<00:02:02.740> so<00:02:03.399> we<00:02:03.640> start<00:02:03.880> off<00:02:04.000> building<00:02:04.420> a<00:02:04.479> level

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
model so we start off building a level

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.320 
model so we start off building a level
by<00:02:04.929> just<00:02:05.860> literally<00:02:06.280> drawing<00:02:06.610> a<00:02:06.670> top-down<00:02:07.060> map

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.600 
by just literally drawing a top-down map
we<00:02:07.539> figure<00:02:07.810> out<00:02:07.869> where<00:02:08.649> everything<00:02:08.920> is<00:02:09.220> and

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
we figure out where everything is and

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.150 
we figure out where everything is and
what<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.060> proportions<00:02:10.569> are<00:02:10.750> from<00:02:11.680> there<00:02:11.860> we

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
what the proportions are from there we

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.680 
what the proportions are from there we
build<00:02:12.400> what<00:02:12.549> we<00:02:12.580> call<00:02:12.790> our<00:02:12.940> white<00:02:13.150> box<00:02:13.330> which

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
build what we call our white box which

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.640 
build what we call our white box which
is<00:02:13.810> a<00:02:13.840> low<00:02:14.380> detail<00:02:14.620> model<00:02:15.549> of<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:16.209> whole<00:02:16.420> level

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
is a low detail model of the whole level

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.289 
is a low detail model of the whole level
and<00:02:17.650> that's<00:02:17.769> really<00:02:17.860> what<00:02:18.340> we<00:02:18.489> stick<00:02:18.910> with<00:02:18.940> for

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
and that's really what we stick with for

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.509 
and that's really what we stick with for
a<00:02:19.329> while<00:02:19.769> once<00:02:20.769> we're<00:02:20.950> happy<00:02:21.040> with<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.430> way

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
a while once we're happy with the way

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.400 
a while once we're happy with the way
everything's<00:02:21.910> laid<00:02:22.120> out<00:02:22.299> then<00:02:22.690> we<00:02:23.140> hand<00:02:23.320> it

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
everything's laid out then we hand it

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.900 
everything's laid out then we hand it
over<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.739> artists<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:24.250> they<00:02:24.400> begin<00:02:24.760> the

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
over to the artists and they begin the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.050 
over to the artists and they begin the
process<00:02:25.090> of<00:02:25.510> making<00:02:26.350> it<00:02:26.500> look<00:02:26.620> great<00:02:27.060> starting

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
process of making it look great starting

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.430 
process of making it look great starting

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
images of what we love this level to

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.479 
images of what we love this level to
look<00:02:34.840> like<00:02:34.989> we<00:02:35.680> look<00:02:35.890> at<00:02:36.070> reference

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
look like we look at reference

look like we look at reference
photography<00:02:37.060> we<00:02:37.480> try<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.900> get<00:02:38.049> blueprints

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
photography we try to get blueprints

wherever<00:02:38.920> we<00:02:39.130> can<00:02:40.079> so<00:02:41.079> in<00:02:41.200> this<00:02:41.290> level<00:02:41.620> there's

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
wherever we can so in this level there's

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.160 
wherever we can so in this level there's
a<00:02:41.859> lot<00:02:42.040> of<00:02:42.070> destruction<00:02:42.670> going<00:02:43.000> on<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.329> it

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
a lot of destruction going on and it

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.690 
a lot of destruction going on and it
actually<00:02:44.319> makes<00:02:44.590> our<00:02:44.769> life<00:02:44.950> as<00:02:45.190> artists<00:02:45.640> a

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
actually makes our life as artists a

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.069 
actually makes our life as artists a
whole<00:02:45.850> lot<00:02:46.000> more<00:02:46.090> difficult<00:02:46.600> to<00:02:46.720> do<00:02:46.870> this

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
whole lot more difficult to do this

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.930 
whole lot more difficult to do this
making<00:02:47.680> damaged<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:48.160> destroyed<00:02:48.310> buildings

making damaged and destroyed buildings

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.430 
making damaged and destroyed buildings
takes<00:02:49.329> about<00:02:49.420> three<00:02:49.780> times<00:02:49.900> as<00:02:50.079> much<00:02:50.230> effort

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
takes about three times as much effort

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.660 
takes about three times as much effort

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
part of making the level believable is

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.260 
part of making the level believable is
that<00:02:55.560> we've<00:02:55.680> included<00:02:55.980> propaganda<00:02:56.820> posters
