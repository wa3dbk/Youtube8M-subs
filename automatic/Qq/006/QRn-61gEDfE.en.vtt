00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
and for my gums to completely recede so

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.789 
and for my gums to completely recede so
they<00:01:54.210> can<00:01:54.360> do<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.630> permanent<00:01:54.869> denture

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
they can do the permanent denture
