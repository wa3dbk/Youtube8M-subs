00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.299
 the beauty guys here is the talk 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.910
 Helton and I are here with the game ig o 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.220
 fish eye power of kells 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.519
 the last of the power of kells series that was 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.600
 released and then come'll show 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.590
 you here 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.199
 This is my deck, this game here. 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.899
 have a greater number of cards in 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.530
 relation to the two others I have already 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.960
 iddf and hokkaido and resell but same 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.579
 so he has no cards from the river gx 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:48.570
 neither of the five of and nor of the show section 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.789
 here a list has hit several cards 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.850
 If I'm not mistaken, you have all the cards of the 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:59.309
 ig the classic and I'm using letter 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:01.739
 Forbidden ready let's go back here 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.750
 Let me see show you here how 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.170
 I already explained in other single games 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.380
 play only once against the character 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.659
 of the game is that here is the joy and then I 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.900
 to win soon in a letter the met I play 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.909
 better than three and if he wins I win 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.860
 three replay cards 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.930
 I already said that it is to see the replay and 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:28.680
 I had a player, I'll show it to you. 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:30.180
 You here are to play in a network like 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.189
 If it was a lan house 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:38.570
 only with a program called hamachi 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:40.829
 You look for the internet, you have to 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.259
 To play this game online I played 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.180
 against eight games but you know him 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.570
 I'll try to bring a video with him. 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.850
 in this game here but leaving aside 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.850
 Let's go here from the I single mold 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:06.079
 then we go there against joinville 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:09.440
 either a curiosity is that the name of the 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.390
 game in the official Japanese dubbing 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.239
 edson nouchi but they have not changed 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.540
 only his name changes to other names 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.090
 there are not a few are several and it was not 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.430
 classic and yes also in xx but leaving 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:35.060
 on the side of the ego 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:57.860
 invoking elf dn for now is just looks 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:03:03.260
 that imitate already made will want to create the 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:05.450
 fai is not an episode 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.670
 if he gets five cards he wins 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.670
 the game but now it 's my turn 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.420
 suri 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.100
 and I'm going to put a non-defense mode 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:25.870
 they will escape that it may be better to force 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:32.520
 haia also heats the scapegoat 4 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.520
 I'm going to attack this one. 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:59.710
 dammit and now a lot of defense that 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:04:08.410
 boring to be messing with those in the 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:11.620
 see his son Daniel attacked evoke the 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.720
 another of niel which shows the way of 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.160
 attack 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.160
 Now I'm going to attack the whole world. 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:29.760
 aissami gum and brings a monster of 1500 or 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.760
 less from the deck to the hand 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.960
 now I'm going to attack with my monsters 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.960
 molds reports here in stock 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.130
 Ready now I'm going to defeat the last one. 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.300
 better off without defense in the next 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:50.010
 round will be just a monster I will not 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.010
 to be able to attack his points directly 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:59.370
 What the hell is this man? 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.370
 missing only two parts 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:06.060
 two letters to the bastard 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.449
 when there was a strong attack it attacks the 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.069
 It's his monster, he's going to 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:26.999
 defense 

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:30.629
 Look, I just bought Dn Elfman in the attack with 

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:34.279
 the weaker obviously having zero of 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:34.279
 defense and will now take enough damage 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:06:03.839
 now at least 1,900 has already taken 3,800 to 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:06:09.300
 1,900 finishes in the next round 

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:11.189
 duel if it does not end up in his round 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.610
 because it will form the fai not I will 

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:13.610
 lose 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:26.050
 I'm bound to win now if it's a 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:29.620
 disgraced letter to the pot of greed 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:33.600
 Forbidden letter to get two cards 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:40.090
 here with two cards when summoning the 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:41.770
 the genie of the lamp attack with 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:47.010
 a radinho just arrived or stopped 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:47.010
 attack that bastard 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:55.740
 gosh I think I'll miss you do 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:55.740
 something has nothing to do here 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:04.930
 only works if a brother attacks he has 

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:15.479
 932 thousand face defense has nothing to 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:19.320
 destroy the drug or lose that damn 

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:19.320
 I can not believe I lost 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.680
 firewall 

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:35.620
 paid spine guys I hope you 

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:39.580
 I liked the video today was unfortunate 

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:42.150
 Man, I've never lost it to him. 

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:46.480
 so this is what I hope you liked 

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:49.000
 until the next video and said there tell us 

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:53.590
 comments if you want more videos 

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:57.430
 digg of kells from anyone and e 

00:07:53.590 --> 00:08:00.310
 another in the other game today that I 

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:04.590
 I try to get here to make the video and 

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:04.590
 that's what it said
