00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.480
 hello today we are going to make a make-up 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.880
 spider-man in this case my model is my 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.090
 nephew 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:22.730
 and the first thing we're going to do is going to be 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:25.220
 draw big triangles in color 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.460
 white on our lower eyelid and 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.460
 higher 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.610
 now let's move on with all our 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.400
 face applying a red color 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.860
 you can add two or three layers so that 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.860
 be a little more marked in color 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.460
 now with a black color let's define 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.390
 well our eyes 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.390
 what is the triangle 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.350
 so there's a division between 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.350
 white color and red 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:17.800
 our next step will be to apply 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:20.850
 some fine lines starting from the 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.850
 center of our nose 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:32.670
 since we have finished them 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:38.150
 Now let's make some small curves 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.150
 between our divisions that we made 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.400
 and thus creating our web in the 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.400
 face 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.640

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.450
 I hope you liked it and that you follow 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.450
