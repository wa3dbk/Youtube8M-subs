00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:22.230
 it's clear 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.170
 but how few actually make it to a successful book author 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.539

 go to the authors camp change significantly 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.930
 I do not just describe step by step 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.020
 what spiritual and material value of such

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.950
