I've been looking for some short bob
styles<00:00:27.400> and<00:00:27.580> so<00:00:27.699> I<00:00:27.730> saw<00:00:27.939> this<00:00:28.119> one<00:00:28.359> father<00:00:28.570> was

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
styles and so I saw this one father was

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:29.310 
styles and so I saw this one father was
cute

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
cute

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.640 
cute
wanted<00:00:29.740> to<00:00:29.800> try<00:00:30.039> it<00:00:30.070> out<00:00:30.369> I<00:00:31.500> really<00:00:32.500> I<00:00:32.529> think

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
wanted to try it out I really I think

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.640 
wanted to try it out I really I think
that<00:00:32.949> the<00:00:33.100> wick<00:00:33.280> is<00:00:33.460> cut<00:00:33.760> very<00:00:34.059> nicely<00:00:34.650> this

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
that the wick is cut very nicely this

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.299 
that the wick is cut very nicely this
part<00:00:36.190> in<00:00:36.460> the<00:00:36.790> front<00:00:37.199> it<00:00:38.199> hung<00:00:38.739> a<00:00:38.769> little<00:00:39.159> bit

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
part in the front it hung a little bit

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.700 
part in the front it hung a little bit
below<00:00:39.580> my<00:00:39.729> chin<00:00:40.030> it<00:00:40.449> was<00:00:40.720> a<00:00:41.049> little<00:00:41.320> bit<00:00:41.530> much

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
below my chin it was a little bit much

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.890 
below my chin it was a little bit much
for<00:00:41.979> me<00:00:42.400> so<00:00:42.430> I<00:00:42.580> had<00:00:42.909> to<00:00:42.940> cut<00:00:43.360> my<00:00:43.390> go<00:00:43.690> little

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
for me so I had to cut my go little

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.479 
for me so I had to cut my go little
layer<00:00:44.019> into<00:00:44.470> it<00:00:44.589> and<00:00:44.680> I<00:00:44.739> think<00:00:44.979> that<00:00:45.129> that

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
layer into it and I think that that

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.000 
layer into it and I think that that
actually<00:00:45.820> looks<00:00:46.570> a<00:00:46.690> little<00:00:46.720> better<00:00:47.170> as<00:00:47.830> you

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
actually looks a little better as you

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.310 
actually looks a little better as you
see<00:00:48.190> like<00:00:48.370> on<00:00:48.519> the<00:00:48.640> model<00:00:49.120> is<00:00:49.390> paying<00:00:49.960> it<00:00:50.140> like

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
see like on the model is paying it like

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.189 
see like on the model is paying it like
pretty<00:00:51.309> low<00:00:51.489> below<00:00:51.790> her<00:00:51.940> chin<00:00:52.000> and<00:00:52.570> it<00:00:53.110> was

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
pretty low below her chin and it was

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.289 
pretty low below her chin and it was
just<00:00:53.320> a<00:00:53.350> bit<00:00:53.530> much<00:00:53.710> so<00:00:54.220> I<00:00:54.460> like<00:00:54.729> it<00:00:54.879> like<00:00:55.000> this

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:55.299 
just a bit much so I like it like this

00:00:55.299 --> 00:01:00.869 
just a bit much so I like it like this
this<00:00:55.659> side<00:00:56.019> is<00:00:56.920> a<00:00:57.250> little<00:00:57.580> more<00:00:58.920> basic<00:00:59.920> of<00:01:00.699> a

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
this side is a little more basic of a

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.259 
this side is a little more basic of a
cut<00:01:01.210> I<00:01:01.600> was<00:01:02.080> feeling<00:01:02.470> it<00:01:02.589> at<00:01:02.710> first<00:01:03.040> but<00:01:03.580> now<00:01:03.850> I

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
cut I was feeling it at first but now I

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:05.910 
cut I was feeling it at first but now I
don't<00:01:04.479> know<00:01:04.629> I'm<00:01:05.049> really<00:01:05.320> I'm<00:01:05.470> not<00:01:05.680> feeling

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
don't know I'm really I'm not feeling

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.690 
don't know I'm really I'm not feeling
that<00:01:06.040> as<00:01:06.189> much<00:01:06.490> I<00:01:06.640> think<00:01:06.670> I<00:01:07.180> like<00:01:07.659> to<00:01:07.840> keep<00:01:08.049> it

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
that as much I think I like to keep it

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.149 
that as much I think I like to keep it
pushed<00:01:09.700> back<00:01:10.030> and<00:01:10.869> like<00:01:11.079> tucks<00:01:11.409> behind<00:01:11.740> my<00:01:11.859> ear

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
pushed back and like tucks behind my ear

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.380 
pushed back and like tucks behind my ear
I<00:01:12.579> think<00:01:13.060> that<00:01:13.210> looks<00:01:13.359> a<00:01:13.479> little<00:01:13.659> edgy<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:16.180> I

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
I think that looks a little edgy and I

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.209 
I think that looks a little edgy and I
also<00:01:16.509> might<00:01:16.840> cut<00:01:17.020> some<00:01:17.049> layers<00:01:17.409> into<00:01:18.100> this

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:18.219 
also might cut some layers into this

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:20.219 
also might cut some layers into this
side<00:01:18.549> and<00:01:18.789> I<00:01:18.820> also<00:01:19.060> might<00:01:19.420> cut<00:01:19.630> layers<00:01:19.840> into

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
side and I also might cut layers into

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:26.459 
side and I also might cut layers into
the<00:01:20.350> back<00:01:20.590> let<00:01:20.859> me<00:01:20.979> show<00:01:21.159> you<00:01:21.219> the<00:01:21.429> back<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.990> the

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:26.469 
the back let me show you the back so the

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:28.499 
the back let me show you the back so the
back<00:01:26.500> also<00:01:27.340> I<00:01:27.369> think<00:01:27.670> a<00:01:27.850> use<00:01:28.060> some<00:01:28.270> layering

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
back also I think a use some layering

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.139 
back also I think a use some layering
because<00:01:28.929> it's<00:01:29.289> also<00:01:29.500> a<00:01:29.649> little<00:01:29.979> basic<00:01:30.189> and<00:01:31.030> you

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
because it's also a little basic and you

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:32.819 
because it's also a little basic and you
know<00:01:31.299> if<00:01:31.420> I'm<00:01:31.539> aware<00:01:31.810> short<00:01:32.200> style<00:01:32.590> you<00:01:32.740> know

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:34.649 
know if I'm aware short style you know
it<00:01:33.039> doesn't<00:01:33.280> need<00:01:33.369> to<00:01:33.460> be<00:01:33.520> basic<00:01:34.179> needs<00:01:34.450> to<00:01:34.539> be

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
it doesn't need to be basic needs to be

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.770 
it doesn't need to be basic needs to be
you<00:01:34.810> know<00:01:34.960> edgy<00:01:35.770> hot<00:01:36.039> so<00:01:36.729> you<00:01:37.420> know<00:01:37.539> that's
