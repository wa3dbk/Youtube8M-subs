 I'm making videos so that's going to take 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.690
 four names all that we go at the option of a 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.270
 brief exchange with the fifth friends 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.980
 generation to which I will make the 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.050
 future video on the tweets the 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.370
 applications the jailbreak then simon 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.470
 little demo here him they want to sell 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.069
 and it's the new deadlines 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.539
 new video that geoffrey simply 

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:10.100
 so you may have noticed who 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:11.899
 is still packed in his little box 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.240
 but me if I do not see a little 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.950
 unpacking the box ipod touch and what 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.960
 generation or the way they 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.579
 basically approve of his business for 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.590
 show you kids cry not everything 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:24.499
 change headphones loose reminded 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.999
 that games do not hide for times the 

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:28.639
 small delay appears on Thursday shows and and 

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:30.889
 Here and there in is no baffle 

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:33.109
 generation is good enough to cable 

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:34.520
 lightning where we are victories and the 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:36.170
 little tongue for natacha de la 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.670
 poverty you understood you do not have 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.859
 already bought ipod elsewhere it's 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.509
 for that you listen to the video a 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:43.130
 Once you have a device all that is 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.670
 fine but we need their ten 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.959
 minutes 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.749
 so I 'm sure I do not have 

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:49.520
 install linux on my computer you 

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:50.899
 show it tg not format my drive 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.299
 hard install linux in the north 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.939
 I use a virtual machine with life 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.219
 a way to show how the 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.599
 process works since linux then 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:02.420
 that's what we 'll see them how 

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:03.280
 manufacture his os 6.0 system all the 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.860
 devices this is where 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.039
 the principle but with linus and with 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.360
 escape made it's gone alan first 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.040
 step of course you have to connect 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.020
 your idevice on your computer 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.700
 linux then we see here that I have my 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.350
 ipod touch fifth generation of 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.690
 connected we see that versions and of 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.640
 6 points during sudan sudan senator 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.170
 you have to go to evasion.com and 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.270
 download the linux version 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.739
 while ikea on linux and takes you 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.780
 on the site of burgault we download it 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.260
 and we record the office note 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.940
 computers 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.530
 so me this is a folder that we 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.800
 pressure we see they manufacture 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:39.190
 fingers and extract here then we reach 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.530
 and afterwards we also help in duplicate 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.010
 click on it and you have a lot of 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.900
 falls 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.790
 so gentlemen if you have a 32 bit 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.550
 you have to run the latter if you 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.819
 have 64 bits it's the one with 64 me I 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:54.340
 64 bit so i'm going to click on the 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.750
 the one who beats in beauce 64 thereafter 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.610
 it's the same principle as on windows 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.060
 or mac you have to click on dja 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.590
 bricks 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.420
 so we see that detect month and 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.900
 fifth- generation bitch on the bones 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.459
 6.1 and then we click here then 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.290
 we see that nathalie baye is in 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.420
 receive information from 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.590
 ivg and eventually make it fair 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.780
 wait about 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.239
 I would say one two three minutes the 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.670
 time that everything without voice goes their idevice 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.650
 once the dogs escape will you 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.730
 says to continue pressing a 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.590
 touch on your idevice 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.019
 we 'll unlock it so it's 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.670
 here we go on the second page and 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.370
 we got together we called the brig 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.940
 you just have to type it once and 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.340
 the following 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.930
 evasion re continues his process so 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.790
 must wait a number of three 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.790
 minutes your idevice to start 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.019
 many times you just have to wait 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.000
 so once your idevice and 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.709
 start of course escape voices you and 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.989
 that the lighter jo complete so we go 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.130
 click on exact and now we have 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.420
 finished with the draws 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.920
 we can now go on nathalie 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.790
 baye on the second page and in to 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.470
 the cydia icon 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.540
 once we go open it's going to me 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.459
 ask to prepare the shale m on 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.489
 have to wait a bit and then 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.840
 to jailbroken idevice 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.519
 so as we could see it's not 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.540
 more complicated on windows or a mac 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.310
 I still had to show you 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.810
