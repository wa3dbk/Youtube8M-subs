00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello friends today I bring you a new 

00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:09.689
 temporary in which I teach them to download 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.689
 a very useful tool for 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:21.759
 it's about this that you see here 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:24.410
 basically it is a gadget that shows us 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:26.630
 the amount of use that we are giving 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.070
 to our computer is to say the 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.250
 hearts that are making here 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.070
 we can see that my computer is at 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.589
 37% also show us the processes 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.699
 which performs ram memory and each of 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:39.699
 the threads we have 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:48.650
 let's look first we go to the link 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.650
 with the description of this video 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:56.300
 they tell us a bit about the application 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:59.230
 then what are the purpose of each part? 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.420
 that appear and good 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.660
 the download can choose any of 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.660
 these options 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.280
 we click and save files accept 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.530
 I download it because I already have it 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.909
 then we go to where we keep 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.210
 our archives 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.210
 it would be here 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:32.140
 and this right will come out 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:36.409
 when we bring them, this is going to come out 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.710
 We simply double-click on it 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.570
 we install 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.659
 in my case I do not install it because I already 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.500
 I have activated then one more option 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.500
 what brings us 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.860
 the gadget is that we can be following 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:56.130
 the temperature at which our 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.130
 computer for that we go to option 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.530
 and where it says show temperatures you 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.530
 we give 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.640
 we accept 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.459
 here as you can see I get the 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.709
 temperature of each of the centuries 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.650
 no average is the temperature at which 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.110
 are my computers but 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.640
 I do not give them to do this to you 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.060
 more red letters will appear in this 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.190
 part 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.840
 They are not going to show you the temperature 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.860
 you are missing a supplement that is 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.700
 call 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:33.180
 to get it we have the other one that 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:37.409
 is in the description of the video that is 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.750
 and download 64-bit and 64-bit slices 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:41.459
 in my case because that is my system 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.609
 operative you may have a 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.650
 32-bit operating system and being 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.150
 that the case I will also leave one 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.290
 for schuster 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.599
 32 and others 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.090
 if you do not know what the operating system is 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:59.000
 that you have then we are going to 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:02.780
 start teams 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.670
 right click properties 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.140
 and here it shows us the specifications 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.330
 from our computer for him 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.420
 from rne 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.130
 the system type operating system of 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.170
 64 bits 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:22.030
 32,000 already know what to do 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.790
 then we give you download 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.920
 and when the download is over we go 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.140
 Where else do we have it? 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.140
 and this will appear 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.400
 64 bit cut 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.400
 we will do it 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.250
 yes 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.040
 is simple 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.109
 something very important and listen to 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.150
 Viennese many times when we go to 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:59.709
 download something we only see that we 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.709
 images appear and we are 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.030
 in this case they are offering us a 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.270
 product 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.010
 36 maximer which is to maximize the 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.620
 performance of us 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.180
 in this case we give the town because 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.980
 if we give you next with the option 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.560
 marked that will download us this 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.510
 our invoke work will ask 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.880
 licenses and computers 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.840
 now if we give the next one and 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.840
 we wait 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.770
 is going to come out is this weird document a 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.710
 advice that I give you is this is the 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:44.310
 application that we need 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.600
 then they take it and drag up 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.420
 a point where they know they are going to 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.550
 use for example this is mine I 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.890
 I already did 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.340
 they can already serve document and they give 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:58.940
 closed to the discharge once they have 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.940
 single 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.849
 this picture will appear 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.910
 picture 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:10.730
 they can not close it 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:14.200
 because because if they close them they would be 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.200
 finalizing the application 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.350
 this is what appeared to you 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.840
 if we are going to remove the temperatures 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.090
 so 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.250
 to accept 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.050
 the picture we just minimize it 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.669
 because it will leave us windows to see 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.460
 finished that bothers us in our 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:35.069
 bar 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.930
 so here we can see the temperature 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:39.270
 to which our average is 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.680
 computer here would be each of the 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.009
 centuries 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.050
 good when you restart it will not be able 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.639
 computer obviously the application is 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.949
 will close them the only thing they have to 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.870
 do if they want to have the 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:58.639
 temperature is to go where they have 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:06:01.129
 saved the cut for example 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:02.409
 and ready when they want to see it they just give it 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:05.589
 click 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:07.119
 and here it's going to look good, that's 

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:09.099
 everything and if they have doubts if they have 

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:11.800
 problems with the laws with the discharge 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:14.469
 or they do not understand something they ask me and I 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.889
 as far as I can go to the 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:16.889
 next
