00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.580
 with windows 8 wants to microsoft 

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:06.259
 operating system can do that on one 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.910
 smartphone and tablet just at home 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:10.460
 is like on the classic pc and 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.380
 Notebook accordingly brings windows 8 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.670
 also more changes than you would in the 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.690
 rule of a new windows version 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.609
 is used 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.800
 For example, they can look after the 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.359
 installation on request directly with a 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.189
 log in microsoft account 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.019
 because windows 8 integrates cloud 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.880
 functions so save and 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.679
 synchronize information 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.899
 servers in the net now deep in the 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:31.759
 operating system the most obvious 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:33.770
 However, revisions of windows 8 concern 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.510
 optics and operation and windows 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.700
 veterans first expected a shock 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.470
 after logging in you will be contacted directly by 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.870
 the former metro called standard 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.160
 Surface of windows 8 welcomes the 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.110
 microsoft probably from trademark law 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.290
 start up recently in model newey 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.850
 where user interface has been exchanged 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.650
 So user interface is available 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.230
 but we stay with the 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.480
 grippier metro term central 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.160
 The elements of metro are tiles 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.320
 each represent a program 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.239
 however with Microsoft the associated 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.350
 programs apps and pulls one 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.719
 spread only over one's own 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.729
 Appstore like that of smartphones 

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:09.829
 the name is known 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.719
 understandable because the windows 8 apps 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:13.520
 start after a left click always in 

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:15.200
 full screen and no longer in the actual 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.600
 eponymous window mode of windows 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.119
 with the birth buttons at the top 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.039
 window edge just as little can be 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.020
 Position apps like windows freely 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:26.329
 they should always be displayed in full screen 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.130
 become the only concession to the windows 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.509
 tradition two apps let themselves 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.829
 accumulate next to each other 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.229
 but only with fixed 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.579
 size ratio that is a proven 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.649
 three quarters of the screen area 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:39.259
 the other one has to narrow down 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.729
 stripes on the edge lie depending on the range 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.289
 but not for meaningful 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.600
 to present information 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.579
 The ones belonging to the apps are the tiles 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.259
 can be like those of android 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.899
 widgets be dynamic and information 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.939
 view the tile of the weather app about 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.159
 reveals the current weather the tile 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.779
 news app the latest headlines with 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.700
 This works for a microsoft account 

00:01:56.779 --> 00:02:01.490
 also contact with emails or with 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.109
 facebook twitter and co let the apps 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.880
 to arrange as you wish 

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:06.590
 the screen is not enough space 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.030
 more you move the picture section 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.030
 by the mouse 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.560
 move the mouse wheel or rotate a 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.420
 Overview of all apps you get per 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.730
 mausrad while pressed 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.800
 control button or with the help of 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.870
 small minus sign that windows 8 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.620
 fades in as soon as you put the mouse pointer in 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.700
 move the lower right corner 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.440
 at all, the screen corners play 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.380
 in windows 8 a much bigger role 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.630
 than previously in the upper left or 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.790
 In the lower corner you will find the new one 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.459
 task switcher on the one hand between the 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.650
 last opened apps or the metro 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.600
 Surface turns back and forth when you 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.890
 receive move the mouse towards the center 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.840
 In addition, they are an overview of all 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.610
 open apps or programs and 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.650
 switch to these by clicking 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.630
 known combination of keys old tab 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.750
 works but also with 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.550
 offers the usual look and feel 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.340
 the mouse pointer in the upper right or 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.209
 lower corner appears 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.840
 Context-sensitive mini with several 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.360
 options 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.890
 depending on the so-called teams 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.780
 which app will give you the right one out 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.910
 call the possibilities are first 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.519
 can be adapted to this but 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.140
 also out on the entire pc from those 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.730
 the photo app lets you know the picture 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.840
 with the help of sharing in a social 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.850
 network upload 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.920
 send by e-mail or skydrive 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.569
 called cloud memory from windows 8 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.579
 lay down 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.650
 but what does the new windows offer offside 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.930
 the smartphone surface and where is the 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.670
 desktop in the answer is simply the 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.439
 desktop is now an app click 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.909
 on the corresponding tile opens 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:33.019
 for the first time on windows 8 one 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:34.670
 familiar environment 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.469
 There you will find the usual ones 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.489
 links and the system tray in the 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:39.980
 lower right corner 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.780
 despite the optics reminiscent of Windows 7 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.700
 the desktops he is no longer that 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.859
 central element of the operating system 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.569
 but actually an app like that 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.760
 All new media tricks work 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.680
 from windows 8 the german bar am 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.750
 right screen border to switch to 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.700
 other apps on the left edge even that 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.439
 Limit the desktop to a page 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:02.510
 you can and can close the 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:04.310
 desktop app also on a pc or 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.079
 notebook you will be the desktop though 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.090
 even with windows 8 still on 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.799
 most often use the usual 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.689
 Windows programs do not start like that 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:14.090
 apps in the metro full screen but the 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:15.799
 familiar window on the desktop 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.299
 to start a desktop program 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.979
 use either a tile 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.109
 however, the traditional ones look 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.150
 Linking cycon in comparison to the 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.340
 for metro adapted tiles mild 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.139
 said modestly or you type 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.360
 the first letters of the program 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.710
 You can also enter 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.570
 the usual links on the 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.530
 desktop and its quick launch bar 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.960
 invest 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.400
 only the familiar start button together 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.930
 they can no longer use the menu 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.880
 because that is no longer there instead 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:46.580
 find in the lower left corner 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:48.440
 only the metro task switcher as well 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.750
 missing the start menu brings the desktop 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.880
 But even more innovations so omitted 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.860
 windows 8 on the three-dimensional aero 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.870
 Effects of windows 7 on window frames 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.120
 and icons, and instead put back 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.830
 on two-dimensional flat frames the 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.080
 However , color match each other now 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:06.340
 according to the chosen design to what the 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.340
 ergonomics does quite well 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.580
 also owns the file explorer 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.590
 the ribbon menus known by office 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.960
 the matching actions under 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.210
 to summarize the different riders who 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.340
 the ribs - she does not like them too 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.430
 just hide and get one 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.139
 simple minimalist explorer 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.270
 There is also a revised task 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:32.310
 manager of one, too 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.440
 very rudimentary view of the current 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.259
 Applications shows and allows these too 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.030
 finish what is good for pc newbies to 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:40.919
 other but also much more info 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.440
 Well prepared and accessible 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:45.240
 windows 7 so you see the detail 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.070
 resource consumption of each apps 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.720
 or programs and finally you can 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.520
 also the autostart function makes sense 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.210
 monitor and unwanted programs or 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.210
 disable services 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:58.229
 Another bonus for frequent users is 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.940
 right-click on the position of the 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:01.979
 reachable state buttons 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.440
 quick menu that microsoft is facing 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:06.060
 Windows 7 has significantly expanded and that 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.440
 very brisk access to a whole 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:11.039
 number of system control options 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:13.139
 under the dash is windows 8 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:15.180
 or its central and 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:17.070
 not disconnectable metro part as 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.039
 microsoft itself strictly adopts the 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:21.389
 operated by touchscreen 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:23.580
 microsofts strategy is a consistent one 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:25.620
 user experience from the smartphone all the way up 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.990
 to the desktop pc to offer greetings 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.090
 with mouse and keyboard it works though 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.530
 also the main ways in the 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.900
 Frequently needed corners of the screen 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.820
 but are sometimes noticeably longer than at 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.469
 the predecessors and also the 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.400
 Shut down now needs one 

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:40.400
 click more than before 

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:45.459
 Franconia 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:51.310
 despite the collapse between metro and 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.050
 the desktop leaves windows 8 behind 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.160
 some time of use but no 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.260
 bowls of aftertaste 

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.420
 this is mainly because of that 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.970
 Windows 8 racing at all tasks 

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:03.340
 fast is no unnecessary animation 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:05.230
 or 3d knickknack no noticeable 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.210
 delay when switching constantly 

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:09.120
 between metro and the desktop between 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:11.440
 apps to the traditional windows program 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.090
 even booting is noticeably faster 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.790
 as even with me already fast windows 

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:17.260
 7 really compelling reasons for the 

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:19.270
 Switching to windows 8 we find 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.980
 but not like him the apps
