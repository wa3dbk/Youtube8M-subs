00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.070
 at 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:31.930
 the boat is ready soon and we come 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.989
 to put it in the water to go 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:38.500
 a good night before going to do the 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:42.040
 little crossing so here and joris goes 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.629
 to say hello to you 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.470
 happy to be here and we have pure 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.470
 conditions for tomorrow 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.710
 abbas and cross it's still a 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.820
 opportunity to make a hundred thousand years 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.070
 and I am supported and still 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.409
 it's the dream said world are already done 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.170
 Web dedicated spinnakers can make a 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:11.380
 endless edge of more than seven hours 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.509
 under speed ball challenge challenge must by 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.289
 one in ten years was as far away 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.310
 from the coast on a small boat is a 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:25.049
 little risk taste could well 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:27.780
 then my game that there is another who dreams 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:35.649
 behind we see plymouth 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:40.290
 the lighthouse with the breakwater tac tac 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:45.460
 is he also hateful 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.490
 20:49 and we went to the east at 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.490
 time 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.450
 at 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.680
 in part 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.680
 franck 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.010
 moment marking for me it's I think 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.409
 the double trap under spinnaker we could have 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.030
 at first we were really stalled every 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.879
 two 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.109
 until the time comes a little hot on 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:44.849
 some waves we did not go far 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:47.099
 to desalt at the little more a beautiful 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:52.439
 small desalination hands of the father of five 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:54.290
 minutes 5 10 minutes and after me for 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:58.260
 me the highlight is still 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.450
 we had after that we sent the spinnaker 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.870
 for nearly two hours we were 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:07.040
 sitting on it and that's still 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.040
 images that will remain engraved 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:25.210
 a moon fish where we met two 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.219
 three fishermen some boaters 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.169
 the cargo ship is somewhat disappointing 

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:32.379
 no panic studies to have on it 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.379
 yeah 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.850
 we had to make points a whole 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.850
 twenties like that 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.979
 m 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:32.340
 the sleeve and we have fifteen drownings 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.540
 if we are above 81 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:40.870
 will cancel case 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.150
 back to the crÃ¨s 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:07.020
 needs 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.420
 there are two the passage of life 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.919
 Yes 

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:49.919
 E7400 

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:59.689
 hop 

00:06:56.509 --> 00:06:59.689
 this area 

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.920
 Oh yes, that's for sure, and we'll be there 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.510
 will leave more beautiful but I think we 

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.780
 a way to make a very good very good 

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.780
 record
