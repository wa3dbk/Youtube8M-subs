00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
were gonna be talking about symmetry and

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.360 
were gonna be talking about symmetry and
why<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.920> don't<00:00:44.460> want<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.789> do<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:46.010> so<00:00:47.010> if<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.190> did

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
why you don't want to do it so if I did

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.910 
why you don't want to do it so if I did
something<00:00:47.550> like<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:48.260> and<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.559> my<00:00:49.680> house

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
something like this and this is my house

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.189 
something like this and this is my house
so<00:00:50.700> let's<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:51.000> say<00:00:51.149> we<00:00:51.180> bring<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.870> back<00:00:52.020> over

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
so let's just say we bring it back over

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.529 
so let's just say we bring it back over
here<00:00:52.440> we<00:00:52.590> join<00:00:53.100> these<00:00:53.309> two<00:00:53.520> walls<00:00:53.760> go<00:00:54.329> down<00:00:54.510> a

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
here we join these two walls go down a

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:54.920 
here we join these two walls go down a
level

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
level

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.619 
level
oops<00:00:55.739> got<00:00:56.160> about<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.640> building<00:00:56.879> there<00:00:57.270> we<00:00:57.329> go

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
oops got about it building there we go

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.389 
oops got about it building there we go
so<00:00:57.899> we<00:00:58.079> got<00:00:58.199> these<00:00:58.289> two<00:00:58.350> little<00:00:58.649> rooms<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.039> say

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
so we got these two little rooms and say

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.510 
so we got these two little rooms and say
I<00:00:59.730> were<00:00:59.910> to<00:00:59.969> do<00:01:00.149> something<00:01:00.180> like<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
I were to do something like this so the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.420 
I were to do something like this so the
other<00:01:02.609> side<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.879> 5<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.390> 5<00:01:03.660> as<00:01:03.899> well<00:01:04.430> now

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
other side is 5 this is 5 as well now

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.140 
other side is 5 this is 5 as well now
this<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.670> exactly<00:01:06.210> symmetrical<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:08.150> I'm

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
this is exactly symmetrical and I'm

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.820 
this is exactly symmetrical and I'm
going<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.390> be<00:01:09.450> honest<00:01:09.689> houses<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.409> real<00:01:10.619> life

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
going to be honest houses in real life

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.120 
going to be honest houses in real life
generally<00:01:11.520> are<00:01:11.670> not<00:01:11.909> symmetrical<00:01:12.659> at<00:01:12.840> all<00:01:13.130> I

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
generally are not symmetrical at all I

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.520 
generally are not symmetrical at all I
mean<00:01:14.850> sure<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.210> does<00:01:15.330> happen<00:01:15.509> but<00:01:15.840> that's

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
mean sure it does happen but that's

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.770 
mean sure it does happen but that's
going<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.830> be<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.280> very<00:01:17.700> purposeful<00:01:18.299> act<00:01:18.600> it

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
going to be a very purposeful act it

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.359 
going to be a very purposeful act it
doesn't<00:01:19.049> doesn't<00:01:19.259> happen<00:01:19.470> because<00:01:20.159> usually

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
doesn't doesn't happen because usually

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.460 
doesn't doesn't happen because usually
in<00:01:20.670> real<00:01:20.820> life<00:01:21.000> you'll<00:01:21.180> find<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.540> house<00:01:21.750> maybe

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
in real life you'll find a house maybe

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.230 
in real life you'll find a house maybe
it's<00:01:22.740> like<00:01:22.860> 50<00:01:23.159> years<00:01:23.310> old<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.759> it's<00:01:24.119> been

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
and over time it's had a lot of add-ons

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.440 
and over time it's had a lot of add-ons
and<00:01:28.320> changes<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.490> even<00:01:29.729> new<00:01:29.939> houses<00:01:30.329> they

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.880 
and changes and and even new houses they
aren't<00:01:30.720> designed<00:01:30.990> symmetrically<00:01:31.590> that's<00:01:31.770> not

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
aren't designed symmetrically that's not

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.030 
aren't designed symmetrically that's not
how<00:01:32.040> house<00:01:32.700> designs<00:01:33.060> work<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:34.320> if<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.530> if<00:01:34.799> you

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
notice yourself starting to build

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.149 
notice yourself starting to build
something<00:01:36.360> symmetrical<00:01:37.110> say<00:01:37.619> then<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:37.950> ends

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
something symmetrical say then it ends

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.469 
something symmetrical say then it ends
up<00:01:38.220> even<00:01:38.490> more<00:01:38.610> symmetrical<00:01:39.119> they're<00:01:39.299> doing

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
up even more symmetrical they're doing

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.460 
up even more symmetrical they're doing
some<00:01:39.600> other<00:01:39.689> there<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.110> just<00:01:40.140> like<00:01:40.350> oh

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
some other there so you just like oh

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.889 
some other there so you just like oh
yeah<00:01:40.650> we'll<00:01:40.770> just<00:01:40.799> go<00:01:41.189> like<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.490> like<00:01:41.899> first

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
yeah we'll just go like this like first

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.260 
yeah we'll just go like this like first
of<00:01:43.049> all<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.380> looks<00:01:43.530> like<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.770> frickin<00:01:44.700> school

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
of all this looks like a frickin school

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.460 
of all this looks like a frickin school
building<00:01:45.659> or<00:01:45.750> something<00:01:46.049> because<00:01:46.140> it's<00:01:46.350> like

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
building or something because it's like

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.649 
building or something because it's like
I<00:01:47.040> don't<00:01:47.549> know<00:01:47.610> like<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.880> hospital<00:01:48.149> something

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
I don't know like a hospital something

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.359 
I don't know like a hospital something
cuz<00:01:48.780> it's<00:01:48.869> all<00:01:48.930> symmetrical<00:01:49.470> instead<00:01:49.890> that's

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
cuz it's all symmetrical instead that's

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.690 
cuz it's all symmetrical instead that's
that's<00:01:50.880> not<00:01:51.090> how<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> home<00:01:51.780> feels<00:01:52.640> so<00:01:53.640> you

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
that's not how a home feels so you

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.670 
that's not how a home feels so you
really<00:01:54.180> want<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.390> avoid<00:01:54.600> doing<00:01:55.229> anything

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
really want to avoid doing anything

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.889 
really want to avoid doing anything
symmetrical<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.219> even<00:01:56.520> includes<00:01:56.880> on<00:01:57.719> the

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
symmetrical this even includes on the

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.810 
symmetrical this even includes on the
interior<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:58.619> let's<00:01:59.219> just<00:01:59.399> pretend<00:01:59.549> for<00:01:59.729> a

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
interior so let's just pretend for a

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.310 
interior so let's just pretend for a
moment<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.509> exterior<00:02:00.869> isn't

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
moment the the exterior isn't

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.230 
moment the the exterior isn't
symmetrical<00:02:01.829> at<00:02:01.920> all<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.969> was<00:02:03.090> just

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
symmetrical at all and I was just

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.459 
symmetrical at all and I was just
building<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.600> inside<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:03.990> we<00:02:04.079> have<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.229> hallway

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
building the inside so we have a hallway

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.560 
building the inside so we have a hallway
here<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.070> they<00:02:05.130> were<00:02:05.189> like<00:02:05.399> oh<00:02:05.610> we<00:02:05.969> could<00:02:06.450> do<00:02:06.540> a

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
here and they were like oh we could do a

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.660 
here and they were like oh we could do a
room<00:02:06.960> here<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.680> then<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:07.890> guess<00:02:08.250> we<00:02:08.340> can<00:02:08.459> do<00:02:08.550> it

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
room here and then I guess we can do it

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.210 
room here and then I guess we can do it
here<00:02:08.879> as<00:02:08.940> well<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.690> we<00:02:10.440> can<00:02:10.560> do<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:10.830> and

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
here as well and and we can do this and

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.480 
here as well and and we can do this and
we<00:02:11.370> do<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.580> same<00:02:11.730> over<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.030> other<00:02:12.180> side<00:02:12.450> and

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
we do the same over the other side and

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.580 
we do the same over the other side and
look<00:02:13.790> some<00:02:14.150> symmetry<00:02:14.570> just<00:02:14.960> doesn't<00:02:15.260> work<00:02:15.380> if

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
look some symmetry just doesn't work if

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.500 
look some symmetry just doesn't work if
you're<00:02:15.710> trying<00:02:15.920> to<00:02:16.010> build<00:02:16.100> a<00:02:16.250> house<00:02:16.430> it's<00:02:17.360> as

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
you're trying to build a house it's as

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.270 
you're trying to build a house it's as
simple<00:02:17.630> as<00:02:17.810> that<00:02:17.900> really<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:18.680> want<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:19.040> avoid

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
simple as that really you want to avoid

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.820 
simple as that really you want to avoid
it<00:02:19.490> as<00:02:19.610> much<00:02:19.850> as<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.270> can<00:02:20.450> so<00:02:20.690> say<00:02:21.620> we<00:02:21.740> have

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
it as much as you can so say we have

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.020 
it as much as you can so say we have
something<00:02:22.040> like<00:02:22.070> this<00:02:22.310> I<00:02:22.370> mean<00:02:22.640> something<00:02:22.910> as

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
something like this I mean something as

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.810 
something like this I mean something as
simple<00:02:23.180> as<00:02:23.420> just<00:02:23.480> grabbing<00:02:23.990> our<00:02:24.080> wall<00:02:24.820> moving

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
simple as just grabbing our wall moving

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.850 
simple as just grabbing our wall moving
it<00:02:25.940> back<00:02:26.150> even<00:02:26.540> back<00:02:27.050> like<00:02:27.230> this<00:02:27.350> so<00:02:27.410> steps

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
it back even back like this so steps

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.160 
it back even back like this so steps
backwards<00:02:28.600> but<00:02:29.600> if<00:02:29.690> you<00:02:29.750> got<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:29.930> do<00:02:29.990> like<00:02:30.020> a

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
backwards but if you got to do like a

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.510 
backwards but if you got to do like a
stepping<00:02:30.530> thing<00:02:30.710> like<00:02:30.830> this<00:02:30.920> you<00:02:31.160> kind<00:02:31.490> of

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
stepping thing like this you kind of

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.900 
stepping thing like this you kind of
want<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.730> make<00:02:31.820> this<00:02:32.360> parts<00:02:32.720> more<00:02:33.080> like<00:02:33.260> is<00:02:33.910> so

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
want to make this parts more like is so

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.470 
want to make this parts more like is so
we'll<00:02:35.060> bring<00:02:35.210> it<00:02:35.960> into<00:02:36.440> there<00:02:36.860> probably<00:02:37.480> and

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
we'll bring it into there probably and

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.790 
we'll bring it into there probably and
just<00:02:38.630> play<00:02:38.810> around<00:02:38.900> with<00:02:39.050> the<00:02:39.140> shape<00:02:39.380> so<00:02:39.590> like

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
just play around with the shape so like

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
just play around with the shape so like
if<00:02:39.890> we<00:02:39.980> bring<00:02:40.100> this<00:02:40.220> back<00:02:40.400> in<00:02:40.520> there<00:02:40.670> like<00:02:40.790> that

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
if we bring this back in there like that

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.580 
if we bring this back in there like that
that<00:02:41.450> definitely<00:02:41.780> looks<00:02:41.900> better<00:02:42.140> than<00:02:42.440> I<00:02:42.530> did

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
that definitely looks better than I did

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.800 
that definitely looks better than I did
before<00:02:42.740> I<00:02:43.070> mean<00:02:43.280> granted<00:02:44.030> it's<00:02:44.120> a<00:02:44.360> weird<00:02:44.570> shape

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
before I mean granted it's a weird shape

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.890 
before I mean granted it's a weird shape
but<00:02:45.200> it's<00:02:45.410> no<00:02:45.620> longer<00:02:45.770> symmetrical<00:02:46.490> at<00:02:46.670> all<00:02:46.900> so

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
but it's no longer symmetrical at all so

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.720 
but it's no longer symmetrical at all so
let's<00:02:48.500> just<00:02:48.650> say<00:02:48.710> we<00:02:48.830> want<00:02:48.920> to<00:02:49.040> roof<00:02:49.220> it<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:49.580> if

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
let's just say we want to roof it and if

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.010 
let's just say we want to roof it and if
you<00:02:49.790> want<00:02:49.940> to<00:02:50.000> learn<00:02:50.090> how<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.210> do<00:02:50.450> quick

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
you want to learn how to do quick

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.350 
you want to learn how to do quick
roofing<00:02:51.620> tips<00:02:52.070> and<00:02:52.310> tricks<00:02:52.580> and<00:02:52.850> I<00:02:52.970> suggest

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
roofing tips and tricks and I suggest

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.330 
roofing tips and tricks and I suggest
checking<00:02:53.420> out<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.780> other<00:02:53.810> video<00:02:54.230> I'm<00:02:55.190> so

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
checking out the other video I'm so

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.610 
checking out the other video I'm so
going<00:02:55.490> to<00:02:55.550> join<00:02:55.730> that<00:02:55.850> there<00:02:56.240> and<00:02:56.600> I'm<00:02:57.410> going

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
going to join that there and I'm going

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.110 
going to join that there and I'm going
to<00:02:57.650> join<00:02:57.860> it<00:02:58.820> with<00:02:58.880> this<00:02:59.630> like<00:03:00.350> see<00:03:00.980> so<00:03:01.850> we<00:03:02.000> have

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
to join it with this like see so we have

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.370 
to join it with this like see so we have
that<00:03:02.240> little<00:03:02.450> house<00:03:02.570> here<00:03:02.600> now<00:03:02.960> and<00:03:03.140> it's<00:03:03.350> not

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
that little house here now and it's not

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.840 
that little house here now and it's not
symmetrical<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.160> but<00:03:04.340> we<00:03:04.490> have<00:03:04.580> a<00:03:04.610> roof

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
symmetrical and but we have a roof

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.550 
symmetrical and but we have a roof
glitch<00:03:05.090> with<00:03:05.270> whatever<00:03:05.630> reason<00:03:06.140> I<00:03:06.290> don't<00:03:06.320> know

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
glitch with whatever reason I don't know

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.250 
glitch with whatever reason I don't know
why<00:03:06.590> but<00:03:07.040> that's<00:03:07.760> what<00:03:07.940> happens<00:03:08.330> oh<00:03:08.420> that's

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
why but that's what happens oh that's

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.690 
why but that's what happens oh that's
roofing<00:03:09.710> for<00:03:09.890> you

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
roofing for you

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.880 
roofing for you
is<00:03:10.970> it<00:03:11.090> going<00:03:11.180> to<00:03:11.240> do<00:03:11.330> it<00:03:11.420> again<00:03:11.480> yes<00:03:11.810> it<00:03:11.990> is<00:03:12.110> so

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
is it going to do it again yes it is so

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.590 
is it going to do it again yes it is so
we'll<00:03:13.310> ignore<00:03:13.460> that<00:03:13.730> for<00:03:13.850> now<00:03:13.910> we'll<00:03:14.330> do<00:03:14.420> it<00:03:14.540> a

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
we'll ignore that for now we'll do it a

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.390 
we'll ignore that for now we'll do it a
different<00:03:14.720> way<00:03:15.040> we're<00:03:16.040> going<00:03:16.160> to<00:03:16.220> go<00:03:16.280> like

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
different way we're going to go like

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.350 
different way we're going to go like
this<00:03:16.580> and<00:03:16.640> we're<00:03:16.910> going<00:03:17.000> to<00:03:17.060> bring<00:03:17.210> it<00:03:17.330> down

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
this and we're going to bring it down

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.300 
this and we're going to bring it down
anyway<00:03:18.140> so<00:03:18.260> you<00:03:18.350> so<00:03:18.680> you<00:03:18.800> can<00:03:18.920> just<00:03:19.010> ignore<00:03:19.100> the

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
anyway so you so you can just ignore the

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.370 
anyway so you so you can just ignore the
roofing<00:03:19.550> but<00:03:19.610> my<00:03:19.790> point<00:03:20.000> here<00:03:20.270> is<00:03:20.630> that<00:03:20.990> the

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
roofing but my point here is that the

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.900 
roofing but my point here is that the
house<00:03:21.530> is<00:03:21.710> no<00:03:21.860> longer<00:03:22.040> symmetrical<00:03:22.670> and<00:03:22.820> it

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
house is no longer symmetrical and it

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.310 
house is no longer symmetrical and it
looks<00:03:23.090> a<00:03:23.180> lot<00:03:23.300> better<00:03:23.360> than<00:03:23.780> it<00:03:24.140> would<00:03:24.290> have

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
looks a lot better than it would have

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.140 
looks a lot better than it would have
done<00:03:24.530> if<00:03:24.710> it<00:03:24.860> was<00:03:25.010> symmetrical<00:03:25.640> so<00:03:26.030> we're

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
done if it was symmetrical so we're

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.090 
done if it was symmetrical so we're
going<00:03:26.270> to<00:03:26.330> do<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.510> same<00:03:26.690> thing<00:03:26.990> now<00:03:27.140> we're

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
going to do the same thing now we're

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.290 
going to do the same thing now we're
going<00:03:28.220> to<00:03:28.280> make<00:03:28.370> it<00:03:28.460> symmetrical<00:03:28.550> again<00:03:29.090> and

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
going to make it symmetrical again and

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.780 
going to make it symmetrical again and
I'll<00:03:29.390> show<00:03:29.630> you<00:03:30.040> what<00:03:31.040> it<00:03:31.160> looks<00:03:31.370> like<00:03:31.520> if<00:03:31.760> we

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
I'll show you what it looks like if we

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.330 
I'll show you what it looks like if we
were<00:03:32.060> to<00:03:32.240> do<00:03:32.390> it<00:03:32.570> with<00:03:33.140> a<00:03:33.170> symmetrical<00:03:33.830> shape

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
were to do it with a symmetrical shape

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.450 
were to do it with a symmetrical shape
and<00:03:34.610> do<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:35.030> roof<00:03:35.270> the<00:03:35.840> same<00:03:36.230> and<00:03:36.560> all<00:03:37.160> of<00:03:37.310> that

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:37.460 
and do the roof the same and all of that

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.050 
and do the roof the same and all of that
kind<00:03:37.670> of<00:03:37.730> stuff<00:03:37.850> it<00:03:38.120> just<00:03:38.330> it<00:03:39.170> just<00:03:39.230> looks

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
kind of stuff it just it just looks

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.880 
kind of stuff it just it just looks
uninspired<00:03:41.060> it<00:03:41.330> doesn't<00:03:41.630> look<00:03:41.870> like<00:03:42.170> this<00:03:42.350> had

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
uninspired it doesn't look like this had

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.270 
uninspired it doesn't look like this had
time<00:03:43.550> and<00:03:43.850> thought<00:03:44.390> put<00:03:44.690> into<00:03:44.720> it<00:03:45.110> I<00:03:45.860> just

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
time and thought put into it I just

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.060 
time and thought put into it I just
looks<00:03:46.460> like<00:03:46.550> it's<00:03:46.670> been<00:03:46.730> thrown<00:03:47.000> together<00:03:48.070> so

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
looks like it's been thrown together so

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.580 
looks like it's been thrown together so
we'll<00:03:49.190> bring<00:03:49.310> that<00:03:49.430> down<00:03:49.750> and<00:03:50.750> there<00:03:51.440> you<00:03:51.530> go

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
we'll bring that down and there you go

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.440 
we'll bring that down and there you go
that<00:03:51.620> like<00:03:52.130> that<00:03:52.430> that<00:03:52.880> doesn't<00:03:53.150> look<00:03:53.300> like<00:03:53.420> a

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
that like that that doesn't look like a

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.880 
that like that that doesn't look like a
house<00:03:53.660> I<00:03:53.900> mean<00:03:54.110> it's<00:03:54.890> it's<00:03:55.400> -<00:03:55.930> it<00:03:56.930> it's<00:03:57.500> no

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.210 
mean to do that just play around with

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:15.520 
mean to do that just play around with
the<00:04:14.300> shapes<00:04:14.540> like<00:04:14.720> the<00:04:14.810> easiest<00:04:15.170> way<00:04:15.350> is<00:04:15.410> just

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
the shapes like the easiest way is just

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.500 
the shapes like the easiest way is just
to<00:04:15.740> click<00:04:16.280> and<00:04:16.489> drag<00:04:16.520> walls<00:04:17.030> like<00:04:17.270> if<00:04:17.420> you

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
to click and drag walls like if you

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:18.820 
to click and drag walls like if you
don't<00:04:17.630> want<00:04:17.750> to<00:04:17.810> actually<00:04:18.140> destroy<00:04:18.620> walls

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
don't want to actually destroy walls

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.110 
don't want to actually destroy walls
just<00:04:19.040> click<00:04:19.250> and<00:04:19.340> drag<00:04:19.400> them<00:04:19.760> and<00:04:19.880> see<00:04:19.970> what

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
just click and drag them and see what

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.570 
just click and drag them and see what
happens<00:04:20.739> so<00:04:21.739> we<00:04:21.799> can<00:04:21.919> go<00:04:21.980> back<00:04:22.130> to<00:04:22.160> the<00:04:22.280> similar

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
happens so we can go back to the similar

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.670 
happens so we can go back to the similar
shape<00:04:22.610> we<00:04:22.850> kind<00:04:23.000> of<00:04:23.090> had<00:04:23.180> before<00:04:23.570> this<00:04:24.560> wood

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
shape we kind of had before this wood

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.290 
shape we kind of had before this wood
back<00:04:24.860> over<00:04:25.040> here<00:04:25.340> and<00:04:25.610> this<00:04:25.760> wood<00:04:25.970> back
