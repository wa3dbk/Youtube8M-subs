 a great player also known as my 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.340
 disciple since I have given one another 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.199
 advice but how can you see your 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.640
 team brings because it's pretty good 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.860
 center with his voice will be me with my win 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.120
 the future substitute I know that of roser 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.739
 aires defended special crossing the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.239
 structure of your team and what improvements 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.610
 toxic is something that does not bother me 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.220
 too much only that they poison don 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.260
 fan and now he decides to change towards his 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.760
 Spending you hit with the shadow ball a 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.620
 hit that did him great damage since 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.900
 come also expect low a lot changes 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.000
 his great because he does not want it to be a 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.379
 pokémon has weakened I go for a 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.760
 sure for my good luck do not fail 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.040
 already put me the rocks more were 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.810
 protection would just where 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.130
 which are the accurate wave wants to be 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.420
 I finished and besides that it's going to 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.130
 recover a bit of life with the remains 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.900
 of the Nobel for an accurate and one of 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.189
 risk 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.380
 in an excellent position behind me 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.390
 substitute I'm watching the movements 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.670
 from jürgen and he wants you to come alone 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.649
 with life wait but I 'm not allowed 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.700
 since I have divide pain in this great 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.740
 gareth he became known as sub split 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.390
 it's a pretty good being, it goes down a lot 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.100
 you recover your life with the divide as 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.680
 they saw it while their gourmets incera 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.119
 mind nomas broke my substitute and I 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.920
 I knew I was going to change something, it tells me that 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.390
 will change back I predicted it well 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.619
 I have free substitutes again 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.659
 Between sookie tram 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.429
 we're just taking turns here 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.140
 they would be number that is in a certain way 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.579
 for the prediction protection this 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.799
 movement wants me to finish 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.439
 these attacks the new the accurate crown 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.969
 and you can get one down already gastón 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.340
 pokémon who left without causing any 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:56.840
 annoyance for my good luck between 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.369
 new and so good for the protection 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.929
 exit that I'm going to use but I did not want 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.049
 risk more about predicting since not 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:04.369
 lost all my remaining few 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.810
 an accurate and well I only need 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.789
 one to weaken it or if it is not 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.119
 pointed the shadow could make a good 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.739
 hurt 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.989
 and thrown for example toads since 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.580
 we know you can trust easily washes 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.019
 goal in January but elicited with the 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.030
 smoke while your come in a way 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.760
 very brave who made it almost sure 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.290
 that it was a hangar escarpment since its 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.849
 team there is no quick pokemon here 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.409
 is where I am surprised and jailbreak one 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.090
 I should be climbing but I was wrong 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.310
 with the object and I put the rest 6 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.579
 innovate the thread notice and it's an expensive and 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.019
 that that red was so it's a 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.430
 sure did not fail him and he managed to finish 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.900
 with my daughter and dragon it was quite 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.819
 quick the battle but that was because of 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.769
 an error of mine that has not put the 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.599
 cloth object chosen but then good 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.120
 its okay the substitute vapor its by the 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.769
 ray then one put your substitute I 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.569
 I thought to use this the movement of 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.430
 cancellation why change for the dignified 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.660
 but I do not like it makes me think that 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.400
 I have it and then with a beam I get 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.379
 weakening the toads is a Pokémon that 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.970
 She loves the truth as equal and 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.859
 pretty good on earth 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.650
 in fact for easily so he did with 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:05.280
 This pokemon for many whys hit 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.109
 to fish die as they saw yesterday in 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.480
 gasteiz on hi dragon you pay it easily 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:11.819
 with saints with pure toxic and breathe is 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.680
 a toads of special fiction 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.359
 the immense ska maria what they went through 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.980
 for the value ibi thinking that maybe 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.420
 to use the roar but no they are not 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.599
 came with me funk to remove what 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:25.049
 are the toxic waters and the rocks since 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:26.280
 you have two delivery classes here I go 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.319
 to say with him I want to time now for 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.549
 remove them as I tell them I am poisoned 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.739
 it's not something that matters very much that they go 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.500
 it's just a wall just take away 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:37.530
 things and throw rocks and remove them and those 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.540
 things but it is not a pokémon that it is 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.760
 very very functional for the team 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.260
 only remove them in you houses in case 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.209
 in this case if it works for me already 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.889
 that he had all three kinds of 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.189
 entrecasa since they had toxic waters 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:52.859
 leaks and trap rocks while using a 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:54.290
 plasma that your vehicle is the only 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.510
 pokemon what 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.219
 that gives me a little fear since it 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.959
 can go out of control because I have 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:02.030
 avenge with the ball shadows but if I 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.129
 they feel like I have anyway 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.659
 user with the chosen tape and with the 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:06.920
 crushing motion but still not 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:08.750
 I'm sure to take it with a blow 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.189
 that could get out of control but 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.560
 you go right now everything is half controlled 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:14.510
 this is Carmona and how did you see and then 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.530
 I go by lightning against this one the 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.840
 only is what taken 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.759
 relatively well that is going to think 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.289
 here you walk one is to win but not me 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.750
 I'm going to stay because it was the move that 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:25.039
 I did before I 'm not going to do it again 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.860
 I got into the Giorgio mind 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:30.080
 a moment so with a critical radius 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.490
 which made me totally remove 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.020
 dependent I lead a life 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.340
 red that is her face 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.810
 simply because he does not want to sacrifice 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.039
 now about unique I thought maybe 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.780
 is the microcine the ability of the 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:41.570
 regeneration but then I'm not 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.979
 sure I still get to hit him with the 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.060
 gift of guinea I do a good damage to 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:46.820
 Although not even points in the 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.259
 special attack of sap 2 and that rose 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.520
 heredia special defense I tell them 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:51.830
 rosell of special job is pretty 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.720
 well still it does not take very well with 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.729
 dignity that will be special 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.509
 Even if you do not give him points 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:01.610
 exceeds 200 special attack points 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:03.650
 only without sand gives about 240 that I 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.270
 I do not remember well but it has a good 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.559
 special attack that is sometimes coal and 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.229
 simply because he does not want his 

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:11.059
 roster and die the tornado still the 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.099
 throw coal and you will be what you will be 

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:14.629
 on another line for the storm of 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:16.370
 leaves the only movement that charges for 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:18.080
 attack this role I will be mine I have it 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.180
 condemned but they fear storm of 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.529
 leaves is a good move is not born almost 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.849
 nothing the year since as I say these 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:26.809
 special craft trees it takes 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:28.370
 pretty good good igneous portland for 

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:31.550
 weaken it and it has not been for sale 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.749
 this of 20 in which his reunite nothing else 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.740
 but then in the range of life that is 

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:35.360
 because with lightning it's going to be more than 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.249
 enough to finish it and then this 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.139
 it was the battle as the third of the 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:41.449
 high controls of little more international 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:43.699
 good fire jurgen you return to the first 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:45.740
 elite 4 and well this was the battle 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:47.360
 I hope you liked her 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:51.939
 surprise if they like pokémon 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.939
 competitive as we see each other in goodbye
