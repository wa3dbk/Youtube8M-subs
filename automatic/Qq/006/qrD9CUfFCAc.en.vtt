00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
up the two halves that you line them up

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.360 
up the two halves that you line them up
so<00:00:46.940> you<00:00:47.059> have<00:00:47.210> a<00:00:47.239> hole<00:00:47.600> here<00:00:48.079> you<00:00:49.010> can<00:00:49.130> see<00:00:49.309> it

so you have a hole here you can see it

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.190 
so you have a hole here you can see it
right<00:00:49.489> there<00:00:49.630> and<00:00:50.630> it<00:00:50.720> just<00:00:50.930> snaps<00:00:51.290> together

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
right there and it just snaps together

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.959 
right there and it just snaps together
like<00:00:54.200> that<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:54.800> now<00:00:55.280> you<00:00:55.340> need<00:00:55.579> that<00:00:55.760> hole

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
like that and now you need that hole

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:57.940 
like that and now you need that hole
there<00:00:56.149> because<00:00:56.420> it<00:00:56.960> also<00:00:57.110> comes<00:00:57.440> with<00:00:57.530> a<00:00:57.680> base

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
there because it also comes with a base

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.350

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
a little bit flat kind of like this

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.680 
a little bit flat kind of like this
throw<00:03:16.470> like<00:03:16.620> a<00:03:16.650> beam<00:03:16.950> just<00:03:17.850> like<00:03:18.000> that<00:03:18.210> and<00:03:18.600> if

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
throw like a beam just like that and if

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.780 
throw like a beam just like that and if
you<00:03:18.840> take<00:03:19.050> your<00:03:19.230> scissors<00:03:19.470> and<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:20.430> cut<00:03:20.670> it

you take your scissors and you cut it

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.020 
you take your scissors and you cut it
exactly<00:03:21.030> in<00:03:21.630> half<00:03:22.430> now<00:03:23.430> you'll<00:03:23.640> have<00:03:23.700> two

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
exactly in half now you'll have two

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.970 
exactly in half now you'll have two
balls<00:03:24.270> that<00:03:24.540> are<00:03:24.570> exactly<00:03:25.020> the<00:03:25.200> same<00:03:25.230> size<00:03:25.440> so

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
balls that are exactly the same size so

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.470 
balls that are exactly the same size so
that's<00:03:26.130> my<00:03:26.250> little<00:03:26.400> little<00:03:26.820> trick<00:03:27.120> there<00:03:27.270> for

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
about as tall as the basis so that's a

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.510 
about as tall as the basis so that's a
good<00:04:03.630> way<00:04:03.750> to<00:04:03.810> kind<00:04:04.320> of<00:04:04.410> measure<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:05.130> you<00:04:05.340> can

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
good way to kind of measure and you can
