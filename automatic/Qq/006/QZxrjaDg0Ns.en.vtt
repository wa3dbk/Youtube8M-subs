the<00:00:00.780> messenger<00:00:01.380> spacecraft<00:00:01.520> will<00:00:02.520> hit<00:00:03.179> the

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
the messenger spacecraft will hit the

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.470 
the messenger spacecraft will hit the
surface<00:00:03.870> of<00:00:04.350> mercury<00:00:04.859> and<00:00:05.310> crash<00:00:05.730> at<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.180> end

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
surface of mercury and crash at the end

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.629 
surface of mercury and crash at the end
of<00:00:06.540> April<00:00:06.930> basically<00:00:07.740> we're<00:00:07.890> out<00:00:08.040> of<00:00:08.069> fuel<00:00:08.370> now

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
of April basically we're out of fuel now

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.730 
of April basically we're out of fuel now
we're<00:00:09.630> at<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.840> end<00:00:09.960> of<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.200> really<00:00:10.500> successful

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
we're at the end of a really successful

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.220 
we're at the end of a really successful
mission<00:00:11.370> what<00:00:11.969> happens<00:00:12.300> we<00:00:12.809> can't<00:00:13.110> do

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
mission what happens we can't do

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.140 
mission what happens we can't do
anything<00:00:13.259> anymore<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:14.309> stop<00:00:14.549> but<00:00:14.700> from<00:00:14.910> doing

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
anything anymore to stop but from doing

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.790 
anything anymore to stop but from doing
what<00:00:15.299> it<00:00:15.420> naturally<00:00:15.870> wants<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.170> do<00:00:16.289> because<00:00:16.770> of

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
what it naturally wants to do because of

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.010 
what it naturally wants to do because of
the<00:00:17.039> fact<00:00:17.279> that<00:00:17.520> mercury<00:00:18.119> does<00:00:18.480> not<00:00:18.660> have<00:00:18.869> an

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
the fact that mercury does not have an

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.679 
the fact that mercury does not have an
atmosphere<00:00:19.730> the<00:00:20.730> spacecraft<00:00:21.240> will<00:00:21.390> actually

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
atmosphere the spacecraft will actually

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.750 
atmosphere the spacecraft will actually
not<00:00:21.840> burn<00:00:22.050> up<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.859> will<00:00:23.010> truly<00:00:23.250> explode

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
not burn up so it will truly explode

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.540 
not burn up so it will truly explode
when<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.390> hits<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.840> surface<00:00:25.490> University<00:00:26.490> of

doesn't<00:01:29.070> fissile<00:01:29.729> out<00:01:29.880> we<00:01:30.240> make<00:01:30.540> discoveries

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
doesn't fissile out we make discoveries

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.670 
doesn't fissile out we make discoveries
till<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.680> last<00:01:31.979> day<00:01:32.790> at<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.630> height<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:34.170> the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.390 
discoveries of this mission messenger
basically<00:01:37.380> made<00:01:37.500> us<00:01:37.619> aware<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.070> fact<00:01:38.280> that

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
basically made us aware of the fact that

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.640 
basically made us aware of the fact that
mercury<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.000> fact<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.810> planet<00:01:40.500> that's

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
mercury is in fact a planet that's

this we've stayed up at night because of
it<00:02:19.590> we've<00:02:19.830> written<00:02:20.600> publications<00:02:21.600> about<00:02:21.690> it

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960

it we've written publications about it
of<00:02:22.080> course<00:02:22.260> we<00:02:22.440> will<00:02:22.590> do<00:02:22.710> so<00:02:22.950> in<00:02:23.070> the<00:02:23.100> future

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
of course we will do so in the future

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.370 
of course we will do so in the future
and<00:02:23.700> we've<00:02:23.820> made<00:02:24.060> discoveries<00:02:24.690> far<00:02:25.110> beyond

and we've made discoveries far beyond
what<00:02:25.410> we<00:02:25.710> expected<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:27.750> catch<00:02:27.960> is<00:02:27.990> is<00:02:28.350> that<00:02:28.500> if

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
what we expected the catch is is that if

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.590 
what we expected the catch is is that if
they<00:02:28.740> don't<00:02:28.920> perform<00:02:29.100> as<00:02:29.580> well<00:02:29.640> as<00:02:29.910> or<00:02:30.390> better

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
they don't perform as well as or better

they don't perform as well as or better
than<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:31.080> fuels<00:02:31.320> we<00:02:31.470> already<00:02:31.770> have<00:02:32.070> you<00:02:32.790> can

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
than the fuels we already have you can

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.340 
than the fuels we already have you can
have<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.120> net<00:02:33.360> increase<00:02:33.540> in<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:34.020> carbon

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
emissions associated with these fuels so

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.720 
emissions associated with these fuels so
we<00:02:37.110> have<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.380> be<00:02:37.410> careful<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.980> understand

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
we have to be careful and understand
