 that you eat very healthy very 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.079
 nutritious but very varied the flyers 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.820
 traditional are made with dough in 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.000
 this case we will make them very much like 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.460
 It removes kilos with a lot of fiber with 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.680
 nopal while the nopales are browned 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.780
 to finish my preparation here I'm going to 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.060
 cut lettuce and I'm going to tell you a 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.399
 little bit of how we did it I have 70 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.170
 grams of previously cooked chicken that 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:18.380
 nothing wrong or cooked in water is fine 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.960
 Seasoned and crumbled I have my cubes 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.700
 of panela cheese those are 70 grams for 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.159
 a meal and 60 grams of a cheese 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.890
 Panela is for dinner I also have so much 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:31.009
 green sauce which I do as in my 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.709
 I get home to boil the water will put the 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.679
 tomatoes, chilitos, I'll grind you with 

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:38.850
 an invited garlic salt and a few leaves 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:41.400
 coriander 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.960
 since they are seeing the publisher nopales 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.280
 on both sides I'm going to put a 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.000
 little salt and pepper so that 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.000
 have flavor 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.579
 I like to use pepper and salt 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.710
 grain since it has a lot more flavor 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.909
 that normal 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.909
 and let's ride 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.690
 we put our two nopales 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.390
 I'm going to put that today on 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.690

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.739

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.160

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.160

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.300
 of the tomato 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.130
 and a few slices of onion only 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.940
 over 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.940
 as decoration 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.989
 we can bathe it with our green sauce 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.970
 or some red sauce or the sauce in 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.800
