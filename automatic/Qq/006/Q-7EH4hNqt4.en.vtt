 overlays decompose as soon as 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.039
 solar ultraviolet falls and then 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.560
 all or almost all is washed away by precipitation 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.179
 you have an erroneous opinion of ours 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.750
 something glass manufacturers 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:40.450

 sticks to glass 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.470
 and so as not to fall there is a safety 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.630
 cable 2 gentlemen already 20 thousand mounted on 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.400
 magnets on both sides of glass in the state 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.420
 magnetic brush and which for us 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.880
 testing climbers staged also 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:23.650
 baths are dropped but because the magnetic

 to gives out rob gave me do fell off 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.070
 It is known that such a thing has long been taken 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.310

 the beasts are forever smudged with something inside and 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:49.000
 outside we give about this time to work a 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.000

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.980
 ready 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.879
 considering that this is my first one 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.879
 qualitatively 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.540

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.730
 vacuum cleaner for windows copes with a bang 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.800

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.020
 after applying going narrow 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.290
 nozzle in just a couple of minutes yuri 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.940
 finished work on magnets worked 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.709
 full twenty minutes but even 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.500
 automatic detergent supply 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.480
 did not help the stains from the brushes did not 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.190
 disappeared full experience appeared 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.100
 significantly faster than just 4 minutes 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.040
 Were here divorces remained 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.290
 in general, the champion 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:42.109
 those turned out to be Nina Filipovna with her 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:44.390
 newspapers file I understand how to curl 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:45.950
 we found out already then wash without streaks 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.989
 vacuum robot is still capable 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.510
 ingenious supplement to this asian 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:53.030
 technicians came up with our craftsmen after 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.459
 3 polished glass and the truth was clean 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.829
 however for the manufacturerâ€™s defects 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.810
 we put this device only 4 stars 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.730
 the robot on the ruble magnets was heavy 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.799
 and uncomfortable and work far from 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.650
 all windows the thickness of the glass must 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.239
 be from 16 to 28 millimeters and in 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:14.299
 Russian realities, it happens more 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:16.519
 30 set only even the assessment and magnetic 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:19.359
 brushes she brushes bad on and all the time 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.359
 tries to fall away 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.120
 real competitor to try and newspaper can 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.430
 recognize only the window cleaner 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.970
 talented and the invention gets 5 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.860
 the stars 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.680
 of course we are talking only about easy 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.060
 accessible windows to where it is difficult and dangerous 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.430
 still have to call 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.430
