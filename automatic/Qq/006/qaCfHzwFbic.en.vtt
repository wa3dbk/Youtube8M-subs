here<00:00:49.730> hmm<00:00:50.730> sure<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.570> set<00:00:51.750> right<00:00:51.780> here<00:00:52.170> is

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
here hmm sure this set right here is

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.229 
here hmm sure this set right here is
just<00:00:53.100> slightly<00:00:53.430> different<00:00:54.620> than<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:55.800> setup

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
just slightly different than this setup

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.400 
just slightly different than this setup
the<00:00:57.239> only<00:00:57.420> difference<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:58.079> setups

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
the only difference is this setups

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.410 
the only difference is this setups
easier<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.800> conceal<00:00:59.100> than<00:00:59.399> this<00:00:59.520> setup<00:00:59.760> but

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
easier to conceal than this setup but

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.610 
easier to conceal than this setup but
I'm<00:01:00.510> not<00:01:00.629> going<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.809> go<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:00.989> take<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.289> apart

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
I'm not going to go and take this apart

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.500 
I'm not going to go and take this apart
to<00:01:01.980> show<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:02.699> setup<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.239> little

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
to show you and this setup is a little

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.070 
to show you and this setup is a little
bit<00:01:03.600> simpler<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:04.949> better<00:01:05.220> for<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:06.080> so

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
bit simpler so it's better for you so

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.340 
bit simpler so it's better for you so
the<00:01:07.170> way<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.439> works<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:08.570> you<00:01:09.570> have<00:01:09.810> these

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
the way this works is you have these

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.890 
the way this works is you have these
separate<00:01:11.340> from<00:01:12.150> these<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.840> these<00:01:13.650> go<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.900> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
separate from these and these go to the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.260 
separate from these and these go to the
line<00:01:16.140> back<00:01:16.439> here<00:01:16.770> which<00:01:17.070> then<00:01:17.310> goes<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.970> these

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
line back here which then goes to these

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.010 
line back here which then goes to these
two<00:01:18.689> repeaters<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.890> go<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:21.020> dispensers

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
two repeaters that go to the dispensers

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.469 
two repeaters that go to the dispensers
which<00:01:22.530> when<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.860> push<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.250> button<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:24.119> will

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
which when you push the button it will

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.320 
which when you push the button it will
light<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.110> thing<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.560> then<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.909> button

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
light the thing and then this button

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.859 
light the thing and then this button
goes<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.560> line<00:01:29.060> which<00:01:30.060> then<00:01:30.360> goes<00:01:30.509> sorry

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
goes to this line which then goes sorry

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.899 
goes to this line which then goes sorry
for<00:01:31.020> all<00:01:31.079> those<00:01:31.200> slurping<00:01:31.619> noises<00:01:32.040> which<00:01:32.670> goes

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
for all those slurping noises which goes

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.219 
for all those slurping noises which goes
to<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:34.520> redstone<00:01:35.520> light<00:01:36.030> which<00:01:36.750> then<00:01:37.020> goes

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
to this redstone light which then goes

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.830 
to this redstone light which then goes
to<00:01:37.290> these<00:01:37.680> two<00:01:37.950> sticky<00:01:38.430> pistons<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.060> then<00:01:39.689> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
to these two sticky pistons and then the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.270 
to these two sticky pistons and then the
same<00:01:40.049> thing<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.560> have<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.740> leading<00:01:41.070> around

same thing and you have a leading around
backs<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.880> then<00:01:42.030> they<00:01:42.180> both<00:01:42.950> activate<00:01:43.950> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
backs and then they both activate the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.980 
backs and then they both activate the
things<00:01:45.780> at<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.020> same<00:01:46.170> time<00:01:46.640> so<00:01:47.640> yeah<00:01:47.990> it's

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
so we had a confined space and we

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.350 
so we had a confined space and we
couldn't<00:02:29.110> build<00:02:29.380> a<00:02:29.680> large<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:30.760> block<00:02:31.000> one<00:02:31.210> that

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
couldn't build a large to block one that

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.080 
couldn't build a large to block one that
you<00:02:31.420> just<00:02:31.570> saw<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.780> second<00:02:32.140> ago<00:02:32.520> this<00:02:33.520> one<00:02:33.730> is<00:02:33.940> a

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
you just saw a second ago this one is a

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.700 
you just saw a second ago this one is a
one-block<00:02:34.450> one<00:02:34.750> so<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:34.960> push<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.260> button<00:02:35.290> and

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
one-block one so you push the button and

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.850 
one-block one so you push the button and
then<00:02:36.370> you<00:02:36.640> push<00:02:36.820> the<00:02:36.970> button<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.390> yeah<00:02:38.350> so<00:02:38.620> way

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
then you push the button and yeah so way

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.490 
then you push the button and yeah so way
it<00:02:38.980> works<00:02:39.160> is<00:02:39.520> pretty<00:02:40.240> much<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.420> same<00:02:40.720> except

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
it works is pretty much the same except

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.900 
it works is pretty much the same except
just<00:02:41.650> slightly<00:02:41.860> different<00:02:42.250> way<00:02:42.280> more<00:02:42.580> compact

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
just slightly different way more compact

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.300 
just slightly different way more compact
I<00:02:43.090> can<00:02:43.210> say<00:02:43.300> that<00:02:43.330> for<00:02:43.510> sure<00:02:43.630> um<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:45.100> way<00:02:45.220> it

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
I can say that for sure um the way it

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.970 
I can say that for sure um the way it
goes<00:02:45.370> is<00:02:45.570> you<00:02:46.570> have<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.840> dispenser<00:02:47.350> then<00:02:47.830> you

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
goes is you have the dispenser then you

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.580 
goes is you have the dispenser then you
have<00:02:48.130> this<00:02:48.400> and<00:02:48.700> then<00:02:48.970> this<00:02:49.180> goes<00:02:49.480> to<00:02:49.630> here<00:02:50.050> as

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
have this and then this goes to here as

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.760 
have this and then this goes to here as
you<00:02:50.770> can<00:02:50.800> tell<00:02:51.040> and<00:02:51.220> then<00:02:52.090> um<00:02:52.710> this<00:02:53.710> button

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
you can tell and then um this button

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.710 
you can tell and then um this button
when<00:02:56.770> you<00:02:56.860> push<00:02:57.070> it<00:02:57.280> activates<00:02:57.910> this<00:02:58.420> little

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
when you push it activates this little

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.390 
when you push it activates this little
torch<00:02:59.500> thingy<00:02:59.800> and<00:03:01.560> because<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.950> power<00:03:03.130> from

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
torch thingy and because the power from

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:15.620 
torch thingy and because the power from
this<00:03:05.340> actually<00:03:06.870> mmm-hmm<00:03:12.360> power<00:03:13.360> from<00:03:13.660> this

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
this actually mmm-hmm power from this

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.040 
this actually mmm-hmm power from this
see<00:03:16.630> if<00:03:16.720> we<00:03:16.810> can<00:03:16.930> do<00:03:17.020> this

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
see if we can do this

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.440 
see if we can do this
yeah<00:03:20.050> okay<00:03:20.500> so<00:03:20.820> actually<00:03:21.820> it's<00:03:22.060> even<00:03:22.300> more

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
yeah okay so actually it's even more

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.250 
yeah okay so actually it's even more
compact<00:03:22.900> yay<00:03:23.350> so<00:03:23.800> the<00:03:24.070> power<00:03:24.190> from<00:03:24.520> on<00:03:25.260> that

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
compact yay so the power from on that

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.710 
compact yay so the power from on that
thing<00:03:26.590> goes<00:03:27.460> to<00:03:28.770> from<00:03:29.770> that<00:03:30.190> goes<00:03:30.610> to<00:03:31.000> the

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
thing goes to from that goes to the

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.330 
thing goes to from that goes to the
power<00:03:31.930> from<00:03:32.020> the<00:03:32.200> button<00:03:32.380> goes<00:03:32.650> to<00:03:32.830> this<00:03:33.010> and

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
power from the button goes to this and

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.310 
power from the button goes to this and
this<00:03:34.060> which<00:03:34.570> then<00:03:34.810> will<00:03:34.960> power<00:03:35.170> this<00:03:35.920> and<00:03:37.320> then

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
this which then will power this and then

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.240 
this which then will power this and then
you<00:03:38.470> go<00:03:38.590> up<00:03:38.620> here<00:03:39.070> and<00:03:39.190> then<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.270> power<00:03:40.450> from

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
you go up here and then the power from

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.550 
you go up here and then the power from
the<00:03:43.170> na<00:03:44.170> from<00:03:44.710> this<00:03:44.950> will<00:03:45.550> go<00:03:45.700> into<00:03:46.060> this<00:03:46.960> which

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
the na from this will go into this which

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.740 
the na from this will go into this which
then<00:03:47.770> we'll<00:03:47.920> go<00:03:48.010> around<00:03:48.340> to<00:03:48.580> this<00:03:48.850> which<00:03:49.600> will

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
then we'll go around to this which will

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.150 
then we'll go around to this which will
then<00:03:49.870> go<00:03:50.020> to<00:03:50.080> this<00:03:50.320> and<00:03:50.560> then<00:03:50.650> that<00:03:50.800> and<00:03:51.040> then

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
then go to this and then that and then

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.890 
then go to this and then that and then
that<00:03:51.310> will<00:03:51.430> be<00:03:51.520> pulled<00:03:51.760> back<00:03:51.940> and<00:03:52.600> I<00:03:52.750> thought

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
that will be pulled back and I thought

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.150 
that will be pulled back and I thought
why<00:03:53.080> not<00:03:53.110> add<00:03:53.380> a<00:03:53.410> little<00:03:53.560> aesthetic<00:03:54.070> effect

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
why not add a little aesthetic effect

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.220 
why not add a little aesthetic effect
