00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
I mean some things just because some

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.530 
I mean some things just because some
things<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:37.630> don't<00:02:37.810> depend<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:39.700> mean<00:02:40.270> some<00:02:40.450> of

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
things you don't depend I mean some of

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.200 
things you don't depend I mean some of
my<00:02:40.630> tattoos<00:02:41.050> are<00:02:41.230> reminders<00:02:41.800> of<00:02:42.040> good<00:02:42.940> and<00:02:43.120> bad

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
my tattoos are reminders of good and bad

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:49.470 
my tattoos are reminders of good and bad
so<00:02:46.860> that's<00:02:47.860> that's<00:02:48.640> just<00:02:48.880> something<00:02:49.060> I<00:02:49.300> like

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
so that's that's just something I like

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.300 
so that's that's just something I like
to<00:02:49.660> do<00:02:50.520> it<00:02:51.520> isn't<00:02:52.210> important<00:02:52.660> for<00:02:52.840> me<00:02:52.960> so<00:02:53.170> I<00:02:53.310> put

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
to do it isn't important for me so I put

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.520 
to do it isn't important for me so I put
it<00:02:54.400> on<00:02:54.490> my<00:02:54.580> body<00:02:54.790> but<00:02:57.690> now<00:02:58.690> I<00:02:58.720> think<00:02:58.870> people<00:02:59.380> are

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
it on my body but now I think people are

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.410 
it on my body but now I think people are
more<00:02:59.710> confident<00:03:00.190> about<00:03:00.340> doing<00:03:00.790> it<00:03:00.910> is<00:03:01.000> it's

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
more confident about doing it is it's

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.420 
more confident about doing it is it's
more<00:03:01.630> accepting<00:03:02.170> that<00:03:02.320> so<00:03:03.070> that's<00:03:03.280> why<00:03:03.370> you

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
more accepting that so that's why you
