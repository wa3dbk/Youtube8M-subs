long time because he hasn't connected to
my<00:04:33.210> Wi-Fi<00:04:33.420> but<00:04:34.370> basically<00:04:35.370> just<00:04:35.670> click

if you're getting errors downloading it
that's<00:04:42.150> most<00:04:42.420> likely<00:04:42.510> because<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:43.350> green

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
that's most likely because the green

poison<00:04:44.160> server<00:04:44.670> is<00:04:45.230> quite<00:04:46.230> slow<00:04:46.500> at<00:04:46.950> this

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
poison server is quite slow at this

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.020
