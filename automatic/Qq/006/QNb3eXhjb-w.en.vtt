00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
realized that it didn't work because we

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.469 
realized that it didn't work because we
weren't<00:01:28.220> able<00:01:28.430> to<00:01:28.670> determine<00:01:28.970> whether<00:01:29.150> it<00:01:29.390> was

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479

a<00:01:29.509> text<00:01:29.930> or<00:01:30.020> this<00:01:30.229> so<00:01:30.409> this<00:01:30.560> is<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:30.890> next<00:01:31.159> step

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
a text or this so this is the next step

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.190 
a text or this so this is the next step
and<00:01:31.520> then<00:01:31.640> we'll<00:01:31.820> kind<00:01:32.030> of<00:01:32.240> just<00:01:32.540> said<00:01:32.960> we<00:01:33.080> go

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
and then we'll kind of just said we go

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.510 
and then we'll kind of just said we go
from<00:01:33.320> here<00:01:33.380> to<00:01:33.650> see<00:01:33.770> if<00:01:33.920> we<00:01:34.040> have<00:01:34.189> to<00:01:34.340> improve

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520
