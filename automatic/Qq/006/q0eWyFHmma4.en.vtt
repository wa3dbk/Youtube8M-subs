00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
really disappointed that we didn't win

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.450 
really disappointed that we didn't win
because<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.730> players<00:00:08.940> gave<00:00:09.300> everything

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
because the players gave everything

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.970 
because the players gave everything
physically<00:00:11.460> they<00:00:11.790> put<00:00:12.059> everything<00:00:12.570> in<00:00:12.980> right

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
physically they put everything in right

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.519 
physically they put everything in right
now<00:00:14.190> psychologically<00:00:14.820> we<00:00:15.509> are<00:00:15.660> experiencing

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
now psychologically we are experiencing

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.830 
now psychologically we are experiencing
some<00:00:16.770> problems<00:00:16.949> but<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:18.420> thought<00:00:18.690> they<00:00:18.810> looked

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
some problems but I thought they looked

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.660 
some problems but I thought they looked
better<00:00:19.380> in<00:00:19.740> this<00:00:19.980> respect<00:00:20.250> during<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.880> game

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
better in this respect during the game

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.580 
better in this respect during the game
the<00:00:23.670> first<00:00:23.910> half<00:00:24.210> showing<00:00:24.449> wasn't<00:00:24.990> as<00:00:25.140> good<00:00:25.350> as

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
the first half showing wasn't as good as

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.220 
the first half showing wasn't as good as
i<00:00:25.710> would<00:00:25.769> have<00:00:25.890> liked<00:00:26.449> we<00:00:27.449> made<00:00:27.660> some<00:00:27.689> mistakes

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
i would have liked we made some mistakes

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.040 
i would have liked we made some mistakes
technically<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.789> found<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.210> hard<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.599> get<00:00:30.840> any

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
technically and found it hard to get any

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.770 
technically and found it hard to get any
rhythm<00:00:31.320> going<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.980> we<00:00:32.940> sometimes<00:00:33.420> got<00:00:33.660> the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
rhythm going and we sometimes got the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.490 
rhythm going and we sometimes got the
final<00:00:34.170> pass<00:00:34.410> wrong<00:00:35.600> at<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.809> back<00:00:37.079> we<00:00:37.110> were

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
final pass wrong at the back we were

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.830 
final pass wrong at the back we were
good<00:00:37.710> we<00:00:37.950> didn't<00:00:38.760> concede<00:00:39.149> much<00:00:39.390> which<00:00:39.809> is

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
good we didn't concede much which is

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.160 
good we didn't concede much which is
good<00:00:40.340> we<00:00:41.340> are<00:00:41.460> well<00:00:41.670> aware<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.450> win<00:00:42.660> we

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
good we are well aware that to win we

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.090 
good we are well aware that to win we
need<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.500> score<00:00:43.770> at<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.040> other<00:00:44.340> end<00:00:46.010> in<00:00:47.010> the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
need to score at the other end in the

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.520 
need to score at the other end in the
second<00:00:47.430> half<00:00:47.640> our<00:00:48.239> opponents<00:00:48.809> tired<00:00:49.140> because

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
second half our opponents tired because

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.610 
second half our opponents tired because
they<00:00:49.829> had<00:00:49.980> run<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.430> much<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:51.120> saw<00:00:51.750> we<00:00:52.410> on<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
they had run so much I saw we on the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.279 
they had run so much I saw we on the
other<00:00:52.739> hand<00:00:52.920> had<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.579> few<00:00:53.850> chances<00:00:54.050> and<00:00:55.050> maybe

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
other hand had a few chances and maybe

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.830 
other hand had a few chances and maybe
needed<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.890> bit<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.129> luck<00:00:56.309> we<00:00:56.940> need<00:00:57.719> to

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
needed a bit of luck we need to

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.849 
needed a bit of luck we need to
rediscover<00:00:58.170> how<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.680> score<00:00:59.100> again<00:01:00.620> overall<00:01:01.620> I

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
rediscover how to score again overall I

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.799 
rediscover how to score again overall I
would<00:01:01.980> say<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.460> result<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> small<00:01:03.480> step

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
would say the result is a small step

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.710 
would say the result is a small step
forwards<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.619> was<00:01:05.430> on<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.700> coherent<00:01:05.970> ethical<00:01:06.570> you

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
forwards I was on a coherent ethical you

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.380 
forwards I was on a coherent ethical you
I<00:01:07.020> started<00:01:07.619> with<00:01:07.799> two<00:01:08.040> attacking<00:01:08.760> midfielders

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
I started with two attacking midfielders

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.719 
I started with two attacking midfielders
because<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.260> wanted<00:01:10.560> more<00:01:10.770> intensity<00:01:11.430> in<00:01:11.670> the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
because I wanted more intensity in the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.090 
because I wanted more intensity in the
middle<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.090> pitch<00:01:12.390> an<00:01:13.290> area<00:01:13.710> where<00:01:13.979> we

middle of the pitch an area where we

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.899 
middle of the pitch an area where we
need<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.549> find<00:01:14.850> better<00:01:14.970> balance<00:01:16.400> is<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.610> what's
