craft and today have you guys atomic
size<00:00:27.070> another<00:00:27.430> one<00:00:27.610> and<00:00:28.090> they're<00:00:28.480> basically

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
size another one and they're basically

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:35.970 
size another one and they're basically
it's<00:00:29.560> a<00:00:29.680> little<00:00:29.919> bit<00:00:30.040> of<00:00:30.130> a<00:00:30.220> nerdy<00:00:34.620> yeah<00:00:35.620> I<00:00:35.650> said

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
it's a little bit of a nerdy yeah I said

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.680 
it's a little bit of a nerdy yeah I said
no<00:00:36.070> so<00:00:36.310> basically<00:00:36.610> you<00:00:36.820> person<00:00:37.180> is<00:00:37.270> going<00:00:37.480> to

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
no so basically you person is going to

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.970 
no so basically you person is going to
do<00:00:37.930> this<00:00:38.230> one<00:00:38.470> it's<00:00:39.220> all<00:00:39.489> about<00:00:40.710> breaking<00:00:41.710> down

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
do this one it's all about breaking down

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.310 
do this one it's all about breaking down
elements<00:00:42.820> creating<00:00:43.540> these<00:00:43.660> new<00:00:44.080> elements

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
elements creating these new elements

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.440 
elements creating these new elements
alone<00:00:45.070> element<00:00:45.670> part<00:00:45.850> here<00:00:46.120> was<00:00:46.300> different

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
alone element part here was different

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.240 
alone element part here was different
atomic<00:00:46.870> numbers<00:00:47.260> is<00:00:47.410> ten<00:00:47.620> different<00:00:47.890> elements

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
atomic numbers is ten different elements

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.210 
atomic numbers is ten different elements
at<00:00:48.700> the<00:00:48.760> moment<00:00:49.120> the<00:00:49.450> stones<00:00:49.960> new<00:00:50.320> so<00:00:50.560> was<00:00:51.100> this

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
at the moment the stones new so was this

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.040 
at the moment the stones new so was this
common<00:00:51.520> number<00:00:51.730> is<00:00:51.850> one<00:00:52.090> worth<00:00:52.450> a<00:00:52.480> gazillion

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
common number is one worth a gazillion

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.260 
common number is one worth a gazillion

was<00:00:55.420> simply<00:00:55.720> one<00:00:55.990> book<00:00:56.320> so<00:00:57.540> the<00:00:58.540> stone<00:00:58.780> other

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
was simply one book so the stone other

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.490 
was simply one book so the stone other

you're<00:01:26.010> gonna<00:01:26.100> need<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.340> craft<00:01:26.580> some<00:01:26.790> insane

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
you're gonna need to craft some insane

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.750 
you're gonna need to craft some insane
machines<00:01:28.410> I've<00:01:28.680> got<00:01:28.800> a<00:01:28.830> possibility<00:01:29.520> hoping

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
machines I've got a possibility hoping

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.120 
machines I've got a possibility hoping
right<00:01:30.000> here<00:01:30.390> but<00:01:30.930> there<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.260> this<00:01:31.530> chest<00:01:31.920> yes

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
right here but there in this chest yes

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.070 
right here but there in this chest yes
so<00:01:32.310> we<00:01:32.490> have<00:01:32.700> three<00:01:33.030> machines<00:01:33.360> are<00:01:33.840> two

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
so we have three machines are two

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.030 
so we have three machines are two
machines<00:01:34.230> here<00:01:34.380> we've<00:01:34.590> got<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.800> atomic

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
machines here we've got the atomic

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.700 
machines here we've got the atomic
clash'<00:01:35.400> which<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.000> has<00:01:36.150> like<00:01:36.390> two<00:01:37.320> pieces<00:01:37.530> of

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
clash' which is has like two pieces of

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
the atomic flasher basically I'm gonna

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.590 
the atomic flasher basically I'm gonna
put<00:01:49.620> them<00:01:49.770> outside<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.400> the<00:01:50.880> plating<00:01:51.090> damages

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
put them outside and the plating damages

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.650 
put them outside and the plating damages

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
blocks 2 redstone and I'm pretty sure it

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.650 
blocks 2 redstone and I'm pretty sure it
is<00:01:58.590> very<00:01:58.950> high<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.160> the<00:01:59.460> bar<00:01:59.760> oh<00:02:00.060> yeah<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.450> is

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
is very high in the bar oh yeah that is

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.050 
is very high in the bar oh yeah that is

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
pieces of black plane it's just to make

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.930 
pieces of black plane it's just to make
it<00:02:13.890> look<00:02:14.130> good<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.490> doesn't<00:02:14.730> really<00:02:14.850> do

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
it look good it doesn't really do

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.400 
it look good it doesn't really do
anything<00:02:15.090> but<00:02:15.630> basically<00:02:15.870> this<00:02:16.050> is<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.350> way

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
anything but basically this is the way

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.410 
anything but basically this is the way
you're<00:02:16.530> gonna<00:02:16.620> set<00:02:16.830> it<00:02:16.920> off<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.160> bed<00:02:17.280> way<00:02:17.460> the

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
you're gonna set it off the bed way the

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.530 
you're gonna set it off the bed way the
atomic<00:02:19.310> what's<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.430> how<00:02:20.670> I<00:02:20.700> just<00:02:20.970> broke<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.240> I

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
atomic what's the how I just broke it I

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.080 
atomic what's the how I just broke it I
just<00:02:22.170> I<00:02:22.530> just<00:02:22.650> broke<00:02:23.100> my<00:02:23.340> own<00:02:23.610> atomic

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
just I just broke my own atomic

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.440 
just I just broke my own atomic
extractor<00:02:25.020> I<00:02:25.200> feel<00:02:25.440> sad<00:02:25.680> now<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:26.330> feel<00:02:27.330> really

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
extractor I feel sad now I feel really

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.770 
extractor I feel sad now I feel really
sad<00:02:27.750> now

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
sad now

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.360 
sad now
so<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:31.020> at<00:02:31.200> atomic<00:02:31.470> clash<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:32.040> put<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.310> down

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
so the at atomic clash you put it down

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.949 
so the at atomic clash you put it down
here<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.760> then<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.239> approach<00:02:33.450> or<00:02:33.600> attractor

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
here and then the approach or attractor

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.300 
here and then the approach or attractor
is<00:02:34.080> like<00:02:34.230> that<00:02:34.380> basically<00:02:34.739> put<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.040> atomic

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
is like that basically put the atomic

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.370 
is like that basically put the atomic
pack<00:02:35.430> up<00:02:35.670> look<00:02:36.120> I'll<00:02:36.480> put<00:02:36.690> my<00:02:36.750> pipes<00:02:36.930> in<00:02:37.170> middle

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
pack up look I'll put my pipes in middle

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.170 
pack up look I'll put my pipes in middle
and<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:37.770> completely<00:02:38.010> messes<00:02:38.370> up<00:02:38.489> fix<00:02:38.880> it

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
and I completely messes up fix it

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.760 
and I completely messes up fix it
look<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.660> pipes<00:02:39.870> on<00:02:40.080> even<00:02:40.320> going<00:02:40.530> into<00:02:40.650> the

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
look the pipes on even going into the

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.530 
look the pipes on even going into the
machine<00:02:41.070> oh<00:02:42.620> it<00:02:43.620> works<00:02:43.860> otherwise<00:02:44.700> so<00:02:45.270> I'm

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
machine oh it works otherwise so I'm

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.300 
machine oh it works otherwise so I'm
gonna<00:02:45.690> go<00:02:45.870> back<00:02:46.050> into<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.530> factory<00:02:46.890> for<00:02:47.070> a<00:02:47.130> few

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
gonna go back into the factory for a few

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.580 
gonna go back into the factory for a few
seconds<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.790> grab<00:02:47.940> my<00:02:48.540> materials<00:02:49.110> we<00:02:49.260> shot<00:02:49.440> in

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
seconds to grab my materials we shot in

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.960 
seconds to grab my materials we shot in
this<00:02:49.830> chest<00:02:50.100> so<00:02:50.190> basically<00:02:50.459> these<00:02:50.700> are<00:02:50.910> the

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
this chest so basically these are the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.610 
this chest so basically these are the
things<00:02:51.270> we<00:02:51.360> can<00:02:51.540> use<00:02:51.690> to<00:02:51.750> break<00:02:51.900> down<00:02:52.050> smooth

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
things we can use to break down smooth

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.449 
things we can use to break down smooth
stone<00:02:52.800> log

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459

coal iron gold lapis block well away

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.770 
coal iron gold lapis block well away
diamond<00:02:57.900> at<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.320> racks<00:02:58.470> glowstone<00:02:59.430> and

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
diamond at the racks glowstone and

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.490 
diamond at the racks glowstone and
emerald<00:03:00.780> so<00:03:00.840> basically<00:03:01.080> I<00:03:01.200> got<00:03:01.320> to<00:03:01.380> break

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
emerald so basically I got to break

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.710 
emerald so basically I got to break
these<00:03:01.709> down<00:03:01.739> with<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.610> proton<00:03:03.150> extractor

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
these down with the proton extractor

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.440 
these down with the proton extractor
which<00:03:03.870> is<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.110> iron<00:03:04.500> block<00:03:04.890> looking<00:03:05.190> one<00:03:05.450> and

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
which is the iron block looking one and

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.970 
which is the iron block looking one and
basically<00:03:06.840> you<00:03:06.989> just<00:03:07.019> tap<00:03:07.410> on<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:07.709> it's<00:03:07.890> a

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
basically you just tap on it and it's a

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.850 
basically you just tap on it and it's a
freshman<00:03:08.340> graph<00:03:08.489> it<00:03:08.610> as<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.120> can<00:03:09.239> see<00:03:09.390> the

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
freshman graph it as you can see the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.810 
freshman graph it as you can see the
solution<00:03:10.860> will<00:03:10.950> give<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.160> one<00:03:11.400> proton

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
solution will give you one proton

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.850 
solution will give you one proton

is<00:03:27.720> goes<00:03:28.110> like<00:03:28.290> this<00:03:28.440> so<00:03:28.500> nether<00:03:28.950> Apple<00:03:29.310> TV<00:03:29.489> 8

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 
is goes like this so nether Apple TV 8

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.319 
is goes like this so nether Apple TV 8
first<00:03:31.170> on<00:03:31.290> 59<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:31.920> Amaral<00:03:32.400> a<00:03:32.519> single<00:03:32.969> emerald

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.300 
first on 59 and Amaral a single emerald
hippies<00:03:33.659> and<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.500> basically<00:03:34.709> need<00:03:34.950> to<00:03:34.980> do<00:03:35.099> now

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
hippies and the basically need to do now

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.979 
hippies and the basically need to do now
is<00:03:35.519> after<00:03:35.969> you<00:03:36.030> get<00:03:36.090> some<00:03:36.269> photons<00:03:36.659> only

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
is after you get some photons only

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.289 
is after you get some photons only
Deccan<00:03:37.200> Traps<00:03:37.230> um<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:38.189> another<00:03:38.730> item<00:03:38.939> that<00:03:39.120> is

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
Deccan Traps um and another item that is

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.330 
Deccan Traps um and another item that is
very<00:03:39.599> important<00:03:40.260> in<00:03:40.439> which<00:03:40.739> is<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.069> synthetic

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
very important in which is the synthetic

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.360 
very important in which is the synthetic
nucleus<00:03:42.209> so<00:03:42.810> trafficking<00:03:43.409> synthetic<00:03:43.590> nucleus

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
nucleus so trafficking synthetic nucleus

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.500 
nucleus so trafficking synthetic nucleus
you're<00:03:44.489> gonna<00:03:44.640> need<00:03:44.730> one<00:03:45.000> piece<00:03:45.180> of<00:03:45.390> glass

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
you're gonna need one piece of glass

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.970 
you're gonna need one piece of glass
paint<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:45.930> for<00:03:46.140> leather<00:03:46.439> so<00:03:46.739> it's<00:03:46.859> pretty

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
paint and for leather so it's pretty

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.069 
paint and for leather so it's pretty
simple<00:03:47.189> to<00:03:47.400> craft<00:03:47.579> and<00:03:47.939> popular<00:03:48.750> craft<00:03:48.870> table

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
simple to craft and popular craft table

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.809 
simple to craft and popular craft table
and<00:03:49.349> simply<00:03:49.590> you'll<00:03:49.709> get<00:03:49.890> three<00:03:50.250> synthetic

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
and simply you'll get three synthetic

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.390 
and simply you'll get three synthetic
nucleus<00:03:51.329> so<00:03:51.569> I'm<00:03:52.290> going<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.680> these<00:03:53.040> going<00:03:53.250> to

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
nucleus so I'm going to these going to

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.520 
nucleus so I'm going to these going to
take<00:03:53.670> quite<00:03:54.180> a<00:03:54.239> few<00:03:54.390> more<00:03:55.079> if<00:03:55.230> you<00:03:55.319> don't<00:03:55.409> mind

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
take quite a few more if you don't mind

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.229 
take quite a few more if you don't mind
there<00:03:55.920> we<00:03:56.010> go<00:03:56.099> there's<00:03:56.340> all<00:03:56.609> the<00:03:56.790> society

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
there we go there's all the society

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.910 
there we go there's all the society
clears<00:03:57.450> in<00:03:57.599> here<00:03:57.720> about<00:03:58.379> twenty<00:03:58.709> three<00:03:58.859> of

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
clears in here about twenty three of

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.309 
clears in here about twenty three of
them<00:03:59.040> basically<00:03:59.220> do<00:03:59.579> is<00:03:59.849> you<00:04:00.329> simply<00:04:00.540> go<00:04:00.870> up<00:04:01.109> to

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
them basically do is you simply go up to

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.080 
them basically do is you simply go up to
the<00:04:01.439> atomic<00:04:01.650> class<00:04:01.889> show<00:04:02.040> you<00:04:02.099> tap<00:04:02.370> on<00:04:02.579> them

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
the atomic class show you tap on them

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.819 
the atomic class show you tap on them
with<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.359> protons<00:04:03.750> as<00:04:03.900> many<00:04:04.379> times<00:04:04.560> you<00:04:04.680> want

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
with the protons as many times you want

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.199 
with the protons as many times you want
to<00:04:04.859> see<00:04:04.950> of<00:04:05.159> course<00:04:05.489> the<00:04:05.579> atomic<00:04:05.909> number<00:04:06.180> is

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
to see of course the atomic number is

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.729 
to see of course the atomic number is
how<00:04:06.840> many<00:04:06.989> times<00:04:07.139> you<00:04:07.230> want<00:04:07.319> so<00:04:07.439> say<00:04:07.590> if<00:04:07.680> you

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
how many times you want so say if you

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.559 
how many times you want so say if you
want<00:04:07.889> a<00:04:07.950> smoothing<00:04:08.250> it<00:04:08.909> will<00:04:09.060> say<00:04:09.180> proton

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
want a smoothing it will say proton

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.390 
want a smoothing it will say proton
count<00:04:09.750> one<00:04:09.900> and<00:04:10.109> you<00:04:10.200> just<00:04:10.379> tap<00:04:10.560> on<00:04:10.799> it<00:04:11.040> with<00:04:11.250> a

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
count one and you just tap on it with a

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.490 
count one and you just tap on it with a
it's<00:04:11.669> a<00:04:11.879> synthetic<00:04:12.510> nuclear<00:04:13.019> and<00:04:13.200> oh<00:04:13.230> create<00:04:13.439> a

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
it's a synthetic nuclear and oh create a

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.939 
it's a synthetic nuclear and oh create a
smooth<00:04:13.709> stone<00:04:13.829> and<00:04:14.250> then<00:04:14.370> two<00:04:14.579> is<00:04:14.790> log<00:04:15.949> three

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
smooth stone and then two is log three

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.849 
smooth stone and then two is log three
is<00:04:17.190> cold<00:04:17.789> as<00:04:18.690> you<00:04:18.840> see<00:04:18.989> or<00:04:19.139> drop<00:04:19.320> a<00:04:19.349> call<00:04:19.650> and

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
is cold as you see or drop a call and

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:25.010 
is cold as you see or drop a call and
then<00:04:20.400> four<00:04:20.759> is<00:04:22.250> iron<00:04:23.300> five<00:04:24.300> is<00:04:24.509> easy<00:04:24.720> you<00:04:24.870> can

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
then four is iron five is easy you can

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.939 
then four is iron five is easy you can
count<00:04:25.229> it<00:04:25.349> down<00:04:25.500> to<00:04:25.650> five<00:04:25.800> five<00:04:26.400> will<00:04:26.639> be<00:04:26.759> gold

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:27.949 
count it down to five five will be gold

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:33.980 
count it down to five five will be gold
6<00:04:28.949> will<00:04:29.099> be<00:04:29.190> lapis<00:04:29.580> block<00:04:31.039> seven<00:04:32.039> would<00:04:32.370> be

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
6 will be lapis block seven would be

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.740 
6 will be lapis block seven would be
the<00:04:34.110> diamond<00:04:34.920> and<00:04:35.160> it<00:04:36.000> will<00:04:36.210> be<00:04:36.330> another<00:04:36.540> rack

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
the diamond and it will be another rack

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.970 
the diamond and it will be another rack
and<00:04:37.290> then<00:04:38.220> nine<00:04:38.610> if<00:04:39.240> I<00:04:39.360> can<00:04:39.480> get<00:04:39.600> up<00:04:39.780> nine<00:04:40.080> would

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
and then nine if I can get up nine would

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.000 
and then nine if I can get up nine would
be<00:04:41.250> the<00:04:41.850> one<00:04:42.660> the<00:04:42.900> only<00:04:42.930> closer<00:04:43.410> and<00:04:43.740> I'm<00:04:43.920> gonna

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
be the one the only closer and I'm gonna

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.470 
be the one the only closer and I'm gonna
have<00:04:44.190> to<00:04:44.280> break<00:04:44.490> down<00:04:44.520> this<00:04:44.910> once<00:04:45.270> more

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
have to break down this once more

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.060 
have to break down this once more
talking<00:04:45.810> to<00:04:45.900> change<00:04:46.140> in<00:04:46.230> them<00:04:46.410> as<00:04:46.800> you<00:04:46.890> can<00:04:46.980> see

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
talking to change in them as you can see

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.470 
talking to change in them as you can see
features<00:04:47.370> kind<00:04:47.550> of<00:04:47.640> switch<00:04:47.910> be<00:04:48.060> putting<00:04:48.390> over

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
features kind of switch be putting over

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.120 
features kind of switch be putting over
them<00:04:48.720> and<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.110> maxpro<00:04:49.560> train<00:04:49.740> you<00:04:49.800> can<00:04:49.830> get<00:04:50.010> to

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
them and the maxpro train you can get to

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.310 
them and the maxpro train you can get to
is<00:04:50.250> 10<00:04:50.520> and<00:04:50.700> then<00:04:50.760> it<00:04:50.820> won't<00:04:51.060> type<00:04:51.330> anymore<00:04:51.570> so

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
is 10 and then it won't type anymore so

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.810 
is 10 and then it won't type anymore so
that<00:04:52.470> is<00:04:52.650> the<00:04:52.800> emerald<00:04:53.190> as<00:04:53.310> you<00:04:53.370> can<00:04:53.490> see<00:04:53.640> that

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
that is the emerald as you can see that

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.850 
that is the emerald as you can see that
is<00:04:53.940> making<00:04:54.240> it<00:04:54.450> like<00:04:54.990> this<00:04:55.260> how<00:04:55.440> you<00:04:55.500> want<00:04:55.800> to

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
is making it like this how you want to

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.650 
is making it like this how you want to
replace<00:04:56.070> it<00:04:56.220> breakdown<00:04:56.670> materials<00:04:57.120> and<00:04:57.540> you

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
replace it breakdown materials and you

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:58.970 
replace it breakdown materials and you
can<00:04:57.780> create<00:04:57.930> a<00:04:57.990> MIDI<00:04:58.200> materials<00:04:58.620> or<00:04:58.800> we<00:04:58.860> can

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
can create a MIDI materials or we can

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.380 
can create a MIDI materials or we can
break<00:04:59.100> down<00:04:59.130> image<00:04:59.490> or<00:04:59.610> make<00:04:59.910> it<00:05:00.000> into<00:05:00.030> all<00:05:00.240> the

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
break down image or make it into all the
