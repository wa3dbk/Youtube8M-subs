00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
of left or right side of the screen so

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.820 
of left or right side of the screen so
just<00:00:15.269> keep<00:00:15.630> following<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.260> going<00:00:16.529> into<00:00:16.650> the

side that the enemies come from

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.480 
side that the enemies come from
so<00:00:19.050> they<00:00:19.199> spawn<00:00:19.500> from<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.830> right<00:00:19.980> side<00:00:20.220> go<00:00:20.430> to

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
so they spawn from the right side go to

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.920 
so they spawn from the right side go to
the<00:00:20.670> right<00:00:20.850> if<00:00:21.090> it's<00:00:21.330> fall<00:00:21.480> from<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.720> left

the right if it's fall from the left

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.029 
the right if it's fall from the left
side<00:00:22.109> go<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.590> left

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
side go to the left

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.950

get through it with the only minimal

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.250 
get through it with the only minimal
damage<00:00:41.149> the<00:00:42.149> hardest<00:00:42.450> part<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.750> maneuvering

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
damage the hardest part is maneuvering

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.360 

the<00:00:57.170> other<00:00:57.290> problem<00:00:57.740> of<00:00:57.800> course<00:00:58.040> is<00:00:58.070> that<00:00:58.280> you

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
the other problem of course is that you

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.830 
the other problem of course is that you
do<00:00:58.520> have<00:00:58.550> a<00:00:58.700> time<00:00:59.000> limit<00:00:59.180> but<00:00:59.420> it's<00:00:59.570> enough

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
do have a time limit but it's enough

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.270 
do have a time limit but it's enough
time<00:01:00.080> that<00:01:00.290> you<00:01:00.350> should<00:01:00.380> be<00:01:00.650> able<00:01:00.740> to<00:01:00.890> find<00:01:01.130> the

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
time that you should be able to find the

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:09.160 
time that you should be able to find the
exit<00:01:01.700> before<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:02.180> time<00:01:02.390> expires

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.109 

once<00:01:09.799> you<00:01:09.920> reach<00:01:10.130> the<00:01:10.340> end<00:01:10.430> it's<00:01:10.670> time<00:01:10.820> for<00:01:11.030> the

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
once you reach the end it's time for the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.109 
left to right to avoid the fire from him
and<00:01:15.290> then<00:01:15.680> keep<00:01:15.950> launching<00:01:16.340> bombs<00:01:16.580> into<00:01:16.970> its

and then keep launching bombs into its
bunker<00:01:17.540> it<00:01:18.110> doesn't<00:01:18.439> take<00:01:18.560> too<00:01:18.770> many<00:01:18.890> shots

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
bunker it doesn't take too many shots

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.830 
bunker it doesn't take too many shots
and<00:01:19.549> he'll<00:01:19.670> die<00:01:19.850> and<00:01:20.090> you'll<00:01:20.210> get<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:20.450> ending

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.719 

once<00:02:06.050> the<00:02:06.229> helicopter<00:02:06.380> takes<00:02:06.950> off<00:02:07.190> taking<00:02:07.640> you

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
once the helicopter takes off taking you

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.790 
once the helicopter takes off taking you
away<00:02:07.820> from<00:02:08.000> Vietnam<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:09.050> credits<00:02:09.470> start<00:02:09.530> to

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
away from Vietnam the credits start to

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.839 
away from Vietnam the credits start to
roll<00:02:10.009> and<00:02:10.250> you've<00:02:10.399> completed<00:02:10.819> platoon

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.789 

and<00:02:14.390> while<00:02:14.599> this<00:02:14.749> team<00:02:14.930> is<00:02:15.049> relatively<00:02:15.469> short

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:15.799 
and while this team is relatively short

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:17.949 
and while this team is relatively short
mainly<00:02:16.609> based<00:02:16.819> on<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.239> fact<00:02:17.480> that<00:02:17.599> once<00:02:17.870> you

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
mainly based on the fact that once you

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.839 
mainly based on the fact that once you
know<00:02:18.109> where<00:02:18.260> to<00:02:18.379> go<00:02:18.590> it<00:02:18.859> becomes<00:02:19.249> very<00:02:19.519> short

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
know where to go it becomes very short

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.640 
know where to go it becomes very short
but<00:02:20.090> if<00:02:20.599> you<00:02:20.749> don't<00:02:20.930> have<00:02:21.019> a<00:02:21.079> guide<00:02:21.319> that<00:02:21.469> use

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
but if you don't have a guide that use

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.170 
but if you don't have a guide that use
it'll<00:02:21.920> take<00:02:22.099> you<00:02:22.189> a<00:02:22.219> long<00:02:22.459> time<00:02:22.730> just<00:02:22.939> to<00:02:23.030> get

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
it'll take you a long time just to get

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.250 
it'll take you a long time just to get
past<00:02:23.359> that<00:02:23.540> first<00:02:23.599> level
