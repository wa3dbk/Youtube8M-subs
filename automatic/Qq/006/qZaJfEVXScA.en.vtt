00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
it says converts harmony to new MIDI

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.360 
it says converts harmony to new MIDI
track<00:01:08.140> you<00:01:08.530> want<00:01:08.680> to<00:01:08.740> use<00:01:08.830> the<00:01:08.980> harmony

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
track you want to use the harmony

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.020 
track you want to use the harmony
there's<00:01:09.580> also

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.000 

convert<00:01:13.030> melody<00:01:13.600> will<00:01:14.260> be<00:01:14.290> like<00:01:14.680> fork<00:01:14.920> a

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
convert melody will be like fork a

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.830 
convert melody will be like fork a
single<00:01:15.370> you<00:01:15.850> know<00:01:15.880> note<00:01:16.590> phrase<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:19.240> drums<00:01:19.660> as

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
single you know note phrase in drums as

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.600 
single you know note phrase in drums as
well<00:01:20.020> and<00:01:20.350> sliced<00:01:20.680> a<00:01:20.920> new<00:01:21.070> MIDI<00:01:21.280> track<00:01:21.580> as<00:01:21.730> well

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
well and sliced a new MIDI track as well

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.770 
well and sliced a new MIDI track as well
but<00:01:24.610> for<00:01:24.880> this<00:01:25.000> I<00:01:25.560> converted<00:01:26.560> to<00:01:26.950> harmony<00:01:27.780> it

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
but for this I converted to harmony it

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.170 
but for this I converted to harmony it
takes<00:01:28.990> a<00:01:29.080> little<00:01:29.200> while<00:01:30.130> to<00:01:30.250> process<00:01:30.430> but<00:01:30.730> I

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
takes a little while to process but I

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.940 
takes a little while to process but I
did<00:01:31.420> already<00:01:31.570> that<00:01:31.900> so<00:01:32.170> and<00:01:32.350> here's<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:32.740> MIDI

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
did already that so and here's the MIDI

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.670 
did already that so and here's the MIDI
file<00:01:33.190> now<00:01:33.460> and<00:01:33.760> I<00:01:34.750> also<00:01:34.960> i<00:01:35.170> should<00:01:35.500> note<00:01:35.650> that

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
file now and I also i should note that

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.830 
file now and I also i should note that
Ableton<00:01:36.370> will<00:01:36.700> detect<00:01:37.000> that<00:01:37.150> it's<00:01:37.300> piano<00:01:37.600> and

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
Ableton will detect that it's piano and

00:01:37.840 --> 00:02:16.699 
Ableton will detect that it's piano and
I'll<00:01:37.930> put<00:01:38.260> it<00:01:38.350> on<00:01:38.380> a<00:01:38.440> piano<00:01:38.710> sound

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.270 

alright<00:02:17.709> so<00:02:18.010> as<00:02:18.459> you<00:02:18.609> can<00:02:18.700> see<00:02:18.909> there<00:02:19.120> it's<00:02:19.599> uh

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.740 

it<00:02:23.000> does<00:02:23.300> um<00:02:24.130> kind<00:02:25.130> of<00:02:25.160> a<00:02:25.250> mixed<00:02:25.640> if<00:02:26.270> you<00:02:26.569> will

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
it does um kind of a mixed if you will

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.420 
it does um kind of a mixed if you will
kind<00:02:27.050> of<00:02:27.170> job<00:02:27.410> I<00:02:27.440> mean<00:02:27.709> it<00:02:27.770> gets<00:02:27.920> most<00:02:28.130> of<00:02:28.280> it

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
kind of job I mean it gets most of it

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.400 
kind of job I mean it gets most of it
but<00:02:28.610> then<00:02:28.730> someone<00:02:29.569> look<00:02:29.750> those<00:02:29.900> triplets<00:02:30.200> and

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
but then someone look those triplets and

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.760 
but then someone look those triplets and
stuff<00:02:30.709> there<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:31.250> doesn't<00:02:31.430> really<00:02:32.410> seem<00:02:33.410> to<00:02:33.590> do

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
stuff there it doesn't really seem to do

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.970 
stuff there it doesn't really seem to do
and<00:02:34.420> some<00:02:35.420> of<00:02:35.450> those<00:02:35.540> notes<00:02:35.750> are<00:02:35.930> high<00:02:36.080> I<00:02:36.410> don't

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
and some of those notes are high I don't

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.080 
and some of those notes are high I don't
know<00:02:37.040> if<00:02:37.100> it<00:02:37.160> just<00:02:37.280> goes<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.520> piano<00:02:37.850> sound

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
know if it just goes the piano sound

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.610 
know if it just goes the piano sound
maybe<00:02:38.330> that<00:02:38.720> it's<00:02:38.870> playing<00:02:39.500> here<00:02:41.020> and<00:02:42.020> here's

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
maybe that it's playing here and here's

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:57.880 
maybe that it's playing here and here's
both<00:02:42.830> together<00:02:43.040> just<00:02:43.520> give<00:02:43.790> a

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.940 

so<00:02:58.890> let's<00:02:59.310> just<00:02:59.400> actually<00:02:59.760> it's<00:03:00.060> just<00:03:00.240> play

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
so let's just actually it's just play

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:15.900 
so let's just actually it's just play
this<00:03:01.950> original<00:03:02.880> one<00:03:03.000> again<00:03:06.560> MIDI<00:03:07.560> one

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.800 

yeah<00:03:16.910> so<00:03:17.090> it<00:03:17.150> sounds<00:03:17.330> like<00:03:17.360> it's<00:03:17.510> like<00:03:17.600> maybe

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
yeah so it sounds like it's like maybe

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.530 
yeah so it sounds like it's like maybe
an<00:03:17.960> octave<00:03:18.290> higher<00:03:18.320> too<00:03:22.030> of<00:03:23.030> course<00:03:23.270> you<00:03:23.390> can

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
an octave higher too of course you can

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.480 
an octave higher too of course you can
just<00:03:23.690> go<00:03:23.810> in<00:03:23.840> here<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:24.230> you<00:03:24.440> know<00:03:24.560> edit<00:03:25.310> or

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
just go in here and you know edit or

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.620 
just go in here and you know edit or
whatever<00:03:25.760> move<00:03:26.600> it<00:03:26.690> down<00:03:26.810> an<00:03:27.020> octave<00:03:27.580> but<00:03:28.580> uh

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
whatever move it down an octave but uh

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.180 
whatever move it down an octave but uh
so<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:29.750> features<00:03:30.080> is<00:03:30.410> you<00:03:30.650> know<00:03:30.800> it's<00:03:30.920> kind<00:03:31.100> of

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
so the features is you know it's kind of

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.580 
so the features is you know it's kind of
it's<00:03:31.720> no<00:03:32.720> i<00:03:32.810> don't<00:03:33.020> know<00:03:33.080> i<00:03:33.110> don't<00:03:33.200> have<00:03:33.410> to<00:03:33.500> be

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
it's no i don't know i don't have to be

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.480 
it's no i don't know i don't have to be
able<00:03:33.740> to<00:03:33.830> you<00:03:33.980> know<00:03:34.100> exactly<00:03:35.860> you<00:03:36.860> know<00:03:36.980> record

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
able to you know exactly you know record

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.940 
able to you know exactly you know record
a<00:03:37.610> whole<00:03:37.760> band<00:03:38.000> and<00:03:38.390> expect<00:03:38.810> to<00:03:38.870> transfer<00:03:39.860> it

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
a whole band and expect to transfer it

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.450 
a whole band and expect to transfer it
into<00:03:40.040> MIDI<00:03:40.310> it's<00:03:40.640> going<00:03:40.760> to<00:03:40.820> be<00:03:40.910> perfect<00:03:42.460> but

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:43.460 
into MIDI it's going to be perfect but

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.550 
into MIDI it's going to be perfect but
you<00:03:43.640> can<00:03:43.820> really<00:03:44.090> do<00:03:44.270> some<00:03:44.510> creative<00:03:45.110> things

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
you can really do some creative things

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.470 
you can really do some creative things
you<00:03:45.920> know<00:03:46.040> you<00:03:46.100> can<00:03:46.310> change<00:03:46.340> that<00:03:46.700> different

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
you know you can change that different

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.890 
you know you can change that different
instrument<00:03:47.900> or<00:03:47.960> something<00:03:48.350> if<00:03:48.620> you<00:03:48.770> want<00:03:49.900> but

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
instrument or something if you want but

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.960 
instrument or something if you want but
check<00:03:51.770> out<00:03:51.860> the<00:03:51.980> other<00:03:52.070> conversion<00:03:52.640> tests

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
check out the other conversion tests

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.340 
check out the other conversion tests
I've<00:03:53.120> done<00:03:53.330> in<00:03:53.900> the<00:03:54.050> links<00:03:54.350> in<00:03:54.580> the<00:03:55.580> video<00:03:56.350> so

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
I've done in the links in the video so
