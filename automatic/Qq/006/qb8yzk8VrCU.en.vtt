00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 school 22 at the end but still the 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.629
 compensation compensated in the 94th 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.900
 minute how much does that sound like 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.160
 defenseman yes of course lived 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.410
 Clearly just after the good first 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.700
 half the time we played too 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.809
 then earns 2 0 in leadership 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.250
 we went in the second 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.189
 half-time then not so well done 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.939
 The Spaniards had their own 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.170
 your chance you are half-time he 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.519
 have imposed themselves all this 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.439
 throw something in front that something here 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.269
 then you have to try in the act 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.859
 had implemented some 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.329
 possibilities of the very last second 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.520
 to get to the goal 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.239
 of course very annoying though 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.530
 Ultimately , we have achieved our goal 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.440
 which is why we are here 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.800
 to make the groups first and 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.539
 We did that and therefore we are 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.039
 we are completely satisfied and only good 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.120
 business card for german football 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.670
 Leave a total in the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.899
 europe league group phase so far or 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.000
 yes we are of course happy that we 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.530
 Our successes last year 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.570
 European stage had this year 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.399
 could even confirm with even more 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.100
 with the group-first topic now 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.629
 It was important for us to do that 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.700
 we have a good starting position for 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.500
 for the draw if thats me too 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.689
 meet very strong teams 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.030
 although ultimately all are themselves 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.159
 are qualified are already enormous 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.640
 strong and there we have to be hellish 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.259
 watch out 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.729
 maybe you have a dreamless for 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.229
 always asking everyone and they say we 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.270
 want nice getaway for the fans though 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.650
 maybe a club where you ever 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.060
 I really wanted to play 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.500
 I would like to choose which one for me 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.930
 I would like to be in English 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.070
 get English club because there is 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.710
 always the atmosphere again completely 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.549
 especially explosive and better in it that 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.920
 that would be a nice go 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.869
 but now again first bundesliga 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.000
 again two very important players in the 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.860
 ligabetrieb against leverkusen 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.380
 We have to put that on the field 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.119
 there has to be something to bring the leverkusen 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.920
 recent talks showed that straight 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.960
 in good shape have that tremendously strong 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.759
 are a hard chunk 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.530
 very clearly because just the last 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.909
 home game at home this year 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.110
 we offer fans a bit of that 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.490
 also a nice further better 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.020
 Of course we are relative now 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.130
 pleasant temperatures towards evening 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.990
 It gets a bit cooler but in 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.850
 Hanover when we look around there 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.950
 is probably relatively white how much 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.740
 this fall in temperature will make us too 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.900
 create 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.820
 I do not think that's great 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.540
 now only two were created 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.610
 days here 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.100
 therefore, the body they have not yet 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.540
 so used to it but i just hope that 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.900
 The plane can land in tonight 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.340
 Hanover 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.850
 that would be nice let's wait 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.850
 Thank you very much 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.890
