so<00:00:01.020> we're<00:00:01.140> looking<00:00:01.230> at<00:00:01.410> a<00:00:01.469> typical

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
so we're looking at a typical

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.949 
so we're looking at a typical
eavestrough<00:00:02.520> that<00:00:03.270> we're<00:00:03.689> actually

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
eavestrough that we're actually

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.410 
eavestrough that we're actually
stripping<00:00:04.740> off<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:04.890> heads<00:00:05.160> today<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:06.089> reason

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
stripping off the heads today the reason

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.270 
stripping off the heads today the reason
why<00:00:06.569> we're<00:00:06.839> stripping<00:00:07.259> is<00:00:07.379> because<00:00:07.770> it's<00:00:08.160> a

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
why we're stripping is because it's a

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.370 
why we're stripping is because it's a
that's<00:00:08.970> probably<00:00:09.300> but<00:00:09.450> almost<00:00:09.690> 30<00:00:09.960> years<00:00:10.050> old

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
that's probably but almost 30 years old

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.730 
that's probably but almost 30 years old
as<00:00:11.000> the<00:00:12.000> fasteners<00:00:12.690> if<00:00:12.900> we<00:00:13.019> take<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.230> look<00:00:13.410> at<00:00:13.590> it

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
as the fasteners if we take a look at it

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.599 
as the fasteners if we take a look at it
here<00:00:14.040> you<00:00:14.940> can<00:00:15.210> see<00:00:15.630> in<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.230> eavestrough<00:00:16.680> that

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
here you can see in the eavestrough that

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.060 
here you can see in the eavestrough that
the<00:00:18.420> fasteners<00:00:18.930> are<00:00:18.960> pretty<00:00:19.260> much<00:00:19.439> about<00:00:19.680> 30

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
the fasteners are pretty much about 30

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.519 
the fasteners are pretty much about 30
inches<00:00:20.400> apart<00:00:20.789> that's<00:00:21.779> pretty<00:00:22.080> much<00:00:22.230> typical

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
inches apart that's pretty much typical

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.439 
inches apart that's pretty much typical
sometimes<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:23.279> find<00:00:23.460> them<00:00:23.609> 30<00:00:23.850> inches<00:00:24.119> apart

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
sometimes we find them 30 inches apart

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.830 
sometimes we find them 30 inches apart
even<00:00:25.350> sometimes<00:00:25.710> 4<00:00:26.010> feet<00:00:26.279> apart<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:26.880> the

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
even sometimes 4 feet apart so the

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.050 
even sometimes 4 feet apart so the
further<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.380> these<00:00:28.619> brackets<00:00:29.279> are<00:00:29.580> apart

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
further that these brackets are apart

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.380 
further that these brackets are apart
the<00:00:30.750> weaker<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.170> east<00:00:31.349> rock<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.800> going<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.040> be

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
the weaker the east rock is going to be

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.569 
the weaker the east rock is going to be
sometimes<00:00:33.410> it<00:00:34.410> can<00:00:34.590> be<00:00:34.620> more<00:00:34.739> critical<00:00:35.550> to

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
sometimes it can be more critical to

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.020 
sometimes it can be more critical to
have<00:00:36.170> extra<00:00:37.170> fasteners<00:00:37.739> in<00:00:38.010> your<00:00:38.579> eavestrough

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
have extra fasteners in your eavestrough

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.150 
have extra fasteners in your eavestrough
than<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.870> upgrade<00:00:40.200> your<00:00:40.680> knees<00:00:40.829> trough

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
than it is to upgrade your knees trough

than it is to upgrade your knees trough
to<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.430> head<00:00:41.550> engage<00:00:41.899> because<00:00:42.899> really<00:00:43.350> this

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
to the head engage because really this

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.500 
to the head engage because really this
is<00:00:43.739> what<00:00:43.950> gives<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.340> support<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.270> front

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
is what gives the support on the front

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.540 
is what gives the support on the front
of<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.660> East<00:00:45.840> Rock<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.559> brackets<00:00:47.090> so<00:00:49.550> what

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
of the East Rock is the brackets so what

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.950 
of the East Rock is the brackets so what
happens<00:00:50.910> if<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.180> brackets<00:00:51.360> are<00:00:51.629> too<00:00:51.750> far

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
happens if the brackets are too far

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.139 
happens if the brackets are too far
apart<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.860> weight<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.280> ice<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.610> snow<00:00:53.789> can

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
apart the weight of the ice and snow can

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.420 
apart the weight of the ice and snow can
pull<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.570> front<00:00:55.410> edge<00:00:55.559> down<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.190> they<00:00:56.309> get

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
pull this front edge down so they get

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.060 
pull this front edge down so they get
all<00:00:56.489> warped<00:00:56.969> out<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.289> out<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.350> place<00:00:58.649> when<00:00:59.010> you

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
all warped out of out of place when you

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.130 
all warped out of out of place when you
get<00:00:59.219> an<00:00:59.340> ice<00:00:59.640> buildup<00:01:00.120> or<00:01:00.359> snow<00:01:00.600> slide<00:01:00.930> of

get an ice buildup or snow slide of

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.389 
get an ice buildup or snow slide of
something<00:01:01.440> like<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.770> they<00:01:01.980> quite<00:01:02.190> easily

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
something like that they quite easily

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.329 
something like that they quite easily
Bend<00:01:02.850> out<00:01:03.110> so<00:01:04.110> with<00:01:04.650> very<00:01:04.680> little<00:01:04.920> pressure

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
Bend out so with very little pressure

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.149 
Bend out so with very little pressure
you<00:01:05.580> can<00:01:05.760> have<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.540> problem<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:08.040> other

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
you can have that problem the other

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.039 
you can have that problem the other
problem<00:01:08.610> with<00:01:08.729> brackets<00:01:09.210> being<00:01:09.510> too<00:01:09.840> far

problem with brackets being too far

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.250 
problem with brackets being too far
apart<00:01:10.700> is<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:12.090> when<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.420> set<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> ladder<00:01:12.930> up

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
apart is that when you set a ladder up

apart is that when you set a ladder up
the<00:01:14.040> eavestrough<00:01:14.820> wants<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.299> cave<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:16.909> so

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
the eavestrough wants to cave in so

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.300 
the eavestrough wants to cave in so
since<00:01:18.540> we're<00:01:18.780> stripping<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.560> C<00:01:19.740> strap<00:01:20.070> off

little<00:01:25.049> gutters<00:01:25.290> are<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:27.290> we're<00:01:28.290> not<00:01:28.380> very

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
little gutters are so we're not very

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.050 
little gutters are so we're not very
high<00:01:28.979> we're<00:01:29.280> just<00:01:29.430> on<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.610> side<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
high we're just on the side of the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.240 
high we're just on the side of the
garage<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:31.350> I'll<00:01:31.470> do<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:31.740> give<00:01:32.070> their

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
garage so I'll do is just give their

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.850 
garage so I'll do is just give their
ladder<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.610> little<00:01:32.759> bit<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.060> pressure

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.180 

right<00:01:39.520> but<00:01:39.730> I've<00:01:39.820> got<00:01:39.940> a<00:01:39.970> shape<00:01:40.270> there<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:44.190> much

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
right but I've got a shape there so much

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.510 
right but I've got a shape there so much
weight<00:01:46.620> going<00:01:47.620> up<00:01:47.740> and<00:01:47.920> down<00:01:48.010> with<00:01:48.280> a<00:01:48.310> big

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
weight going up and down with a big

weight going up and down with a big
ladder<00:01:48.760> on<00:01:49.000> the<00:01:49.090> side<00:01:49.330> of<00:01:49.450> your<00:01:49.510> home<00:01:50.220> to

ladder on the side of your home to
create<00:01:51.520> that<00:01:51.700> ugly<00:01:52.060> mess<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:55.890> what<00:01:56.890> we're

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
create that ugly mess so what we're

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.440 
create that ugly mess so what we're
gonna<00:01:57.070> say<00:01:57.610> we're<00:01:57.940> gonna<00:01:58.030> show<00:01:58.300> you<00:01:58.360> a

gonna say we're gonna show you a

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.350 
gonna say we're gonna show you a
solution<00:01:59.730> there's<00:02:00.730> a<00:02:00.760> couple<00:02:00.940> of<00:02:01.090> different

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.389 
leaves troughs we will do the t-rex
fastening<00:02:06.130> system<00:02:06.820> which<00:02:07.030> gives<00:02:08.369> like<00:02:09.369> a

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
fastening system which gives like a

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.000 
fastening system which gives like a
solid<00:02:09.910> continuous<00:02:10.390> bracket<00:02:11.260> on<00:02:11.380> top<00:02:11.590> so<00:02:11.890> it's

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
solid continuous bracket on top so it's

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.890 
solid continuous bracket on top so it's
not<00:02:12.100> going<00:02:12.250> to<00:02:12.340> be<00:02:12.430> any<00:02:12.550> weak<00:02:12.790> points<00:02:13.210> if

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
not going to be any weak points if

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.360 
not going to be any weak points if
you're<00:02:14.140> not<00:02:14.230> going<00:02:14.380> to<00:02:14.440> do<00:02:14.590> like<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.040> t-rex

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
you're not going to do like the t-rex

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.120 
you're not going to do like the t-rex
system<00:02:15.820> then<00:02:16.540> you<00:02:16.750> can<00:02:16.900> also<00:02:17.050> put<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.680> spacers

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
system then you can also put the spacers

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.360 
system then you can also put the spacers
in<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.310> lot<00:02:18.550> closer<00:02:18.820> if<00:02:19.330> these<00:02:19.540> brackets<00:02:20.370> were

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
in a lot closer if these brackets were

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.180 
in a lot closer if these brackets were
twice<00:02:21.730> as<00:02:21.790> close<00:02:22.180> you<00:02:22.959> would<00:02:23.110> feel<00:02:23.860> like<00:02:24.010> it's

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
twice as close you would feel like it's

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.350 
twice as close you would feel like it's
twice<00:02:24.310> as<00:02:24.430> strong<00:02:24.760> because<00:02:25.180> you're<00:02:25.270> gonna

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
twice as strong because you're gonna

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.360 
twice as strong because you're gonna
have<00:02:25.510> that<00:02:25.630> much<00:02:25.780> more<00:02:26.020> support<00:02:26.470> so<00:02:27.070> the<00:02:27.220> key

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
have that much more support so the key

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.010 
have that much more support so the key
thing<00:02:27.610> is<00:02:27.640> if<00:02:27.940> you're<00:02:28.060> not<00:02:28.209> using<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.660> t-rex

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
thing is if you're not using the t-rex

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.710 
thing is if you're not using the t-rex
like<00:02:29.290> we're<00:02:29.440> going<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.650> do<00:02:29.770> today<00:02:29.950> is<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.240> make

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
like we're going to do today is to make

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.090 
like we're going to do today is to make
sure<00:02:31.930> that<00:02:32.050> these<00:02:32.200> brackets<00:02:32.500> are<00:02:32.770> nice<00:02:32.920> and

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
sure that these brackets are nice and

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.290 
sure that these brackets are nice and
close<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:33.520> that'll<00:02:33.700> give<00:02:33.820> you<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.090> strength

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
close and that'll give you the strength

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.810 
close and that'll give you the strength
that<00:02:34.540> you<00:02:34.600> need<00:02:34.720> as<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.530> can<00:02:35.709> see<00:02:35.920> that<00:02:36.670> this

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
that you need as you can see that this

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.530 
that you need as you can see that this
whole<00:02:37.000> leaves<00:02:37.300> trough<00:02:37.570> here<00:02:37.930> is<00:02:38.610> toast

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.729 

that's<00:02:43.540> pretty<00:02:43.750> bad<00:02:43.959> shape<00:02:44.260> there<00:02:44.530> you<00:02:44.620> can

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
that's pretty bad shape there you can

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.759 
that's pretty bad shape there you can
also<00:02:44.860> see<00:02:45.250> that<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.519> ripped<00:02:45.760> right<00:02:46.030> in<00:02:46.769> and

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
also see that it ripped right in and

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.040 
also see that it ripped right in and
these<00:02:48.489> these<00:02:48.850> these<00:02:49.060> troughs<00:02:49.450> will<00:02:49.660> not<00:02:49.810> take

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
these these these troughs will not take

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.460 
these these these troughs will not take
very<00:02:50.290> much<00:02:51.150> wear<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:52.180> tear<00:02:52.540> at<00:02:52.900> all<00:02:53.140> so

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
very much wear and tear at all so

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.990 
very much wear and tear at all so
they're<00:02:53.800> lucky<00:02:53.980> that<00:02:54.250> they<00:02:54.400> stayed<00:02:54.730> on<00:02:54.760> the

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
they're lucky that they stayed on the

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.640 
they're lucky that they stayed on the
house<00:02:55.150> for<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.600> as<00:02:55.750> long<00:02:55.930> as<00:02:56.080> they<00:02:56.170> did<00:02:56.410> for

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
house for the as long as they did for

the<00:02:56.709> last<00:02:56.890> 25<00:02:57.430> or<00:02:57.519> 30<00:02:57.850> years<00:03:06.150> much<00:03:07.150> stronger

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
the last 25 or 30 years much stronger

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.630 
the last 25 or 30 years much stronger
system<00:03:07.989> and<00:03:08.200> then<00:03:08.920> we'll<00:03:09.070> take<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.400> ladder

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
system and then we'll take the ladder

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.370 
system and then we'll take the ladder
and<00:03:09.940> give<00:03:10.090> that<00:03:10.269> a<00:03:10.300> few<00:03:10.480> bangs<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:10.989> see<00:03:11.200> how

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
and give that a few bangs and see how

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.320 
and give that a few bangs and see how
see<00:03:12.130> how<00:03:12.190> much<00:03:12.340> stronger<00:03:12.640> we<00:03:12.880> can<00:03:13.000> make<00:03:13.150> us<00:03:13.300> a

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
see how much stronger we can make us a

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.230 
see how much stronger we can make us a
new<00:03:13.540> leaf<00:03:13.720> drops<00:03:14.050> we<00:03:14.260> do

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
new leaf drops we do

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.180 
new leaf drops we do
easily<00:03:15.630> hang<00:03:15.870> from<00:03:16.140> them<00:03:16.290> so<00:03:16.830> once<00:03:17.040> again

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
easily hang from them so once again

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.280 
easily hang from them so once again
we're<00:03:17.550> really<00:03:17.790> nice<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.210> low<00:03:18.360> I'm<00:03:18.780> going<00:03:19.110> to

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
we're really nice and low I'm going to

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.140 
we're really nice and low I'm going to
grab<00:03:19.950> on<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.190> these<00:03:20.400> these<00:03:20.580> drops<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:23.150> just

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
grab on to these these drops and just

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.960 
grab on to these these drops and just
hang<00:03:24.750> on<00:03:24.990> but<00:03:25.440> I<00:03:25.500> can<00:03:25.680> just<00:03:25.890> know<00:03:26.190> that<00:03:26.640> this<00:03:26.790> is

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
hang on but I can just know that this is

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:48.430 
hang on but I can just know that this is
not<00:03:27.150> going<00:03:27.360> to<00:03:27.420> go<00:03:27.600> well<00:03:27.810> to<00:03:45.020> the<00:03:46.020> course<00:03:46.260> and

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
not going to go well to the course and

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.670 
not going to go well to the course and
the<00:03:49.440> brackets<00:03:49.890> folding<00:03:50.280> let<00:03:50.400> go<00:03:51.350> to<00:03:52.350> the<00:03:52.440> front

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
the brackets folding let go to the front

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.320 
the brackets folding let go to the front
and<00:03:52.830> then<00:03:52.920> plus<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.280> eavesdrop<00:03:53.670> just<00:03:53.970> ripped

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
and then plus the eavesdrop just ripped

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:00.830 
and then plus the eavesdrop just ripped
apart<00:03:54.450> so<00:03:55.580> these<00:03:59.210> put<00:04:00.210> on<00:04:00.300> a<00:04:00.330> little<00:04:00.510> test

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
apart so these put on a little test

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.600 
apart so these put on a little test
piece<00:04:01.050> of<00:04:01.380> what<00:04:01.740> we're<00:04:01.890> actually<00:04:02.010> putting<00:04:02.370> on

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
piece of what we're actually putting on

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.060 
piece of what we're actually putting on
and<00:04:02.850> then<00:04:02.940> we'll<00:04:03.120> try<00:04:03.360> and<00:04:03.570> demo<00:04:04.470> out<00:04:04.740> our<00:04:04.920> new

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
and then we'll try and demo out our new

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.880 
and then we'll try and demo out our new
t-rex<00:04:05.490> as<00:04:05.670> a<00:04:05.810> black<00:04:06.810> eavestrough<00:04:07.350> with<00:04:07.710> the

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
t-rex as a black eavestrough with the

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:13.190 
t-rex as a black eavestrough with the
t-rex<00:04:08.100> on<00:04:08.970> top<00:04:09.300> and<00:04:10.670> see<00:04:11.670> how<00:04:12.630> weak<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:13.080> other

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
t-rex on top and see how weak the other

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.190 
t-rex on top and see how weak the other
one<00:04:13.410> was<00:04:13.590> so<00:04:14.520> we<00:04:15.150> have<00:04:15.300> the<00:04:15.450> ladder<00:04:15.660> sitting<00:04:16.080> on

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
one was so we have the ladder sitting on

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:37.480 
one was so we have the ladder sitting on
the<00:04:16.290> t-rex

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:45.210 

all<00:04:38.490> right

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.589 

oh<00:04:45.330> no<00:04:46.330> problem

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:50.599 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:59.290 

nice<00:04:51.169> and<00:04:51.379> tight<00:04:54.699> so<00:04:56.860> the<00:04:57.860> major<00:04:58.209> benefit<00:04:59.209> of

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
nice and tight so the major benefit of

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.689 
nice and tight so the major benefit of
this<00:04:59.419> thing
