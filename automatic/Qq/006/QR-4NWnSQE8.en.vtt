here<00:01:29.130> was<00:01:29.159> start<00:01:29.520> with<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.729> hatch<00:01:29.850> first<00:01:30.210> and

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
here was start with the hatch first and

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.390 
here was start with the hatch first and
then<00:01:30.600> he<00:01:30.630> sees<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.350> probe<00:01:31.590> with<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.920> Overlord

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
then he sees the probe with the Overlord

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.609 
then he sees the probe with the Overlord
on<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.670> map<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:32.970> he's<00:01:33.150> like<00:01:33.360> okay<00:01:34.229> I'm<00:01:34.439> not

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
on the map and he's like okay I'm not

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.679 
on the map and he's like okay I'm not
gonna<00:01:34.829> risk<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.369> I'm<00:01:35.549> gonna<00:01:35.759> go<00:01:36.000> into<00:01:36.540> the

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
gonna risk that I'm gonna go into the

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.840 
gonna risk that I'm gonna go into the
pool<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.200> don't<00:01:37.740> want<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.009> be<00:01:38.130> can<00:01:38.340> rush<00:01:38.579> by<00:01:38.790> you

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
pool I don't want to be can rush by you

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.240 
pool I don't want to be can rush by you
but<00:01:39.540> now<00:01:39.689> he<00:01:39.750> delays<00:01:40.409> his<00:01:40.560> expansion<00:01:40.950> quite

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
but now he delays his expansion quite

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.310 
but now he delays his expansion quite
significantly<00:01:41.850> because<00:01:42.119> we<00:01:42.479> have<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:43.049> pylon

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
significantly because we have that pylon

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.490 
significantly because we have that pylon
here<00:01:43.710> as<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.920> block<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:45.420> probe<00:01:45.869> runs<00:01:46.259> in

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
here as a block and the probe runs in

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.620 
here as a block and the probe runs in
sees<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:47.490> morning<00:01:47.880> poems<00:01:48.149> like<00:01:48.299> all<00:01:48.479> right

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
sees this morning poems like all right

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.850 
sees this morning poems like all right
you're<00:01:48.899> gonna<00:01:49.020> start<00:01:49.320> things<00:01:49.530> off<00:01:49.649> with<00:01:49.710> a

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
you're gonna start things off with a

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.319 
you're gonna start things off with a
pool<00:01:50.040> leg<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.430> have<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.640> zerglings<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.180> kill

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
pool leg and have the zerglings to kill

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.600 
pool leg and have the zerglings to kill
my<00:01:51.450> pile<00:01:51.630> on<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.899> that's<00:01:52.290> nice<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:53.040> also<00:01:53.250> delays

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
my pile on it that's nice it also delays

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.660 
my pile on it that's nice it also delays
of<00:01:53.790> course<00:01:54.060> Stardust<00:01:54.869> expansion<00:01:55.439> he<00:01:56.310> still

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
of course Stardust expansion he still

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.130 
of course Stardust expansion he still
gets<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.000> Nexus<00:01:57.390> now<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.659> time<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.049> even

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
gets the Nexus now in time and even

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.560 
gets the Nexus now in time and even
before<00:01:58.670> vortex<00:01:59.670> gets<00:01:59.880> his<00:02:00.000> own<00:02:00.149> hatch<00:02:00.390> but

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
before vortex gets his own hatch but

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.170 
before vortex gets his own hatch but
still<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.530> pilum<00:02:01.979> thats<00:02:02.250> 100<00:02:02.640> minerals<00:02:02.969> right

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
still the pilum thats 100 minerals right

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.639 
still the pilum thats 100 minerals right
the<00:02:03.390> end<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.719> delays<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.229> course<00:02:04.500> is

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
the end that delays of course is

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.249 
the end that delays of course is
expansion<00:02:05.040> attempt<00:02:05.520> as<00:02:05.670> well<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.630> let's<00:02:07.079> see

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
expansion attempt as well so let's see

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.710 
expansion attempt as well so let's see
how<00:02:07.290> exactly<00:02:07.979> that's<00:02:08.819> gonna<00:02:09.060> work<00:02:09.300> out<00:02:09.509> right

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
how exactly that's gonna work out right

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.809 
how exactly that's gonna work out right
now<00:02:09.899> for<00:02:10.440> vortex<00:02:10.979> because<00:02:11.280> that's<00:02:11.459> definitely

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
now for vortex because that's definitely

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.450 
now for vortex because that's definitely
a<00:02:11.879> little<00:02:12.120> bit<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.510> different

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
a little bit of a different

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.340 
a little bit of a different
that<00:02:13.820> he<00:02:13.910> has<00:02:14.030> they're<00:02:14.360> very<00:02:14.900> different<00:02:15.260> to

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
that he has they're very different to

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.710 
that he has they're very different to
what<00:02:15.470> we<00:02:15.530> saw<00:02:15.860> earlier<00:02:16.070> in<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.520> game<00:02:16.690> where<00:02:17.690> he

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
what we saw earlier in the game where he

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.290 
what we saw earlier in the game where he
just<00:02:18.650> dominated<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.700> pace<00:02:19.880> of<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.180> match

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
just dominated the the pace of the match

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.450 
just dominated the the pace of the match
of<00:02:20.870> course<00:02:21.140> he<00:02:21.260> has<00:02:21.410> to<00:02:21.590> get<00:02:21.710> his<00:02:21.770> expansion<00:02:22.220> it

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
of course he has to get his expansion it

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.610 
of course he has to get his expansion it
takes<00:02:22.730> that<00:02:22.850> third<00:02:23.090> base<00:02:23.330> over<00:02:23.660> here<00:02:23.840> 10<00:02:24.350> saw

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
takes that third base over here 10 saw

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.930 
takes that third base over here 10 saw
one<00:02:24.950> of<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.130> things<00:02:25.310> that<00:02:25.460> he<00:02:25.520> knows<00:02:25.700> is<00:02:25.910> that

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
one of the things that he knows is that

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.760 
one of the things that he knows is that
there<00:02:26.210> has<00:02:26.240> been<00:02:26.570> a<00:02:26.600> fortune<00:02:27.080> if<00:02:27.500> there's<00:02:27.710> a

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
there has been a fortune if there's a

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.710 
there has been a fortune if there's a
forge<00:02:28.010> opening<00:02:28.490> the<00:02:28.880> chances<00:02:29.330> of<00:02:29.420> control

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
forge opening the chances of control

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.090 
forge opening the chances of control
display<00:02:29.990> it<00:02:30.110> really<00:02:30.410> be<00:02:30.530> aggressive<00:02:30.980> towards

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
display it really be aggressive towards

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.590 
display it really be aggressive towards
your<00:02:31.400> third<00:02:31.580> place<00:02:31.790> a<00:02:31.820> very<00:02:32.030> limit<00:02:32.390> that<00:02:32.480> you

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
your third place a very limit that you

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.450 
your third place a very limit that you
can<00:02:32.750> of<00:02:32.840> course<00:02:33.050> always<00:02:33.260> cannon<00:02:33.770> but<00:02:34.130> it<00:02:34.250> means

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
can of course always cannon but it means

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.220 
can of course always cannon but it means
that<00:02:34.640> he<00:02:34.760> can<00:02:34.850> similarly<00:02:35.390> simply<00:02:35.810> take<00:02:36.050> this

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
that he can similarly simply take this

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.830 
that he can similarly simply take this
third<00:02:36.530> base<00:02:36.770> and<00:02:37.040> then<00:02:37.400> roughly<00:02:37.730> at<00:02:37.910> 420<00:02:38.450> 430

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
third base and then roughly at 420 430

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.840 
third base and then roughly at 420 430
he<00:02:39.320> takes<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.710> base<00:02:39.890> over<00:02:40.190> there<00:02:40.340> so<00:02:40.520> once<00:02:40.700> the

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
he takes the base over there so once the

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.610 
he takes the base over there so once the
Pilon<00:02:41.180> is<00:02:41.300> down<00:02:41.510> he<00:02:41.930> will<00:02:42.080> have<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.260> myth<00:02:42.500> we

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
Pilon is down he will have the myth we

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.380 
Pilon is down he will have the myth we
already<00:02:42.980> has<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.280> minerals<00:02:43.580> takes<00:02:44.120> down

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
already has the minerals takes down

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.820 
already has the minerals takes down
another<00:02:44.630> base<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.170> he's<00:02:45.290> going<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:45.530> be<00:02:45.620> fine

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
another base and he's going to be fine

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.400 
another base and he's going to be fine
for<00:02:46.130> now<00:02:46.250> so<00:02:46.760> that's<00:02:47.210> a<00:02:47.390> pretty<00:02:47.780> figured<00:02:48.260> out

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
for now so that's a pretty figured out

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.110 
for now so that's a pretty figured out
style<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.100> it's<00:02:49.430> going<00:02:49.610> to<00:02:49.670> even<00:02:49.970> out<00:02:50.060> a

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
style and it's going to even out a

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.970 
style and it's going to even out a
little<00:02:50.360> bit<00:02:50.510> again<00:02:50.750> zerg<00:02:51.350> player<00:02:51.410> will<00:02:51.830> help

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
little bit again zerg player will help

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.040 
little bit again zerg player will help
have<00:02:52.340> his<00:02:52.460> three<00:02:52.730> bases<00:02:53.060> upstart<00:02:53.630> us<00:02:53.750> is<00:02:53.900> gonna

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
have his three bases upstart us is gonna

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.740 
have his three bases upstart us is gonna
look<00:02:54.440> just<00:02:54.830> as<00:02:55.070> Epona<00:02:55.340> little<00:02:55.700> bit<00:02:55.820> was<00:02:56.390> able

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
look just as Epona little bit was able

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.020 
look just as Epona little bit was able
to<00:02:56.960> throw<00:02:57.620> him<00:02:57.770> off<00:02:57.860> and<00:02:58.160> force<00:02:58.550> him<00:02:58.760> to<00:02:58.850> take

the base to the top left a little bit

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.950 
the base to the top left a little bit

faster but vortex doesn't make the

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
mistake of action not scouting here's

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.830 
mistake of action not scouting here's
exactly<00:03:04.490> in<00:03:04.880> position<00:03:05.240> that<00:03:05.360> just<00:03:05.570> makes<00:03:05.750> sure

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
exactly in position that just makes sure

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.810 
exactly in position that just makes sure
that<00:03:05.960> there<00:03:06.200> is<00:03:06.290> no<00:03:06.530> probe<00:03:06.890> hidden<00:03:07.250> that<00:03:07.610> could

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
that there is no probe hidden that could

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.700 
that there is no probe hidden that could
drop<00:03:08.060> down<00:03:08.330> a<00:03:08.360> pile<00:03:08.660> in<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:08.990> couple<00:03:09.290> of<00:03:09.320> cannons

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:09.710 
drop down a pile in a couple of cannons

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.950 
drop down a pile in a couple of cannons
I<00:03:09.920> was<00:03:10.250> like<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.520> most<00:03:11.060> horrible<00:03:11.300> way<00:03:11.570> to<00:03:11.630> lose

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
I was like the most horrible way to lose

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.230 
I was like the most horrible way to lose
if<00:03:12.170> that<00:03:12.290> happens<00:03:12.590> to<00:03:12.650> you<00:03:12.860> in<00:03:13.310> vortex<00:03:13.550> is<00:03:13.910> very

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
if that happens to you in vortex is very

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.450 
if that happens to you in vortex is very
clever<00:03:14.480> about<00:03:14.720> this<00:03:15.110> does<00:03:15.620> not<00:03:15.800> fall<00:03:16.100> into<00:03:16.280> the

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
clever about this does not fall into the

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.370 
clever about this does not fall into the
trap<00:03:16.700> of<00:03:16.730> being<00:03:17.090> too<00:03:17.420> greedy<00:03:17.570> he<00:03:17.930> sends<00:03:18.230> that

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
trap of being too greedy he sends that

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.620 
trap of being too greedy he sends that
scout<00:03:18.620> out<00:03:18.860> nothing<00:03:19.730> they<00:03:19.910> are<00:03:20.030> but<00:03:20.360> still

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
scout out nothing they are but still

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.180 
scout out nothing they are but still
it's<00:03:20.990> something<00:03:21.380> that<00:03:21.470> you<00:03:21.500> should<00:03:21.710> always<00:03:21.860> do

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
it's something that you should always do

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.120 
it's something that you should always do
so<00:03:22.910> for<00:03:23.330> now<00:03:23.450> Stardust<00:03:24.170> it's<00:03:24.710> probably<00:03:24.950> just

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
so for now Stardust it's probably just

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.530 
so for now Stardust it's probably just
thinking<00:03:25.520> about<00:03:25.610> what<00:03:25.910> he's<00:03:26.030> going<00:03:26.270> to<00:03:26.300> do<00:03:26.420> in

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540

thinking about what he's going to do in
this<00:03:26.690> game<00:03:26.960> if<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:28.340> past<00:03:28.790> games<00:03:29.150> have<00:03:29.570> been

this game if the past games have been

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.690 
this game if the past games have been
any<00:03:30.440> indicator<00:03:30.980> of<00:03:31.100> what<00:03:31.310> we're<00:03:31.460> going<00:03:31.580> to

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
any indicator of what we're going to

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.000 
any indicator of what we're going to
expect<00:03:32.360> here<00:03:32.540> it's<00:03:33.080> gonna<00:03:33.320> be<00:03:33.530> hit<00:03:33.650> a<00:03:33.680> mortal

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
expect here it's gonna be hit a mortal

push<00:03:34.190> this<00:03:35.150> time<00:03:35.420> apparently<00:03:35.630> without<00:03:36.320> the

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
push this time apparently without the

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.330 
push this time apparently without the
initial<00:03:37.310> for<00:03:37.520> gate<00:03:37.700> but<00:03:38.570> is<00:03:39.170> he<00:03:39.380> really<00:03:39.980> gonna

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
initial for gate but is he really gonna

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.800 
initial for gate but is he really gonna
go<00:03:40.550> for<00:03:40.790> it<00:03:40.880> that<00:03:41.000> was<00:03:41.150> the<00:03:41.330> one<00:03:41.480> of<00:03:41.600> the<00:03:41.660> maps

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
go for it that was the one of the maps

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.090 
go for it that was the one of the maps
where<00:03:41.990> he<00:03:42.080> used<00:03:42.200> the<00:03:42.380> immortal<00:03:42.650> push<00:03:42.770> against

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
where he used the immortal push against

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.860 
where he used the immortal push against
Jaden<00:03:43.370> keep<00:03:43.700> in<00:03:43.850> mind<00:03:44.090> and<00:03:44.300> really<00:03:44.630> worked

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
Jaden keep in mind and really worked

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.260 
Jaden keep in mind and really worked
very<00:03:45.320> very<00:03:45.410> well<00:03:45.620> for<00:03:45.890> him<00:03:46.040> jado<00:03:46.730> maybe<00:03:46.970> over

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
very very well for him jado maybe over

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.760 
very very well for him jado maybe over
drone<00:03:47.480> a<00:03:47.510> little<00:03:47.840> bit<00:03:47.960> and<00:03:48.140> played<00:03:48.440> this<00:03:48.560> too

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
drone a little bit and played this too

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.040 
drone a little bit and played this too
greedy<00:03:49.040> but<00:03:49.730> let's<00:03:49.940> see<00:03:50.120> how<00:03:50.240> exactly<00:03:50.390> not

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
greedy but let's see how exactly not

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.330 
greedy but let's see how exactly not
only<00:03:51.260> bought<00:03:51.440> explains<00:03:51.950> that<00:03:52.070> but<00:03:52.250> if

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
only bought explains that but if

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.890 
only bought explains that but if
Stardust<00:03:52.790> is<00:03:52.880> also<00:03:53.000> going<00:03:53.330> for<00:03:53.600> the<00:03:53.690> same

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
Stardust is also going for the same

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.960 
Stardust is also going for the same
build<00:03:54.170> because<00:03:54.650> if<00:03:54.890> he<00:03:54.950> goes<00:03:55.100> for<00:03:55.130> an<00:03:55.580> immortal

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
build because if he goes for an immortal

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.060 
build because if he goes for an immortal
push<00:03:56.150> again<00:03:56.600> he<00:03:57.140> would<00:03:57.260> kind<00:03:57.470> of<00:03:57.530> identify

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
push again he would kind of identify

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.130 
push again he would kind of identify
himself<00:03:58.250> as<00:03:58.700> a<00:03:58.760> bit<00:03:58.850> of<00:03:59.030> a<00:03:59.180> one-trick<00:03:59.570> pony<00:03:59.870> and

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
himself as a bit of a one-trick pony and

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.650 
himself as a bit of a one-trick pony and
currently<00:04:01.130> looks<00:04:01.700> like<00:04:01.880> vortex<00:04:02.330> has<00:04:02.480> his

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
currently looks like vortex has his

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.390 
currently looks like vortex has his
number<00:04:02.990> and<00:04:03.110> that's<00:04:03.500> of<00:04:03.710> course<00:04:03.860> also<00:04:04.130> one<00:04:04.370> of

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
number and that's of course also one of

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.980 
number and that's of course also one of
the<00:04:04.580> questions<00:04:04.970> if<00:04:05.120> you<00:04:05.270> are<00:04:05.390> Stardust<00:04:05.780> right

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
the questions if you are Stardust right

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.870 
the questions if you are Stardust right
now<00:04:06.140> you<00:04:06.560> know<00:04:06.740> that<00:04:06.980> this<00:04:07.100> is<00:04:07.280> a<00:04:07.310> style<00:04:07.700> that

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
now you know that this is a style that

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.370 
now you know that this is a style that
you've<00:04:08.060> been<00:04:08.270> using<00:04:08.450> quite<00:04:08.840> a<00:04:08.870> lot<00:04:09.080> than<00:04:09.230> that

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
you've been using quite a lot than that

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.500 
you've been using quite a lot than that
people<00:04:09.740> know<00:04:09.890> you<00:04:09.950> love<00:04:10.430> to<00:04:10.610> play<00:04:10.820> do<00:04:11.390> you

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
people know you love to play do you

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.270 
people know you love to play do you
really<00:04:11.720> risk<00:04:12.050> it<00:04:12.230> on<00:04:12.350> the<00:04:12.470> third<00:04:12.680> map<00:04:12.950> to<00:04:13.130> go

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
really risk it on the third map to go

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.160 
really risk it on the third map to go
for<00:04:13.460> that<00:04:13.550> again<00:04:13.820> or<00:04:14.000> do<00:04:14.480> you<00:04:14.600> just<00:04:14.630> go<00:04:14.990> for<00:04:15.050> it

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
for that again or do you just go for it

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.210 
for that again or do you just go for it
because<00:04:15.320> they<00:04:15.500> said<00:04:15.650> like<00:04:15.740> yeah<00:04:15.920> it's<00:04:16.070> my

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
because they said like yeah it's my

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.710 
because they said like yeah it's my
strength<00:04:16.580> here<00:04:16.850> it's<00:04:16.970> really<00:04:17.210> the<00:04:17.299> one<00:04:17.450> thing

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
strength here it's really the one thing

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.570 
strength here it's really the one thing
that<00:04:17.750> I<00:04:17.930> have<00:04:18.350> the<00:04:18.470> diving<00:04:18.830> stone<00:04:19.040> cold<00:04:19.400> and

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
that I have the diving stone cold and

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.909 
that I have the diving stone cold and
where<00:04:20.060> I'm<00:04:20.150> so<00:04:20.359> super<00:04:20.750> strong<00:04:21.020> with<00:04:21.230> but<00:04:21.799> it

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
where I'm so super strong with but it

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.890 
where I'm so super strong with but it
may<00:04:22.160> make<00:04:22.370> it<00:04:22.400> a<00:04:22.610> little<00:04:23.030> bit<00:04:23.210> too<00:04:23.360> predictable

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
may make it a little bit too predictable

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.250 
may make it a little bit too predictable
because<00:04:24.050> vortex<00:04:24.650> is<00:04:24.830> sweet

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
because vortex is sweet

is able to get it actually and that puts
the<00:05:46.470> pilot<00:05:46.800> a<00:05:47.040> little<00:05:47.820> bit<00:05:47.940> farther<00:05:48.180> back<00:05:48.480> but

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.200 
the pilot a little bit farther back but

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.510 
the pilot a little bit farther back but
he<00:05:49.290> still<00:05:49.470> doesn't<00:05:49.650> have<00:05:49.770> a<00:05:49.860> lot<00:05:49.980> of<00:05:50.010> units<00:05:50.400> and

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
he still doesn't have a lot of units and

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.800 
he still doesn't have a lot of units and
you<00:05:50.580> also<00:05:50.760> doesn't<00:05:51.090> have<00:05:51.180> those<00:05:51.270> rocks<00:05:51.540> down

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
you also doesn't have those rocks down

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.870 
you also doesn't have those rocks down
so<00:05:52.140> just<00:05:52.380> between<00:05:52.710> the<00:05:52.890> two<00:05:53.070> bases<00:05:53.520> still<00:05:53.820> a

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
so just between the two bases still a

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.640 
so just between the two bases still a
little<00:05:54.060> bit<00:05:54.240> more<00:05:54.360> significant<00:05:54.960> queen<00:05:55.500> is

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
little bit more significant queen is

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.050 
little bit more significant queen is
also<00:05:56.040> not<00:05:56.130> there<00:05:56.340> just<00:05:56.370> yet<00:05:56.640> could<00:05:56.880> drop

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
also not there just yet could drop

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.090 
also not there just yet could drop
another<00:05:57.330> the<00:05:58.290> creep<00:05:58.530> too<00:05:58.710> much<00:05:58.860> you<00:05:58.980> really
