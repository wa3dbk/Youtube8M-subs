00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.030 
on the looks gorgeous and here's the
epic<00:02:50.570> climax<00:02:51.050> of<00:02:51.380> clone<00:02:52.160> side

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.660 

again<00:02:56.700> look<00:02:57.030> at<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.269> color<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.599> this<00:02:57.840> logger

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:11.080 

this<00:03:01.060> is<00:03:01.209> ridiculous

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.310 

this<00:03:12.090> might<00:03:12.270> be<00:03:12.390> our<00:03:12.510> first<00:03:12.750> rock-climbing

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
this might be our first rock-climbing

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:22.370 
this might be our first rock-climbing
experience

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.470 

after<00:03:23.130> a<00:03:23.160> 20-minute<00:03:23.520> climb<00:03:23.970> we<00:03:24.120> made<00:03:24.270> it<00:03:24.360> to

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
after a 20-minute climb we made it to

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.970 
after a 20-minute climb we made it to
the<00:03:24.570> top<00:03:24.750> of<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.020> waterfall<00:03:25.320> where<00:03:25.680> we<00:03:25.800> got<00:03:25.950> a

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
the top of the waterfall where we got a

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.040 
the top of the waterfall where we got a
spectacular<00:03:26.760> view<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.300> were<00:03:27.450> able<00:03:27.570> to<00:03:27.720> peer

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
spectacular view and were able to peer

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.420 
spectacular view and were able to peer
over<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.530> waterfall<00:03:28.950> which<00:03:29.070> you<00:03:29.160> don't<00:03:29.340> get

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
over the waterfall which you don't get

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.210 
over the waterfall which you don't get
to<00:03:29.550> do<00:03:29.700> very<00:03:29.730> often<00:03:30.320> the<00:03:31.320> area<00:03:31.650> up<00:03:31.800> there<00:03:31.830> was

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
to do very often the area up there was

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.190 
to do very often the area up there was
like<00:03:32.250> a<00:03:32.490> swamp<00:03:33.000> just<00:03:33.510> wasn't<00:03:33.810> dirty<00:03:33.990> or

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
like a swamp just wasn't dirty or

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.350 
like a swamp just wasn't dirty or
anything<00:03:34.230> like<00:03:34.590> that<00:03:34.650> it<00:03:34.950> was<00:03:35.040> pretty<00:03:35.280> cool

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.060 

I've<00:03:40.810> gotten<00:03:41.140> a<00:03:41.200> little<00:03:41.320> bit<00:03:41.530> closer<00:03:41.770> to<00:03:41.980> the

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
I've gotten a little bit closer to the

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.260 
I've gotten a little bit closer to the
edge<00:03:42.250> and<00:03:42.810> this<00:03:43.810> is<00:03:43.990> what<00:03:44.140> it<00:03:44.260> looks<00:03:44.440> like<00:03:45.270> it's

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
edge and this is what it looks like it's

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.780 
edge and this is what it looks like it's
really<00:03:46.540> cool

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.399 

I<00:03:51.909> wonder<00:03:52.540> if<00:03:52.569> we<00:03:52.689> can<00:03:52.780> go<00:03:52.870> swimming<00:03:53.170> down

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:53.409 
I wonder if we can go swimming down

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:58.559 
I wonder if we can go swimming down
there<00:03:53.670> it<00:03:54.670> looked<00:03:54.939> nice<00:03:55.180> I<00:03:57.120> don't<00:03:58.120> think<00:03:58.450> he's

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
there it looked nice I don't think he's

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:08.530 
there it looked nice I don't think he's
supposed<00:03:58.750> to<00:03:58.959> be<00:03:59.079> doing<00:03:59.379> that

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.089 

this<00:04:09.140> right<00:04:09.349> here<00:04:09.530> might<00:04:09.680> be<00:04:09.709> the<00:04:09.920> world

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
this right here might be the world

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:52.959 
this right here might be the world
smallest<00:04:10.879> waterfall<00:04:11.469> yeah

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:52.969 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:59.140 

Oh<00:04:55.119> Lord

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.310 

the<00:05:03.530> scary<00:05:03.830> part<00:05:03.920> is<00:05:04.190> getting<00:05:04.430> the<00:05:04.640> rope<00:05:05.320> but

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
the scary part is getting the rope but

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:15.430 
the scary part is getting the rope but
he's<00:05:06.470> got<00:05:06.680> long<00:05:06.860> arms<00:05:07.100> so<00:05:07.370> he's<00:05:07.580> lucky

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440
