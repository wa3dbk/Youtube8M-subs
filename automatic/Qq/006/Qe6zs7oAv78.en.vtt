00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.780 
you can buy a grow light out of those
catalogs<00:00:44.590> and<00:00:44.920> that's<00:00:45.040> just<00:00:45.280> fine<00:00:45.460> if<00:00:45.670> you're

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790

grow<00:00:49.570> light<00:00:49.600> but<00:00:50.440> I<00:00:50.850> being<00:00:51.850> a<00:00:51.970> little<00:00:52.150> more

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.240 
grow light but I being a little more

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.360 
grow light but I being a little more
frugal<00:00:52.720> I<00:00:52.960> thought<00:00:53.680> I'd<00:00:53.800> try<00:00:54.010> and<00:00:54.070> make<00:00:54.130> my<00:00:54.340> own

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
frugal I thought I'd try and make my own

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.160 
frugal I thought I'd try and make my own
grow<00:00:54.670> light<00:00:54.880> and<00:00:54.910> I've<00:00:55.180> done<00:00:55.809> it<00:00:55.840> for<00:00:55.930> a<00:00:56.050> couple

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
grow light and I've done it for a couple

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.690 
grow light and I've done it for a couple
years<00:00:56.350> now<00:00:56.530> and<00:00:56.710> I've<00:00:56.860> figured<00:00:57.340> out<00:00:57.489> a<00:00:57.550> pretty

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
years now and I've figured out a pretty

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.490 
years now and I've figured out a pretty
decent<00:00:58.180> way<00:00:58.239> to<00:00:58.270> do<00:00:58.510> it<00:00:58.630> what<00:00:59.200> we're<00:00:59.350> going<00:00:59.470> to

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
decent way to do it what we're going to

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.000 
decent way to do it what we're going to
use<00:00:59.770> our<00:01:00.040> two<00:01:01.020> inexpensive<00:01:02.020> fluorescent

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
use our two inexpensive fluorescent

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.180 
use our two inexpensive fluorescent

the pi r-squared thing from the cold
frame<00:01:50.680> video<00:01:50.920> I<00:01:51.010> screwed<00:01:51.340> it<00:01:51.370> up<00:01:51.549> a<00:01:52.090> guy

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
frame video I screwed it up a guy

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.180 
frame video I screwed it up a guy
emailed<00:01:53.140> me<00:01:53.320> and<00:01:53.380> so<00:01:53.500> we<00:01:53.590> did<00:01:53.710> the<00:01:53.770> math<00:01:53.950> wrong

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
emailed me and so we did the math wrong

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.160 
emailed me and so we did the math wrong
it<00:01:54.670> is<00:01:54.790> close<00:01:55.030> but<00:01:55.600> it<00:01:55.720> worked

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
it is close but it worked

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.160 
it is close but it worked

a way to get into the back of the

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.050 
a way to get into the back of the
fixture<00:03:00.480> and<00:03:00.660> here<00:03:01.080> it's<00:03:01.770> this<00:03:02.600> little<00:03:03.600> insert

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060

so again make sure these aren't plugged

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.870 
so again make sure these aren't plugged
in<00:03:07.410> when<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:07.650> do<00:03:07.770> this<00:03:07.950> we're<00:03:08.460> going<00:03:08.550> to<00:03:08.640> screw

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
in when you do this we're going to screw

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.490 
in when you do this we're going to screw
from<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.180> backs<00:03:09.570> of<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.080> fluorescent

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
from the backs of the fluorescent

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.720 
from the backs of the fluorescent
fixture<00:03:10.800> into<00:03:11.070> the<00:03:11.160> wood<00:03:11.280> so<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.430> just<00:03:11.610> got

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
fixture into the wood so I just got

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.370 
fixture into the wood so I just got
these<00:03:11.820> little<00:03:12.030> screws<00:03:12.270> these<00:03:12.720> are<00:03:12.900> zip<00:03:13.110> screws

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
these little screws these are zip screws

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.280 
these little screws these are zip screws
they're<00:03:13.770> used<00:03:14.130> for<00:03:14.430> putting<00:03:15.360> metal<00:03:15.660> studs<00:03:16.080> and

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
they're used for putting metal studs and

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.990 
they're used for putting metal studs and
houses<00:03:16.650> so<00:03:16.890> this<00:03:17.070> will<00:03:17.250> cut<00:03:17.460> through<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.790> thin

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
houses so this will cut through the thin

houses so this will cut through the thin
metal<00:03:23.210> bet<00:03:24.210> that<00:03:24.330> doesn't<00:03:24.630> happen<00:03:24.720> on<00:03:24.960> this

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
bulbs in now what we're going to do now

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.610 
bulbs in now what we're going to do now
is<00:03:56.550> on<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.120> flip<00:03:57.330> side<00:03:57.360> of<00:03:57.570> this<00:03:57.810> we're<00:03:58.500> going

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
is on the flip side of this we're going

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.260 
is on the flip side of this we're going
to<00:03:58.680> find<00:03:58.950> the<00:03:59.100> center<00:04:01.310> will<00:04:02.310> we<00:04:02.460> be<00:04:02.610> eyeballing

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
to find the center will we be eyeballing

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.560 
to find the center will we be eyeballing
it<00:04:03.360> yeah<00:04:04.020> we're<00:04:04.260> going<00:04:04.380> to<00:04:04.440> eyeball<00:04:04.680> of<00:04:05.010> course

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
it yeah we're going to eyeball of course

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.470 
just tips um yeah I'll show you what I'm
doing<00:04:15.550> let's<00:04:15.760> assume<00:04:15.940> you<00:04:16.150> know<00:04:16.209> there's<00:04:16.420> a

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
doing let's assume you know there's a

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.750 
doing let's assume you know there's a
method<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:16.840> my<00:04:17.080> Eric<00:04:17.830> madness<00:04:18.250> here<00:04:19.440> but

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
method to my Eric madness here but

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.100 
method to my Eric madness here but
that's<00:04:21.760> in<00:04:21.940> the<00:04:21.970> middle<00:04:22.210> between<00:04:22.480> the<00:04:22.720> two

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
that's in the middle between the two

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.850 
that's in the middle between the two
okay<00:04:23.620> so<00:04:23.680> we<00:04:23.950> have<00:04:24.420> screweyes<00:04:25.420> in<00:04:26.320> our<00:04:26.650> piece

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
okay so we have screweyes in our piece

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.230 
okay so we have screweyes in our piece
of<00:04:26.890> wood<00:04:27.870> we've<00:04:28.870> got<00:04:29.110> a<00:04:29.140> little<00:04:29.820> adapter<00:04:30.820> here

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
of wood we've got a little adapter here

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.200 
of wood we've got a little adapter here
so<00:04:31.420> we<00:04:31.510> can<00:04:31.690> put<00:04:32.970> two<00:04:34.530> plugs<00:04:35.530> into<00:04:36.010> a<00:04:36.160> timer<00:04:36.490> the

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
so we can put two plugs into a timer the

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.390 
so we can put two plugs into a timer the
grow<00:04:37.420> lights<00:04:37.690> need<00:04:37.930> to<00:04:38.050> be<00:04:38.140> on<00:04:38.320> 16<00:04:38.980> hours<00:04:39.280> a<00:04:39.310> day

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
grow lights need to be on 16 hours a day

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.880 
grow lights need to be on 16 hours a day
because<00:04:39.670> you're<00:04:40.360> never<00:04:40.570> going<00:04:40.780> to<00:04:40.890> fully

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
because you're never going to fully

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.490 
because you're never going to fully
simulate<00:04:42.700> sunlight<00:04:43.120> so<00:04:43.630> the<00:04:43.810> 16<00:04:44.200> hours

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
simulate sunlight so the 16 hours

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.190 
simulate sunlight so the 16 hours
compensates<00:04:45.130> for<00:04:45.250> the<00:04:45.460> low<00:04:45.610> amount<00:04:45.850> of<00:04:45.970> light

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
compensates for the low amount of light

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.870 
compensates for the low amount of light
and<00:04:47.200> this<00:04:47.680> is<00:04:47.860> a<00:04:47.890> really<00:04:48.130> nice<00:04:48.250> timer<00:04:48.550> you<00:04:48.760> can

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
and this is a really nice timer you can

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.340 
and this is a really nice timer you can
use<00:04:49.060> those<00:04:49.210> kind<00:04:49.510> of<00:04:49.600> have<00:04:49.750> the<00:04:49.870> clock<00:04:50.110> face

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
use those kind of have the clock face

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.150 
use those kind of have the clock face
too<00:04:50.650> they<00:04:50.830> work<00:04:51.010> just<00:04:51.160> fine<00:04:51.340> as<00:04:51.490> well

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
too they work just fine as well

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.130 
too they work just fine as well
alright<00:04:54.160> so<00:04:54.400> we<00:04:54.580> are<00:04:54.610> at<00:04:54.820> what<00:04:55.270> is<00:04:55.390> usually<00:04:55.870> the

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
alright so we are at what is usually the

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.470 
alright so we are at what is usually the
laundry<00:04:56.500> counter<00:04:56.890> it<00:04:57.070> is<00:04:57.100> it's<00:04:57.910> a<00:04:58.030> nice<00:04:58.210> white

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
laundry counter it is it's a nice white

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.710 
laundry counter it is it's a nice white
counter<00:04:59.190> but<00:05:00.190> in<00:05:00.430> late<00:05:01.180> winter<00:05:01.420> early<00:05:01.480> spring

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
counter but in late winter early spring

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.530 
counter but in late winter early spring
it<00:05:02.260> becomes<00:05:02.650> the<00:05:02.890> seedling<00:05:03.280> tray<00:05:03.550> grow<00:05:04.090> area

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
it becomes the seedling tray grow area

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.780 
it becomes the seedling tray grow area
so<00:05:04.930> we've<00:05:05.050> got<00:05:05.140> two<00:05:05.230> skies<00:05:05.560> here<00:05:05.770> and<00:05:05.950> then<00:05:06.580> up

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
so we've got two skies here and then up

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.660 
so we've got two skies here and then up
in<00:05:07.030> the<00:05:07.060> ceiling<00:05:07.480> here<00:05:08.080> I<00:05:08.200> put<00:05:08.740> another<00:05:09.280> screw

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:09.670 
in the ceiling here I put another screw

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.030 
in the ceiling here I put another screw
I<00:05:09.760> and<00:05:10.180> I<00:05:10.240> got<00:05:10.420> this<00:05:10.540> neat<00:05:10.780> kind<00:05:10.930> of<00:05:11.050> chain<00:05:11.350> that

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
I and I got this neat kind of chain that

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.390 
I and I got this neat kind of chain that
hooks<00:05:12.280> in<00:05:12.490> very<00:05:12.730> nicely<00:05:13.530> to<00:05:14.530> this<00:05:14.980> right<00:05:15.190> here

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
hooks in very nicely to this right here

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.520 
hooks in very nicely to this right here
I<00:05:15.580> use<00:05:16.090> the<00:05:16.270> chain<00:05:16.540> because<00:05:16.900> you<00:05:17.020> can<00:05:17.170> adjust

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
I use the chain because you can adjust

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.470 
I use the chain because you can adjust
the<00:05:17.710> height<00:05:17.890> of<00:05:18.190> the<00:05:18.340> grow<00:05:18.550> light<00:05:18.760> as<00:05:18.940> the

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
the height of the grow light as the

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.450 
the height of the grow light as the
seedlings<00:05:19.960> start<00:05:20.230> to<00:05:20.320> grow<00:05:20.500> up<00:05:20.680> you<00:05:21.100> can<00:05:21.250> raise

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
seedlings start to grow up you can raise

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.740 
seedlings start to grow up you can raise
the<00:05:21.610> grow<00:05:21.820> light<00:05:22.000> so<00:05:22.150> the<00:05:22.240> chain<00:05:22.450> works<00:05:22.660> well

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
the grow light so the chain works well

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.190 
the grow light so the chain works well
nice<00:05:25.750> huh<00:05:26.070> so<00:05:27.070> we've<00:05:27.220> got<00:05:27.370> our<00:05:27.490> timer<00:05:28.200> I'm

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
nice huh so we've got our timer I'm

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.830 
nice huh so we've got our timer I'm
going<00:05:29.410> to<00:05:29.470> take<00:05:29.680> our<00:05:30.550> two<00:05:30.820> lights<00:05:31.090> and<00:05:31.390> plug

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
going to take our two lights and plug

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.830 
going to take our two lights and plug
them<00:05:31.960> into<00:05:32.110> a<00:05:32.230> little<00:05:33.220> adapter<00:05:33.810> the<00:05:34.810> adapter

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
them into a little adapter the adapter

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.880 
them into a little adapter the adapter
plugs<00:05:35.560> into<00:05:35.890> the<00:05:36.430> side<00:05:36.610> of<00:05:36.760> the<00:05:36.850> timer<00:05:37.120> and<00:05:37.890> now

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
plugs into the side of the timer and now

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.510 
plugs into the side of the timer and now
for<00:05:39.280> the<00:05:39.340> lighting<00:05:39.520> ceremony<00:05:41.100> okay<00:05:42.100> look<00:05:42.430> at

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
for the lighting ceremony okay look at

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.560 
for the lighting ceremony okay look at
that<00:05:43.830> when<00:05:44.830> you're<00:05:44.950> growing<00:05:45.190> seedlings<00:05:45.669> these

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
that when you're growing seedlings these

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.900 
that when you're growing seedlings these
lights<00:05:46.960> have<00:05:47.200> to<00:05:47.380> be<00:05:47.410> smack<00:05:48.040> on<00:05:48.280> top<00:05:48.580> of<00:05:48.790> these

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
lights have to be smack on top of these

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.740 
lights have to be smack on top of these
trays<00:05:49.300> um<00:05:49.740> because<00:05:50.740> it's<00:05:51.580> not<00:05:52.270> a<00:05:52.300> whole<00:05:52.570> lot<00:05:52.720> of

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
trays um because it's not a whole lot of

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.630 
trays um because it's not a whole lot of
wattage<00:05:53.020> coming<00:05:53.440> out<00:05:53.560> it's<00:05:53.740> not<00:05:53.950> the<00:05:54.160> Sun<00:05:54.400> it's

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:54.640 
wattage coming out it's not the Sun it's

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.460 
wattage coming out it's not the Sun it's
not<00:05:54.820> you<00:05:55.180> know<00:05:55.300> how<00:05:55.480> many<00:05:55.630> miles<00:05:55.840> away<00:05:56.230> it<00:05:56.350> is

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
not you know how many miles away it is

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.820 
not you know how many miles away it is
so<00:05:57.040> these<00:05:57.340> trays<00:05:57.730> have<00:05:58.510> to<00:05:58.750> be<00:05:58.930> they<00:05:59.650> have<00:05:59.800> to

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
so these trays have to be they have to

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.520 
so these trays have to be they have to
be<00:05:59.919> literally<00:06:00.400> right<00:06:00.610> here<00:06:00.810> the<00:06:01.810> leaves<00:06:02.050> will

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
be literally right here the leaves will

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.380 
be literally right here the leaves will
grow<00:06:02.740> right<00:06:03.190> and<00:06:03.460> they'll<00:06:03.669> start<00:06:03.940> to<00:06:04.060> curler

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:04.390 
grow right and they'll start to curler

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:05.880 
grow right and they'll start to curler
on<00:06:04.510> the<00:06:04.660> bulbs<00:06:04.930> and<00:06:04.990> that's<00:06:05.169> okay<00:06:05.500> because

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:05.890 
on the bulbs and that's okay because

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.340 
on the bulbs and that's okay because

you're starting you raise it that's why

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.680 
you're starting you raise it that's why

for some reason I don't know why but you
just<00:07:00.810> you<00:07:01.020> use<00:07:01.230> the<00:07:01.410> chain<00:07:01.680> to<00:07:02.070> adjust<00:07:02.460> the

height here I don't really know the
benefit<00:07:05.460> of<00:07:05.490> leaving<00:07:05.910> the<00:07:06.060> light<00:07:06.240> on<00:07:06.390> 24<00:07:06.870> hours

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:07.140 
benefit of leaving the light on 24 hours

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.620 
benefit of leaving the light on 24 hours
a<00:07:07.170> day<00:07:07.260> but<00:07:08.130> maybe<00:07:08.430> maybe<00:07:08.910> you<00:07:09.120> can<00:07:09.300> do<00:07:09.420> that

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:09.630 
a day but maybe maybe you can do that

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.540 
a day but maybe maybe you can do that
but<00:07:10.020> we<00:07:10.200> put<00:07:10.440> the<00:07:10.560> timer<00:07:10.800> on<00:07:10.920> to<00:07:11.160> save<00:07:11.340> some

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:11.550 
but we put the timer on to save some

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.870 
but we put the timer on to save some
energy<00:07:11.670> I<00:07:12.090> bet<00:07:12.930> they<00:07:13.080> need<00:07:13.260> to<00:07:13.350> sleep<00:07:13.560> I<00:07:14.160> don't

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:14.880 
energy I bet they need to sleep I don't

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.020 
energy I bet they need to sleep I don't
know<00:07:14.970> if<00:07:15.060> plants<00:07:15.390> sleep<00:07:15.660> I<00:07:15.900> think<00:07:16.880> they<00:07:17.880> need

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:18.030 
know if plants sleep I think they need

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:18.560 
know if plants sleep I think they need
some<00:07:18.060> time<00:07:18.360> off

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:18.570
