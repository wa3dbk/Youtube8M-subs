00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
week from week from today looks like

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.550 
week from week from today looks like
thickness<00:05:51.450> values<00:05:51.780> come<00:05:51.990> down<00:05:52.200> a<00:05:52.230> little<00:05:52.410> bit

again<00:05:52.830> as<00:05:52.950> another<00:05:53.220> surge<00:05:53.460> of<00:05:53.610> cold<00:05:53.760> air<00:05:53.940> drops

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
again as another surge of cold air drops

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.420 
again as another surge of cold air drops
in<00:05:54.420> here<00:05:54.570> so<00:05:54.780> heís<00:05:55.350> go<00:05:55.560> back<00:05:55.740> in<00:05:55.890> the<00:05:55.950> 40s<00:05:56.370> and

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430
