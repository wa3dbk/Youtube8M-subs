00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:22.240 

this<00:04:18.049> one<00:04:18.290> heads<00:04:19.359> it's<00:04:20.359> hard<00:04:20.540> about<00:04:21.250> very

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
this one heads it's hard about very

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.820

strong<00:04:23.170> dark<00:04:24.170> cocoa<00:04:24.770> flavor<00:04:26.080> um<00:04:27.080> I'd<00:04:27.530> say<00:04:27.560> the

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
strong dark cocoa flavor um I'd say the

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.850 
strong dark cocoa flavor um I'd say the
percentage<00:04:28.190> is<00:04:28.580> about<00:04:30.130> 60%<00:04:31.130> cacao<00:04:32.230> and<00:04:33.230> as<00:04:33.710> you

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
percentage is about 60% cacao and as you

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.780 
percentage is about 60% cacao and as you
know<00:04:34.010> the<00:04:34.190> higher<00:04:34.400> the<00:04:35.360> percentage<00:04:36.790> the

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
know the higher the percentage the

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.300 
know the higher the percentage the
stronger<00:04:38.210> the<00:04:38.330> chocolate<00:04:38.720> flavor<00:04:39.100> the<00:04:40.100> less

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
stronger the chocolate flavor the less

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.880 
stronger the chocolate flavor the less
sugar<00:04:40.820> and<00:04:42.490> generally<00:04:43.720> there<00:04:44.720> is<00:04:44.840> no<00:04:45.110> milk<00:04:45.530> or

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
sugar and generally there is no milk or

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:51.720 
sugar and generally there is no milk or
milk<00:04:46.040> fat<00:04:46.930> okay<00:04:47.930> let's<00:04:48.590> move<00:04:48.770> on<00:04:49.180> to<00:04:50.180> this<00:04:50.450> one

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
milk fat okay let's move on to this one

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.700 
milk fat okay let's move on to this one
this<00:04:52.730> one<00:04:52.970> doesn't<00:04:53.420> really<00:04:53.630> have<00:04:53.930> much<00:04:53.960> of

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
this one doesn't really have much of

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.490 
this one doesn't really have much of
sound<00:04:55.360> when<00:04:56.360> you<00:04:56.450> break<00:04:56.690> it<00:04:57.130> as<00:04:58.130> opposed<00:04:58.520> to

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
sound when you break it as opposed to

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.690 
sound when you break it as opposed to
the<00:05:00.500> first<00:05:00.740> chocolate<00:05:01.040> that<00:05:01.400> we<00:05:01.550> tried<00:05:03.700> which

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
the first chocolate that we tried which

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.159 
the first chocolate that we tried which
had<00:05:04.970> a<00:05:05.000> bit<00:05:05.360> more<00:05:05.630> snap<00:05:06.410> to<00:05:06.680> it<00:05:07.810> so<00:05:08.810> let's<00:05:08.960> go

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
had a bit more snap to it so let's go

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:14.680 
had a bit more snap to it so let's go
ahead<00:05:09.260> and<00:05:09.610> smell<00:05:10.610> this<00:05:10.700> one<00:05:13.510> smells<00:05:14.510> like

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
ahead and smell this one smells like

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.659 
ahead and smell this one smells like
calm<00:05:15.380> and<00:05:17.050> then<00:05:18.050> maybe<00:05:18.320> a<00:05:18.800> little<00:05:19.310> bit<00:05:19.520> of

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
calm and then maybe a little bit of

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.190 
calm and then maybe a little bit of
fruitiness<00:05:20.210> as<00:05:20.720> well<00:05:20.990> a<00:05:21.350> lot<00:05:21.740> of<00:05:21.770> chocolate

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
fruitiness as well a lot of chocolate

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.680 
fruitiness as well a lot of chocolate
tends<00:05:24.200> to<00:05:24.440> have<00:05:24.650> a<00:05:25.130> fruity<00:05:25.760> undertone<00:05:26.390> to<00:05:26.570> it

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
tends to have a fruity undertone to it

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.469 
tends to have a fruity undertone to it
especially<00:05:27.560> when<00:05:28.040> it's<00:05:28.190> this<00:05:28.400> dark<00:05:28.729> let's

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
especially when it's this dark let's

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:38.309 
especially when it's this dark let's
give<00:05:29.660> it<00:05:29.690> a<00:05:29.870> try<00:05:32.950> hmm<00:05:34.330> interesting

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:38.319 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:43.869 

um<00:05:39.319> I<00:05:40.240> definitely<00:05:41.240> do<00:05:41.870> detect<00:05:42.879> fruitiness

00:05:43.869 --> 00:05:43.879 
um I definitely do detect fruitiness

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:50.170 
um I definitely do detect fruitiness
sort<00:05:44.629> of<00:05:44.720> like<00:05:44.900> a<00:05:44.930> raisin<00:05:45.289> taste<00:05:49.180> this

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
sort of like a raisin taste this

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:56.580 
sort of like a raisin taste this
chocolate<00:05:50.539> is<00:05:51.039> from<00:05:52.039> South<00:05:52.310> America<00:05:54.970> it<00:05:55.970> is

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
chocolate is from South America it is

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.089 
chocolate is from South America it is
75%<00:05:57.590> cacao<00:05:58.419> so<00:05:59.419> it<00:05:59.539> has<00:05:59.659> a<00:05:59.690> very<00:05:59.810> high<00:06:00.259> cacao

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:01.099 
75% cacao so it has a very high cacao

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:06.460 
75% cacao so it has a very high cacao
content<00:06:02.050> and<00:06:03.050> a<00:06:03.169> slight<00:06:03.470> bitterness<00:06:05.289> it<00:06:06.289> also

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470 
content and a slight bitterness it also

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.350 
content and a slight bitterness it also
has<00:06:06.800> some<00:06:08.199> acidity<00:06:09.199> at<00:06:09.440> the<00:06:09.560> end<00:06:09.710> a<00:06:10.099> nice<00:06:11.090> bite

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
has some acidity at the end a nice bite

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.399 
has some acidity at the end a nice bite
to<00:06:11.569> it<00:06:12.340> and<00:06:13.340> the<00:06:14.240> characteristic<00:06:15.020> fruitiness

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:15.409 
to it and the characteristic fruitiness

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:19.779 
to it and the characteristic fruitiness
as<00:06:15.800> well<00:06:16.120> some<00:06:17.120> people<00:06:17.240> don't<00:06:17.539> like<00:06:17.750> that<00:06:18.789> what

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:19.789 
as well some people don't like that what

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:24.330 
as well some people don't like that what
do<00:06:19.909> you<00:06:20.000> think<00:06:20.180> about<00:06:20.389> it<00:06:22.150> you<00:06:23.150> like<00:06:23.330> it<00:06:23.360> I

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
do you think about it you like it I

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.520 
do you think about it you like it I
agree<00:06:25.340> it's<00:06:25.819> definitely<00:06:26.449> an<00:06:26.840> intense<00:06:27.259> bite

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:27.530 
agree it's definitely an intense bite

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.779 
agree it's definitely an intense bite
but<00:06:27.860> I<00:06:28.159> think<00:06:29.060> it's<00:06:29.180> good<00:06:30.069> now<00:06:31.069> we<00:06:31.129> have<00:06:31.400> one

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:31.789 
but I think it's good now we have one

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:46.490 
but I think it's good now we have one
more<00:06:31.969> to<00:06:32.120> try<00:06:37.960> let's<00:06:38.960> go<00:06:39.169> ahead<00:06:39.229> and<00:06:39.440> try

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:51.570 

this<00:06:47.500> one<00:06:47.740> smells<00:06:48.610> and<00:06:49.060> tastes<00:06:49.479> sweeter<00:06:50.580> than

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:51.580 
this one smells and tastes sweeter than

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.159 
this one smells and tastes sweeter than
the<00:06:51.729> other<00:06:51.910> wants<00:06:52.180> to<00:06:52.240> be<00:06:52.330> tried<00:06:53.010> um<00:06:54.010> I<00:06:55.169> think

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:56.169 
the other wants to be tried um I think

00:06:56.169 --> 00:06:59.939 
the other wants to be tried um I think
it<00:06:56.440> has<00:06:56.680> vanilla<00:06:57.160> notes<00:06:57.870> and<00:06:58.870> maybe<00:06:59.650> some

00:06:59.939 --> 00:06:59.949 
it has vanilla notes and maybe some

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:03.540 
it has vanilla notes and maybe some
flowery<00:07:00.460> notes<00:07:00.820> as<00:07:01.030> well<00:07:02.310> certainly<00:07:03.310> rather

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:03.550 
flowery notes as well certainly rather

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:04.439 
flowery notes as well certainly rather
than<00:07:03.729> wild

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:04.449 
than wild

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:07.740 
than wild
I<00:07:05.190> believe<00:07:06.190> the<00:07:06.340> percentage<00:07:06.850> on<00:07:07.000> this<00:07:07.210> is<00:07:07.479> a

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:07.750 
I believe the percentage on this is a

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:16.379 
I believe the percentage on this is a
50%<00:07:09.090> cacao<00:07:11.340> so<00:07:12.340> it's<00:07:12.490> not<00:07:12.669> very<00:07:12.880> strong<00:07:15.210> but<00:07:16.210> it

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:16.389 
50% cacao so it's not very strong but it

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:19.340 
50% cacao so it's not very strong but it
has<00:07:16.510> a<00:07:16.539> really<00:07:16.810> nice<00:07:17.050> round<00:07:17.410> flavor<00:07:17.940> it's<00:07:18.940> got

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:19.350 
has a really nice round flavor it's got

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.529 
has a really nice round flavor it's got
nice<00:07:20.350> notes<00:07:20.650> of<00:07:20.889> vanilla<00:07:20.979> I<00:07:21.550> think<00:07:22.240> this<00:07:22.389> would

00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:22.539 
nice notes of vanilla I think this would

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:24.150 
nice notes of vanilla I think this would
be<00:07:22.570> really<00:07:22.720> good<00:07:23.139> chocolate<00:07:23.590> to<00:07:23.770> use<00:07:23.889> for

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.160 
be really good chocolate to use for

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:36.469 
be really good chocolate to use for
baking<00:07:26.130> I'm<00:07:27.130> gonna<00:07:27.280> grab<00:07:27.490> some<00:07:27.520> water<00:07:27.970> here<00:07:28.330> I

00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:36.479 

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:38.700 

really<00:07:37.479> hope<00:07:37.660> you<00:07:37.810> enjoyed<00:07:38.139> our<00:07:38.169> chocolate
