a safety I've always been taught to go

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.459 
a safety I've always been taught to go
to<00:00:47.850> quarterbacks<00:00:48.510> launch<00:00:48.840> point<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.379> know

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
to quarterbacks launch point you know

step<00:00:51.329> drop<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:52.170> go<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.500> point<00:00:52.920> where<00:00:52.980> you're

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
step drop you go to a point where you're

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.470 
step drop you go to a point where you're
going<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.399> pressure<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.789> quarterback<00:00:54.000> and

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
going to pressure the quarterback and

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.380 
going to pressure the quarterback and
when<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.620> have<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.190> game<00:00:56.520> blitzing<00:00:57.059> corners

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
when you have this game blitzing corners

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.450 
when you have this game blitzing corners
and<00:00:57.510> safeties<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:58.620> really<00:00:58.949> like<00:00:59.250> they're

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
and safeties it's really like they're

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.729 
and safeties it's really like they're
geared<00:00:59.910> toward<00:01:00.300> going<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:01.050> where<00:01:01.379> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
geared toward going to where the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.310 
geared toward going to where the
protection<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.460> mean<00:01:02.670> Gilbert<00:01:03.030> runs<00:01:03.359> right

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
protection is I mean Gilbert runs right

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.590 
protection is I mean Gilbert runs right
into<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:05.189> fullback<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.880> I'm<00:01:06.270> not<00:01:06.420> going<00:01:06.540> to

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
into this fullback and I'm not going to

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.969 
into this fullback and I'm not going to
say<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.080> full-back<00:01:07.439> maybe<00:01:07.710> couldn't

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
say that the full-back maybe couldn't

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.679 
say that the full-back maybe couldn't
have<00:01:08.100> picked<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.369> block<00:01:08.670> up<00:01:08.850> anyway<00:01:09.210> but

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
have picked this block up anyway but

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.330 
have picked this block up anyway but
look<00:01:09.869> at<00:01:09.990> how<00:01:10.110> unnatural<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.860> looks<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.310> mean

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
look at how unnatural this looks I mean

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.640 
look at how unnatural this looks I mean
just<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.909> positioning<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.600> him<00:01:12.810> where<00:01:13.380> his

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
just the positioning of him where his

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.200 
just the positioning of him where his
head<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.010> looking<00:01:14.580> directly<00:01:14.820> at<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
head is looking directly at the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.630 
head is looking directly at the
quarterback<00:01:15.540> but<00:01:15.869> his<00:01:16.020> body<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.680> slanted

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
quarterback but his body is slanted

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.149 
quarterback but his body is slanted
toward<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.970> full-back<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.979> even<00:01:19.979> more

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
toward the full-back and even more

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.730 
toward the full-back and even more
frustrating<00:01:20.790> as<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> gamer<00:01:21.479> when<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.350> look<00:01:22.590> at

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
we're going to talk about in a second

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.050 
we're going to talk about in a second
when<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.659> see<00:01:27.869> how<00:01:28.020> close<00:01:28.520> this<00:01:29.520> linebacker

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
when you see how close this linebacker

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.660

block the core and it's again it's
really<00:01:42.240> what<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.479> corner<00:01:42.810> blocking<00:01:43.229> himself

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
really what the corner blocking himself

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.980 
really what the corner blocking himself
more<00:01:44.280> than<00:01:44.430> anything<00:01:44.610> else<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.630> ball<00:01:45.869> is

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
more than anything else so the ball is

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.300 
more than anything else so the ball is
thrown<00:01:46.170> obviously<00:01:46.649> over<00:01:46.860> where<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.070> pressure

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
thrown obviously over where the pressure

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.830 
thrown obviously over where the pressure
comes<00:01:47.640> from<00:01:47.880> which<00:01:48.000> is<00:01:48.030> an<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.450> know<00:01:48.570> great

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
comes from which is an you know great

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.539 
comes from which is an you know great
concept<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.470> football<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.070> know<00:01:50.340> Owen

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
concept in football you know Owen

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.039 
concept in football you know Owen
Daniels<00:01:50.880> catches<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.540> but<00:01:51.659> let's<00:01:51.840> talk<00:01:51.990> about

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
Daniels catches it but let's talk about

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.389 
Daniels catches it but let's talk about
the<00:01:52.350> physics<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.040> there<00:01:53.130> bring<00:01:53.280> the

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
the physics of this and there bring the

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.609 
the physics of this and there bring the
box<00:01:53.640> back<00:01:53.880> up<00:01:54.060> again<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.899> know<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.229> basically

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
box back up again you know I basically

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.289 
box back up again you know I basically
take<00:01:56.009> control<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.430> corner<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.850> I'm<00:01:56.969> going

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
take control the corner and I'm going

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.120 
take control the corner and I'm going
for<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.509> hit<00:01:57.659> steak<00:01:57.840> because<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.229> know<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:59.009> I've

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
for a hit steak because I know that I've

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.740 
for a hit steak because I know that I've
got<00:01:59.280> assistance<00:01:59.610> coming<00:02:00.119> from<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.390> side<00:02:00.570> with

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
got assistance coming from the side with

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.010 
got assistance coming from the side with
Gibson<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.320> this<00:02:02.130> game<00:02:02.399> physics<00:02:03.000> wise<00:02:03.390> really

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
Gibson and this game physics wise really

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.100 
Gibson and this game physics wise really
has<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.259> dependency<00:02:04.979> on<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.460> first<00:02:05.850> impact<00:02:06.570> or

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
has a dependency on that first impact or

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.779 
has a dependency on that first impact or
whatever<00:02:07.500> impact<00:02:07.979> it's<00:02:08.160> going<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.340> register

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
whatever impact it's going to register

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.880 
whatever impact it's going to register
you<00:02:08.910> don't<00:02:09.060> have<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.390> dynamic<00:02:10.050> double<00:02:10.709> hit

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
you don't have that dynamic double hit

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.050 
you don't have that dynamic double hit
tackling<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.459> this<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:11.700> another<00:02:11.940> great

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
tackling and this is another great

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.150 
tackling and this is another great
example<00:02:12.300> where

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
example where

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.010 
example where
you<00:02:13.220> know<00:02:13.340> Daniels<00:02:13.790> is<00:02:13.910> going<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.150> come<00:02:14.330> in<00:02:14.510> I'm

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
you know Daniels is going to come in I'm

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.570 
you know Daniels is going to come in I'm
gonna<00:02:15.200> use<00:02:15.440> your<00:02:15.560> control<00:02:15.950> and<00:02:15.980> I'm<00:02:16.160> gonna<00:02:16.310> try

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
gonna use your control and I'm gonna try

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.400 
gonna use your control and I'm gonna try
to<00:02:16.640> you<00:02:16.850> know<00:02:16.880> make<00:02:17.240> a<00:02:17.300> play<00:02:17.600> forsyth<00:02:18.080> humble

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
to you know make a play forsyth humble

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.800 
to you know make a play forsyth humble
Buster<00:02:19.190> screen<00:02:19.520> is<00:02:19.730> not<00:02:20.000> respected<00:02:20.420> at<00:02:20.690> all

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
Buster screen is not respected at all

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.810 
Buster screen is not respected at all
because<00:02:21.170> obviously<00:02:21.830> you've<00:02:22.220> got<00:02:22.400> Gibson

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
because obviously you've got Gibson

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.000 
because obviously you've got Gibson
coming<00:02:23.060> over<00:02:23.240> from<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.450> side<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:24.110> basically

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
coming over from the side and basically

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.460 
coming over from the side and basically
Gibson's<00:02:25.910> hit<00:02:26.180> is<00:02:26.420> all<00:02:26.660> that<00:02:27.080> matters<00:02:27.200> you

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
Gibson's hit is all that matters you

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.100 
Gibson's hit is all that matters you
know<00:02:27.500> wait<00:02:28.060> momentum<00:02:29.060> positioning<00:02:29.960> it

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
know wait momentum positioning it

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.100 
know wait momentum positioning it
doesn't<00:02:30.470> matter<00:02:30.650> my<00:02:31.400> hit<00:02:32.000> doesn't<00:02:32.810> even

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
doesn't matter my hit doesn't even

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.320 
doesn't matter my hit doesn't even
impact<00:02:33.710> him<00:02:33.920> I<00:02:34.070> basically<00:02:34.340> just<00:02:34.610> crumble<00:02:35.210> to

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
impact him I basically just crumble to

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.660 
impact him I basically just crumble to
the<00:02:35.360> ground<00:02:35.480> actually<00:02:36.230> as<00:02:36.380> Gibson<00:02:37.010> pushes<00:02:37.520> him

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
the ground actually as Gibson pushes him

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.010 
the ground actually as Gibson pushes him
off<00:02:37.790> and<00:02:37.970> is<00:02:38.090> this<00:02:38.240> the<00:02:38.300> end<00:02:38.420> of<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.690> world<00:02:38.810> on

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
off and is this the end of the world on

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.320 
off and is this the end of the world on
the<00:02:39.110> plate<00:02:39.320> not<00:02:39.950> really<00:02:40.310> i<00:02:40.460> mean<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.940> tackle

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
the plate not really i mean the tackle

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.090 
the plate not really i mean the tackle
got<00:02:41.450> made<00:02:41.690> probably<00:02:41.990> will<00:02:42.500> where<00:02:42.860> it<00:02:42.950> would

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
got made probably will where it would

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.410 
got made probably will where it would
have<00:02:43.220> been<00:02:43.310> anyway<00:02:43.640> but<00:02:44.090> these<00:02:44.210> are

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
have been anyway but these are

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.510 
have been anyway but these are
situations<00:02:44.600> where<00:02:45.200> we<00:02:45.350> should<00:02:45.530> have<00:02:45.710> two

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
situations where we should have two

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.130 
situations where we should have two
defenders<00:02:46.940> against<00:02:47.240> one<00:02:47.480> offensive<00:02:47.900> player

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
defenders against one offensive player

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.140 
defenders against one offensive player
and<00:02:48.290> it<00:02:48.380> just<00:02:48.620> does<00:02:48.830> not<00:02:49.100> happen<00:02:49.460> on<00:02:50.090> a

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
and it just does not happen on a

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.090 
and it just does not happen on a
consistent<00:02:50.570> basis<00:02:51.200> so<00:02:51.380> loved<00:02:51.890> it<00:02:51.980> are<00:02:52.070> you

want to bring up I've seen this several
times<00:02:57.350> in<00:02:57.920> this<00:02:58.460> game<00:02:58.700> various<00:02:59.450> players<00:02:59.780> why

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
times in this game various players why

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.500 
times in this game various players why
do<00:03:00.590> we<00:03:00.770> have<00:03:00.920> player<00:03:01.310> models<00:03:01.760> like<00:03:01.910> this<00:03:02.150> where

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
do we have player models like this where

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.980 
do we have player models like this where
if<00:03:02.780> you<00:03:03.200> take<00:03:03.380> a<00:03:03.410> look<00:03:03.680> at<00:03:03.800> the<00:03:03.890> uniform<00:03:04.660> why<00:03:05.660> is

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
if you take a look at the uniform why is

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.140 
if you take a look at the uniform why is
his<00:03:06.500> jersey<00:03:07.220> this<00:03:07.370> way<00:03:07.580> I<00:03:07.730> mean<00:03:07.880> if<00:03:08.000> we're

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
his jersey this way I mean if we're

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.240 
his jersey this way I mean if we're
talking<00:03:08.300> about<00:03:08.630> a<00:03:08.750> next-gen<00:03:09.290> console<00:03:09.860> why

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
talking about a next-gen console why

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.160 
talking about a next-gen console why
can't<00:03:10.520> I<00:03:10.580> look<00:03:10.610> down<00:03:11.120> a<00:03:11.150> complete<00:03:11.750> line<00:03:12.140> of

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
can't I look down a complete line of

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.250 
can't I look down a complete line of
dirt<00:03:13.160> and<00:03:13.190> clean<00:03:13.640> on<00:03:13.910> his<00:03:14.330> uniform<00:03:14.660> doesn't

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
dirt and clean on his uniform doesn't

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.320
