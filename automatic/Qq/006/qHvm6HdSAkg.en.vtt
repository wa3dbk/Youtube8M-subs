hey it's mr. Brown following with
another<00:00:05.310> gas<00:00:06.270> powered<00:00:06.660> bicycle<00:00:06.870> video<00:00:07.760> and

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:09.769 
another gas powered bicycle video and

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.669 
another gas powered bicycle video and
these<00:00:10.769> are<00:00:10.980> some<00:00:11.219> tips<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.940> tricks<00:00:12.210> on<00:00:12.679> this

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
these are some tips and tricks on this

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.169 
these are some tips and tricks on this
stuff<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.099> make<00:00:14.219> it<00:00:14.400> better<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.790> work<00:00:15.150> better

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
stuff to make it better and work better

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.050 
stuff to make it better and work better
and<00:00:15.839> run<00:00:16.109> better<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.500> everything<00:00:17.039> once<00:00:17.850> you

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
and run better and everything once you

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.109 
and run better and everything once you
already<00:00:18.210> have<00:00:18.890> it<00:00:19.890> built<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.359> so<00:00:23.090> some<00:00:24.090> of

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
already have it built and so some of

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.300 
already have it built and so some of
these<00:00:24.630> things<00:00:24.869> are<00:00:25.170> performance<00:00:25.680> parts<00:00:26.010> and

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
these things are performance parts and

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.240 
these things are performance parts and
you<00:00:26.400> have<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.609> buy<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.230> I<00:00:28.230> don't<00:00:28.859> have

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
suggest depends on what my old bike you

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.490 
suggest depends on what my old bike you
have<00:01:36.000> because<00:01:37.000> they're<00:01:37.540> all<00:01:37.660> different<00:01:37.900> sizes

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.660 

would<00:02:35.340> say<00:02:35.580> just<00:02:35.790> in<00:02:36.239> my<00:02:36.480> last<00:02:37.349> video<00:02:37.769> I<00:02:38.099> got

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
would say just in my last video I got

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.910 
would say just in my last video I got
sitting<00:02:38.940> there<00:02:39.120> take<00:02:40.019> apart<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.620> exhaust
