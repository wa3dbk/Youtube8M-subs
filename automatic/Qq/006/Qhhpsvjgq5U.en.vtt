00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
here today I'm gonna be reviewing the

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.809 
here today I'm gonna be reviewing the
dxracer<00:00:03.659> chair<00:00:04.009> I've<00:00:05.009> been<00:00:05.220> using<00:00:05.370> this<00:00:05.580> chair

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
dxracer chair I've been using this chair

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.089 
dxracer chair I've been using this chair
for<00:00:06.029> a<00:00:06.060> while<00:00:06.210> and<00:00:06.569> it<00:00:06.720> is<00:00:06.750> absolutely<00:00:07.560> amazing

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
for a while and it is absolutely amazing

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.280 
for a while and it is absolutely amazing
so<00:00:08.700> on<00:00:08.849> to<00:00:09.000> make<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:09.150> review<00:00:09.540> about<00:00:09.570> it<00:00:09.809> so<00:00:10.260> I

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
so on to make a review about it so I

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.360 
so on to make a review about it so I
guess<00:00:10.349> we<00:00:10.650> should<00:00:10.679> start<00:00:10.889> at<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.250> beginning

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
guess we should start at the beginning

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.370 
guess we should start at the beginning
so<00:00:12.059> right<00:00:12.509> here<00:00:12.690> where<00:00:12.809> you<00:00:12.870> guys<00:00:12.990> are<00:00:13.139> seeing

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
so right here where you guys are seeing

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.470 
so right here where you guys are seeing
is<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.980> package<00:00:14.490> that<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:14.730> received<00:00:15.299> and

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
is a package that I received and

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.510 
is a package that I received and
everything<00:00:15.990> was<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.590> they're<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.400> reason

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
everything was and they're the reason

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.310 
everything was and they're the reason
why<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:17.850> don't<00:00:17.970> have<00:00:18.390> video<00:00:18.570> footage<00:00:18.900> is

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
why I don't have video footage is

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.220 
why I don't have video footage is
because<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.890> have<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.430> DSLR<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.930> doesn't

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
because I have a DSLR and it doesn't

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.570 
because I have a DSLR and it doesn't
have<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.380> lot<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.619> focus<00:00:22.800> it's<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.279> little<00:00:23.490> bit

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
have a lot of focus it's a little bit

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.519 
have a lot of focus it's a little bit
hard<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:23.910> record<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.630> put<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:25.080> chair<00:00:25.350> together

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
hard to record and put a chair together

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.009 
hard to record and put a chair together
so<00:00:26.279> that's<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.580> reason<00:00:26.910> why<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.090> took<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.810> whole

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
so that's the reason why I took a whole

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.570 
so that's the reason why I took a whole
bunch<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.349> photos<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.189> would<00:00:29.340> like<00:00:29.429> to

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
bunch of photos and I would like to

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.519 
bunch of photos and I would like to
mention<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.119> thought<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.990> would<00:00:31.140> take<00:00:31.380> me

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
mention that I thought it would take me

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.139 
mention that I thought it would take me
a<00:00:31.560> long<00:00:31.949> time<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.550> put<00:00:32.669> everything<00:00:32.759> together

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
a long time to put everything together

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.120 
a long time to put everything together
because<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.719> knew<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.020> came<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.380> pieces<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:35.040> was

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
because I knew it came in pieces I was

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.340 
because I knew it came in pieces I was
like<00:00:35.309> oh<00:00:35.489> no<00:00:35.600> I'm<00:00:36.600> gonna<00:00:36.809> be<00:00:36.960> here<00:00:37.140> forever

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
like oh no I'm gonna be here forever

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.069 
like oh no I'm gonna be here forever
however<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.280> whole<00:00:38.550> thing<00:00:38.940> it's<00:00:39.239> like<00:00:39.390> seven

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
however the whole thing it's like seven

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.410 
however the whole thing it's like seven
or<00:00:40.230> eight<00:00:40.290> steps<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.850> literally<00:00:42.270> had

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
or eight steps and I literally had

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.560 
or eight steps and I literally had
everything<00:00:43.079> done<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.950> about<00:00:44.100> 15<00:00:44.969> minutes<00:00:45.360> and

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
everything done in about 15 minutes and

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.869 
everything done in about 15 minutes and
this<00:00:45.750> included<00:00:46.350> me<00:00:46.559> stopping<00:00:47.160> at<00:00:47.309> every<00:00:47.430> step

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
this included me stopping at every step

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.510 
this included me stopping at every step
and<00:00:48.120> taking<00:00:48.690> photos<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.200> my<00:00:49.350> process<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.190> I

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
and taking photos of my process and I

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.670 
and taking photos of my process and I
thought<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.120> was<00:00:51.239> really<00:00:51.600> easily<00:00:52.110> for<00:00:52.170> someone

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
thought it was really easily for someone

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.139 
thought it was really easily for someone
that<00:00:52.800> doesn't<00:00:53.039> really<00:00:53.309> put<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.730> lot<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.030> things

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
that doesn't really put a lot of things

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.850 
that doesn't really put a lot of things
together<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.629> here's<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.230> entries<00:00:55.530> all<00:00:55.710> the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.640 
in here these things are bottom extra
they're<00:03:46.910> like<00:03:47.090> wood<00:03:47.510> and<00:03:47.870> some<00:03:48.260> padding
