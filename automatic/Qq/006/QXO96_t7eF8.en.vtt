00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
one it's called a v-mon because he was

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.660 
one it's called a v-mon because he was
one<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:16.920> my<00:01:17.070> favorites<00:01:17.400> growing<00:01:17.700> up<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:19.670> so

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
one of my favorites growing up so so

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.880 
one of my favorites growing up so so
yeah<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.659> know<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.320> from<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.530> American

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
yeah I know this from the American

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.260 
yeah I know this from the American
version<00:01:23.009> because<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.430> played<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> little<00:01:23.970> bit

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
version because I played a little bit

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.700 
version because I played a little bit
but<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.570> thought<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.020> was<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> little<00:01:25.470> too

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
but I thought it was a little too

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.800 
but I thought it was a little too
pay2win<00:01:26.340> but<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:26.759> Korean<00:01:27.119> version<00:01:27.420> seems<00:01:27.659> a

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
pay2win but this Korean version seems a

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.960 
pay2win but this Korean version seems a
lot<00:01:27.990> more<00:01:28.020> balanced<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.400> economy<00:01:29.880> isn't

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
lot more balanced and the economy isn't

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.450 
lot more balanced and the economy isn't
much<00:01:30.360> better

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
much better

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.270 
much better
so<00:01:32.460> I'm<00:01:32.549> gonna<00:01:32.670> see<00:01:32.880> what

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
so I'm gonna see what

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.169 
so I'm gonna see what
basically<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.399> starts<00:01:35.460> out<00:01:35.729> with<00:01:35.789> a<00:01:35.909> bunch<00:01:36.090> of

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179 
basically it starts out with a bunch of

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:37.789 
basically it starts out with a bunch of
free<00:01:36.479> space<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.320> wouldn't<00:01:37.560> give<00:01:37.649> the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
free space that you wouldn't give the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.090 
free space that you wouldn't give the
American<00:01:38.189> version<00:01:38.750> and<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:40.649> got<00:01:41.280> my<00:01:41.429> B<00:01:42.920> mark<00:01:43.920> I

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
American version and I got my B mark I
