lifting<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:45.550> sebum<00:02:46.120> attaches<00:02:47.080> to<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.710> hair

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
lifting the sebum attaches to the hair

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.180 
lifting the sebum attaches to the hair
follicle<00:02:48.610> so<00:02:49.540> that's<00:02:50.050> why<00:02:50.290> it's<00:02:50.560> important<00:02:51.040> to

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
follicle so that's why it's important to

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.670 
follicle so that's why it's important to
rinse<00:02:51.640> it<00:02:51.970> when<00:02:52.720> you're<00:02:52.840> doing<00:02:53.080> a<00:02:53.170> water<00:02:53.350> rinse

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
to rinse it with warm water I've been

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.680 
to rinse it with warm water I've been
doing<00:02:56.620> a<00:02:56.680> lot<00:02:56.800> of<00:02:56.860> reading<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.520> they<00:02:58.060> say<00:02:58.300> heat

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
doing a lot of reading and they say heat

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:05.040 
doing a lot of reading and they say heat
um<00:03:00.510> kind<00:03:01.510> of<00:03:01.690> activates<00:03:03.660> more<00:03:04.660> sebum

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
um kind of activates more sebum

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.770 
um kind of activates more sebum
production<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:07.590> but<00:03:08.590> with<00:03:08.860> that<00:03:09.780> they're

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
production and but with that they're

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.140 
production and but with that they're
kind<00:03:11.260> of<00:03:11.320> like<00:03:11.500> consequences<00:03:12.460> to<00:03:12.670> under

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
kind of like consequences to under

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.590 
kind of like consequences to under
production<00:03:13.360> and<00:03:14.080> overproduction

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
production and overproduction

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.590 
production and overproduction
overproduction<00:03:16.600> can<00:03:17.140> cause<00:03:17.380> acne

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
overproduction can cause acne

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.770 
overproduction can cause acne
overproduction<00:03:19.600> can<00:03:19.930> cause<00:03:20.640> bacterial

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
overproduction can cause bacterial

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.590 
overproduction can cause bacterial
bacteria<00:03:22.780> on<00:03:23.050> the<00:03:23.200> scalp<00:03:23.560> because<00:03:24.330> the<00:03:25.330> more

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
bacteria on the scalp because the more

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.040 
bacteria on the scalp because the more
