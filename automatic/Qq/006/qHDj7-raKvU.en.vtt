so our advice is douse it with water and

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:32.120 
so our advice is douse it with water and
use<00:01:30.149> it<00:01:30.299> safely<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:31.350> give<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.680> plenty<00:01:31.859> of<00:01:32.039> time

small fountain firework to some of the

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.990 
small fountain firework to some of the
more<00:03:47.420> aggressive<00:03:47.840> fireworks<00:03:48.670> like<00:03:49.670> this<00:03:49.819> one

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
more aggressive fireworks like this one

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.420

and bottle rockets this is fire founder

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.000 
and bottle rockets this is fire founder
Solich<00:03:59.390> and<00:03:59.690> as<00:03:59.870> I<00:04:00.020> mentioned<00:04:00.350> before<00:04:00.380> one<00:04:00.920> of

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
Solich and as I mentioned before one of

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.220 
Solich and as I mentioned before one of
the<00:04:01.070> dangers<00:04:01.370> with<00:04:01.550> sparklers<00:04:02.030> can<00:04:02.780> be<00:04:02.900> as<00:04:03.050> the

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
the dangers with sparklers can be as the

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.270 
the dangers with sparklers can be as the
children<00:04:03.530> are<00:04:03.620> running<00:04:03.710> around<00:04:03.950> with<00:04:04.160> them

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
children are running around with them

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.250 
children are running around with them
they<00:04:04.730> can<00:04:04.910> come<00:04:04.940> in<00:04:05.300> contact<00:04:05.390> with<00:04:05.750> clothing

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
they can come in contact with clothing

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.470 
they can come in contact with clothing
clothing<00:04:06.650> again<00:04:07.070> these<00:04:07.400> burn<00:04:07.640> at<00:04:07.760> about<00:04:07.940> 1,200

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
clothing again these burn at about 1,200

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.510 
clothing again these burn at about 1,200
degrees<00:04:08.570> Fahrenheit<00:04:09.320> and<00:04:09.470> how<00:04:09.980> quickly<00:04:10.220> can

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
degrees Fahrenheit and how quickly can

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:52.210 
degrees Fahrenheit and how quickly can
start<00:04:11.180> a<00:04:11.300> piece<00:04:11.690> of<00:04:11.840> clothing<00:04:12.080> on<00:04:12.380> fire

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.140 

ok<00:04:53.220> so<00:04:53.280> now<00:04:53.490> we're<00:04:53.580> going<00:04:53.610> to<00:04:53.760> light<00:04:53.910> off<00:04:54.030> a

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
ok so now we're going to light off a

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.720 
ok so now we're going to light off a
small<00:04:54.480> ground<00:04:54.780> shower<00:04:55.110> fireworks<00:04:55.740> but<00:04:56.460> we're

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
small ground shower fireworks but we're

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:57.710 
small ground shower fireworks but we're
going<00:04:56.820> to<00:04:56.910> take<00:04:57.030> a<00:04:57.060> look<00:04:57.270> at<00:04:57.360> it<00:04:57.480> through<00:04:57.570> our

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
going to take a look at it through our

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.120 
going to take a look at it through our
thermal-imaging<00:04:58.080> camera<00:04:58.620> to<00:04:58.740> see<00:04:58.860> what<00:04:58.980> kind

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
thermal-imaging camera to see what kind

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:08.510 
thermal-imaging camera to see what kind
of<00:04:59.160> temperature<00:04:59.550> reading<00:04:59.790> we're<00:04:59.910> getting<00:05:07.520> we

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
of temperature reading we're getting we

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.830 
of temperature reading we're getting we
were<00:05:08.550> able<00:05:08.760> to<00:05:08.910> record<00:05:09.180> temperatures<00:05:09.660> in

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
were able to record temperatures in

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.030 
were able to record temperatures in
excess<00:05:10.169> of<00:05:10.260> 300<00:05:10.590> degrees<00:05:12.410> so<00:05:13.410> here<00:05:13.560> I<00:05:13.590> have<00:05:13.680> a

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
excess of 300 degrees so here I have a

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.460 
excess of 300 degrees so here I have a
small<00:05:14.250> common<00:05:14.760> firework<00:05:15.090> that<00:05:15.240> explodes<00:05:15.690> so

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
small common firework that explodes so

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.260 
small common firework that explodes so
we're<00:05:16.620> going<00:05:16.710> to<00:05:16.800> demonstrate<00:05:16.979> now<00:05:17.280> is<00:05:17.430> what

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
we're going to demonstrate now is what

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.030 
we're going to demonstrate now is what
happens<00:05:18.300> if<00:05:18.810> you<00:05:19.080> had<00:05:19.410> the<00:05:19.560> fireworks<00:05:19.770> still

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
happens if you had the fireworks still

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.860 
happens if you had the fireworks still
in<00:05:20.160> your<00:05:20.250> hand<00:05:20.460> when<00:05:20.790> it<00:05:20.970> exploded<00:05:21.330> or<00:05:21.660> if<00:05:21.810> you

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
in your hand when it exploded or if you

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.210 
in your hand when it exploded or if you
thought<00:05:22.080> it<00:05:22.199> was<00:05:22.320> a<00:05:22.350> dud<00:05:22.620> you<00:05:22.770> went<00:05:22.949> to<00:05:23.040> pick<00:05:23.190> it

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
thought it was a dud you went to pick it

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:40.360 
thought it was a dud you went to pick it
up<00:05:23.400> but<00:05:23.760> it<00:05:23.910> exploded<00:05:24.389> in<00:05:24.479> your<00:05:24.600> hand

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.890 

as<00:05:41.370> you<00:05:41.550> can<00:05:41.700> see<00:05:41.850> this<00:05:42.300> did<00:05:42.510> quite<00:05:42.630> a<00:05:42.660> bit<00:05:42.810> of

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
as you can see this did quite a bit of

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.060 
as you can see this did quite a bit of
damage<00:05:43.050> to<00:05:43.170> the<00:05:43.350> Apple<00:05:43.620> there's<00:05:43.770> a<00:05:43.830> lot<00:05:43.980> of

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
damage to the Apple there's a lot of

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.640 
damage to the Apple there's a lot of
kinetic<00:05:44.340> energy<00:05:44.520> here<00:05:45.000> that<00:05:45.600> if<00:05:46.260> this<00:05:46.500> was

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
kinetic energy here that if this was

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:47.960 
kinetic energy here that if this was
still<00:05:46.800> in<00:05:46.920> your<00:05:47.040> hand<00:05:47.220> can<00:05:47.430> result<00:05:47.640> in<00:05:47.820> serious

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
still in your hand can result in serious

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.620 
still in your hand can result in serious
injury<00:05:48.480> finger<00:05:49.110> amputations<00:05:49.770> burns<00:05:50.580> just<00:05:50.970> be

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
injury finger amputations burns just be

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.240 
injury finger amputations burns just be
a<00:05:51.660> real<00:05:51.900> problem<00:05:52.110> if<00:05:52.380> you<00:05:52.440> if<00:05:52.800> this<00:05:52.950> were<00:05:53.070> to<00:05:53.160> go

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
a real problem if you if this were to go

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.970 
a real problem if you if this were to go
off<00:05:53.340> in<00:05:53.490> your<00:05:53.580> hands<00:05:54.350> thank<00:05:55.350> you<00:05:55.470> for<00:05:55.620> watching
