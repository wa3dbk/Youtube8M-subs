to test out this technology from space

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.490 
to test out this technology from space
all<00:03:20.980> our<00:03:21.310> calculations<00:03:21.870> indicated<00:03:22.870> that<00:03:23.260> this

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
all our calculations indicated that this

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.190 
all our calculations indicated that this
should<00:03:23.860> work<00:03:24.060> but<00:03:25.060> we<00:03:25.240> really<00:03:25.600> did<00:03:25.780> not<00:03:25.960> know

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
should work but we really did not know

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.650 
should work but we really did not know
before<00:03:26.530> we<00:03:27.130> switched<00:03:27.400> on<00:03:27.640> the<00:03:27.880> receiver<00:03:28.630> on

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660

the space station first of June 2010 the
system<00:03:33.310> was<00:03:33.580> turned<00:03:33.970> on<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:35.290> switch<00:03:35.950> was

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
system was turned on the switch was

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.790 
system was turned on the switch was
flipped<00:03:36.340> and<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:37.480> light<00:03:37.780> came<00:03:37.990> on<00:03:38.050> and<00:03:38.230> we

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
flipped and the light came on and we

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.070 
flipped and the light came on and we
were<00:03:38.860> actually<00:03:39.400> able<00:03:39.640> to<00:03:39.970> get<00:03:40.570> the<00:03:40.690> first<00:03:40.900> date

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
were actually able to get the first date

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.140 
were actually able to get the first date
in<00:03:41.230> yes<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:41.830> instrument<00:03:42.190> works<00:03:42.340> we<00:03:42.760> all<00:03:42.940> got

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
in yes the instrument works we all got

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.290 
in yes the instrument works we all got
very<00:03:43.600> excited<00:03:43.780> and<00:03:44.430> suddenly<00:03:45.430> we<00:03:45.610> can<00:03:45.760> see<00:03:45.970> a

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
very excited and suddenly we can see a

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.770 
very excited and suddenly we can see a
whole<00:03:47.200> world<00:03:47.440> full<00:03:47.560> of<00:03:47.709> shape<00:03:48.250> data<00:03:48.430> was<00:03:48.910> I

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
whole world full of shape data was I

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.930 
whole world full of shape data was I
would<00:03:50.080> say<00:03:50.200> a<00:03:50.230> quantum<00:03:50.739> leap<00:03:50.890> really<00:03:51.340> in<00:03:51.520> our

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
would say a quantum leap really in our

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.210 
would say a quantum leap really in our
ability<00:03:52.450> to<00:03:52.480> to<00:03:53.140> look<00:03:53.260> at<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.650> global<00:03:53.980> ship

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
ability to to look at the global ship

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.880 
ability to to look at the global ship
traffic<00:03:54.430> it's<00:03:54.970> like<00:03:55.180> a<00:03:55.209> blind<00:03:55.600> man<00:03:55.890> starting

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
traffic it's like a blind man starting

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.479 
traffic it's like a blind man starting
to<00:03:57.130> see<00:03:57.660> yeah<00:03:58.660> it<00:03:58.750> was<00:03:58.870> a<00:03:58.900> huge<00:03:59.530> relief<00:03:59.620> and

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
to see yeah it was a huge relief and

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.580 
to see yeah it was a huge relief and
great<00:04:00.700> satisfaction<00:04:00.910> to<00:04:01.360> see<00:04:01.600> so<00:04:02.410> this

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
great satisfaction to see so this

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.800 
great satisfaction to see so this
brought<00:04:02.920> a<00:04:03.130> whole<00:04:03.340> new<00:04:03.670> dimension<00:04:03.880> to<00:04:04.540> the

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
brought a whole new dimension to the

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.810 
brought a whole new dimension to the
monitoring<00:04:05.440> of<00:04:05.560> ship<00:04:05.800> traffic<00:04:06.100> on<00:04:06.459> the<00:04:06.550> open

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
monitoring of ship traffic on the open

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.290 
monitoring of ship traffic on the open
oceans<00:04:07.470> nobody<00:04:08.470> knew<00:04:08.920> how<00:04:09.610> many<00:04:09.670> ships<00:04:09.940> really

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
oceans nobody knew how many ships really

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.110 
oceans nobody knew how many ships really
are<00:04:10.360> out<00:04:10.510> there<00:04:10.690> at<00:04:10.870> any<00:04:10.959> given<00:04:11.320> time<00:04:11.530> and

are out there at any given time and

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.760 
are out there at any given time and
suddenly<00:04:13.120> we<00:04:13.270> had<00:04:13.450> if<00:04:14.080> not<00:04:14.320> the<00:04:14.470> complete

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
suddenly we had if not the complete

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.070 
suddenly we had if not the complete
picture<00:04:14.980> than<00:04:15.370> almost<00:04:15.970> complete<00:04:16.540> picture<00:04:16.750> and

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
picture than almost complete picture and

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.530 
picture than almost complete picture and
on<00:04:17.290> a<00:04:17.440> typical<00:04:17.560> day<00:04:17.919> the<00:04:18.640> space<00:04:18.880> station<00:04:19.359> is

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
on a typical day the space station is

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.710 
on a typical day the space station is
observing<00:04:20.260> about<00:04:20.830> thirty<00:04:21.400> thousand<00:04:22.240> ships

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
observing about thirty thousand ships

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.290 
observing about thirty thousand ships
out<00:04:23.020> on<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:23.470> open<00:04:23.560> ocean<00:04:23.910> our<00:04:24.910> kind<00:04:25.210> of

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
out on the open ocean our kind of

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.790 
out on the open ocean our kind of
overwhelmed<00:04:25.720> by<00:04:25.810> guest<00:04:26.020> by<00:04:26.169> the<00:04:26.200> responses<00:04:26.770> of

overwhelmed by guest by the responses of

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.470 
overwhelmed by guest by the responses of
the<00:04:27.190> space<00:04:27.400> station<00:04:27.430> really<00:04:27.910> is<00:04:28.120> an<00:04:28.240> excellent

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
the space station really is an excellent

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.790 
the space station really is an excellent
lab<00:04:28.750> for<00:04:29.140> testing<00:04:29.980> this<00:04:30.700> type<00:04:30.910> of<00:04:30.940> technology

lab for testing this type of technology
this<00:04:32.800> project<00:04:33.340> demonstrates<00:04:33.610> that<00:04:34.330> the

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
this project demonstrates that the

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.380 
this project demonstrates that the
International<00:04:35.380> Space<00:04:35.530> Station<00:04:36.220> is<00:04:36.730> not<00:04:37.060> just

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
International Space Station is not just

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.980 
International Space Station is not just
for<00:04:37.450> science<00:04:38.080> and<00:04:38.290> astronauts<00:04:39.210> but<00:04:40.210> it<00:04:40.540> really

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
for science and astronauts but it really

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.500 
for science and astronauts but it really
benefits<00:04:41.530> the<00:04:42.250> whole<00:04:42.490> mankind<00:04:42.760> with

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
benefits the whole mankind with

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:51.060 
benefits the whole mankind with
down-to-earth<00:04:44.020> applications
