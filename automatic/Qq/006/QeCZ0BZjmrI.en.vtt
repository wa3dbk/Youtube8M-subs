the
and<00:01:51.180> we're<00:01:51.540> still<00:01:51.720> seeing<00:01:51.990> continuous<00:01:52.800> rises

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
and we're still seeing continuous rises

in<00:01:53.580> salary<00:01:54.030> for<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.050> administration<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:56.460> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
in salary for the administration in the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.010 
in salary for the administration in the
past<00:01:56.820> ten<00:01:57.210> years<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.780> think<00:01:59.630> the<00:02:00.630> number<00:02:00.930> of

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
past ten years I think the number of

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.690 
past ten years I think the number of
administrators<00:02:01.560> at<00:02:01.740> PSU<00:02:02.160> has<00:02:02.190> gone<00:02:02.580> up

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
administrators at PSU has gone up

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.390 
administrators at PSU has gone up
sixty-five<00:02:03.450> percent<00:02:03.750> while<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.800> average<00:02:05.160> pay

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
sixty-five percent while the average pay

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.100 
sixty-five percent while the average pay
for<00:02:05.640> administrators<00:02:06.150> has<00:02:06.450> gone<00:02:06.630> up<00:02:06.750> something

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
for administrators has gone up something

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.669 
for administrators has gone up something
like<00:02:07.260> 32<00:02:07.740> or<00:02:08.250> 37<00:02:09.000> percent<00:02:09.390> yet<00:02:10.320> the<00:02:10.440> average

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
like 32 or 37 percent yet the average

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:17.270 
like 32 or 37 percent yet the average
pay<00:02:10.890> for<00:02:11.100> a<00:02:11.130> faculty<00:02:11.370> member<00:02:11.610> has<00:02:11.970> shrunk<00:02:16.280> I

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
pay for a faculty member has shrunk I

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.250 
pay for a faculty member has shrunk I
think<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.670> most<00:02:17.790> emblematic<00:02:18.080> example<00:02:19.080> is

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
think the most emblematic example is

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.010 
think the most emblematic example is
this<00:02:19.920> thing<00:02:20.100> called<00:02:20.400> article<00:02:20.820> 44<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.570> faculty

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
this thing called article 44 the faculty

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.780 
this thing called article 44 the faculty
proposed<00:02:22.380> it<00:02:22.620> was<00:02:22.709> new<00:02:22.860> contract<00:02:23.489> language

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
proposed it was new contract language
