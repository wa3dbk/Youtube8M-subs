00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.760 
very surprised that it did not seem like
it<00:05:59.580> was<00:05:59.729> that<00:05:59.880> long<00:06:00.229> and<00:06:01.229> even<00:06:01.650> though<00:06:01.740> I

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
it was that long and even though I

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.980 
it was that long and even though I
didn't<00:06:02.099> understand<00:06:02.669> the<00:06:02.789> language<00:06:02.969> I<00:06:03.479> can

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
didn't understand the language I can

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.180 
didn't understand the language I can
still<00:06:04.169> follow<00:06:04.349> along<00:06:04.500> with<00:06:04.800> it<00:06:04.889> I<00:06:04.949> mean<00:06:05.070> it's

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
still follow along with it I mean it's

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.279 
still follow along with it I mean it's
not<00:06:05.340> for<00:06:05.460> action<00:06:05.789> sequences<00:06:06.389> that<00:06:07.080> you<00:06:07.139> don't

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:07.289 
not for action sequences that you don't

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:09.379 
not for action sequences that you don't
have<00:06:07.349> to<00:06:07.440> really<00:06:07.590> worry<00:06:07.650> about<00:06:07.889> that<00:06:08.099> and<00:06:08.490> I

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:09.389 
have to really worry about that and I

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:11.510 
have to really worry about that and I
mean<00:06:09.509> it<00:06:09.659> just<00:06:09.949> seems<00:06:10.949> out<00:06:11.070> of<00:06:11.130> this<00:06:11.280> movie

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
mean it just seems out of this movie

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.589 
mean it just seems out of this movie
that<00:06:11.610> just<00:06:11.820> reminded<00:06:12.330> me<00:06:12.360> of<00:06:12.449> the<00:06:12.539> original

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:12.599 
that just reminded me of the original

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:14.330 
that just reminded me of the original
series<00:06:13.020> the<00:06:13.229> lifting<00:06:13.590> off<00:06:13.740> from<00:06:14.039> the<00:06:14.280> earth

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 
series the lifting off from the earth

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:19.310

the<00:06:15.740> the<00:06:16.740> ultra<00:06:17.070> Menace<00:06:17.430> missile<00:06:18.080> the<00:06:19.080> first

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 
the the ultra Menace missile the first

the the ultra Menace missile the first
warp<00:06:19.620> tests<00:06:20.219> the<00:06:20.610> battles<00:06:21.060> I<00:06:21.599> mean<00:06:22.080> I<00:06:22.110> was<00:06:22.500> just

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
warp tests the battles I mean I was just

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.159 
warp tests the battles I mean I was just
absolutely<00:06:23.340> I<00:06:23.729> was<00:06:24.240> taken<00:06:24.539> away<00:06:24.630> when<00:06:24.750> I<00:06:24.930> first

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
absolutely I was taken away when I first

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:28.249 
absolutely I was taken away when I first
saw<00:06:25.320> this<00:06:25.530> I<00:06:26.090> got<00:06:27.090> this<00:06:27.300> particular<00:06:27.719> movie<00:06:28.229> I

had gotten off work it was like five
o'clock<00:06:30.000> I<00:06:30.599> immediately<00:06:31.589> put<00:06:31.979> it<00:06:32.070> into<00:06:32.250> the

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
o'clock I immediately put it into the

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:32.740 
o'clock I immediately put it into the
blue

and<00:06:35.240> I<00:06:35.330> started<00:06:35.600> watching<00:06:35.810> it<00:06:36.110> and<00:06:36.410> I<00:06:36.920> was<00:06:36.950> like

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
and I started watching it and I was like

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.830 
and I started watching it and I was like

but then I mean after a couple of times

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.810 
but then I mean after a couple of times
you<00:06:41.720> get<00:06:41.810> used<00:06:42.050> to<00:06:42.170> it<00:06:42.230> now<00:06:42.410> the<00:06:43.280> lot<00:06:43.640> of<00:06:43.670> the

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:43.820 
you get used to it now the lot of the

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.250 
you get used to it now the lot of the
effects<00:06:44.300> from<00:06:44.420> the<00:06:44.510> original<00:06:44.810> show<00:06:44.870> are<00:06:45.140> in

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:45.260 
effects from the original show are in

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.580 
effects from the original show are in
there<00:06:45.500> the<00:06:45.950> the<00:06:46.430> warp<00:06:46.730> is<00:06:47.270> fantastic<00:06:48.140> it's

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:48.590 
there the the warp is fantastic it's

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.360 
there the the warp is fantastic it's
like<00:06:49.040> a<00:06:49.070> vortex<00:06:49.640> effect<00:06:49.850> and<00:06:50.320> I<00:06:51.320> don't<00:06:52.160> know<00:06:52.280> if

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.370 
like a vortex effect and I don't know if

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.770 
like a vortex effect and I don't know if
you<00:06:52.460> remember<00:06:52.640> this<00:06:53.030> or<00:06:53.210> not<00:06:53.390> from<00:06:53.660> the

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:10.460 
the a lot of the only things you really

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.780 
the a lot of the only things you really
see<00:07:10.610> in<00:07:10.669> the<00:07:10.730> way<00:07:10.820> of<00:07:11.350> of<00:07:12.350> actual<00:07:13.100> weaponry<00:07:13.610> is

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:13.790 
see in the way of of actual weaponry is

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.909 
see in the way of of actual weaponry is
the<00:07:14.419> actual<00:07:14.810> shock<00:07:15.110> cannon<00:07:15.380> the<00:07:15.620> wave<00:07:15.710> motion

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919 
the actual shock cannon the wave motion

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:17.650 
the actual shock cannon the wave motion
gun<00:07:16.100> you<00:07:16.340> don't<00:07:16.430> see<00:07:16.669> the<00:07:16.760> side<00:07:17.000> missiles<00:07:17.450> you

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:17.660 
gun you don't see the side missiles you

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.810 
gun you don't see the side missiles you
don't<00:07:17.810> see<00:07:18.020> the<00:07:18.140> shield<00:07:20.140> now<00:07:21.140> there<00:07:22.010> are<00:07:22.340> a<00:07:22.370> few

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:22.820 
don't see the shield now there are a few

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.390 
don't see the shield now there are a few
things<00:07:23.480> in<00:07:23.570> there<00:07:23.690> that<00:07:23.840> you're<00:07:23.960> going<00:07:24.080> to<00:07:24.140> get

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.400 
things in there that you're going to get

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.760 
things in there that you're going to get
like<00:07:25.400> for<00:07:25.610> example<00:07:26.000> there's<00:07:26.120> a<00:07:26.210> couple<00:07:26.390> of<00:07:26.770> in

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:27.770 
like for example there's a couple of in

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:32.440 
like for example there's a couple of in
the<00:07:28.060> the<00:07:29.060> design<00:07:29.450> of<00:07:29.810> analyzer<00:07:31.090> looks<00:07:32.090> a<00:07:32.210> lot

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:32.450 
the the design of analyzer looks a lot

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:33.940 
the the design of analyzer looks a lot
like<00:07:32.690> the<00:07:32.870> original<00:07:33.260> one<00:07:33.410> except<00:07:33.740> that<00:07:33.860> he

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:33.950 
like the original one except that he

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.010 
like the original one except that he
doesn't<00:07:34.310> have<00:07:34.460> they<00:07:35.090> have<00:07:35.240> feet<00:07:35.510> this<00:07:35.810> time

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:36.020 
doesn't have they have feet this time

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.610 
doesn't have they have feet this time
and<00:07:36.290> I<00:07:37.419> just<00:07:38.419> was<00:07:38.660> amazed<00:07:38.990> at<00:07:39.260> the<00:07:39.290> last

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:39.620 
and I just was amazed at the last

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:44.370 
and I just was amazed at the last
sequence<00:07:40.310> or<00:07:40.910> analyzer<00:07:41.450> was<00:07:41.720> in<00:07:41.870> the<00:07:41.960> movie<00:07:42.229> so

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:44.380 
sequence or analyzer was in the movie so

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.810 
sequence or analyzer was in the movie so
overall<00:07:45.380> if<00:07:45.710> you<00:07:45.830> can<00:07:45.979> pick<00:07:46.190> this<00:07:46.340> up<00:07:46.520> please

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:46.820 
overall if you can pick this up please

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.230 
overall if you can pick this up please
do<00:07:47.030> so<00:07:47.270> I<00:07:47.300> mean<00:07:47.690> I<00:07:47.720> believe<00:07:47.870> I<00:07:48.200> paid<00:07:48.970> just<00:07:49.970> about
