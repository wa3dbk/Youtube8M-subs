we've ever witnessed in our sport does

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.379 
we've ever witnessed in our sport does
it<00:05:04.400> do<00:05:05.400> you<00:05:05.460> think<00:05:05.490> about<00:05:05.699> it<00:05:05.909> sometimes<00:05:06.240> in

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
it do you think about it sometimes in

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.510 
it do you think about it sometimes in
thinking<00:05:06.599> of<00:05:06.719> this<00:05:06.810> isn't<00:05:07.139> fair<00:05:07.349> at<00:05:08.159> any<00:05:08.430> other

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
thinking of this isn't fair at any other

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.339 
thinking of this isn't fair at any other
point<00:05:08.759> in<00:05:08.909> history<00:05:09.090> i<00:05:09.330> would<00:05:09.599> probably

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 
point in history i would probably

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:12.559 
point in history i would probably
already<00:05:10.500> be<00:05:10.800> the<00:05:11.190> top<00:05:11.400> of<00:05:11.550> the<00:05:11.639> world<00:05:11.789> not<00:05:12.449> at

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:12.569 
already be the top of the world not at

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:14.480 
already be the top of the world not at
all<00:05:12.659> i<00:05:12.900> see<00:05:13.289> it<00:05:13.379> as<00:05:13.440> an<00:05:13.560> opportunity<00:05:13.620> to<00:05:14.219> get<00:05:14.340> to

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
all i see it as an opportunity to get to

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.180 
all i see it as an opportunity to get to
race<00:05:14.669> the<00:05:14.909> best<00:05:15.090> and<00:05:15.389> i<00:05:16.080> feel<00:05:16.319> like<00:05:16.590> with<00:05:17.039> my

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
race the best and i feel like with my

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.439 
race the best and i feel like with my
current<00:05:17.430> progression<00:05:18.000> I<00:05:18.090> could<00:05:18.270> definitely

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
current progression I could definitely

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.100 
current progression I could definitely
in<00:05:19.020> the<00:05:19.469> future<00:05:19.800> get<00:05:20.190> up<00:05:20.610> to<00:05:20.990> hopefully<00:05:21.990> the

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
in the future get up to hopefully the

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.409 
in the future get up to hopefully the
same<00:05:22.319> level<00:05:22.560> I<00:05:22.830> see<00:05:23.159> more<00:05:23.400> visit<00:05:23.610> more<00:05:24.180> of<00:05:24.300> a

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
same level I see more visit more of a
