00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
v6 but I was almost biased about buying

v6 but I was almost biased about buying
the<00:00:24.210> master<00:00:24.810> 40<00:00:25.080> series<00:00:25.410> one<00:00:25.710> because<00:00:26.039> it's

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
the master 40 series one because it's

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.769 
the master 40 series one because it's
really<00:00:26.340> calm<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.090> videos<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.539> saw

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
really calm and the videos that I saw

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.780 
really calm and the videos that I saw
didn't<00:00:28.140> sound<00:00:28.320> very<00:00:28.439> good<00:00:28.650> but

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:30.790 
didn't sound very good but

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.210 
didn't sound very good but
one<00:00:31.330> thing<00:00:31.510> I<00:00:31.600> can<00:00:31.840> say<00:00:32.080> is<00:00:32.230> it<00:00:32.380> is<00:00:32.410> properly

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
one thing I can say is it is properly

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.410 
one thing I can say is it is properly
loud

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.180 

and<00:00:36.630> really<00:00:36.960> for<00:00:37.140> normal<00:00:37.470> driving<00:00:37.620> not

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
and really for normal driving not

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.380 
and really for normal driving not
revving<00:00:38.520> too<00:00:38.610> high<00:00:38.760> or<00:00:38.820> anything<00:00:39.030> like<00:00:39.330> that

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
revving too high or anything like that

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.640 
revving too high or anything like that
it<00:00:39.750> does<00:00:39.960> sound<00:00:39.990> just<00:00:40.590> like<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> v8<00:00:41.220> and<00:00:41.900> I'm<00:00:42.900> the

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
it does sound just like a v8 and I'm the

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.350 
it does sound just like a v8 and I'm the
kind<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.920> guy<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.280> nitpicks<00:00:44.640> on<00:00:44.820> all<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.180> that

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
kind of guy that nitpicks on all of that

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.260 
kind of guy that nitpicks on all of that
to<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:46.940> finest<00:00:47.940> detail<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:49.190> mean<00:00:50.190> no<00:00:50.700> I'll<00:00:50.940> I'll

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
to the finest detail I mean no I'll I'll

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.920 
to the finest detail I mean no I'll I'll
rev<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:52.050> second<00:00:52.470> but<00:00:53.239> just<00:00:54.239> like<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.420> got

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
rev it in a second but just like I got

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.479 
rev it in a second but just like I got
it<00:00:55.020> at<00:00:55.110> uh<00:00:55.230> mode<00:00:55.440> because<00:00:55.830> it<00:00:56.010> keeps<00:00:56.220> it<00:00:56.430> in

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
it at uh mode because it keeps it in

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.610 
it at uh mode because it keeps it in
lower<00:00:56.640> rpms<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.330> it<00:00:57.450> makes<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> Rev<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.260> little

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
lower rpms and it makes the Rev a little

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.720 
lower rpms and it makes the Rev a little
bit<00:00:58.710> higher

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.730 

there<00:01:04.300> you<00:01:04.390> go<00:01:04.540> until<00:01:04.960> that<00:01:05.019> time<00:01:05.229> mode<00:01:05.470> that's

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
there you go until that time mode that's

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.430 
there you go until that time mode that's
that's<00:01:06.190> in<00:01:06.310> fourth<00:01:06.550> gear

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.320 

but

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
but

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.510 
but
and<00:01:11.780> I<00:01:11.900> it<00:01:12.050> sounds<00:01:12.320> just<00:01:12.410> like<00:01:12.620> a<00:01:12.680> v8<00:01:12.920> I<00:01:13.310> mean

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
and I it sounds just like a v8 I mean

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.190 
and I it sounds just like a v8 I mean
there's<00:01:13.940> there's<00:01:14.360> nothing<00:01:14.630> other<00:01:14.780> than<00:01:14.990> this

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
there's there's nothing other than this

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.080 
multiple of the behind the cat and then
it<00:02:52.620> goes<00:02:52.739> right<00:02:52.830> over<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.130> crossmember<00:02:53.730> on

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
it goes right over the crossmember on

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.310 
it goes right over the crossmember on
the<00:02:54.180> bottom<00:02:54.480> with<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.660> transmission<00:02:55.050> and

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
the bottom with the transmission and
