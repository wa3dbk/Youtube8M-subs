00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
hair down but and I remember watching it

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.070 
hair down but and I remember watching it
and<00:02:09.520> it's<00:02:09.850> not<00:02:10.060> reverting<00:02:10.509> back<00:02:10.539> to<00:02:10.780> its<00:02:10.899> Kiki

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
and it's not reverting back to its Kiki

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.110 
and it's not reverting back to its Kiki
state<00:02:11.500> so<00:02:11.770> it<00:02:12.400> was<00:02:12.520> nothing<00:02:12.790> that<00:02:12.820> I<00:02:13.090> could

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
state so it was nothing that I could

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.820 
state so it was nothing that I could
really<00:02:13.450> do<00:02:13.660> with<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:14.140> except<00:02:14.350> for<00:02:14.380> all<00:02:14.709> the

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
really do with it except for all the

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.360 
really do with it except for all the
ends<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:15.520> it's<00:02:15.940> borne<00:02:16.239> out<00:02:16.450> a<00:02:16.480> lot<00:02:17.250> so<00:02:18.250> that's

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
ends and it's borne out a lot so that's

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.260
