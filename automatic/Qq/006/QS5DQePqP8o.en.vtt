up<00:02:25.340> with<00:02:25.460> the<00:02:25.520> idea<00:02:25.790> for<00:02:25.850> mounting<00:02:26.350> brackets

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
up with the idea for mounting brackets

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.720 
up with the idea for mounting brackets
for<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.500> microwave<00:02:27.860> you<00:02:28.310> can<00:02:28.430> see<00:02:28.610> it<00:02:28.700> very

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
for the microwave you can see it very

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.210 
for the microwave you can see it very
well<00:02:28.910> but<00:02:29.090> it's<00:02:30.020> a<00:02:30.230> metal<00:02:30.710> bar<00:02:30.890> runs

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
well but it's a metal bar runs

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.920 
well but it's a metal bar runs
underneath<00:02:31.550> and<00:02:32.210> over<00:02:32.390> here<00:02:32.600> so<00:02:32.780> it<00:02:32.840> was

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
underneath and over here so it was

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.860 
underneath and over here so it was
really<00:02:33.140> cool<00:02:33.290> idea<00:02:33.940> water<00:02:34.940> lines<00:02:35.180> going

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
really cool idea water lines going

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.400 
really cool idea water lines going
outside<00:02:36.250> into<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.600> gas<00:02:38.600> on-demand<00:02:38.930> hot<00:02:39.200> water

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
outside into the gas on-demand hot water

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.170 
outside into the gas on-demand hot water
here<00:02:39.620> which<00:02:39.830> some<00:02:40.100> people<00:02:40.220> get<00:02:40.610> nervous<00:02:40.910> about

it<00:03:31.670> is<00:03:31.880> insulated<00:03:32.600> however<00:03:33.010> had<00:03:34.010> I<00:03:34.040> had<00:03:34.280> to<00:03:34.400> do

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
it is insulated however had I had to do

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.520 
it is insulated however had I had to do
it<00:03:34.640> over<00:03:34.790> I<00:03:35.180> would<00:03:35.540> not<00:03:36.020> have<00:03:36.170> had<00:03:36.380> them

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
it over I would not have had them

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.840 
it over I would not have had them
insulator<00:03:36.890> to<00:03:36.950> put<00:03:37.130> up<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.310> walls<00:03:37.520> because

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
insulator to put up the walls because

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.449 
insulator to put up the walls because
it's<00:03:38.240> just<00:03:38.390> this<00:03:38.740> Rowlett<00:03:39.740> aluminum<00:03:40.220> backing

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
it's just this Rowlett aluminum backing

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:47.770 
it's just this Rowlett aluminum backing
of<00:03:40.700> insulation<00:03:41.090> which<00:03:41.390> is<00:03:46.300> so<00:03:47.300> of<00:03:47.390> course<00:03:47.510> got

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
of insulation which is so of course got

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.350 
of insulation which is so of course got
the<00:03:47.870> RV<00:03:48.140> door<00:03:48.320> on<00:03:48.620> it<00:03:48.770> as<00:03:48.920> well<00:03:49.190> so<00:03:49.970> we<00:03:50.150> can<00:03:50.270> have

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
the RV door on it as well so we can have

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.320 
the RV door on it as well so we can have
screen<00:03:50.720> door<00:03:51.280> but<00:03:52.280> that's<00:03:52.880> pretty<00:03:53.090> much<00:03:53.209> it

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
screen door but that's pretty much it

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.449 
screen door but that's pretty much it
took<00:03:53.660> us<00:03:53.780> a<00:03:53.810> few<00:03:53.959> weekends<00:03:54.530> and<00:03:55.220> we're<00:03:55.370> always

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
took us a few weekends and we're always

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.870 
took us a few weekends and we're always
kind<00:03:55.760> of<00:03:55.790> tweaking<00:03:56.090> a<00:03:56.300> little<00:03:56.540> bit<00:03:57.730> but<00:03:58.730> it's

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
kind of tweaking a little bit but it's

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.990 
kind of tweaking a little bit but it's
fun<00:03:59.120> so<00:03:59.950> definitely<00:04:00.950> way<00:04:01.280> cheaper<00:04:01.550> than<00:04:01.700> going

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
fun so definitely way cheaper than going

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.800 
fun so definitely way cheaper than going
out<00:04:02.120> and<00:04:02.180> buying<00:04:02.300> a<00:04:02.600> tool<00:04:02.840> or<00:04:03.020> camper<00:04:03.530> so
