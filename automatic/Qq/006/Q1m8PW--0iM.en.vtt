00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.610 

I've<00:00:11.940> had<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.120> long<00:00:12.420> career<00:00:12.719> working<00:00:13.139> with<00:00:13.320> dogs

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.060 

we<00:00:24.970> spend<00:00:25.300> so<00:00:25.420> much<00:00:25.960> time<00:00:26.070> concerning

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
we spend so much time concerning

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.249 
we spend so much time concerning
ourselves<00:00:27.340> with<00:00:27.610> status<00:00:28.270> and<00:00:28.750> over<00:00:29.170> the

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:29.259 
ourselves with status and over the

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:30.870 
ourselves with status and over the
centuries<00:00:29.650> we've<00:00:29.830> been<00:00:29.949> led<00:00:30.160> to<00:00:30.189> believe<00:00:30.369> that

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
centuries we've been led to believe that

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.880 
centuries we've been led to believe that
we<00:00:31.000> have<00:00:31.210> to<00:00:31.240> really<00:00:31.570> strive<00:00:32.020> to<00:00:32.050> be<00:00:32.230> the<00:00:32.349> Alpha

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
we have to really strive to be the Alpha

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.860 
we have to really strive to be the Alpha
the<00:00:33.610> problem<00:00:33.970> is<00:00:34.059> that<00:00:34.210> most<00:00:34.360> dogs<00:00:34.600> actually

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
the problem is that most dogs actually

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.410 
the problem is that most dogs actually
don't<00:00:35.350> want<00:00:35.559> to<00:00:35.680> dominate<00:00:36.220> and<00:00:36.520> then<00:00:37.000> we<00:00:37.210> end

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
don't want to dominate and then we end

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.420 
don't want to dominate and then we end
up<00:00:37.540> putting<00:00:37.750> these<00:00:38.020> needless<00:00:38.379> rules<00:00:38.890> in<00:00:39.160> place

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
up putting these needless rules in place

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.150 
up putting these needless rules in place
and<00:00:39.850> it<00:00:40.510> really<00:00:40.780> confuses<00:00:41.320> and<00:00:41.470> stressed<00:00:41.800> dogs

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
and it really confuses and stressed dogs

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.369 
and it really confuses and stressed dogs
out<00:00:42.460> and<00:00:42.850> that<00:00:43.390> means<00:00:43.600> that<00:00:43.930> they<00:00:44.080> end<00:00:44.230> up

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
out and that means that they end up

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:47.189 
out and that means that they end up
either<00:00:44.580> mislabeling<00:00:45.580> behavior<00:00:46.210> or<00:00:46.449> calling

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
either mislabeling behavior or calling

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.130 
either mislabeling behavior or calling
them<00:00:47.320> dominant<00:00:47.830> in<00:00:48.760> the<00:00:49.390> last<00:00:49.600> video<00:00:49.960> we

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
them dominant in the last video we

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.930 
them dominant in the last video we
looked<00:00:50.290> at<00:00:50.500> the<00:00:50.559> research<00:00:51.010> from<00:00:51.309> rudolph

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
looked at the research from rudolph

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.000 
looked at the research from rudolph
Schenkel<00:00:52.420> that's<00:00:52.629> been<00:00:52.780> disproved<00:00:53.350> and<00:00:53.620> that

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
Schenkel that's been disproved and that

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.950 
Schenkel that's been disproved and that
research<00:00:54.610> was<00:00:54.790> done<00:00:55.000> back<00:00:55.180> in<00:00:55.210> the<00:00:55.449> 30s<00:00:55.839> and

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
research was done back in the 30s and

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.609 
research was done back in the 30s and
40s

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:56.619 
40s

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:58.140 
40s
so<00:00:57.100> what<00:00:57.220> we're<00:00:57.339> actually<00:00:57.460> gonna<00:00:57.699> do<00:00:57.879> in<00:00:58.030> this

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
so what we're actually gonna do in this

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.119 
so what we're actually gonna do in this
video<00:00:58.570> is<00:00:58.629> look<00:00:58.869> at<00:00:59.019> how<00:00:59.170> wolf<00:00:59.409> packs<00:00:59.680> actually

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129

video is look at how wolf packs actually
work<00:01:00.309> and<00:01:00.549> what<00:01:00.699> makes<00:01:00.729> a<00:01:01.059> really<00:01:01.239> good<00:01:01.420> leader

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
work and what makes a really good leader
