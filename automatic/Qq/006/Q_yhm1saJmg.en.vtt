00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:09.049
 Precisely magnificent perfect of the audi tts 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:18.160
 classical sound 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:18.160
 can me the bmw m 2 35 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.759
 These two coupes heat us powerful 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.980
 a car image wants to know which bayer 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:28.220
 makes more and more on the 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.220
 Racetrack 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.530
 when it comes to athletic compact so far 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.829
 Coupe s against when you 're not at 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.079
 porsche thought then one can at bwm 235 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.059
 just not over the thing is power 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.079
 a six-cylinder rear wheel drive there 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.910
 is already a lot 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.510
 but now there is a challenger 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.650
 a new challenger to the audi tts 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.230
 four-wheel drive 310 ps 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.879
 also the thing sees really fast 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.230
 really good and we have the two 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.579
 cars the two bavaria on the 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.579
 race track against each other 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.239
 Let's look at the first 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.489
 Ingolstadt on the lettering makes it 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.710
 already clearly from the outside have here 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.130
 we do not use it with a normal pc too 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.830
 do 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.890
 a front transversely mounted four-cylinder 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.700
 turbo with 310 ps pushes the tts coupe 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.470
 in 5 4 seconds on tempo 100 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.470
 this yellow flash is shut off 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.159
 250 kilometers per hour 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:27.740
 priced the audi tts coupe begins 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.390
 49,100 euros the back seat is not for 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.960
 adults and the trunk volume of 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.040
 300 5 712 liters make it clear that you 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.860
 this car is not enough 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.180
 but we want 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.870
 yes also know what he is on the 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.870
 race track can 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.410
 despite 310 ps, ​​the tts sounds rather 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.480
 unexciting 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.070
 only in sport mode and at higher 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.820
 He plays his sweeping revs 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.260
 soundtrack off 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.820
 it just can not be completely denied 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:04.680
 that here only a two-liter four-cylinder 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.930
 turbo slaves the audi tts kicking now 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.060
 almost perfect the high-tech coupe at 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.670
 Although only one in front under the hood 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.620
 two-liter four-cylinder but plenty 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.600
 steam to all four wheels thanks 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.290
 all-wheel drive right crib out of the 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.570
 curves out 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.050
 really fast on the race track one 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.910
 Great lap time and it really is 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.680
 inspire the coupe that anyway 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.480
 a little bit of cooling is that the 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.880
 driver does not really take him away 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.470
 not really appealing fair enough 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.640
 But you have to say that is more 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.390
 can be at a very high level 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.340
 the audi tts is a coupé as well 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.870
 it can hardly do better and that can be 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.870
 drivers bring a lot of joy 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.890
 although optically less sharp and in the 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.810
 profile almost a bit chubby 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.300
 The neck is faster at the bmw 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.340
 vertical despite higher seating position 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.500
 fits the two perfect as one 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.970
 Glove and also on the back seat can 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.860
 as an adult human being 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.720
 short distances take the three-liter space 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:15.090
 six-cylinder already stirs in the 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:18.030
 idle smoky and over it will only 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:24.810
 even better the 235 could be 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:26.220
 just for hours we just want to 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.940
 rather drive and have to go very fast 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.520
 rethink 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.920
 as bmw and the hand switch canceled and 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.910
 the eight-speed automatic were announced 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.680
 we briefly disappointed 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.990
 completely wrong as it turns out 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.900
 better than the zf automaten can be 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.090
 the 326 ps simply can not manage 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.770
 every connection fits every gear change 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.030
 happens lightning fast and without 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.520
 significant back 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.850
 the sprint on tempo 100 copes with the 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.160
 bmw thanks to its 326 ps in 4.9 seconds 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.000
 and here too is at 250 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.770
 then close the kilometer 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.040
 the basic prize for the munich starts 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:02.040
 from 44 1750 euro 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:11.660
 the bmw m 235 presents itself as 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.510
 real bavarian pounder front of the 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.380
 hood a three-liter inline six 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.300
 drives on the rear wheels 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.040
 that's the way it is and so we have that 

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.060
 also like to be here on the race track 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.670
 although a bit more demanding 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.740
 not easy to drive but if 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.450
 you got it out then rewarded with one 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.300
 a permanent grin in a pretty 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:32.360
 good lap time we say everything 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:35.360
 to be done properly so takes the bmw 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.800
 the audi up to 100 km h half a second 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.940
 and holds the lead up to speed 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.010
 200 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.450
 the manual audi suffers here 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.120
 under his conspicuously short 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.280
 Translation up to 100 km h must be twice 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.840
 be switched plus a short 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.820
 Art break during fast eating 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.680
 the gears that improves the 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.860
 switching comfort and protects the material 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.810
 But it costs time really slow 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.910
 that does not thank the tts though 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.220
 four-wheel drive and 20 inch wheels for 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.080
 1,900 euros surcharge on travel 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:08.210
 Ingolstadt at the start almost the US-wide 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:11.210
 buy 55 last just 18 seconds 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.460
 only then does the bmw m 2 35 send itself 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.440
 although the audi knows no mercy 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.820
 storms faster from tight sweeps and 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.190
 does not just stop at pure 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.330
 powder works but also too violent 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.520
 construction movements 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.350
 although his steering a trail softer 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.570
 and therefore less responsive binding 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.210
 as the bmw finds the wrestler 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.670
 Almost automatically the ideal line and holds 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.320
 unconditionally attached to her but who is 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:36.050
 because now the king of Bavaria when it comes to 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:40.730
 sportive coupes goes on a day at the 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:42.110
 race track audi tts against bmw m 2 35 am 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.080
 this essentially remains one thing 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.540
 question of taste the w &amp; w something inhibits 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.850
 poorly rustic like also across 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.280
 driving but again that no cold 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:55.880
 lets that really get carried away and the audi 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.160
 very neutral very foolproof of 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.750
 to drive everyone really fast 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.150
 almost perfect already and that's why 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.010
 but also something cools the conclusion of the 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.240
 whole story at the end 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.560
 Ingolstadt and Munich are not so 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.600
 far apart as you sometimes think 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:13.530
 the bavaria shows where to go both 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.480
 audi tts as well as bmw m 2 35 are included 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.030
 the compact coupés to the special ones 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.980
 treats of ingolstädter shines as 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.930
 Fool safe all- wheel athlete 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.600
 Munich he flies a hearty very 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.280
 ambitious driving style 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.650
 ultimately decide only in nuances to 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.600
 favor of the bmw of his driver 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.970
 stronger demands but also with more 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.570
 goose bumps and the broader grin 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.570
 rewarded
