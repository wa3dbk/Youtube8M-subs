00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.720
 the Hague 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.640
 that is a 39 year old poland signed for the third time a week 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.810
 it looks nice 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.300
 it to play 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.940
 the news would you they lived from 225 million years to 60 million years ago 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.109
 during that time 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:46.160
 developed many different species 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.880
 that was also because the continents were created 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.650
 250 million years ago only the supercontinent pangea existed 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.170
 60 million years later that also broke those continents out of two parts 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.030
 drifted apart again 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.190
 the dinosaur group became isolated and could take care of those splits 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.320
 independently for the animals 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.780
 in the hortus in hair you can watch fossils and skeletons until March 2008 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.400
 of dinosaurs found in china 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.670
 in addition, the replicas are from dinosaurs 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.670
 intend to commit 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.250
 you see it is full of 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.219
 The thorny sales we also know they made seemed to make robber 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.500
 He also has a volunteer header time to defend himself 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.770
 to hold 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.060
 do you have anything special with the dinosaurs year i have walked the 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.060
 to dig up Members of the European Parliament 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.620
 france and spain eurogamer 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.460
 the former 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.009
 I think I have a wheelchair once 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.550
 among young people 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.690
 for that petrified remains found from 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:02.890
 particular 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.570
 little animals moss animals that we bite through so beautifully and that stone 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:13.559
 that two go to new world open to others all who is who who 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:15.319
 you never win 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.339
 could see only the best could see with it 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:21.949
 reconstructing a wonderful lewis world that fascinates me 

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:26.179
 so if we have archeology of biology you can say 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.009
 bolat was super 

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:30.519
 system fraction questions 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.369
 nine years 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:34.439
 so it's a cult 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.439
 don't hit me 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.239
 has released more 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.689
 the tensions shot the war 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:45.359
 fossilized tens of thousands of years old throughout his life 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.109
 traces of traces of animals and plants 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:51.999
 Schoten also studied theology and works at the Geological Institute of 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:53.609
 the university in groningen 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.609
 and leave from the free university in Amsterdam 

00:02:57.149 --> 00:03:00.219
 the book shots is almost 75 and with medication 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:04.449
 but it still has courses and still fewer research trips 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:05.689
 and the excavations 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:11.709
 his preference for stones and fossils has never disappeared a goal 3 million 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.909
 a year earlier you can say that we take care of it 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:16.069
 also 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.219
 two million years of totally new shirt intimate youth room 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:25.169
 a fraction of the sober pass arose at kellermeyer 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.109
 much to discover 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.199
 And if you then count on it the reason the dinosaur worm it 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:33.769
 have increased that it is not like 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.229
 has happened since 19 85 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:42.169
 that we now know that there is an end to cleaning the impact of an awesome 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:43.969
 meteorite 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:49.059
 who, in reason, has caused an ecological catastrophe across the earth 

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:52.319
 that they are on their 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.339
 and we still find it very new important things 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.099
 the 30 year old joost luiten is a lot of strength 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.379
 that is in berlin 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:06.509
 the that was an exceptional 17 years because he 

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:08.669
 the gates 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:11.669
 this may not actually be longer than the hind legs 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.419
 a third is here 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:17.419
 one wants to decorate it off 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.090
 that is nice animal 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.210
 and yes 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.629
 He has asked a stranger and you can come and see Prinsenbeek 

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:31.749
 Then you see that it is peaceful 

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:34.969
 eating plants does not roll large sharp teeth 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:39.820
 it a copy a dune go again who 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.820
 also the 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:46.409
 6 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:51.789
 6 

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:57.930
 this is typical 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.900
 surprising 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.409
 who would learn now 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:04.319
 the price is on all four legs 

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:05.310
 people in need 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.360
 the long neck 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.430
 OSS that keep that body in balance are also huge 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.539
 what to rise 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:15.300
 temporary on 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.870
 and with that top it has been constantly eating you yourself already have 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:20.990
 dug up something like that 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.020
 hell yes 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.259
 such a complete skeleton anp no no no no no no no 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.169
 the reason 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.129
 I never saw that when I did see a fossil link 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:39.150
 That's a piece of the weather the chance I have ever found 

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:42.729
 or I have I was found 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:44.860
 it is so you can do teamwork 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.330
 You understand that you are all here 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.330
 with a wooden sculpture in progress you need a little bit 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:54.930
 the excavator must also have to remove the big cities 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:59.610
 so in general it is great labor intensive 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:03.199
 to get your voice out of the ground 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.419
 there are entire EIA stunts 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:09.419
 present what things would want 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:14.669
 they differ in terms of for him the first country attracts the other 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:16.550
 is 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.060
 the Finnish midfielder 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.749
 still have this 

00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:21.419
 at their most 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:26.009
 plus generally better not worth it and j no which dinosaur whores 

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:33.050
 it is a miracle 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.699
 walk so much past 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:39.900
 Worlds have been defending communities of life 

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:42.430
 at 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.250
 that speaks ot of seeing moreover it is true that you are current 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.980
 communities cannot understand the group if you do not know the old ones 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.760
 it was so hot for the state that he continues to maintain that poverty 

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:04.199
 that is a lot 

00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:10.439
 to keep the cut
