with<00:00:06.960> that<00:00:07.229> app<00:00:07.770> review<00:00:08.610> of<00:00:08.879> Minecraft<00:00:09.780> Pocket

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
with that app review of Minecraft Pocket

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.690 
with that app review of Minecraft Pocket
Edition<00:00:10.379> came<00:00:11.040> out<00:00:13.639> not<00:00:14.639> too<00:00:14.849> long<00:00:14.880> ago<00:00:15.090> and

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:16.700 
Edition came out not too long ago and

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:23.960 
Edition came out not too long ago and
this<00:00:17.700> is<00:00:17.820> what<00:00:17.939> it<00:00:18.060> looks<00:00:18.240> like<00:00:19.849> inside<00:00:20.849> is<00:00:22.970> 699

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
this is what it looks like inside is 699

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.979 
this is what it looks like inside is 699
which<00:00:24.360> is<00:00:24.540> pretty<00:00:24.779> expensive<00:00:25.200> for<00:00:25.800> an<00:00:25.890> app<00:00:26.989> but

00:00:27.979 --> 00:00:27.989 
which is pretty expensive for an app but

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:32.120 
which is pretty expensive for an app but
since<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:29.029> do<00:00:30.029> like<00:00:30.540> Minecraft<00:00:31.110> saw<00:00:31.290> I<00:00:31.649> decided

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
since I do like Minecraft saw I decided

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:40.130 
since I do like Minecraft saw I decided
to<00:00:32.220> buy<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:34.370> um<00:00:37.250> the<00:00:38.250> blonde<00:00:38.760> this<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.870> my

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
to buy it and um the blonde this is my

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.710 
to buy it and um the blonde this is my
house<00:00:40.380> so<00:00:40.620> far<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.010> built<00:00:41.310> this<00:00:41.820> not<00:00:42.420> too

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
house so far that I built this not too

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.830 
house so far that I built this not too
much<00:00:42.990> like<00:00:43.500> it's<00:00:44.400> not<00:00:44.610> too<00:00:44.850> fancy<00:00:45.060> just<00:00:45.360> yet

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
much like it's not too fancy just yet

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.900 
much like it's not too fancy just yet
because<00:00:46.170> that's<00:00:46.770> all<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.190> blocks<00:00:47.460> like<00:00:47.760> you

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
because that's all the blocks like you

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.330 
because that's all the blocks like you
can<00:00:48.120> place<00:00:49.340> or<00:00:50.340> in<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.700> game<00:00:50.880> and<00:00:51.180> also<00:00:52.160> if<00:00:53.160> you

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
can place or in the game and also if you

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.720 
can place or in the game and also if you
like<00:00:53.670> break<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.940> block<00:00:55.100> you<00:00:56.100> don't<00:00:56.280> collect<00:00:56.730> it

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
like break a block you don't collect it

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.190 
like break a block you don't collect it
and<00:00:59.730> also<00:00:59.880> like<00:01:00.510> one<00:01:00.720> thing<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:00.930> don't<00:01:01.110> really

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
and also like one thing I don't really

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.690 
and also like one thing I don't really
like<00:01:01.380> I<00:01:01.530> don't<00:01:01.560> like<00:01:01.950> these<00:01:02.100> controls<00:01:02.550> are

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
like I don't like these controls are

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.690 
like I don't like these controls are
kind<00:01:02.970> of<00:01:03.030> hard<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.360> use<00:01:04.129> you<00:01:05.129> got<00:01:05.280> like<00:01:05.519> these

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
kind of hard to use you got like these

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.300 
kind of hard to use you got like these
buttons<00:01:06.060> here<00:01:06.229> like<00:01:07.229> move<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.650> sideways<00:01:07.950> or
