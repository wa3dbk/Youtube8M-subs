one I'm the sales associate so that they

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.219 
one I'm the sales associate so that they
were<00:01:25.380> having<00:01:25.650> an<00:01:26.040> event<00:01:26.850> in<00:01:27.270> two<00:01:27.659> weeks<00:01:27.930> for

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
were having an event in two weeks for

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.480 
were having an event in two weeks for
the<00:01:28.380> collection<00:01:28.860> which<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.189> was<00:01:29.280> kind<00:01:29.369> of

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
the collection which I was kind of

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.039 
the collection which I was kind of
surprised<00:01:29.820> about<00:01:29.970> because<00:01:30.299> they<00:01:30.869> might<00:01:30.990> be

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
surprised about because they might be

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.510 
surprised about because they might be
sold<00:01:31.320> out<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.619> some<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.920> things<00:01:32.130> by<00:01:32.340> then

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
sold out of some of the things by then

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.109 
sold out of some of the things by then
so<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.759> thought<00:01:33.000> I'd<00:01:33.119> wait<00:01:33.329> until<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:35.119> makeup

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
so I thought I'd wait until the makeup

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.090 
so I thought I'd wait until the makeup
artist<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.780> International<00:01:37.500> makeup<00:01:37.740> artists
