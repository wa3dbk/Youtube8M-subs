coating<00:01:44.000> and<00:01:44.180> the<00:01:45.140> glitter<00:01:45.350> still<00:01:45.679> does<00:01:45.920> kind

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
coating and the glitter still does kind

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.569 
coating and the glitter still does kind
of<00:01:46.429> fall<00:01:47.179> off<00:01:47.420> and<00:01:47.920> if<00:01:48.920> you're<00:01:49.070> real<00:01:49.219> sensitive

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
of fall off and if you're real sensitive

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:51.940 
of fall off and if you're real sensitive
for<00:01:49.759> that<00:01:49.880> or<00:01:50.469> that's<00:01:51.469> something<00:01:51.740> that<00:01:51.859> will

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
for that or that's something that will

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.770 
for that or that's something that will
bother<00:01:52.070> you<00:01:52.399> this<00:01:53.000> might<00:01:53.240> not<00:01:53.270> be<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.659> best

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
bother you this might not be the best

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.450 
bother you this might not be the best
option<00:01:54.079> it'd<00:01:54.409> be<00:01:54.500> something<00:01:54.710> like<00:01:54.859> this<00:01:55.250> you

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
option it'd be something like this you

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.800 
option it'd be something like this you
could<00:01:55.549> still<00:01:55.820> see<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.030> glitter<00:01:56.359> from<00:01:56.659> the

could still see the glitter from the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.010 
could still see the glitter from the
inside<00:01:57.259> um<00:01:58.149> but<00:01:59.149> it's<00:01:59.270> a<00:01:59.299> little<00:01:59.509> less<00:01:59.659> messy

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020
