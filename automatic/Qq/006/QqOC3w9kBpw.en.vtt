00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.480
 and well hello to all of you 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.459
 is found for a video of clash of 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.039
 plant today we find ourselves for the 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:15.600
 Following the golden series 20 target troops 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.080
 for the first episode do not know if you 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.490
 you remember we had done 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.010
 invincible hero is so today one 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.600
 find himself for invincible the pk so 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.820
 here I am I will offer you 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.590
 sorry we may not be interested 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.640
 to war since it's not the subject 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.740
 of the video but we will rather 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.800
 to be interested in both gameplay that I have 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.680
 done at the pk so with a lot of 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.230
 healer years and the principle of this 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.170
 series so the sealing goal that the pk 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.910
 they do not die because the title is 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.930
 invincible 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.550
 so I showed you to have this 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.670
 gameplay that is a little fail 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.020
 even if I'm going to win the game 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.579
 did not go as planned since the 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.770
 two pk you'll see they'll 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.480
 pass but will bypass the village 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.559
 simply with him the same king 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.570
 i started m jimmy d healer 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.460
 to help a little pk but you go 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.079
 see that it will not go well 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.850
 even if I 'm still a lot 

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:11.250
 below yeah I 'm going out of 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.299
 save the pk that goes out where he does not want 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.200
 at all go to lots under it 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.500
 completely fuck 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.110
 and on your side ol pk legal this game are going 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.030
 rather be interested in the king and have no 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.040
 Too much go to the fact that this to do 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.170
 that the pekin will die what is 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.430
 really problematic 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.950
 so here I put a care I did this 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.360
 that I could and here it is the testa 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.659
 this way he can do anything guys 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.930
 who are double so there he remained 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.939
 the other pkk who continues his turn 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.740
 all around and see anyway there is 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.840
 enormously greasy on the king so the 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.340
 king he got a little new invincible 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.509
 to the king you will see that you have are 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.250
 on the 2nd gameplay this will be 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.200
 completely different that really does 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.240
 a dirty carnage 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.740
 so here I am raging and our countries want more 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.970
 go back healer you will see that 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.700
 the king it's just huge 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.470
 what's going to do but he's going away he's going 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.540
 the middle you'll see about the age of 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.189
 v it's going to be pretty huge 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.299
 the age of life goes a lot of trouble he goes 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.150
 it's actually I think it had to 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.310
 to be because of them 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.720
 you will see there are going to be traps 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.090
 policies that will come out and that's okay 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.180
 do it here again packaged 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.580
 tesla it's you who finish the pk the 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.420
 second pay because he will die and we will 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.670
 play anyway show you this 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.080
 gameplay because the king almost did 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.210
 a pretty gorgeous thing and take 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.070
 the two stars with all these 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.330
 healers who was behind him here 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.220
 guys this is it started to get done 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.390
 go down one by one and then there 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.710
 had to draw from that he was doing 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.060
 very bad so the lega the sauces you 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.340
 see that it goes down completely 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.750
 so everything is there there were the traps 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.280
 policies that made my king was 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.230
 redirected towards the political pitfalls that 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.870
 did them and instead of typing the hd he 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.130
 tapped the black elixir so it was good 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.500
 to take the outside it was fine 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.000
 but for the age must you go see that 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.370
 is going to be very complicated since everything 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.410
 simply there I could but healer 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.100
 and you will see that the city hdv and 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.709
 the life of the king 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.810
 it's going to be very very tense and 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.280
 this is mauroy failed to take the 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.300
 relieves and it's a shame I know 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.130
 not if there was in putting the care 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.750
 I could have done anything but good 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.280
 it does not matter you have now I'm going 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.560
 offer you the second gameplay 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.170
 good for those of the mdp I told myself 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.400
 anyway is better to put a peace 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.230
 because in addition because I found that 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.420
 two pk it was already not fast enough 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.190
 so you go see you when I was 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.440
 cadet v10 so it's a hdv 10 years 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.300
 find in doing so they had two a 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.370
 time castle so I had like 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.440
 I had some sappers I was able to get out 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.940
 this little castle of clans so there was 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.680
 even a witch here you want the 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.000
 witch coming out there I got 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.739
 I was a little disgusted I thought 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.630
 what am I going to do and everything is 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.880
 so I planned to attack to the bone 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.070
 so I had an archer so the archer 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.060
 helped me so it could bring back all his 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.700
 troops up because the 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.010
 sappers they could not have yes 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.360
 morimont would have needed a lot more so 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.530
 I brought back a little all the troops 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:53.580
 I launched the castle to destroy a little 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.290
 his troops and after I threw the sauce 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.190
 the good thing we like well here is the 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.330
 little king the queen 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.920
 we do not even see the levels so much 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.110
 his role in the village so I started 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.650
 for now a pk he still remains the 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.420
 witch 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.250
 you will see I will launch all the 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.720
 stay after do not worry so 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.630
 there I start a little healer for 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.760
 not that they lose too many lives either 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.200
 this is a pk there are traps that 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.329
 ethics a little bit everything i believe it's going 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.709
 there will even be bombs 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:20.169
 here is the second healer 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.389
 there I will send the heap after actually 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.190
 at the beginning I really mode must 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.550
 really not that it was going through the 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.680
 troops 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.310
 here is with the direct sault spell so 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.620
 I was really happy because the 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.669
 king and the pk go towards the against 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.870
 the other two cases they went in 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.419
 high I said to myself oh no it's 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.470
 impossible it's true it's a tragedy 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.970
 but I really have a lot of luck 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.979
 since again and me it was a lot of 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.380
 the urss so I really could fill or 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.270
 to the winged pk and how they evolve and 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.819
 for really there it's good 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.380
 healer so that really no pk 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:51.849
 does not die so I was really scared for 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.490
 we are going to look at the pkk as it is 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:56.560
 red he's right in front of the arctic 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.400
 sea ​​is getting off like a 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.470
 mother in your mouth 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.240
 and there you see his life that will begin 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.190
 to go up you see the directions this 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.020
 they make a big fat pile she confessed 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.940
 the life of the pkk that will go back up 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.020
 until he has all his 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.699
 life and there you see now all 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.139
 damage all together now 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:13.300
 cases are related to the mediums saw everything 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:14.590
 the healers it's a huge pile the 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.919
 queen dock in water she is not made 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.030
 touched defense have too far so leroy 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:21.430
 laurent it is also very bad was 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.470
 in a gym a kind of express rage 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.330
 so here I put another jump for that 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.220
 the more salty pk on the other side after 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.860
 on several compartments and that they 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.470
 can leave the village without 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.880
 have to destroy them not so that's it 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.139
 the healer go there is 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.759
 some who will die but that 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.409
 it is not very very serious since I have 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:40.120
 really not bad the ouch of events 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:42.130
 remained almost a dozen still pretty 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.050
 just and does not see the opinion of pk 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.349
 absolutely does not go down even the life of the 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.330
 King 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:47.680
 so there was lagoon laventie queen 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.199
 sick and reinartz becker if they 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.639
 go down directly godmother I had 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:53.289
 still not activated the spell I do not know 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:54.849
 when you activate it here I activate it 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:56.289
 since she was doing 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:57.940
 touch by the cannon and you see that 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:59.800
 and there is still a lot of greasy 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.310
 where there were more people standing in 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.810
 the village 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.789
 frankly I can really do myself 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.590
 full but the big problem was the 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:06.539
 time otherwise I would have put 100% but 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.530
 quietly 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:10.659
 that's the problem with these three pk 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.729
 it's very very long it's not to be 

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:13.389
 quick hop those groups that are just doing 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:16.300
 damages 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:19.900
 so that's not what we can do 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.699
 100% even if they are 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.110
 absolutely they are absolutely not dead 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:24.550
 so for me it was really a 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.880
 big win on this so she has there 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.490
 it was really the perfect example for 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.620
 Peking is 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.389
 see target pk so here I was 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.120
 really happy about this gameplay even though 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:38.160
 this is at the level of time frankly on 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.330
 with five minutes here I like five 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.889
 minutes there frankly it goes and 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.990
 quiet 100% 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:45.150
 here are the defenses more really more 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.949
 nothing to do the healer I think 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:49.289
 that she would not even have the 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:51.509
 rest of healer and that would have done 

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:52.860
 really a huge low gameplay even though 

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:56.759
 it's not a big big village but good 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:59.190
 it's a small hdv 10 nice and that's it 

00:06:56.759 --> 00:07:01.110
 so in any case I hope you'll have 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.180
 really liked this video 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:05.880
 not as usual left a small 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.979
 like and a comment or even 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.300
 share the video or subscribe to my 

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:11.039
 chain it would make me really great 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.569
 pleasure we will end up like 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:14.639
 usually for a next video of 

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:17.120
 violent clash and on those wear you 

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:17.120
 well, go ciao
