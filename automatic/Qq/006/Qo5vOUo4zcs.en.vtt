00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
online classes do them on earth okay so

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.490 
online classes do them on earth okay so
I'm<00:00:45.539> gonna<00:00:45.750> hop<00:00:45.899> on<00:00:47.629> despite<00:00:48.629> those<00:00:49.050> require

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
I'm gonna hop on despite those require

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.029 
I'm gonna hop on despite those require
you<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:50.570> shoes<00:00:51.570> with<00:00:51.949> clips<00:00:54.170> so<00:00:55.170> they're

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
you to have shoes with clips so they're

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.520 
you to have shoes with clips so they're
basically<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.360> Delta<00:00:57.750> local<00:00:58.230> model

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
basically the the Delta local model

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.979 
basically the the Delta local model
which<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.430> with<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.910> three<00:01:00.120> holes<00:01:00.210> because

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
which is with the three holes because

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.329 
which is with the three holes because
you<00:01:01.079> just<00:01:01.260> slip<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.820> any<00:01:02.820> clipping<00:01:03.650> okay<00:01:04.680> so

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
you just slip in any clipping okay so

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.100 
you just slip in any clipping okay so
let's<00:01:05.700> just<00:01:05.880> go<00:01:06.030> over<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.479> nice<00:01:06.659> cool<00:01:06.930> things

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
let's just go over the nice cool things

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.590 
let's just go over the nice cool things
about<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:07.590> as<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.070> said<00:01:08.280> before<00:01:08.450> it<00:01:09.450> has<00:01:09.570> a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
about it so as I said before it has a

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.820 
about it so as I said before it has a
belt-driven<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.700> we<00:01:11.700> just<00:01:12.470> let<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.560> hear<00:01:13.770> our

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
belt-driven so we just let you hear our

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.719 
belt-driven so we just let you hear our
voice<00:01:14.010> sounds<00:01:14.340> like<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.930> with<00:01:16.729> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
voice sounds like and this is with the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.690 
voice sounds like and this is with the
lightest<00:01:18.090> setting<00:01:18.390> right<00:01:18.509> now<00:01:19.400> so<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.610> is

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
lightest setting right now so this is

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.250 
lightest setting right now so this is
like<00:01:20.850> basically<00:01:21.210> no<00:01:21.479> resistance

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.710 

and<00:01:26.260> you<00:01:26.380> hear<00:01:26.560> it<00:01:26.680> it's<00:01:26.830> not<00:01:26.950> really<00:01:27.369> loud<00:01:27.720> and

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
and you hear it it's not really loud and

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.530 
and you hear it it's not really loud and
then<00:01:28.900> I<00:01:29.110> won't<00:01:29.380> go<00:01:29.619> all<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:29.830> way<00:01:29.860> now<00:01:30.450> see<00:01:31.450> the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
then I won't go all the way now see the

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:38.780 
then I won't go all the way now see the
one<00:01:31.659> are<00:01:31.810> harder<00:01:32.050> settings<00:01:34.800> very<00:01:35.800> difficult

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.090 

and<00:01:39.790> again<00:01:40.150> compared<00:01:41.140> to<00:01:41.200> a<00:01:41.290> traditional<00:01:41.500> spin

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
and again compared to a traditional spin

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:49.350 
and again compared to a traditional spin
bike<00:01:42.310> is<00:01:42.820> very<00:01:43.119> quiet<00:01:43.390> and<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.790> brakes<00:01:49.060> and

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
bike is very quiet and the brakes and

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.820 
bike is very quiet and the brakes and
resistance<00:01:49.960> is<00:01:50.200> medic<00:01:50.590> medic<00:01:51.040> driven<00:01:51.820> so<00:01:52.830> it

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
resistance is medic medic driven so it

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.680 
resistance is medic medic driven so it
doesn't<00:01:54.159> use<00:01:54.280> a<00:01:54.310> brake<00:01:54.640> there<00:01:55.119> uses<00:01:55.479> friction

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
doesn't use a brake there uses friction

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.169 
doesn't use a brake there uses friction
to<00:01:56.050> stop<00:01:57.509> okay<00:01:58.830> and<00:01:59.830> let's<00:02:00.340> go<00:02:00.520> over<00:02:00.729> to<00:02:00.759> the

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
to stop okay and let's go over to the

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:03.800 
to stop okay and let's go over to the
panel<00:02:01.539> over<00:02:01.750> here

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
panel over here

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.960 
panel over here
okay<00:02:04.810> so<00:02:04.869> let's<00:02:05.530> turn<00:02:05.740> on<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:05.950> panel<00:02:06.340> the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
okay so let's turn on the panel the

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.050 
okay so let's turn on the panel the
buttons<00:02:07.270> over<00:02:07.450> here<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:09.580> have<00:02:09.789> a<00:02:09.820> headphone

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
buttons over here you have a headphone

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.810 
buttons over here you have a headphone
jack<00:02:10.420> on<00:02:10.570> the<00:02:10.600> side<00:02:10.869> of<00:02:10.899> here<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:12.400> you<00:02:12.670> also

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
jack on the side of here and you also

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.860 
jack on the side of here and you also
have<00:02:13.290> volume<00:02:14.290> up<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:14.680> down<00:02:15.330> so<00:02:16.330> right<00:02:16.630> now<00:02:16.720> I'm

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
have volume up and down so right now I'm

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.960 
have volume up and down so right now I'm
just<00:02:16.930> going<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.290> show<00:02:17.410> off<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.650> sound<00:02:17.970> so

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
just going to show off the sound so

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.180 
just going to show off the sound so
right<00:02:19.540> now<00:02:19.660> I<00:02:19.690> have<00:02:19.989> one<00:02:20.260> ride<00:02:20.500> in<00:02:20.769> progress

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
right now I have one ride in progress

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.470 
right now I have one ride in progress
which<00:02:21.400> I<00:02:21.519> did<00:02:21.700> not<00:02:21.730> finish<00:02:23.790> so<00:02:24.790> I'm<00:02:25.090> gonna<00:02:25.239> pick

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
which I did not finish so I'm gonna pick

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.110 
which I did not finish so I'm gonna pick
that<00:02:25.630> right<00:02:25.690> now<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:27.160> this<00:02:27.550> is<00:02:27.610> basically

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
that right now and this is basically

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.910 
that right now and this is basically
Warners<00:02:28.630> previously<00:02:29.320> recorded<00:02:29.650> classes<00:02:30.870> okay

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
Warners previously recorded classes okay

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.350 
Warners previously recorded classes okay
so<00:02:32.920> right<00:02:33.070> now<00:02:33.190> I<00:02:33.220> have<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.489> sound<00:02:33.730> down<00:02:33.940> so

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
so right now I have the sound down so

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.870 
so right now I have the sound down so
you<00:02:34.420> can't<00:02:34.750> hear<00:02:34.870> right<00:02:35.110> now<00:02:35.260> but<00:02:36.130> is<00:02:36.280> music<00:02:36.670> in

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
you can't hear right now but is music in

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.780 
you can't hear right now but is music in
this<00:02:37.060> instruction<00:02:37.630> from<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.989> instructor<00:02:38.790> you

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
this instruction from the instructor you

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.180 
this instruction from the instructor you
know<00:02:39.910> it's<00:02:40.060> down<00:02:40.209> here<00:02:40.630> I<00:02:40.750> have<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.739> metrics

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
know it's down here I have the metrics

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.680 
know it's down here I have the metrics
so<00:02:42.940> as<00:02:43.239> I'm<00:02:43.420> spinning<00:02:45.239> you<00:02:46.239> can<00:02:46.420> see<00:02:46.540> the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
so as I'm spinning you can see the

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.170 
so as I'm spinning you can see the
output<00:02:46.840> from<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:48.030> class<00:02:49.030> over<00:02:49.329> here<00:02:49.560> so<00:02:51.180> the

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
output from the class over here so the

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.620 
output from the class over here so the
important<00:02:52.780> vectors<00:02:52.900> that<00:02:53.290> give<00:02:53.440> us<00:02:53.590> distance

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
important vectors that give us distance

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.110 
important vectors that give us distance
cadence<00:02:55.630> output<00:02:56.430> resistance<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:57.730> the

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
cadence output resistance and the

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.720 
cadence output resistance and the
calories<00:02:58.450> burn<00:02:58.660> now<00:02:59.290> when<00:02:59.590> I<00:02:59.620> turn<00:03:00.519> the

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
calories burn now when I turn the

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.990 
calories burn now when I turn the
resistance<00:03:01.239> down<00:03:02.340> they'll<00:03:03.340> show<00:03:03.670> the

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
resistance down they'll show the

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.050 
resistance down they'll show the
percentage<00:03:04.540> so<00:03:04.989> this<00:03:05.230> makes<00:03:05.470> it<00:03:05.620> very<00:03:05.650> helpful

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
percentage so this makes it very helpful

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.539 
percentage so this makes it very helpful
for<00:03:07.060> you<00:03:07.299> and<00:03:07.989> keeping<00:03:08.320> your<00:03:09.100> classes

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
for you and keeping your classes

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.039 
for you and keeping your classes
consistent<00:03:10.890> so<00:03:12.390> see<00:03:13.390> over<00:03:13.510> here<00:03:13.570> it's<00:03:13.840> pretty

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
consistent so see over here it's pretty

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.930 
consistent so see over here it's pretty
much<00:03:14.170> it<00:03:14.829> takes<00:03:14.980> like<00:03:15.220> maybe<00:03:15.430> our<00:03:15.579> second<00:03:15.850> note

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
much it takes like maybe our second note

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.050 
much it takes like maybe our second note
is<00:03:16.030> from<00:03:16.269> register<00:03:16.660> but<00:03:17.350> it's<00:03:17.470> pretty<00:03:17.709> fast

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
is from register but it's pretty fast

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.280 
is from register but it's pretty fast
and<00:03:19.060> after<00:03:19.390> a<00:03:19.420> while<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:19.720> start<00:03:19.989> to<00:03:20.109> learn<00:03:20.230> how

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
and after a while you start to learn how

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.060 
and after a while you start to learn how
much<00:03:20.620> of<00:03:21.100> a<00:03:21.850> turn<00:03:22.090> is<00:03:22.480> one<00:03:22.930> or<00:03:23.049> two<00:03:23.109> percent<00:03:23.530> to

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
much of a turn is one or two percent to

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.590 
much of a turn is one or two percent to
increase<00:03:24.420> also<00:03:25.420> at<00:03:25.690> least<00:03:25.870> you<00:03:26.079> could<00:03:27.420> you<00:03:28.420> see

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
increase also at least you could you see

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.509 
increase also at least you could you see
over<00:03:28.750> here<00:03:28.810> you<00:03:28.900> could<00:03:29.109> hide<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.560> values<00:03:30.370> if

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
over here you could hide the values if

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:31.590 
over here you could hide the values if
you<00:03:30.549> don't<00:03:30.730> want<00:03:30.880> to<00:03:30.940> see<00:03:31.090> it<00:03:31.209> like<00:03:31.239> you<00:03:31.480> don't

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
you don't want to see it like you don't

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.870 
you don't want to see it like you don't
want<00:03:31.780> to<00:03:31.840> see<00:03:31.930> that<00:03:32.370> so<00:03:33.370> this<00:03:33.519> is<00:03:33.579> a<00:03:33.699> pretty

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
want to see that so this is a pretty

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.960 
want to see that so this is a pretty
cool<00:03:34.799> also<00:03:35.799> you<00:03:35.980> have<00:03:36.130> a<00:03:36.190> leaderboard<00:03:36.790> with

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
cool also you have a leaderboard with

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:37.380 
cool also you have a leaderboard with
the<00:03:37.090> class

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
the class

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.180 
the class
so<00:03:37.570> you<00:03:37.630> can<00:03:37.780> see<00:03:37.900> over<00:03:37.930> here<00:03:38.170> and<00:03:38.800> again<00:03:39.010> you

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
so you can see over here and again you

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.720 
so you can see over here and again you
can<00:03:39.460> hide<00:03:39.610> it<00:03:39.790> or<00:03:40.330> show<00:03:40.570> it<00:03:40.710> and<00:03:41.710> in<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.430> corner

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
can hide it or show it and in the corner

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.910 
can hide it or show it and in the corner
over<00:03:42.790> here<00:03:42.940> you<00:03:43.300> see<00:03:43.570> how<00:03:43.750> much<00:03:44.140> of<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.740> class

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
over here you see how much of the class

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.080 
over here you see how much of the class
is<00:03:45.160> remaining<00:03:46.470> so<00:03:47.470> this<00:03:48.100> is<00:03:48.220> very<00:03:48.520> cool

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
is remaining so this is very cool

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.650 
is remaining so this is very cool
you<00:03:49.600> spend<00:03:50.130> your<00:03:51.130> 45<00:03:52.030> minutes<00:03:52.360> in<00:03:52.480> this

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
you spend your 45 minutes in this

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.340 
you spend your 45 minutes in this
particular<00:03:52.960> class<00:03:54.600> and<00:03:55.600> you<00:03:55.900> can<00:03:55.930> just<00:03:56.230> go

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
particular class and you can just go

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.690 
particular class and you can just go
through<00:03:56.380> it<00:03:56.710> now<00:03:57.670> after<00:03:58.630> you<00:03:59.020> take<00:03:59.200> the<00:03:59.320> class

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
through it now after you take the class

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.010

the bottom I'll tell you your cadence
resistance<00:04:19.870> speed<00:04:20.680> distance<00:04:21.220> calories<00:04:22.020> if

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
resistance speed distance calories if

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.320 
resistance speed distance calories if
you<00:04:23.110> have<00:04:23.290> a<00:04:23.320> heart<00:04:23.620> moaner<00:04:23.860> you<00:04:24.700> could<00:04:24.910> sync

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
you have a heart moaner you could sync

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.940 
you have a heart moaner you could sync
it<00:04:25.450> to<00:04:25.480> the<00:04:25.690> system<00:04:25.900> and<00:04:26.260> it'll<00:04:26.620> tell<00:04:26.800> you<00:04:26.919> your

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
it to the system and it'll tell you your

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.340 
it to the system and it'll tell you your
heart<00:04:27.190> water<00:04:27.370> I<00:04:27.610> don't<00:04:28.510> have<00:04:28.720> that<00:04:28.870> just<00:04:29.080> yet

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
heart water I don't have that just yet

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.340 
heart water I don't have that just yet
now<00:04:30.220> also<00:04:30.610> on<00:04:30.760> the<00:04:30.910> right<00:04:31.090> I'll<00:04:31.300> list<00:04:31.540> the

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
different classes you've taken and when

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.490 
different classes you've taken and when
you<00:04:34.419> have<00:04:34.570> taken<00:04:34.900> them<00:04:37.020> so<00:04:38.020> we<00:04:38.110> just<00:04:38.140> go<00:04:38.350> back

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
you have taken them so we just go back

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.690 
to me also pretty much there is also a
live<00:04:42.360> class<00:04:43.360> schedule<00:04:43.810> you<00:04:44.700> could

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
live class schedule you could

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.320 
live class schedule you could
participate<00:04:46.140> with<00:04:47.140> other<00:04:47.380> people<00:04:47.860> like

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330

they'll tell you when and you can sign
up<00:04:51.280> for<00:04:51.400> the<00:04:51.610> class<00:04:51.790> probably<00:04:52.240> 10<00:04:52.390> minutes

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
up for the class probably 10 minutes

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.260 
up for the class probably 10 minutes
before<00:04:52.780> I<00:04:53.669> personally<00:04:54.669> have<00:04:54.820> not<00:04:55.000> done<00:04:55.240> that

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
before I personally have not done that

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.110 
before I personally have not done that
yet<00:04:55.650> digit<00:04:56.650> of<00:04:56.740> timing<00:04:57.160> it<00:04:57.760> just<00:04:57.790> not

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
yet digit of timing it just not

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.600 
yet digit of timing it just not
convenient<00:04:58.450> this<00:04:58.750> point<00:04:58.990> but<00:04:59.680> no<00:05:00.040> basically<00:05:00.490> I

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
convenient this point but no basically I

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.920 

also<00:05:24.070> I<00:05:24.250> received<00:05:24.910> an<00:05:25.030> email<00:05:25.120> from<00:05:25.300> peloton

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
also I received an email from peloton

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.200 
also I received an email from peloton
that<00:05:26.200> they<00:05:27.160> work<00:05:27.340> out<00:05:27.520> on<00:05:27.610> a<00:05:27.669> water<00:05:27.850> bottle

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
that they work out on a water bottle

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.870 
that they work out on a water bottle
holder<00:05:28.479> so<00:05:29.050> it's<00:05:29.740> going<00:05:29.950> to<00:05:30.040> be<00:05:30.280> basically

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
holder so it's going to be basically

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.870 
holder so it's going to be basically
around<00:05:31.240> this<00:05:31.479> area<00:05:31.900> I'm<00:05:32.080> thinking<00:05:32.560> maybe<00:05:33.490> here

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
around this area I'm thinking maybe here

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.210 
around this area I'm thinking maybe here
here<00:05:34.390> here<00:05:34.720> or<00:05:34.750> something<00:05:35.169> like<00:05:35.290> that<00:05:35.350> the

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
here here or something like that the

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.170 
here here or something like that the
reason<00:05:36.370> why<00:05:36.550> I'm<00:05:36.610> saying<00:05:36.760> that<00:05:36.880> is<00:05:37.000> because

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
reason why I'm saying that is because

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.790 
reason why I'm saying that is because
they're<00:05:37.450> saying<00:05:37.690> that<00:05:37.870> if<00:05:38.200> molding<00:05:38.680> the

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
they're saying that if molding the

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.510 
they're saying that if molding the
plastic<00:05:39.390> on<00:05:40.390> top<00:05:40.570> of<00:05:40.720> the<00:05:40.810> brake<00:05:41.020> pad<00:05:41.280> so<00:05:42.280> it's

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
plastic on top of the brake pad so it's

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.520 
plastic on top of the brake pad so it's
probably<00:05:42.760> going<00:05:42.910> to<00:05:42.970> be<00:05:43.060> one<00:05:43.270> piece<00:05:43.570> and<00:05:43.900> it's

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
probably going to be one piece and it's

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.170 
probably going to be one piece and it's
going<00:05:44.680> to<00:05:44.830> cover<00:05:45.070> this<00:05:45.490> piece<00:05:45.729> from<00:05:45.849> getting

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
going to cover this piece from getting

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.270 
going to cover this piece from getting
wet<00:05:46.360> from<00:05:46.599> your<00:05:46.810> sweating<00:05:47.140> and<00:05:47.620> believe<00:05:48.130> me

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
wet from your sweating and believe me

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.320 
wet from your sweating and believe me
you<00:05:48.460> do<00:05:48.640> sweat<00:05:48.940> after<00:05:49.360> taking<00:05:49.630> a<00:05:49.810> class

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
you do sweat after taking a class

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.839 
you do sweat after taking a class

00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:14.629 
the distance to see here's the one that

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:16.839 
the distance to see here's the one that
you<00:06:14.720> could<00:06:14.870> control<00:06:15.169> the<00:06:15.319> height<00:06:15.550> the<00:06:16.550> cool

thing<00:06:17.030> about<00:06:17.150> these<00:06:17.530> handles<00:06:18.530> is<00:06:18.770> that<00:06:18.979> you

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:19.129 
thing about these handles is that you

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:21.369 
thing about these handles is that you
could<00:06:19.310> push<00:06:19.520> in<00:06:19.639> the<00:06:19.789> button<00:06:20.090> and<00:06:20.389> you<00:06:21.229> could

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:21.379 
could push in the button and you could

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:23.499 
could push in the button and you could
twist<00:06:21.740> where<00:06:22.159> you<00:06:22.310> want<00:06:22.580> the<00:06:22.819> handle<00:06:23.300> to<00:06:23.479> be

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:23.509 
twist where you want the handle to be

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:26.709 
twist where you want the handle to be
facing<00:06:23.840> and<00:06:24.500> that<00:06:24.530> could<00:06:25.400> avoid<00:06:25.639> poking<00:06:26.419> you

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:26.719 
facing and that could avoid poking you

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:30.969 
facing and that could avoid poking you
in<00:06:26.750> a<00:06:26.900> leg<00:06:27.110> or<00:06:27.349> in<00:06:27.409> the<00:06:27.500> arm<00:06:29.050> the<00:06:30.050> only<00:06:30.500> one<00:06:30.710> it's

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:30.979 
in a leg or in the arm the only one it's

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:32.800 
in a leg or in the arm the only one it's
a<00:06:31.039> little<00:06:31.250> difficult<00:06:31.430> is<00:06:31.849> the<00:06:32.120> handlebars<00:06:32.599> and

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.810 
a little difficult is the handlebars and

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.869 
a little difficult is the handlebars and
that's<00:06:33.469> probably<00:06:33.770> due<00:06:33.949> to<00:06:33.979> the<00:06:34.280> weight<00:06:34.460> of<00:06:34.490> the

00:06:34.869 --> 00:06:34.879 
that's probably due to the weight of the

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:39.640 
that's probably due to the weight of the
monitor<00:06:37.150> but<00:06:38.150> otherwise<00:06:38.330> very<00:06:39.169> easy<00:06:39.349> to<00:06:39.530> do

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
monitor but otherwise very easy to do
