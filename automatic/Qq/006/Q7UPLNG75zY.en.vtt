00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500 
hi there welcome to the Shu Ren a

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.780 
hi there welcome to the Shu Ren a
drawing<00:00:01.829> channel<00:00:02.159> and<00:00:02.250> today<00:00:02.460> I'm<00:00:02.639> going<00:00:02.730> to

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
drawing channel and today I'm going to

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.640 
drawing channel and today I'm going to
show<00:00:02.970> you<00:00:03.000> how<00:00:03.179> to<00:00:03.240> you<00:00:03.480> draw<00:00:03.780> this<00:00:03.990> wild<00:00:04.500> old

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
show you how to you draw this wild old

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.889 
show you how to you draw this wild old
crazy<00:00:05.069> retro<00:00:05.670> rocket<00:00:06.180> but<00:00:06.359> let's<00:00:06.540> not<00:00:06.720> talk

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
crazy retro rocket but let's not talk

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:07.340 
crazy retro rocket but let's not talk
about<00:00:06.930> it

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
about it

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.580 
about it
let's<00:00:08.130> blast<00:00:08.700> off<00:00:11.150> let's<00:00:12.150> have<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.870> line<00:00:13.349> of

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
let's blast off let's have a line of

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.439 
let's blast off let's have a line of
flight<00:00:13.830> going<00:00:14.309> that<00:00:14.549> way<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:15.830> then<00:00:16.830> you<00:00:17.449> want

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
flight going that way and then you want

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.500 
flight going that way and then you want
to<00:00:18.510> draw<00:00:18.779> an<00:00:19.140> arc<00:00:20.570> down<00:00:21.570> there<00:00:22.880> and<00:00:23.880> another

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
to draw an arc down there and another

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.250 
to draw an arc down there and another
one<00:00:26.660> going<00:00:27.660> there<00:00:29.179> this<00:00:30.179> is<00:00:30.359> where<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.720> rocket

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
one going there this is where the rocket

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.740 
one going there this is where the rocket
motor<00:00:31.410> will<00:00:31.740> be<00:00:33.290> and<00:00:34.760> then<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.880> want<00:00:36.120> arcs

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
motor will be and then you want arcs

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.069 
motor will be and then you want arcs
coming<00:00:36.930> down<00:00:37.320> here<00:00:37.800> like<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.719> so<00:00:39.719> they<00:00:39.870> want

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
coming down here like that so they want

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.560 
coming down here like that so they want
to<00:00:40.140> come<00:00:40.260> over<00:00:40.410> more<00:00:40.770> like<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:44.000> and<00:00:45.000> then<00:00:45.270> arc

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
to come over more like that and then arc

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.930 
to come over more like that and then arc
coming<00:00:46.200> there<00:00:46.620> as<00:00:46.890> well<00:00:48.140> let's<00:00:49.140> think<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.559> in

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.450 

just<00:00:52.660> take<00:00:52.870> your<00:00:53.050> time<00:00:53.290> and<00:00:53.530> smoothly<00:00:54.070> draw

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
just take your time and smoothly draw

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.500 
just take your time and smoothly draw
those<00:00:54.700> lines<00:00:55.030> along<00:00:55.360> and<00:00:57.120> don't<00:00:58.120> worry<00:00:58.360> about

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
those lines along and don't worry about

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.340 
those lines along and don't worry about
making<00:00:58.780> it<00:00:59.050> perfect<00:00:59.110> just<00:00:59.830> have<00:00:59.890> fun<00:01:00.100> and<00:01:01.350> just

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
making it perfect just have fun and just

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.290 
making it perfect just have fun and just
take<00:01:02.620> those<00:01:02.770> curves<00:01:03.130> and<00:01:03.430> sometimes<00:01:04.150> it's

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
take those curves and sometimes it's

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.330 
take those curves and sometimes it's
good<00:01:04.449> to<00:01:04.540> kind<00:01:04.660> of<00:01:04.780> get<00:01:04.900> your<00:01:05.050> hand<00:01:05.380> in<00:01:05.980> turn

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
good to kind of get your hand in turn

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.860 
good to kind of get your hand in turn

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
the paper round to be able to help you

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.260 
the paper round to be able to help you
with<00:01:08.020> the<00:01:08.140> curves<00:01:08.440> like<00:01:08.770> that<00:01:09.010> and<00:01:09.880> then<00:01:10.030> draw

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
with the curves like that and then draw

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.300 
with the curves like that and then draw
the<00:01:10.330> engine<00:01:10.870> in<00:01:11.020> with<00:01:11.200> some<00:01:11.380> kind<00:01:11.710> of<00:01:11.800> stripy

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
the engine in with some kind of stripy

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.300 
the engine in with some kind of stripy
bits<00:01:12.520> across<00:01:13.480> the<00:01:13.630> bottom<00:01:13.780> there<00:01:14.140> and<00:01:15.040> up<00:01:15.190> at

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
bits across the bottom there and up at

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.969 
bits across the bottom there and up at
the<00:01:15.400> top<00:01:15.640> leave<00:01:16.540> a<00:01:16.570> little<00:01:16.930> little<00:01:17.440> bit<00:01:17.680> there

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
the top leave a little little bit there

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.130 
the top leave a little little bit there
that's<00:01:18.010> white<00:01:18.580> and<00:01:18.910> then<00:01:19.060> color<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:19.990> whole

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
that's white and then color the whole

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.370 
that's white and then color the whole
lot<00:01:20.380> in<00:01:20.560> or<00:01:20.770> shading<00:01:21.310> in<00:01:21.490> black<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.930> then<00:01:23.170> now

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
lot in or shading in black and then now

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.180 
lot in or shading in black and then now
we're<00:01:23.530> going<00:01:23.620> to<00:01:23.680> draw<00:01:23.860> a<00:01:23.890> kind<00:01:24.160> of

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
we're going to draw a kind of

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.820 
we're going to draw a kind of
checkerboard<00:01:24.820> pattern<00:01:24.910> and<00:01:25.680> split<00:01:26.680> that<00:01:26.770> up

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
checkerboard pattern and split that up

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.700 
checkerboard pattern and split that up
into<00:01:27.160> four<00:01:27.460> line<00:01:28.300> down<00:01:28.510> the<00:01:28.660> middle<00:01:28.690> and<00:01:29.229> then

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
into four line down the middle and then

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.380 
into four line down the middle and then
if<00:01:29.920> we<00:01:30.100> make<00:01:30.310> that<00:01:30.520> kind<00:01:30.820> of<00:01:30.850> slightly<00:01:31.150> uneven

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
if we make that kind of slightly uneven

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.600 
if we make that kind of slightly uneven
it'll<00:01:31.750> help<00:01:32.170> to<00:01:32.380> make<00:01:32.530> it<00:01:32.710> look<00:01:32.920> a<00:01:33.100> bit<00:01:33.160> round

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
it'll help to make it look a bit round

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.280 
it'll help to make it look a bit round
it'll<00:01:33.850> give<00:01:34.000> it<00:01:34.090> a<00:01:34.150> perspective<00:01:34.600> thing<00:01:35.080> and

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
it'll give it a perspective thing and

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.960 
it'll give it a perspective thing and
then<00:01:35.380> fill<00:01:35.650> in<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:35.800> checkerboard<00:01:36.220> pattern<00:01:36.460> a

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
then fill in the checkerboard pattern a

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.469 
then fill in the checkerboard pattern a
bit<00:01:37.840> of<00:01:38.020> shading<00:01:38.350> there<00:01:38.740> on<00:01:38.979> the<00:01:39.369> rocket<00:01:40.270> motor

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
bit of shading there on the rocket motor

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:41.580 
bit of shading there on the rocket motor
and<00:01:41.140> we're<00:01:41.229> going<00:01:41.350> to<00:01:41.410> do<00:01:41.470> another

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
and we're going to do another

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.560 
and we're going to do another
checkerboard<00:01:42.190> on<00:01:42.310> the<00:01:42.430> tips<00:01:42.670> of<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:43.060> tail

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
checkerboard on the tips of the tail

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.520 
checkerboard on the tips of the tail
fins<00:01:43.930> like<00:01:44.320> that<00:01:44.530> as<00:01:44.710> well<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.790> just<00:01:46.690> just<00:01:47.140> you

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
fins like that as well and just just you

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.230 
fins like that as well and just just you
know<00:01:47.680> draw<00:01:47.920> them<00:01:48.070> in<00:01:48.190> the<00:01:48.220> squares<00:01:48.310> really<00:01:49.060> and

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
know draw them in the squares really and

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.880 
know draw them in the squares really and
then<00:01:49.390> shade<00:01:49.930> them<00:01:50.080> all<00:01:50.200> in<00:01:50.350> as<00:01:50.500> a<00:01:50.530> checkerboard

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
then shade them all in as a checkerboard

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.969 
then shade them all in as a checkerboard
effect<00:01:51.160> a<00:01:51.990> bit<00:01:52.990> more<00:01:53.170> shading<00:01:53.410> and<00:01:53.740> then<00:01:53.830> the

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
effect a bit more shading and then the

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.660 
effect a bit more shading and then the
windows<00:01:54.340> draw<00:01:54.610> circles<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:56.530> have<00:01:56.979> four<00:01:57.250> circles

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
windows draw circles I have four circles

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.499 
windows draw circles I have four circles
four<00:01:57.910> windows<00:01:58.179> on<00:01:58.390> this<00:01:58.509> one<00:01:58.750> and<00:01:59.880> then<00:02:00.880> draw

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
four windows on this one and then draw

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.290 
four windows on this one and then draw
little<00:02:01.690> circles<00:02:02.220> inside<00:02:03.220> and<00:02:03.580> you<00:02:03.759> just<00:02:04.030> take

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
little circles inside and you just take

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.779 
little circles inside and you just take
your<00:02:04.539> time<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:05.250> if<00:02:06.250> you<00:02:06.369> want<00:02:06.550> a<00:02:06.610> natural

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
your time and if you want a natural

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.570 
your time and if you want a natural
circles<00:02:07.569> can't<00:02:08.020> see<00:02:08.200> my<00:02:08.350> hat<00:02:08.560> real<00:02:08.920> circles

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
circles can't see my hat real circles

video<00:02:10.210> and<00:02:10.840> then<00:02:11.110> share<00:02:11.770> them<00:02:12.010> in<00:02:12.160> just<00:02:12.340> from

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
video and then share them in just from

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.920 
video and then share them in just from
the<00:02:12.700> top<00:02:12.910> there<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.300> give<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:13.450> kind<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:13.810> a

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
the top there to give a kind of a

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.840 
the top there to give a kind of a
reflected<00:02:14.920> look<00:02:15.280> like<00:02:15.640> that<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:17.350> then<00:02:18.130> put

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
reflected look like that and then put

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.360 
reflected look like that and then put
some<00:02:19.000> little<00:02:19.090> dots<00:02:19.620> all<00:02:20.620> around<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:21.250> outside

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
some little dots all around the outside

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.900 
some little dots all around the outside
of<00:02:22.180> each<00:02:22.360> one<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:25.980> it'll<00:02:26.980> make<00:02:27.430> it<00:02:27.670> I<00:02:27.819> think

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
of each one and it'll make it I think

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:28.949 
of each one and it'll make it I think
that's<00:02:28.180> what<00:02:28.330> makes<00:02:28.510> it<00:02:28.630> look<00:02:28.690> a<00:02:28.780> bit<00:02:28.810> more

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
that's what makes it look a bit more

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.540 
that's what makes it look a bit more
retro<00:02:29.440> because<00:02:29.620> you<00:02:29.740> get<00:02:29.920> all<00:02:29.950> these<00:02:30.220> kind<00:02:30.520> of

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
retro because you get all these kind of

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.540 
retro because you get all these kind of
rivets<00:02:30.910> on<00:02:31.569> the<00:02:32.020> outside<00:02:32.410> whereas<00:02:32.920> now<00:02:33.190> with<00:02:33.459> I

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
rivets on the outside whereas now with I

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.330 
rivets on the outside whereas now with I
suppose<00:02:33.790> you<00:02:33.970> know<00:02:34.090> with<00:02:34.240> a<00:02:34.270> sleek<00:02:34.870> alien<00:02:35.800> kind

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
suppose you know with a sleek alien kind

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.820 
suppose you know with a sleek alien kind
of<00:02:36.780> spaceships<00:02:37.780> you<00:02:37.930> want<00:02:38.140> them<00:02:38.319> to<00:02:38.680> look

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
of spaceships you want them to look

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.820 
of spaceships you want them to look
really<00:02:39.100> smooth<00:02:39.459> but<00:02:39.819> I<00:02:39.880> think<00:02:40.120> an<00:02:40.209> old<00:02:40.270> retro

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
really smooth but I think an old retro

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.740 
really smooth but I think an old retro
especially<00:02:41.830> if<00:02:41.890> it's<00:02:41.980> all<00:02:42.069> kind<00:02:42.280> of<00:02:42.750> bang

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
especially if it's all kind of bang

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.140 
especially if it's all kind of bang
together<00:02:43.959> with<00:02:44.380> rivets<00:02:44.590> and<00:02:45.010> nails<00:02:45.310> and<00:02:45.730> bits

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
together with rivets and nails and bits

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.120 
together with rivets and nails and bits
of<00:02:46.270> glue<00:02:46.510> and<00:02:46.750> string<00:02:47.020> and<00:02:47.260> sealing<00:02:47.620> wax<00:02:47.770> so

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
of glue and string and sealing wax so

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.470 
of glue and string and sealing wax so
you<00:02:48.190> need<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.580> see<00:02:48.760> all<00:02:48.819> these<00:02:48.970> little<00:02:49.120> dots

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
you need to see all these little dots

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.260 
you need to see all these little dots
and<00:02:49.810> lines<00:02:49.990> to<00:02:50.560> show<00:02:50.950> how<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.670> things<00:02:52.000> been

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
and lines to show how the things been

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.020 
and lines to show how the things been
put<00:02:52.480> together<00:02:53.370> it's<00:02:54.370> just<00:02:54.580> good<00:02:54.760> I<00:02:54.970> think

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
put together it's just good I think

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.339 
put together it's just good I think
that's<00:02:55.240> what<00:02:55.420> helps<00:02:55.660> to<00:02:55.750> make<00:02:55.900> it<00:02:56.020> look<00:02:56.140> a<00:02:56.200> bit

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
that's what helps to make it look a bit

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.839 
that's what helps to make it look a bit
old-fashioned

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
old-fashioned

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:04.089 
old-fashioned
and<00:03:01.209> lots<00:03:02.209> and<00:03:02.450> lots<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:02.840> lots<00:03:02.959> and<00:03:03.439> lots<00:03:03.499> and

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
and lots and lots and lots and lots and

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.280 
and lots and lots and lots and lots and
lots<00:03:04.219> of<00:03:04.459> little<00:03:04.670> dots<00:03:04.969> all<00:03:05.299> the<00:03:05.359> way<00:03:05.599> across<00:03:05.840> I

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
lots of little dots all the way across I

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.309 
lots of little dots all the way across I
needed<00:03:06.829> on<00:03:06.950> one<00:03:07.159> side<00:03:07.430> of<00:03:07.819> the<00:03:08.180> line<00:03:08.359> because

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
needed on one side of the line because

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.979 
needed on one side of the line because
if<00:03:09.469> they're<00:03:09.650> kind<00:03:09.859> of<00:03:09.920> folded<00:03:10.310> over<00:03:10.459> and<00:03:10.989> those

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
if they're kind of folded over and those

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.429 
if they're kind of folded over and those
rivets<00:03:12.230> hold<00:03:12.590> that<00:03:12.799> the<00:03:13.010> folds<00:03:13.340> together<00:03:14.439> and

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:15.439 
rivets hold that the folds together and

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:18.039 
rivets hold that the folds together and
then<00:03:15.620> shade<00:03:16.250> down<00:03:16.730> just<00:03:17.150> one<00:03:17.359> side<00:03:17.659> don't<00:03:17.959> go

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
then shade down just one side don't go

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.179 
then shade down just one side don't go
right<00:03:18.379> to<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.859> edge<00:03:20.620> leave<00:03:21.620> a<00:03:21.650> little<00:03:21.950> bit<00:03:22.069> on

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:22.189 
right to the edge leave a little bit on

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:24.009 
right to the edge leave a little bit on
one<00:03:22.370> side<00:03:22.609> and<00:03:22.819> then<00:03:22.939> we'll<00:03:23.090> just<00:03:23.359> give<00:03:23.629> a<00:03:23.659> kind

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
one side and then we'll just give a kind

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.830 
one side and then we'll just give a kind
of<00:03:24.079> sense<00:03:24.650> of<00:03:25.389> three-dimensional<00:03:26.389> Ness<00:03:26.719> I

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
of sense of three-dimensional Ness I

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.740 
of sense of three-dimensional Ness I
just<00:03:29.840> move<00:03:30.019> that<00:03:30.230> around<00:03:30.379> and<00:03:31.450> then<00:03:32.450> we<00:03:32.569> draw

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
just move that around and then we draw

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.140 
just move that around and then we draw
the<00:03:32.810> rocket<00:03:33.370> stuff<00:03:34.370> coming<00:03:34.730> out<00:03:34.819> of<00:03:34.939> the<00:03:35.030> end

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
the rocket stuff coming out of the end

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.589 
the rocket stuff coming out of the end
was<00:03:35.329> that<00:03:35.540> good<00:03:35.930> burp<00:03:36.200> or<00:03:36.590> that<00:03:37.129> stuff<00:03:37.430> and<00:03:37.639> I

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
was that good burp or that stuff and I

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.240 
was that good burp or that stuff and I
would<00:03:39.049> draw<00:03:39.230> a<00:03:39.260> smoke<00:03:39.560> ring<00:03:39.769> I'll<00:03:39.949> show<00:03:40.189> you

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.979 
would draw a smoke ring I'll show you
show<00:03:41.000> you<00:03:41.060> how<00:03:41.180> to<00:03:41.239> draw<00:03:41.449> a<00:03:41.480> smoke<00:03:41.719> ring<00:03:41.840> on

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
show you how to draw a smoke ring on

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.959 
show you how to draw a smoke ring on
draw<00:03:42.199> stuff<00:03:42.590> real<00:03:42.859> easy<00:03:43.069> as<00:03:43.370> well<00:03:43.549> if<00:03:43.730> you<00:03:43.819> want

to make a t-shirt of this I think this

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.020 
to make a t-shirt of this I think this
will<00:03:51.769> make<00:03:51.919> a<00:03:51.949> really<00:03:52.040> good<00:03:52.340> t-shirt<00:03:52.730> I'll<00:03:52.849> put

smoke<00:03:58.879> ring<00:03:59.150> there<00:03:59.359> and<00:03:59.750> then<00:04:00.019> we'll<00:04:00.139> have

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
smoke ring there and then we'll have

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.500 
smoke ring there and then we'll have
some<00:04:00.260> more<00:04:00.560> kind<00:04:00.859> of<00:04:00.949> rocket<00:04:01.370> thrust<00:04:01.849> thrust<00:04:02.209> I
