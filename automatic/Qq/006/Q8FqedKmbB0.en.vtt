00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
feel it it feels protected like there's

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.100 
feel it it feels protected like there's
some<00:00:54.700> sort<00:00:54.850> of<00:00:54.940> coating<00:00:55.239> over<00:00:55.480> it<00:00:55.540> so<00:00:55.750> it<00:00:55.870> won't

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
some sort of coating over it so it won't

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.690 
some sort of coating over it so it won't
just<00:00:56.230> get<00:00:56.530> dirty<00:00:56.800> on<00:00:56.920> you<00:00:59.040> the<00:01:00.040> case<00:01:00.220> is<00:01:00.430> made

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
design you can see the fabric there on

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.450 
design you can see the fabric there on
the<00:01:32.710> back<00:01:32.890> I<00:01:33.160> got<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:33.790> red<00:01:33.970> one<00:01:34.150> which<00:01:34.480> is<00:01:34.510> Hall

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.139 

ok<00:01:45.740> so<00:01:45.799> now<00:01:46.070> I'm<00:01:46.189> going<00:01:46.340> to<00:01:46.399> show<00:01:46.460> you<00:01:46.579> how<00:01:46.610> what

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
ok so now I'm going to show you how what

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:48.670 
ok so now I'm going to show you how what
it<00:01:47.270> looks<00:01:47.390> like<00:01:47.539> inside<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:48.140> actual<00:01:48.320> iphone

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
it looks like inside the actual iphone

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.950 
it looks like inside the actual iphone
four<00:01:49.159> you<00:01:49.729> notice<00:01:49.909> the<00:01:50.210> camera<00:01:50.539> cutout<00:01:50.810> is

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
four you notice the camera cutout is

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.690 
four you notice the camera cutout is
pretty<00:01:51.229> large<00:01:51.530> so<00:01:52.189> you're<00:01:52.310> not<00:01:52.429> gonna<00:01:52.549> have

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
pretty large so you're not gonna have

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.639 
pretty large so you're not gonna have
any<00:01:52.850> of<00:01:52.909> those<00:01:53.000> flash<00:01:53.450> problems<00:01:54.140> with<00:01:54.409> you<00:01:54.530> do

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
any of those flash problems with you do

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.370 
any of those flash problems with you do
what<00:01:55.369> you<00:01:55.490> do<00:01:55.640> have<00:01:55.789> with<00:01:56.000> other<00:01:56.149> cases<00:01:56.450> all

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
what you do have with other cases all

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.590 
what you do have with other cases all
the<00:01:57.439> boards<00:01:57.890> have<00:01:58.100> originally<00:01:58.759> cutout<00:01:59.270> area

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
the boards have originally cutout area

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.870 
the boards have originally cutout area
so<00:01:59.840> you<00:01:59.869> can<00:02:00.259> get<00:02:01.100> into<00:02:01.310> it

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.760 

so<00:02:04.880> to<00:02:04.940> put<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.210> case<00:02:05.390> on<00:02:05.570> it<00:02:06.020> is<00:02:06.140> a<00:02:06.170> two<00:02:06.530> piece

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
so to put the case on it is a two piece

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.550 
so to put the case on it is a two piece
design<00:02:06.800> as<00:02:07.400> I<00:02:07.520> said<00:02:07.700> before<00:02:07.870> so<00:02:08.870> what<00:02:09.440> you're

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
design as I said before so what you're

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.840 
design as I said before so what you're
going<00:02:09.680> to<00:02:09.770> what<00:02:10.010> you're<00:02:10.130> going<00:02:10.250> to<00:02:10.340> do<00:02:10.430> is<00:02:10.640> take

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
going to what you're going to do is take

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.700 
going to what you're going to do is take
the<00:02:11.000> bottom<00:02:11.360> half<00:02:11.540> and<00:02:11.780> just<00:02:12.050> put<00:02:12.230> it<00:02:12.260> into<00:02:12.680> the

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
the bottom half and just put it into the

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:19.690 
the bottom half and just put it into the
iphone<00:02:17.230> if<00:02:18.230> it's<00:02:18.620> it<00:02:18.740> really<00:02:18.770> nicely<00:02:19.250> you<00:02:19.580> have

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
iphone if it's it really nicely you have

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.890 
iphone if it's it really nicely you have
to<00:02:19.790> push<00:02:19.940> down<00:02:19.970> a<00:02:20.180> little<00:02:20.330> bit<00:02:20.450> though<00:02:20.660> and

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
to push down a little bit though and

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.710 
to push down a little bit though and
then<00:02:21.710> for<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.010> top<00:02:22.220> piece<00:02:22.460> on<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:22.940> then<00:02:23.600> we

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
then for the top piece on and then we

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.810 
then for the top piece on and then we
have<00:02:23.750> to<00:02:23.840> do<00:02:23.990> is<00:02:24.080> just<00:02:24.230> snap<00:02:24.440> it<00:02:24.470> on<00:02:24.770> it's<00:02:25.700> a

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
have to do is just snap it on it's a

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.700 
have to do is just snap it on it's a
little<00:02:26.090> difficult<00:02:26.270> to<00:02:26.570> get<00:02:26.720> off<00:02:26.870> which<00:02:27.530> is<00:02:27.680> a

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
little difficult to get off which is a

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.560 
little difficult to get off which is a
