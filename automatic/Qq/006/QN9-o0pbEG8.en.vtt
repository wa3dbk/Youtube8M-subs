 genius that rotten me from my day of 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.180

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.060
 say that when I want three players a 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.530
 thing it takes minium that I 'm here 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.640
 before the mean of the fact that they 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.350
 make sure it works for 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.430
 I stop 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.300
 so all day long I 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.060
 thought about how to do 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.140
 I inquired it's more about 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.050

 test now but it looks 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:10.720
 seriously so I came across the site 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:15.970
 vitalize wrongly but what is it 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.890
 that it's basically good that's going to change the 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.220
 windows display language that me

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.850
 I can not change by default 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.490
 thanks to windows the display in English 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.880
 or French 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.229
 so that was problematic so what 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.720

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.210
 vista windows 7 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.890

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.190
 2002 following me I do not care I have 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.450
 windows 7 should you download a leap 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.530
 to you choose your language before 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:54.220
 in which wanted to put me I 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:57.100
 more English even say it's better I 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.740
 check as never know i'm pretty 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.320
 strong will fall 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:04.660
 here is a pre- card you click on 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.700
 their lives so yes to download 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.420
 users but when it's for my 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.530
 beginnings I'm fine in the 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.640
 Description anyway but Norman 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.640
 it's done here on download 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.490
 you are so good I'm fine 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.490
 direct in the description 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.270
 good especially you do well as I 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.430
 do so I'm going I'm still 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.950
 cut the video while his room 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.360
 face because your 20 minutes of video 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.670
 in front of the bar that is advancing very small 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.090
 small is a bit annoying I 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:57.410
 so I'll do it alone 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.000
 know that during installation your 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.100
 windows is likely to range 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.440
 but then really really lag like 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.420
 me there for example once about 5 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.210
 seconds to click to sion a trick me 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.920
 I tell you I come back after more 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.080
 or less 15 16 minutes we will be finished 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.400
 so go on wait for it to be 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.320
 ended up anyway we end up when 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.260
 it's over she has all the baths so 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:24.080
 that's how you know 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:25.820
 now my pc in english you 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:31.370
 present all those document is music 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:32.300
 to your computer after no everything is not going 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.900
 it's not in English and its mesh 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.880
 document 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.330
 but I had who I am a noob 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.070
 stop I'm a noob so you have to 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.960
 know that once you're done 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:47.900
 within 20 minutes of waiting more or 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:49.370
 less good it took 15 minutes 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:54.260
 will you say something to explain on 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:55.520
 exists and you restart there is actually 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.060
 a restart of your computer as 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.460
 quite simply 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:04.190
 in the beginning when you go restart yves 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:07.340
 reach 1 can be slow because he 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:11.570
 will have to preconfigure everything but 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.770
 in principle it should still not 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.450
 take too long and it should 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.040
 return 1.8 is normal later 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:20.120
