00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 well, it 's all alone 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.589
 example we find ourselves today 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.660
 for a new video 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.389
 today I'm going to talk to you about 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.920
 return of the flying taxi yes because if you me 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.259
 follow for quite some time you have 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.000
 could see that before the game was flying 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.550
 the taxi name its date of the 1.7 I think 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.230
 so here's where I show you that 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.109
 the taxi is exactly the same as 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.060
 you exactly what me bah actually 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.939
 I am obliged to lead him with and the r 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.619
 you know the planes the go 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.510
 mallard the aerobatic aircraft bah me 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.550
 it is as if it is an aerobatic opinion 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.500
 it's a pity I do not have the sound of the game 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.210
 I have not and I forgot to reduce the 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.500
 sound of the game because in fact to what 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.820
 cake it's a little hot sometimes 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.739
 configurations when we are one but 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.300
 like that well we do not confide 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.030
 and lower than I do I do not 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.590
 the configs of the blow well that the rage what 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.059
 when I'm not preparing a video there I'm 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.649

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.570
 inform wanted wanted to surrender the link at all 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.949
 in the description 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.420
 so do not worry about the evening link 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.149
 in the registration staner mend a fire 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.640
 so for that they say yeah virus 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:04.979
 mediafire virus itself makes the virus 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.810
 canes so that's so hop so there you 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.909

 pause mode hey the adolphe believed that 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.560
 I was going to spit but not because 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.760

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.250
 like the punch on the other hand to make a 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.490
 backflip just like in the stuff from to 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.720

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.600
