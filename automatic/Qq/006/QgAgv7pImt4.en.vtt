sorcerer or plate like this and normally
I<00:02:06.700> would<00:02:06.880> say<00:02:07.119> check<00:02:07.780> it<00:02:07.960> for<00:02:08.170> a<00:02:08.200> skin<00:02:08.560> but<00:02:08.860> as

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
I would say check it for a skin but as

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.919 
I would say check it for a skin but as
you<00:02:09.340> can<00:02:09.459> see<00:02:09.520> it's<00:02:10.000> well<00:02:10.239> and<00:02:10.360> truly<00:02:10.509> set

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
you can see it's well and truly set

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.320 
you can see it's well and truly set
there<00:02:11.200> anyway<00:02:12.070> so<00:02:12.130> clearly<00:02:12.700> this<00:02:12.880> is<00:02:12.940> ready

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
there anyway so clearly this is ready

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.360 
there anyway so clearly this is ready
but<00:02:13.600> just<00:02:14.080> to<00:02:14.170> show<00:02:14.350> you<00:02:14.410> this<00:02:15.190> is<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:16.320> skin

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
but just to show you this is the skin

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:26.520 
but just to show you this is the skin
that's<00:02:19.110> forming<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:22.800> therefore<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:26.140> is<00:02:26.350> now

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
that's forming and therefore this is now

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:39.160 
that's forming and therefore this is now
ready<00:02:26.800> to<00:02:27.180> go<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:29.200> haunt<00:02:29.410> sterilized<00:02:29.920> jars
