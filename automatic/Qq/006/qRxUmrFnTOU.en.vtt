00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.460
 you knew that in germany the number of 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.460
 people hospitalized for an attack 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.590
 cardiac is three times greater on 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.659
 Christmas good this is because of the great 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.699
 stress that goes to buy gifts 

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:22.579
 and meet the high expectations 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:25.929
 of family and friends if you live in 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.929
 germany take care 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.340
 Take care of yourself 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.250
 in this video I'm going to talk about a topic 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.839
 that many have asked me is a bit 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.479
 common in your comments 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:50.210
 So I decided to talk about him 

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:52.519
 today we are going to talk about the tail of the 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.649
 iguanas well first of all for what 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.920
 the tail is good if you do not know 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.920
 yet 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.340
 first of all in case you did not know the 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.560
 Iguanas tail is your main 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.840
 defense for any predator this 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.940
 they occupy it like a whip type and the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.030
 truth is that when they are girls they already give 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.920
 pretty strong pigtails imagine one 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.510
 adult 2-meter iguana that has a 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.120
 coletazo sure you'll give a 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.330
 very large cut apart how can you 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:28.050
 appreciate at the top of the 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.630
 Tail of the iguanas brings these piquitos 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.270
 because they also hurt a lot when giving a 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.270
 can cut you very easy but 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.490
 good for the iguanas the tail is that is 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.550
 something that will surely hurt you 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.800
 a lot if you approach them now because 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.930
 the iguanas lose their tail good to 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.780
 times the iguanas to save his life 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.780
 occupy as a last option drop their tail 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.890
 the booty 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.299
 because good if a dog goes after them and 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.119
 is almost ready to bite 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.950
 loose in the tail and the dog logically 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.320
 is going to entertain in the queue that he released 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.849
 and will not go after the iguana that is going to 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.979
 keep running and it will disappear 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.230
 really if it hurts them to drop the 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.110
 tail if it's a pretty strong wound 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.420
 but the iguanas have a very good 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.850
 scarring is why at 23 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.830
 days its tail is already closing a 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.110
 recommendation if you have an iguana and 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.790
 she is running never go to 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.040
 grab the tail because it is very 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.019
 probably the hook and after that 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.630
 you're really going to feel very bad 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.030
 some say that when the iguana is 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.709
 his tail falls or his tail falls off 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.709
 after a while it grows back 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.870
 well that is more or less true in 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.330
 if the tail is going to grow but 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.610
 for nothing is going to grow as he had and 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.830
 for nothing will it grow as long as 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.799
 he had it if he lost a piece like that 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.840
 he's only going to recover a piece like that 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.640
 much the tail of your iguanas the truth 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.500
 is that the tail of the iguanas makes them 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.630
 look very pretty and makes them look 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.910
 too big and exotic but 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.550
 there is also another reason why 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.800
 Iguanas let go of the tail and it's 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.230
 disease again I have here my 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.980
 iguana juana as you can see 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:16.069
 she lost a lot of her tail a 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.709
 little more than half 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:22.010
 because she lost her good tail no 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.540
 predator followed her nor did I 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.519
 halle when it was already running 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.889
 actually she lost it for a 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.139
 disease remember that while they 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:32.180
 I spoke in a video about ticks 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:33.950
 Well I leave here the video if not 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.569
 what they have seen is that the 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.209
 ticks were sucking him so much 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.950
 blood that she began to shed the 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.810
 no longer served him or the 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.790
 calcium or spotlights gave neither 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.639
 sun or anything like that then she 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.669
 began to die he began to suffer from 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:52.370
 a severe anemia that's why its tail 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:54.769
 little by little from the tip to the most 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.959
 thick began to dry thing that I 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.120
 It surprised me too much when I saw it 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.370
 I saw the tail very dry then the 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.219
 I took her out to the sun but I really 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.109
 when the tail of an iguana dries up 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:08.480
 there is no remedy and that part that is 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:10.400
 dry is going to lose is why the 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.370
 importance of caring for our iguanas 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.739
 and take care of their tails for them to be without 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.380
 tail is to be helpless really the 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.329
 they need to defend themselves and also the 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.340
 they need a lot to see 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.199
 the tail is one of the most beautiful parts 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.569
 of the iguana that's why it's very 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:28.759
 important that we take care of the tail of 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:31.460
 our iguanas are never going to grab 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:32.930
 an iguana that runs behind or 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.789
 is that they will want to grab the 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.280
 tail when an iguana is watching or is 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:39.229
 frightened never do that because it's very 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.689
 I'm sure he's going to let her go though you 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:43.729
 Say in Iguana and you have confidence, go 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:46.840
 to drop the tail if you grab him from there 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:49.930
 so do not do it 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.460
 do not do it and well if your iguana is 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.100
 is drying the tail what are you going to do 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.139
 so do not be stingy and take it to 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.930
 good veterinarian I know that many of 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.610
 you are very young people who do not 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.010
 they work and sometimes they do not have money 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.260
 and others suffer because there is no 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:08.530
 veterinarians nearby but it really is 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.419
 important that they take care of their iguana when 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.540
 his tail is drying his tail 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:16.060
 is because something internal is wrong then 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:19.030
 if they need to check the or at least 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.100
 give her a good meal, take it out 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.740
 the days in the sun give him enough water 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.320
 give him calcium and vitamins and if we see that 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.360
 the tail keeps drying more and more 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.250
 then there is no other and you have to 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.590
 take her to the vet and good friends 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.810
