00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
Patrick offers to demonstrate the weird

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.410 
Patrick offers to demonstrate the weird
repulsive<00:00:04.080> effects<00:00:04.529> he<00:00:05.430> hands<00:00:05.640> me<00:00:05.790> a<00:00:05.879> case<00:00:06.180> of

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
repulsive effects he hands me a case of

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.250 
repulsive effects he hands me a case of
super-strong<00:00:07.140> magnets<00:00:08.269> so<00:00:09.269> this<00:00:09.450> is<00:00:09.630> this<00:00:10.050> is

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
super-strong magnets so this is this is

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.799

and<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:17.010> you're<00:00:17.130> saying<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.430> this<00:00:17.670> will

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
and and you're saying that this will

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.410 
and and you're saying that this will
somehow<00:00:18.900> repel<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.439> Sharks<00:00:20.090> yeah<00:00:21.090> here<00:00:21.270> comes

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
somehow repel the Sharks yeah here comes

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.269 
somehow repel the Sharks yeah here comes
a<00:00:21.539> little<00:00:21.660> guy<00:00:21.930> that's<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.710> little<00:00:22.859> nurse<00:00:23.039> shark

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
a little guy that's a little nurse shark

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.349 
a little guy that's a little nurse shark
it<00:00:23.400> might<00:00:23.519> work<00:00:23.699> for<00:00:23.730> him<00:00:24.000> tell<00:00:24.150> me<00:00:24.180> eight

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
it might work for him tell me eight

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.929 
it might work for him tell me eight
three<00:00:24.660> two<00:00:24.930> one<00:00:25.859> oh<00:00:26.300> my<00:00:28.400> drop<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.580> thing<00:00:29.789> on

Dundee<00:00:32.610> never<00:00:32.820> Wow<00:00:33.210> right<00:00:33.960> with<00:00:34.380> seven<00:00:34.710> right

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
Dundee never Wow right with seven right

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.830 
Dundee never Wow right with seven right
right<00:00:35.250> Zach<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.700> shark<00:00:35.969> can't<00:00:36.300> see<00:00:36.660> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
right Zach the shark can't see the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.020 
right Zach the shark can't see the
magnet<00:00:37.200> but<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.649> obviously<00:00:38.160> feels<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.700> effect

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
magnet but it obviously feels the effect

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.180 
magnet but it obviously feels the effect
and<00:00:39.899> it's<00:00:40.140> not<00:00:40.260> happening

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
and it's not happening

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.700 
and it's not happening
one<00:00:41.600> two<00:00:42.600> three<00:00:43.440> now<00:00:43.680> Oh<00:00:44.719> God<00:00:45.750> really<00:00:46.289> yeah<00:00:46.530> you

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
one two three now Oh God really yeah you

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.060 
one two three now Oh God really yeah you
got<00:00:46.890> it

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
got it

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.360 
got it
that's<00:00:47.190> crazy<00:00:47.760> amazing<00:00:49.100> Patrick<00:00:50.100> thought<00:00:50.280> he

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
that's crazy amazing Patrick thought he

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.700 
that's crazy amazing Patrick thought he
could<00:00:50.520> somehow<00:00:50.760> use<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.480> effect<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.110> save

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
could somehow use this effect to save

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.830 
could somehow use this effect to save
sharks<00:00:53.190> from<00:00:53.370> being<00:00:53.670> inadvertently<00:00:54.449> caught

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
sharks from being inadvertently caught

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.340 
sharks from being inadvertently caught
by<00:00:55.110> commercial<00:00:55.590> fishermen<00:00:56.390> but<00:00:57.390> there<00:00:57.539> was<00:00:57.719> so

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
by commercial fishermen but there was so

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.849 
by commercial fishermen but there was so
to<00:00:58.410> speak<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:59.010> catch<00:00:59.690> we<00:01:00.690> put<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.079> magnet<00:01:01.680> right

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
to speak a catch we put the magnet right

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.130 
to speak a catch we put the magnet right
above<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.250> hook<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:03.059> line<00:01:03.210> okay<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:03.930> what

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
above the hook on the line okay and what

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.060 
above the hook on the line okay and what
was<00:01:04.229> happening<00:01:04.350> was<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.799> hooks<00:01:04.949> were

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
was happening was the hooks were

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.990 
was happening was the hooks were
swinging<00:01:05.339> around<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.580> getting<00:01:05.760> hauled<00:01:05.880> it

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
swinging around you getting hauled it

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.100 
swinging around you getting hauled it
caught<00:01:06.180> on<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.360> magnet<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.810> would<00:01:07.080> I

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
caught on the magnet so that would I

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.630 
caught on the magnet so that would I
wasn't<00:01:07.619> catching<00:01:07.770> any<00:01:08.010> sharks<00:01:08.280> but<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.430> wasn't

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
wasn't catching any sharks but it wasn't

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.120 
wasn't catching any sharks but it wasn't
catching<00:01:08.880> anything<00:01:09.060> else<00:01:09.270> either<00:01:09.830> but<00:01:10.830> he

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
catching anything else either but he

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.670 
catching anything else either but he
wasn't<00:01:11.460> willing<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.820> give<00:01:11.970> up<00:01:12.119> he<00:01:13.049> decided<00:01:13.380> he

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
wasn't willing to give up he decided he

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.260 
wasn't willing to give up he decided he
needed<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.070> find<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.490> weakest<00:01:14.970> possible

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
needed to find the weakest possible

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.859 
needed to find the weakest possible
magnet<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.110> would<00:01:16.229> still<00:01:16.530> affect<00:01:16.890> sharks

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
magnet that would still affect sharks

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.510 
magnet that would still affect sharks
the<00:01:18.869> first<00:01:19.110> step<00:01:19.350> was<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.619> create<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.950> baseline

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the first step was to create a baseline

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.179 
the first step was to create a baseline
for<00:01:20.759> comparison<00:01:21.049> by<00:01:22.049> exposing<00:01:22.470> sharks<00:01:22.979> to

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
for comparison by exposing sharks to

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.550 
for comparison by exposing sharks to
non-magnetic<00:01:23.909> materials<00:01:24.540> he<00:01:25.229> offers<00:01:25.530> to

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
non-magnetic materials he offers to

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.160 
non-magnetic materials he offers to
recreate<00:01:26.159> his<00:01:26.310> experiment<00:01:27.090> yeah<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:27.900> don't

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
recreate his experiment yeah I don't

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.200 
recreate his experiment yeah I don't
have<00:01:28.290> insurance<00:01:28.619> for<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:29.040> be<00:01:29.670> careful<00:01:29.970> it

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
have insurance for this be careful it

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.630 
have insurance for this be careful it
might<00:01:30.360> be<00:01:30.540> slippery<00:01:31.280> you're<00:01:32.280> warning<00:01:32.579> me

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
might be slippery you're warning me

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.249 
might be slippery you're warning me
about<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.060> slipperiness<00:01:33.689> news<00:01:33.990> there's

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
about the slipperiness news there's

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.429 
about the slipperiness news there's

as expected next a non-magnetic piece of
Samaria<00:02:24.410> a<00:02:24.680> rare<00:02:25.160> earth<00:02:25.370> element<00:02:25.970> the

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
Samaria a rare earth element the

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.060 
Samaria a rare earth element the
expectation<00:02:27.230> was<00:02:27.380> that<00:02:27.680> because<00:02:27.770> it's

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
expectation was that because it's

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.280 
expectation was that because it's
non-magnetic<00:02:28.630> there<00:02:29.630> would<00:02:29.780> be<00:02:29.810> no<00:02:30.050> reaction

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
non-magnetic there would be no reaction

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.720 
non-magnetic there would be no reaction
oh<00:02:30.830> man

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
oh man

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.729 
oh man
she<00:02:32.180> shouldn't<00:02:32.930> like<00:02:33.080> that<00:02:33.200> at<00:02:33.290> all<00:02:33.380> this<00:02:33.590> is

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
she shouldn't like that at all this is

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.860 
she shouldn't like that at all this is
like<00:02:33.920> kryptonite<00:02:34.340> for<00:02:34.670> sharks<00:02:35.300> and<00:02:35.420> yes<00:02:35.630> it<00:02:35.750> is

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
like kryptonite for sharks and yes it is

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.330 
like kryptonite for sharks and yes it is
wow<00:02:36.410> this<00:02:36.440> is<00:02:36.830> amazing

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
wow this is amazing

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.010 
wow this is amazing
it's<00:02:37.610> just<00:02:37.790> we<00:02:37.970> woke<00:02:38.150> her<00:02:38.300> up<00:02:38.330> and<00:02:38.690> drove<00:02:38.900> her

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
it's just we woke her up and drove her

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.640 
it's just we woke her up and drove her
crazy<00:02:39.200> yep<00:02:39.680> so<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.970> idea<00:02:41.270> is<00:02:41.480> you<00:02:42.200> could<00:02:42.410> make

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
crazy yep so the idea is you could make

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.800 
crazy yep so the idea is you could make
what<00:02:43.100> out<00:02:43.489> of<00:02:43.640> this<00:02:43.790> tether<00:02:44.030> all<00:02:44.300> the<00:02:44.510> ideas

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
what out of this tether all the ideas

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.510 
what out of this tether all the ideas
that<00:02:44.840> it's<00:02:45.050> not<00:02:45.200> magnetic<00:02:45.380> so<00:02:46.280> we<00:02:46.370> could

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
that it's not magnetic so we could

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.130 
that it's not magnetic so we could
potentially<00:02:46.670> incorporate<00:02:47.600> it<00:02:47.690> to<00:02:47.780> a<00:02:47.810> fishing

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
potentially incorporate it to a fishing

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.710 
potentially incorporate it to a fishing
hook<00:02:48.640> and<00:02:49.640> then<00:02:50.150> you<00:02:50.269> got<00:02:50.390> something<00:02:50.570> that

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
hook and then you got something that

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.520 
hook and then you got something that
repels<00:02:51.019> sharks<00:02:52.870> but<00:02:53.870> doesn't<00:02:54.350> have<00:02:54.470> the

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
repels sharks but doesn't have the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.110 
repels sharks but doesn't have the
magnetic<00:02:54.860> properties<00:02:55.070> so<00:02:55.459> it<00:02:55.519> won't<00:02:55.730> tangle

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
magnetic properties so it won't tangle

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.170 
magnetic properties so it won't tangle
the<00:02:56.330> gear<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:56.630> stuff<00:02:56.840> like<00:02:56.930> that
