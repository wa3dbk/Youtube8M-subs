what

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.689 

hey<00:04:32.120> I<00:04:32.479> think<00:04:32.960> it<00:04:33.080> goes<00:04:33.280> further<00:04:34.280> than<00:04:34.460> the

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
hey I think it goes further than the

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:36.760 
hey I think it goes further than the
skills<00:04:35.060> you<00:04:35.270> go<00:04:35.389> farther<00:04:35.720> than<00:04:35.840> who<00:04:36.440> punches

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
skills you go farther than who punches

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.279 
skills you go farther than who punches
harder<00:04:37.190> who<00:04:37.400> punches<00:04:37.849> faster<00:04:38.360> who<00:04:39.110> has<00:04:39.259> a

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
harder who punches faster who has a

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:41.170 
harder who punches faster who has a
better<00:04:39.530> defense<00:04:39.680> I<00:04:40.190> think<00:04:40.460> it<00:04:40.789> comes<00:04:41.090> down

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
better defense I think it comes down

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.200 
better defense I think it comes down
