00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.360
 hello finally that day has come 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:14.880
 when we will open 50 enhanced 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:17.039
 let's crystals for a start let's 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.960
 crystals twist see what of 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:24.900
 this will come out and the rest will open 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.640
 button twist the first crystal 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.260
 we see quite a lot of three star 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.480
 different characters so that im 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.670
 hope will be something worthwhile 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.670
 but no to 2 star winter soldier 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.210
 move on open the next one 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.210
 crystal twist on 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.140
 two stars again and it's a cyclops 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.770
 open 3 crystal 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:27.900
 we see that a lot of 4 stars flashes but 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.900
 again two stars and this abomination 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.650
 open the fourth crystal 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:51.330
 and failure again 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.720
 cut off again 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:58.640
 black we take 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:01.480
 and finally the fifth crystal and further we will begin 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.480
 open with a button 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:24.990
 and again two stars are not needed this 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:28.240
 higher iron man let's open 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:31.120
 first 10 crystals by button 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.900
 see that there are three stars iron fist 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.540
 and jagger on this first take will be 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.260
 jagernaut that i will open abilities 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.260
 uncontrollability 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.950
 Well, in principle, not bad 10 crystals 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.950
 just two 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.950
 three star 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.390
 transformed our heroes and move 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.390
 farther 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.930
 popping up again 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:20.350
 various stocks we close we don’t 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:23.730
 need open the next 10 crystals from 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:26.050
 10 ones 2 stars 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.270
 the only one who we needed was this 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.730
 magic on 2 stars before that he is not 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.650
 It was a double E. 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.480
 the only plus is the discovery of these 10 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:40.720
 crystals 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:42.070
 here is pretty insulting happened so 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.010
 I don’t understand how people of two 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.769
 crystals manage to open 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:51.030
 four star okay not 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.030
 get upset moving on 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.160
 open the next 10 crystals 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:09.870
 and here we have one so star 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.780
 Gamora is also a very good Gomorrah 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.030
 before that there was no double 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:18.169
 finally we opened the crown 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.169
 killing ability 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:30.809
 he 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:42.310
 again pops up stocks close them and 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:47.230
 trying to open another 10 crystals and 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.230
 here guys we have a tragedy 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.700
 the game stops responding 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:58.929
 that more than 10 minutes to something 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:59.999
 happened but kept twisting nothing 

00:04:58.929 --> 00:05:04.629
 was happening 

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:04.869
 went out came in the application without closing 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:10.209
 him 

00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:15.429
 but it did not help in the end we had to 

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:17.379
 completely exit the game will restart in 

00:05:15.429 --> 00:05:20.649
 that moment when we entered ours again 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:24.339
 crystals it turned out that we have left 

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:25.899
 only 5 crystals 

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:28.839
 these crystals happened as a result 

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:31.449
 opened running ahead I will say that there 

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:35.799
 there was a four star torus and the rest 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:37.360
 there were 26 doubles at that moment was very 

00:05:35.799 --> 00:05:41.110
 frustrating because I because 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.789
 really lost 10 crystals from 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.719
 the remaining five crystal and dropped out again 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:47.740
 only 2 star 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:50.800
 eventually 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.389
 with 50 crystals , we had only 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.190
 three 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:57.569
 three star character and 1 4 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:06:00.520
 star top for that amount 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:03.280
 principle yes could be better therefore 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.919
 as I said earlier to you continues us 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.160
 badly deprived in this game but not 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:10.060
 trouble we keep on playing you need it all 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.470
 good luck to all 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.470
 see you in the next video
