different colors italicized bold and so

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.899 
different colors italicized bold and so
forth<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.439> also<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.979> documents<00:01:35.430> can<00:01:35.549> contain

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
forth and also the documents can contain

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.060 
forth and also the documents can contain
images<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.869> they're<00:01:37.020> not<00:01:37.140> strictly<00:01:37.409> textual

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
images so they're not strictly textual

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.969 
images so they're not strictly textual
and<00:01:38.390> then<00:01:39.390> very<00:01:39.689> importantly<00:01:39.750> an<00:01:40.320> HTML

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
and then very importantly an HTML

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.330 
and then very importantly an HTML
document<00:01:41.009> can<00:01:41.549> also<00:01:41.610> include<00:01:42.150> links<00:01:43.040> the<00:01:44.040> idea

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
document can also include links the idea

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.039 
document can also include links the idea
of<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.579> link<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.479> can<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> piece

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
of a link is that you can have a piece

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.109 
of a link is that you can have a piece
of<00:01:46.079> text<00:01:46.530> or<00:01:46.829> an<00:01:47.040> image<00:01:47.340> which<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.549> clickable

ducks<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.890> idea<00:02:05.189> is<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.399> in<00:02:05.700> the

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
ducks and the idea is that in the

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.510 
ducks and the idea is that in the
document<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.540> text<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.469> associated<00:02:08.160> with<00:02:08.340> a

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
document that text is associated with a

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.150 
document that text is associated with a
URL<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.450> URL<00:02:09.989> pointing<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.830> some<00:02:11.009> other

document<00:02:11.400> out<00:02:12.120> there<00:02:12.510> on<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.989> web

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
document out there on the web

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.200 
document out there on the web
and<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:13.920> when<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.160> user<00:02:14.310> clicks<00:02:14.670> on<00:02:14.940> this<00:02:15.150> link

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
and so when the user clicks on this link

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.380 
and so when the user clicks on this link
their<00:02:16.080> web<00:02:16.350> browser<00:02:16.380> then<00:02:17.190> retrieves<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:18.180> web

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
their web browser then retrieves the web

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.030 
their web browser then retrieves the web
page<00:02:18.660> at<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:18.990> URL<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:20.070> then<00:02:20.610> displays<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:22.040> so

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
page at that URL and then displays it so

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.430 
page at that URL and then displays it so
it's<00:02:23.400> called<00:02:23.670> hypertext<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:25.230> web

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
it's called hypertext and the web

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.560 
it's called hypertext and the web
because<00:02:26.220> within<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.880> document<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.540> have

other things in webpages what we usually

call form widgets widgets recall is the

call form widgets widgets recall is the

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
things you come and see in programs like

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.880 
things you come and see in programs like
pull<00:02:44.970> down<00:02:45.180> menus<00:02:45.570> and<00:02:45.900> text<00:02:46.260> boxes<00:02:46.410> where<00:02:46.860> you

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
pull down menus and text boxes where you

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.220 
pull down menus and text boxes where you
can<00:02:47.100> type<00:02:47.310> so<00:02:48.180> you'll<00:02:48.540> see<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.780> few<00:02:48.990> of<00:02:49.050> those

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
can type so you'll see a few of those

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.780 
can type so you'll see a few of those
things<00:02:49.530> inside<00:02:50.070> webpages

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
things inside webpages

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.790 
things inside webpages
and<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.420> idea<00:02:51.720> is<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.170> user<00:02:52.260> can<00:02:52.560> type

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
and the idea is that the user can type

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.650 
and the idea is that the user can type
something<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.310> say<00:02:53.490> these<00:02:53.670> text<00:02:54.000> boxes<00:02:54.150> here

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
something and say these text boxes here

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.080 
something and say these text boxes here
then<00:02:55.140> click<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.590> button<00:02:55.740> and<00:02:56.070> that<00:02:56.700> makes<00:02:56.940> a

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
then click the button and that makes a

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.300 
then click the button and that makes a
request<00:02:57.360> to<00:02:57.780> a<00:02:57.810> web<00:02:58.080> server<00:02:58.350> in<00:02:58.800> which<00:02:59.070> that

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
request to a web server in which that

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.580 
request to a web server in which that
information<00:02:59.490> in<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.150> text<00:03:00.450> box<00:03:00.660> is<00:03:00.900> also<00:03:01.200> sent

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
information in the text box is also sent

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.890 
information in the text box is also sent
and<00:03:02.520> this<00:03:02.730> is<00:03:02.850> actually<00:03:03.180> one<00:03:03.330> way<00:03:03.360> in<00:03:03.780> which

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
and this is actually one way in which

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.690 
and this is actually one way in which
web<00:03:04.170> pages<00:03:04.410> can<00:03:04.590> be<00:03:04.740> more<00:03:05.040> interactive<00:03:05.220> than

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
web pages can be more interactive than

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.720 
web pages can be more interactive than
just<00:03:05.880> being<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.090> bunch<00:03:06.180> of<00:03:06.360> static<00:03:06.750> documents

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
just being a bunch of static documents

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.830 
just being a bunch of static documents
this<00:03:08.730> is<00:03:08.910> actually<00:03:09.210> very<00:03:09.300> important<00:03:09.780> to

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
this is actually very important to

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.260 
this is actually very important to
understand<00:03:10.410> in<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:11.100> very<00:03:11.340> early<00:03:11.640> days<00:03:11.670> of<00:03:11.880> the

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
understand in the very early days of the

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.840 
understand in the very early days of the
web<00:03:12.420> back<00:03:12.810> in<00:03:12.990> the<00:03:13.080> mid-90s<00:03:13.680> almost<00:03:14.400> all<00:03:14.610> web

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
web back in the mid-90s almost all web

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.510 
web back in the mid-90s almost all web
pages<00:03:14.910> were<00:03:15.630> just<00:03:15.840> totally<00:03:16.230> static<00:03:16.710> someone

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
pages were just totally static someone

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.400 
pages were just totally static someone
would<00:03:17.760> author<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.330> page<00:03:18.570> and<00:03:18.840> then<00:03:19.230> when

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
would author the page and then when

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.590 
would author the page and then when
anyone<00:03:19.770> visited<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.400> page<00:03:20.580> they<00:03:21.270> would<00:03:21.450> get

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
anyone visited the page they would get

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.710 
anyone visited the page they would get
back<00:03:21.840> exactly<00:03:22.650> what<00:03:22.830> was<00:03:22.950> authored<00:03:23.720> very

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
back exactly what was authored very

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.420 
back exactly what was authored very
quickly<00:03:24.959> however<00:03:25.410> people<00:03:25.709> hit<00:03:26.010> upon<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.400> idea

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
quickly however people hit upon the idea

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.420 
quickly however people hit upon the idea
of<00:03:26.760> dynamically<00:03:27.750> generated<00:03:28.320> pages<00:03:28.680> meaning<00:03:29.340> a

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
of dynamically generated pages meaning a

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.520 
of dynamically generated pages meaning a
page<00:03:29.670> which<00:03:29.910> is<00:03:30.060> of<00:03:30.180> course<00:03:30.360> designed<00:03:30.930> but

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
page which is of course designed but

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.530 
page which is of course designed but
then<00:03:31.740> programmatically<00:03:32.610> every<00:03:33.090> time<00:03:33.330> a

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
then programmatically every time a

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.080 
then programmatically every time a
request<00:03:33.840> for<00:03:34.200> that<00:03:34.320> page<00:03:34.560> is<00:03:34.740> made<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.760> server

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
request for that page is made the server

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.770 
request for that page is made the server
fills<00:03:36.810> in<00:03:37.020> certain<00:03:37.380> details<00:03:37.560> in<00:03:38.330> effect<00:03:39.330> the

web server ends up generating the page

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
every time someone visits it and this

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.400 
every time someone visits it and this
opens<00:03:44.880> up<00:03:45.030> possibilities<00:03:45.150> for<00:03:46.110> much<00:03:46.260> more

opens up possibilities for much more
interesting<00:03:46.860> websites

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
interesting websites

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.550 
interesting websites

things like say a web store would not be
