00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello and welcome to life tech de 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.330
 This is the test video of a monitor 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.830
 from philips which also as 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.830
 Android device can be used 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.630
 the full hd monitor from philips can 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.880
 either quite normal as a monitor for the 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.920
 computer or as an android multitouch 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.199
 device will be used to him as normal 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.109
 you can just use a monitor 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.640
 connect hdmi or vga cable and 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.369
 you can already use the monitor with his 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.019
 computer use because the monitor, however 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.910
 also the operating system android 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.739
 you did not need one 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.899
 computer and can over the appropriate 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.309
 Setting the monitor as usual 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.440
 Use Android device 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.629
 this is where the philips monitor works 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.280
 a quad core processor with 1.6 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.070
 has installed gigahertz and that 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.460
 operating system android 4.2 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.620
 preinstalled 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.230
 he has a graphics unit from 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.390
 nvidia and 2 gb of memory 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.730
 for the fluid use of the device 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.190
 the internal memory is 8 gb and 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.620
 can with the help of a sdhc card or 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.979
 be extended via the usb port 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.840
 thus, the philips can 23 23 c also 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.400
 as a standalone device completely without 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.200
 computer to be used 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.270
 he has a built-in speaker 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.250
 which stereosound outputs whereby one 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.619
 no external speakers to buy 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.450
 However, as usual for monitors 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.409
 is the sound quality of the speakers 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.360
 not too good 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.430
 So it would be to recommend one 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.470
 external speaker to buy 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.270
 below the screen are located 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.250
 the menu keys to monitor 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.750
 calibrate and adjust 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.250
 With the help of these keys you can 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.990
 also set whether you the 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.850

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.770

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.840

 60 degrees to tilt back 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.450
 the design is also very nice 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.009
 appealing but not too noticeable 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.840
 making the monitor look good on everyone

 for video calls to external devices like 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.030
 for example, a memory extension 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.159
 are to be connected to the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.380

 In addition one finds there a pc audio

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.480
 on 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.490
 In addition, the monitor has a wifi 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.900
