00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.070 
describe like them you don't pain I
guess<00:01:44.160> you<00:01:44.310> can<00:01:44.490> feel<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.790> vibration<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.600> the

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
guess you can feel the vibration of the

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.990 
guess you can feel the vibration of the
Machine<00:01:46.410> more<00:01:46.950> than<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.190> can<00:01:47.370> actually<00:01:47.520> feel

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
Machine more than you can actually feel

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.110 
Machine more than you can actually feel
the<00:01:48.060> needle<00:01:48.510> but<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.680> guess<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.640> could<00:01:50.850> kind<00:01:51.060> of

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
the needle but I guess you could kind of

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.090 
the needle but I guess you could kind of
compare<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.510> to<00:01:51.750> like<00:01:51.900> getting<00:01:52.830> a<00:01:52.920> cavity

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
compare it to like getting a cavity

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.480 
compare it to like getting a cavity
filled<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.850> don't<00:01:54.300> that<00:01:54.450> makes<00:01:54.600> sense<00:01:55.370> like<00:01:56.370> it

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
filled I don't that makes sense like it

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.300 
filled I don't that makes sense like it
only<00:01:56.610> hurts<00:01:57.090> when<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.450> needles<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.310> but

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
only hurts when the needles and you but

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.610 
only hurts when the needles and you but
then<00:01:59.400> it<00:01:59.490> stops<00:01:59.760> when<00:01:59.970> he<00:02:00.030> takes<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.360> off<00:02:00.479> but<00:02:01.320> I

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
then it stops when he takes it off but I

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.670 
then it stops when he takes it off but I
guess<00:02:02.550> it's<00:02:02.729> different<00:02:02.760> for<00:02:03.120> everybody<00:02:03.300> but<00:02:03.690> I

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
guess it's different for everybody but I

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.490 
guess it's different for everybody but I
don't<00:02:05.190> know<00:02:05.250> let's<00:02:05.460> talk<00:02:05.670> about<00:02:05.820> but<00:02:06.410> come<00:02:07.410> on
