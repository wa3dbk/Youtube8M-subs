thick board of maple I cut thick veneers
with<00:02:27.349> my<00:02:27.530> bandsaw<00:02:27.799> and<00:02:28.370> then<00:02:29.090> created<00:02:29.599> panels

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
with my bandsaw and then created panels

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.069 
with my bandsaw and then created panels
for<00:02:30.349> the<00:02:30.409> two<00:02:30.680> sides<00:02:30.950> in<00:02:31.280> front<00:02:31.640> now<00:02:32.629> the<00:02:32.689> front

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
for the two sides in front now the front

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:34.990 
for the two sides in front now the front
panel<00:02:33.500> is<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.769> interesting<00:02:34.099> bit<00:02:34.370> which<00:02:34.819> I'm

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
panel is the interesting bit which I'm

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.379 
panel is the interesting bit which I'm
showing<00:02:35.239> here<00:02:35.689> as<00:02:36.049> a<00:02:36.109> radical<00:02:36.439> departure<00:02:37.310> from

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:37.389 
showing here as a radical departure from

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:40.569 
showing here as a radical departure from
cabinet<00:02:38.389> construction<00:02:39.109> it<00:02:39.859> could<00:02:40.129> not<00:02:40.400> have

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
cabinet construction it could not have

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:43.030 
cabinet construction it could not have
been<00:02:40.730> made<00:02:40.969> without<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:41.599> router<00:02:41.810> so<00:02:42.769> this<00:02:42.920> is

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
been made without the router so this is

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.949 
been made without the router so this is
what<00:02:43.219> I<00:02:43.250> mean<00:02:43.489> about<00:02:43.639> the<00:02:43.909> router<00:02:44.120> shaping<00:02:44.840> the

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
what I mean about the router shaping the

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.659 
what I mean about the router shaping the
