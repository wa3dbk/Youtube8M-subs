 costil climbing these traditionally outdoor practices on the 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:18.630
 cliffs other mountain the block has been a great success since the 80s 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.630
 being much more accessible to the public than natural areas 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:27.539
 for these championships the athletes thoroughly in three categories the block the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.989
 difficulty and speed but let's see it in detail with the test 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.240
 female development 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.020
 in this category the structures to four meters high and it takes 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.020
 to succeed the most extreme passage with the month of it is possible 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.380
 in men jérôme best win a title for France 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.410

 I thank the advanced 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.160
 boss is still a little more on the podium 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.720
 it requires an investment 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.130
 the roadside 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.350
 quite simply 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.229
 the second test and call the difficulties that can be said that she 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.830
 is aptly named because it is first 15 meters from them 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.910
 with passages with negative elevation 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.760
 to tell you, first of all, we need a lot of technical and physical 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.760
 clips in effect to get out 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.070
 in men we are here a passage that ultra technical but I am 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.090
 sure he'll get there 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.090
 will anor be she 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.140
 the last test and the speed for his champions I would not have very 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.410
 technique the goal is to climb as fast as possible and you will see 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.670
 it dumps 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.100
 k 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.100
 Why 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.129
 the same it will have seen a few weeks 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.509
 the same week 

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:14.419
 the right 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:16.809
 the car of m 

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:19.809
 it's not that 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:23.069
