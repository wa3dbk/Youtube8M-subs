00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.989
 for money was right a whole time 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.220

 feel if tempted and if you will see more 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.889
 If you drink it makes sense, you understand. 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:19.599
 people do not drink, no member is an excuse 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:21.069
 When you do not drink, you can not 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.269
 have fun with people who drink 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.459

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.889
 A lot of people can live their lives, but at last 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:32.530
 people also enjoy the images of the 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:34.359

 if playing minecraft then it's this and that 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.410
 who wakes up four in the morning to make the 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.090
 then corn harvest 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.990

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.000
 imi and i like zico soon, well, the guy 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.850
 if you mimic the voice of mickey khan nobody 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:41.010
 it 's not a specialty my street clothes 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:43.110
 who hit the following I'm a business 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.900
 so and does not vary from proponent voiceover is 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:49.680
 more recent but did not have there 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:52.560

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.350
 that I find out that Max does not like that 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.180
 I managed to recover now around like 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:08.640
 and it really is 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:12.180
 this is the idea that radio personnel 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:14.220
 it's not based on that guys 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.150
 You're watching this little york song. 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.680

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.750
 I walk away from God, I know if it is 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:52.070
 this lens is very good microphone beating 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:52.070
 it was hardly too much sleep and that's it under the 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:06:04.260
 alcohol effect on me 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:06.390
