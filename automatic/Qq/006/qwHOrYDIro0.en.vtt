down and we've got four new features and
spinning<00:00:20.670> rules<00:00:20.850> it's<00:00:21.029> really<00:00:21.210> going<00:00:21.330> to

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
spinning rules it's really going to

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.509 
spinning rules it's really going to
revolutionize<00:00:21.890> what<00:00:22.890> spinning<00:00:23.189> reels<00:00:23.369> have

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
revolutionize what spinning reels have

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.550 
revolutionize what spinning reels have
to<00:00:23.699> offer<00:00:24.590> first<00:00:25.590> one<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.849> our<00:00:27.390> g<00:00:27.960> free<00:00:28.320> body

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
to offer first one is our g free body

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.710 
to offer first one is our g free body
this<00:00:29.130> basically<00:00:29.519> takes<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.060> oscillation

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
this basically takes the oscillation

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.150 
this basically takes the oscillation
system<00:00:31.109> which<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.439> normally<00:00:31.710> on<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.859> bottom

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
system which is normally on the bottom

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.520 
system which is normally on the bottom
so<00:00:32.489> used<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.210> be<00:00:33.360> down<00:00:33.660> below<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.110> drive<00:00:34.290> gear

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
so used to be down below the drive gear

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.139 
so used to be down below the drive gear
and<00:00:34.710> now<00:00:34.770> we've<00:00:34.890> moved<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.190> up<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:35.850> what<00:00:36.000> this

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
and now we've moved it up so what this

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.510 
and now we've moved it up so what this
does<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:37.350> brings<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.860> weight<00:00:38.040> more

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
does is it brings the weight more

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.850 
does is it brings the weight more
towards<00:00:38.850> your<00:00:38.969> hand<00:00:39.230> so<00:00:40.230> when<00:00:40.530> you're<00:00:40.649> fishing

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
towards your hand so when you're fishing

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.430 
towards your hand so when you're fishing
it's<00:00:41.100> just<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.370> better<00:00:41.550> balance<00:00:42.000> real<00:00:42.809> still<00:00:43.320> is

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
it's just a better balance real still is

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.410 
it's just a better balance real still is
all<00:00:43.590> about<00:00:43.829> balance<00:00:44.489> smoother<00:00:44.910> it's<00:00:45.329> all

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
all about balance smoother it's all

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.200 
all about balance smoother it's all
about<00:00:45.570> feel<00:00:46.039> so<00:00:47.039> that's<00:00:47.309> G<00:00:47.550> free<00:00:47.789> bodies<00:00:48.120> just

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
about feel so that's G free bodies just

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.540 
about feel so that's G free bodies just
moving<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:49.110> system<00:00:49.559> up<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:49.770> just<00:00:50.399> as

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
moving that that system up so just as

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.619 
moving that that system up so just as
you're<00:00:50.670> casting<00:00:51.149> it's<00:00:51.270> just<00:00:51.449> more

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
you're casting it's just more

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.420 
you're casting it's just more
comfortable<00:00:52.110> right<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:52.920> it's<00:00:53.039> just<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.250> better

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
comfortable right so it's just a better

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.270 
comfortable right so it's just a better
balanced<00:00:53.879> balanced<00:00:54.390> piece<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:55.590> next<00:00:55.829> one<00:00:55.980> in

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
balanced balanced piece the next one in

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.950 
balanced balanced piece the next one in

out<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.280> spinning<00:01:11.580> reel<00:01:11.670> where<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.939> weren't

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
out of a spinning reel where you weren't

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.580 
out of a spinning reel where you weren't
really<00:01:12.299> getting<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:13.200> know<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.470> years

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
really getting that you know in years

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
really getting that you know in years
past

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
past

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.410

so<00:01:14.970> micro<00:01:15.390> module<00:01:15.750> gear<00:01:16.340> core<00:01:17.340> protect<00:01:17.729> so

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
so micro module gear core protect so

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.690 
so micro module gear core protect so
basically<00:01:18.780> adding<00:01:19.049> water<00:01:19.259> resistancy<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.460> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
basically adding water resistancy to the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.399 
basically adding water resistancy to the
reel<00:01:20.850> not<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.299> big<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.600> bass<00:01:21.840> side<00:01:22.110> because

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
reel not so big in the bass side because

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.810 
reel not so big in the bass side because
you're<00:01:22.650> you're<00:01:22.920> basically<00:01:23.340> fishing<00:01:23.700> in

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
you're you're basically fishing in

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.149 
you're you're basically fishing in
freshwater<00:01:24.270> but<00:01:24.750> for<00:01:24.930> our<00:01:25.020> inshore<00:01:25.409> crowd<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
freshwater but for our inshore crowd the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.190 
freshwater but for our inshore crowd the
more<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.460> can<00:01:26.610> eliminate<00:01:26.880> water<00:01:27.360> from

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
more you can eliminate water from

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.480 
more you can eliminate water from
getting<00:01:28.290> inside<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.799> rail<00:01:28.950> longer<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.369> reel

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
getting inside the rail longer the reel

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.219 
getting inside the rail longer the reel
is<00:01:29.610> going<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.820> laugh<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.299> there<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.900> no<00:01:31.020> anti

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
is going to laugh so there is no anti

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.870 
is going to laugh so there is no anti
reverse<00:01:31.380> switch<00:01:31.710> on<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.950> reel<00:01:32.100> anymore<00:01:32.460> so

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
reverse switch on the reel anymore so

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.130 
reverse switch on the reel anymore so
it's<00:01:33.030> not<00:01:33.150> going<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.420> back<00:01:33.540> whine<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.020> by

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
it's not going to back whine so by

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.219 
it's not going to back whine so by
eliminating<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:35.520> know<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:36.030> piece<00:01:36.329> putting

some waterproof features within the reel

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.120 
some waterproof features within the reel
just<00:01:39.240> keeping<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.990> water<00:01:40.110> up<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.829> know<00:01:40.950> from

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
just keeping the water up you know from

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.649 
just keeping the water up you know from
penetrating<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.759> reel<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.240> it's<00:01:42.360> just<00:01:42.450> going

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
penetrating the reel so it's just going

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.710 
penetrating the reel so it's just going
to<00:01:42.720> last<00:01:43.340> quite<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.399> bit<00:01:44.579> longer<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.149> then<00:01:45.329> you

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
to last quite a bit longer and then you

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.170 
to last quite a bit longer and then you
know<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.380> fourth<00:01:46.649> piece<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.369> S<00:01:47.790> direct

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
know the fourth piece is the S direct

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.160 
know the fourth piece is the S direct
drive<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.979> actual<00:01:50.460> handle<00:01:50.960> screws<00:01:51.960> into

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
drive so the actual handle screws into

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.410 
drive so the actual handle screws into
the<00:01:52.259> drive<00:01:52.560> gear<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.520> before<00:01:53.909> you'd<00:01:54.060> have<00:01:54.090> like

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
the drive gear so before you'd have like

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.749 
the drive gear so before you'd have like
you're<00:01:54.570> super<00:01:54.720> stopper<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.310> handle<00:01:56.700> would

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
you're super stopper so the handle would

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:57.920 
you're super stopper so the handle would
you<00:01:57.090> know<00:01:57.180> have<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.600> little<00:01:57.780> bit<00:01:57.869> of

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
you know have you like a little bit of

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.719 
you know have you like a little bit of
back<00:01:58.049> LA<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.979> then<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.219> have<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.399> one-way

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
back LA and then you have a one-way

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.069 
back LA and then you have a one-way
roller<00:01:59.939> bearing<00:02:00.329> which<00:02:00.509> was<00:02:00.659> like<00:02:00.780> super

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
roller bearing which was like super

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.649 
roller bearing which was like super
stopper<00:02:01.409> -<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:02.189> was<00:02:02.280> kind<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.520> like<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.670> really

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
stopper - that was kind of like a really

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.539 
stopper - that was kind of like a really
tight<00:02:03.899> locking<00:02:04.320> device<00:02:04.590> well<00:02:05.369> now<00:02:05.490> the

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
tight locking device well now the

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.880 
tight locking device well now the
handles<00:02:05.969> going<00:02:06.960> right<00:02:07.170> into<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.469> main<00:02:07.649> gear

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
handles going right into the main gear

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.930 
handles going right into the main gear
so<00:02:09.700> now<00:02:09.910> it<00:02:10.060> is<00:02:10.149> 100%<00:02:10.539> perfect<00:02:11.080> so<00:02:11.560> you're<00:02:12.190> not

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
so now it is 100% perfect so you're not

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.550 
so now it is 100% perfect so you're not
losing<00:02:13.120> any<00:02:13.390> energy<00:02:13.870> when<00:02:14.050> you're<00:02:14.140> setting<00:02:14.500> a

hook or when you're turning the handle

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.090

there's<00:02:16.600> nothing<00:02:17.200> there's<00:02:17.380> no<00:02:17.500> gaps<00:02:17.800> in<00:02:18.040> the

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
there's nothing there's no gaps in the

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.380

just pure performance from the from the

starting off of three gear ratios so we
have<00:03:15.760> a<00:03:16.409> 5.5<00:03:17.409> which<00:03:17.680> is<00:03:17.799> your<00:03:17.980> power<00:03:18.189> gear<00:03:18.400> so

you<00:03:26.139> know<00:03:26.260> it's<00:03:26.469> total<00:03:27.250> versatility<00:03:27.730> if<00:03:27.790> you

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:27.879 
you know it's total versatility if you

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:28.800 
you know it's total versatility if you

want to go fast you want to go slow

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.509 
want to go fast you want to go slow
right<00:03:29.230> this<00:03:29.560> is<00:03:29.650> probably<00:03:29.950> just<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.280> number

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
right this is probably just the number

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.720 
right this is probably just the number
one<00:03:30.730> for<00:03:31.540> all-purpose<00:03:32.500> absolutely<00:03:33.189> and<00:03:33.609> then

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
one for all-purpose absolutely and then

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.439 
one for all-purpose absolutely and then
you<00:03:33.819> have<00:03:33.939> the<00:03:34.090> HDC<00:03:34.659> the<00:03:34.900> seven<00:03:35.139> point<00:03:35.379> two
