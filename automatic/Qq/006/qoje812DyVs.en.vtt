what has already been created and the

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.820 
what has already been created and the
answer<00:01:10.090> is<00:01:10.210> maybe<00:01:10.570> but<00:01:10.960> not<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.440> way<00:01:11.590> we've

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
answer is maybe but not the way we've

been doing it if you want to know it's

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.450 
been doing it if you want to know it's
wrong<00:01:13.810> look<00:01:14.260> down<00:01:14.470> at<00:01:14.619> the<00:01:14.710> table<00:01:15.160> it's

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
wrong look down at the table it's

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.770

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
because that's what's going on but if we

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.530 
because that's what's going on but if we
think<00:01:21.250> we're<00:01:21.460> gonna<00:01:21.550> go<00:01:21.760> to<00:01:21.820> the<00:01:21.940> doctor<00:01:22.090> and

think we're gonna go to the doctor and

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.740 
think we're gonna go to the doctor and
get<00:01:22.630> a<00:01:22.690> pill<00:01:23.020> for<00:01:23.350> everything<00:01:24.450> we've<00:01:25.450> missed
