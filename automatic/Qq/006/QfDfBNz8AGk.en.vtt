00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
exciting one a very very good talent in

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.380 
exciting one a very very good talent in
the<00:00:40.079> Premier<00:00:40.440> League<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.399> Harry<00:00:41.700> Kane<00:00:42.059> now

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
the Premier League it is Harry Kane now

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.600 
the Premier League it is Harry Kane now
yet<00:00:42.660> his<00:00:42.809> breakthrough<00:00:43.230> season<00:00:43.920> last<00:00:44.430> year

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
yet his breakthrough season last year

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.970 
yet his breakthrough season last year
and<00:00:44.910> did<00:00:45.420> incredibly<00:00:46.079> well<00:00:46.200> scoring<00:00:46.829> an

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
and did incredibly well scoring an

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.569 
and did incredibly well scoring an
absolute<00:00:47.820> ton<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.510> goals<00:00:48.860> therefore<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.100> think

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
absolute ton of goals therefore I think

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.189 
absolute ton of goals therefore I think
even<00:00:50.879> though<00:00:51.000> he<00:00:51.090> got<00:00:51.210> an<00:00:51.329> upgrade<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.660> FIFA<00:00:52.079> 15

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
even though he got an upgrade in FIFA 15

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.500 
even though he got an upgrade in FIFA 15
I<00:00:52.739> think<00:00:53.190> he's<00:00:53.370> deserving<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.969> pretty<00:00:54.270> big

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
I think he's deserving of a pretty big

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.930 
I think he's deserving of a pretty big
upgrade<00:00:54.660> again<00:00:55.140> for<00:00:55.350> FIFA<00:00:55.649> 16<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.699> think

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
upgrade again for FIFA 16 and I think

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.720 
upgrade again for FIFA 16 and I think
we'll<00:00:57.090> be<00:00:57.120> seeing<00:00:57.360> an<00:00:57.600> 80<00:00:57.870> rated<00:00:58.530> card<00:00:58.829> as<00:00:59.070> his

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
we'll be seeing an 80 rated card as his

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.330 
we'll be seeing an 80 rated card as his
sort<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.149> standard<00:01:00.690> base<00:01:00.960> card<00:01:01.320> pretty<00:01:02.010> sick

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
sort of standard base card pretty sick

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.060 
sort of standard base card pretty sick
now<00:01:02.670> in<00:01:02.850> terms<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.329> stat<00:01:03.629> boosts<00:01:04.140> their<00:01:04.739> sort

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
now in terms of stat boosts their sort

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.090 
now in terms of stat boosts their sort
of<00:01:05.479> you<00:01:06.479> know<00:01:06.510> not<00:01:06.869> too<00:01:07.080> bad<00:01:07.350> across<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.890> board

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
of you know not too bad across the board

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.710 
of you know not too bad across the board
they<00:01:08.250> did<00:01:08.460> quite<00:01:08.700> well<00:01:08.760> when<00:01:09.119> they<00:01:09.210> upgraded

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
they did quite well when they upgraded

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.530 
they did quite well when they upgraded
his<00:01:09.810> card<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.170> FIFA<00:01:10.470> 15<00:01:10.729> and<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:12.119> think<00:01:12.390> what

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
his card in FIFA 15 and I think what

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.840 
his card in FIFA 15 and I think what
we'll<00:01:12.720> see<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.020> slight<00:01:13.320> pace<00:01:13.619> increases<00:01:14.310> made

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
we'll see is slight pace increases made

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.090 
we'll see is slight pace increases made
me<00:01:15.000> like<00:01:15.180> shooting<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.020> physical<00:01:16.590> increases

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
me like shooting and physical increases

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.679 
me like shooting and physical increases
and<00:01:17.250> stuff<00:01:17.400> like<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.610> it's<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.939> big<00:01:18.150> bulky<00:01:18.509> guy

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
and stuff like that it's a big bulky guy

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.600 
and stuff like that it's a big bulky guy
and<00:01:18.840> he<00:01:18.900> deserves<00:01:19.259> at<00:01:19.439> least<00:01:19.470> we're<00:01:20.100> not<00:01:20.130> bulky

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
and he deserves at least we're not bulky

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.520 
and he deserves at least we're not bulky
I<00:01:20.640> guess<00:01:20.850> she<00:01:20.970> sort<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.299> gangly<00:01:21.869> but<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.409> know

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
I guess she sort of gangly but you know

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.380 
I guess she sort of gangly but you know
I<00:01:22.560> mean<00:01:22.770> he's<00:01:22.920> got<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.100> presence<00:01:23.580> about<00:01:23.700> him<00:01:24.030> and

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
I mean he's got a presence about him and

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.820 
I mean he's got a presence about him and
I<00:01:24.450> think<00:01:24.479> he<00:01:24.810> deserves<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.290> have<00:01:25.380> like<00:01:25.590> 80

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
I think he deserves to have like 80

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.730 
I think he deserves to have like 80
physical<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.960> would<00:01:28.110> be<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.229> pretty<00:01:28.500> good

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
physical and that would be a pretty good

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.230 
physical and that would be a pretty good
card<00:01:28.979> actually<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.520> may<00:01:29.700> look<00:01:29.880> at<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.150> and

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
card actually you may look at that and

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.649 
card actually you may look at that and
you<00:01:30.299> may<00:01:30.450> think<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.810> 77<00:01:31.409> pace<00:01:31.700> 77<00:01:32.700> dribbling<00:01:33.030> me

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
you may think of 77 pace 77 dribbling me

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.960

someone<00:01:49.470> that's<00:01:49.560> probably<00:01:49.920> going<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.189> look

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
someone that's probably going to look

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.240 
someone that's probably going to look
fairly<00:01:50.700> similar<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.930> fifa<00:01:52.259> 15<00:01:52.409> card<00:01:53.009> and

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
fairly similar to the fifa 15 card and

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.249 
fairly similar to the fifa 15 card and
that<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.460> Reggie<00:01:53.700> lying<00:01:54.000> Golan<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.689> Belgium

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
that is Reggie lying Golan the Belgium

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.280 
that is Reggie lying Golan the Belgium
who<00:01:55.409> plays<00:01:55.740> for<00:01:56.460> Roma<00:01:56.969> in<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.329> ceri<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.990> now

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
who plays for Roma in the ceri and now

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.260 
who plays for Roma in the ceri and now
he<00:01:58.350> got<00:01:58.740> an<00:01:58.860> 81<00:01:59.159> rated<00:01:59.610> card<00:01:59.850> which<00:02:00.030> i<00:02:00.180> believe

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
he got an 81 rated card which i believe

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.630 
he got an 81 rated card which i believe
is<00:02:00.630> an<00:02:00.810> upgrade<00:02:00.990> from<00:02:01.469> fifa<00:02:01.829> 15<00:02:01.979> like<00:02:02.490> they

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
is an upgrade from fifa 15 like they

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.209 
is an upgrade from fifa 15 like they
gave<00:02:02.820> them<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.000> January<00:02:03.420> upgrade<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:04.219> think

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
gave them a January upgrade I think

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.709 
gave them a January upgrade I think
we'll<00:02:05.399> probably<00:02:05.520> see<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.030> again<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.570> know

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
we'll probably see that again you know

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.900 
we'll probably see that again you know
there's<00:02:07.229> not<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:07.530> many<00:02:07.950> players<00:02:08.310> which<00:02:08.640> when

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
there's not that many players which when

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.059 
there's not that many players which when
he<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.060> give<00:02:09.390> them<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.690> January<00:02:10.140> upgrade<00:02:10.560> they

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
he a give them a January upgrade they

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.740 
he a give them a January upgrade they
then<00:02:11.280> boost<00:02:11.550> again<00:02:11.879> for<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.150> next<00:02:12.180> FIFA

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
then boost again for the next FIFA

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.400 
then boost again for the next FIFA
unless<00:02:13.050> they<00:02:13.200> have

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
unless they have

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.770 
unless they have
absolutely<00:02:14.370> standout<00:02:15.000> second<00:02:15.480> after<00:02:15.600> the

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
absolutely standout second after the

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.610 
absolutely standout second after the
season<00:02:16.260> for<00:02:16.860> example<00:02:17.310> Harry<00:02:17.490> Kane<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.690> I

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
season for example Harry Kane and I

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.230 
season for example Harry Kane and I
think<00:02:19.950> nine<00:02:20.160> Golan<00:02:20.550> or<00:02:20.640> stay<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.820> same<00:02:21.060> this

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
think nine Golan or stay the same this

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.100 
think nine Golan or stay the same this
is<00:02:21.360> what<00:02:21.480> it's<00:02:21.600> looking<00:02:21.810> like<00:02:21.870> on

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
is what it's looking like on

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.020 
is what it's looking like on
head-to-head<00:02:22.590> at<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:22.770> moment<00:02:23.070> anyway<00:02:23.160> in

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
head-to-head at the moment anyway in

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.120 
head-to-head at the moment anyway in
terms<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.420> stat<00:02:24.630> creases<00:02:25.080> it<00:02:25.350> increases<00:02:25.860> and

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
terms of stat creases it increases and

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.130 
terms of stat creases it increases and
decreases<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.850> think<00:02:27.450> we<00:02:27.630> won't<00:02:27.810> really<00:02:27.960> see

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
decreases I think we won't really see

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.900 
decreases I think we won't really see
any<00:02:28.320> decreases<00:02:28.890> maybe<00:02:29.130> a<00:02:29.250> couple<00:02:29.520> of<00:02:29.730> little

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
any decreases maybe a couple of little

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.600 
any decreases maybe a couple of little
boosts<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.510> because<00:02:31.350> he's<00:02:31.470> an<00:02:31.680> 81<00:02:32.070> rated<00:02:32.400> card

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
boosts and because he's an 81 rated card

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.130 
boosts and because he's an 81 rated card
i<00:02:32.700> think<00:02:32.880> his<00:02:33.030> card<00:02:33.330> should<00:02:33.540> show<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:33.780> and

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
i think his card should show that and

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.470 
i think his card should show that and
that<00:02:34.320> card<00:02:34.620> right<00:02:34.830> there<00:02:34.860> is<00:02:35.330> really<00:02:36.330> nice

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
that card right there is really nice

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.470 
that card right there is really nice
that<00:02:36.840> i'm<00:02:37.020> looking<00:02:37.440> forward<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:37.920> because

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
that i'm looking forward to that because

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.850 
that i'm looking forward to that because
slightly<00:02:39.480> better<00:02:39.660> stats<00:02:40.020> across<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.620> board

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
slightly better stats across the board

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.280 
slightly better stats across the board

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
respectively and he would be a nice CDM

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.150 
respectively and he would be a nice CDM
you<00:03:36.480> could<00:03:36.660> use<00:03:36.840> him<00:03:36.990> cm<00:03:37.260> as<00:03:37.440> well<00:03:37.620> but<00:03:38.100> I

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
you could use him cm as well but I

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.740 
you could use him cm as well but I
wouldn't<00:03:38.520> go<00:03:38.550> any<00:03:38.790> further<00:03:39.000> for<00:03:39.360> than<00:03:39.600> that

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
wouldn't go any further for than that

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.410 
wouldn't go any further for than that
and<00:03:39.900> put<00:03:40.050> Matt<00:03:40.200> cam<00:03:40.440> I<00:03:40.680> just<00:03:41.100> think<00:03:41.310> CDM<00:03:41.970> or<00:03:42.120> cm

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
and put Matt cam I just think CDM or cm

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.630 
and put Matt cam I just think CDM or cm
is<00:03:42.600> probably<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.020> right<00:03:43.200> spot<00:03:43.560> for<00:03:43.830> him<00:03:43.980> and

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
is probably the right spot for him and

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.760 
is probably the right spot for him and
he'll<00:03:45.120> he'll<00:03:45.540> get<00:03:45.750> up<00:03:45.870> there<00:03:46.140> like<00:03:46.320> he<00:03:46.470> scores

have<00:04:36.960> been<00:04:37.170> in<00:04:37.350> the<00:04:37.440> right<00:04:37.650> wing<00:04:37.860> spot<00:04:38.190> I

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
have been in the right wing spot I

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.590 
have been in the right wing spot I
believe<00:04:38.520> you<00:04:38.610> got<00:04:38.730> like<00:04:38.850> a<00:04:38.880> man<00:04:39.150> of<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.420> match

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
believe you got like a man of the match

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.540 
believe you got like a man of the match
card<00:04:39.960> and<00:04:40.170> also<00:04:40.410> his<00:04:40.560> team<00:04:40.740> of<00:04:40.860> the<00:04:40.950> season<00:04:41.400> is

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
card and also his team of the season is

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.730 
card and also his team of the season is
in<00:04:42.030> the<00:04:42.120> right<00:04:42.300> wing<00:04:42.480> spot<00:04:42.840> and<00:04:43.050> that<00:04:43.590> is

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
in the right wing spot and that is

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.920 
in the right wing spot and that is
probably<00:04:44.310> due<00:04:44.730> to<00:04:44.760> Suarez<00:04:45.240> you<00:04:45.630> know<00:04:45.750> they've

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
probably due to Suarez you know they've

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.740 
probably due to Suarez you know they've
got<00:04:46.050> that<00:04:46.200> front<00:04:46.530> three<00:04:46.860> of<00:04:47.070> Neymar<00:04:47.820> Suarez

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
got that front three of Neymar Suarez

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.400 
got that front three of Neymar Suarez
messy<00:04:49.290> and<00:04:49.530> you<00:04:50.190> know<00:04:50.660> of<00:04:51.660> course<00:04:51.750> that's

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
messy and you know of course that's

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.990 
messy and you know of course that's
where<00:04:52.680> mess<00:04:52.980> is<00:04:53.130> going<00:04:53.340> to<00:04:53.400> be<00:04:53.520> pushed<00:04:53.760> out<00:04:53.940> to

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
where mess is going to be pushed out to

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.970 
where mess is going to be pushed out to
and<00:04:54.390> I<00:04:54.450> think<00:04:54.660> his<00:04:54.780> regular<00:04:55.170> card<00:04:55.380> will<00:04:55.620> be<00:04:55.650> a

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
and I think his regular card will be a

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.830 
and I think his regular card will be a
right<00:04:56.250> winger<00:04:56.580> and<00:04:56.760> when<00:04:57.450> you<00:04:57.540> change

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
right winger and when you change

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.110 
right winger and when you change
position<00:04:58.350> of<00:04:58.440> a<00:04:58.530> player<00:04:58.740> there<00:04:59.040> the<00:04:59.610> value<00:05:00.000> of

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
position of a player there the value of

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.480 
position of a player there the value of
like<00:05:00.270> how<00:05:00.480> highly<00:05:01.140> they<00:05:01.260> rated<00:05:01.620> in<00:05:02.070> game

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
like how highly they rated in game

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.700 
like how highly they rated in game
changes<00:05:03.150> slightly<00:05:03.360> and<00:05:03.780> therefore<00:05:04.380> I<00:05:04.410> think

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
changes slightly and therefore I think

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.070 
changes slightly and therefore I think
messy<00:05:05.040> will<00:05:05.190> be<00:05:05.280> going<00:05:05.520> up<00:05:05.640> to<00:05:05.850> a<00:05:05.880> 94<00:05:06.720> rated

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
messy will be going up to a 94 rated

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.670 
messy will be going up to a 94 rated
card<00:05:07.640> which<00:05:08.640> is<00:05:08.810> one<00:05:09.810> higher<00:05:10.110> than<00:05:10.170> what<00:05:10.560> I've

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
card which is one higher than what I've

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.250 
card which is one higher than what I've
rated<00:05:10.980> R<00:05:11.010> enero<00:05:11.460> in<00:05:11.610> our<00:05:11.730> potential<00:05:12.270> cards<00:05:13.080> for

rated R enero in our potential cards for

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.830 
rated R enero in our potential cards for

both of these players are absolutely
awesome<00:05:21.050> and<00:05:22.050> and<00:05:22.410> let's<00:05:22.710> not<00:05:22.920> get<00:05:23.130> a<00:05:23.160> little

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
awesome and and let's not get a little

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.500 
awesome and and let's not get a little
war<00:05:23.610> started<00:05:24.240> but<00:05:24.510> 94<00:05:25.350> messy<00:05:25.910> 93<00:05:26.910> pace<00:05:27.120> nightly

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
war started but 94 messy 93 pace nightly

6<00:05:27.720> dribbling<00:05:28.050> nine<00:05:28.200> to<00:05:28.380> shoot<00:05:28.410> an<00:05:28.680> 89<00:05:29.070> passing

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:29.670 
6 dribbling nine to shoot an 89 passing

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.280 
6 dribbling nine to shoot an 89 passing
that<00:05:29.850> is<00:05:29.970> a<00:05:30.000> big<00:05:30.240> start<00:05:30.570> increase<00:05:30.870> in<00:05:31.110> his

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
that is a big start increase in his

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.530 
that is a big start increase in his
passing<00:05:31.860> because<00:05:32.430> he<00:05:32.520> got<00:05:32.670> literally<00:05:33.000> so<00:05:33.330> many

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 
passing because he got literally so many

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.990 
passing because he got literally so many
assists<00:05:33.990> last<00:05:34.170> year<00:05:34.590> and<00:05:34.770> I<00:05:34.800> think<00:05:35.760> some

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
assists last year and I think some

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.400 
assists last year and I think some
people<00:05:36.270> would<00:05:36.330> probably<00:05:36.480> say<00:05:36.810> his<00:05:36.840> person

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
people would probably say his person

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.470 
people would probably say his person
should<00:05:37.620> be<00:05:37.740> in<00:05:37.890> line<00:05:38.130> with<00:05:38.160> his<00:05:38.490> shooting<00:05:38.760> but

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
should be in line with his shooting but

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.690 
should be in line with his shooting but
he<00:05:39.630> got<00:05:39.840> like<00:05:39.870> loads<00:05:40.830> loads<00:05:41.160> of<00:05:41.340> girls<00:05:41.460> I<00:05:41.670> think

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
he got like loads loads of girls I think

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.790 
he got like loads loads of girls I think
he<00:05:41.940> got<00:05:42.090> one<00:05:42.360> more<00:05:42.540> goal<00:05:42.840> that<00:05:43.170> he<00:05:43.260> had<00:05:43.440> games

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
he got one more goal that he had games

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.010 
he got one more goal that he had games
played<00:05:44.160> last<00:05:44.430> year<00:05:44.670> and<00:05:45.030> a<00:05:45.450> whole<00:05:45.630> bunch<00:05:45.660> of

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
played last year and a whole bunch of

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.900 
played last year and a whole bunch of
assists<00:05:46.410> as<00:05:46.530> well<00:05:46.560> and<00:05:47.040> therefore<00:05:47.430> I<00:05:47.640> think

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
assists as well and therefore I think

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.280 
assists as well and therefore I think
because<00:05:48.180> he<00:05:48.240> got<00:05:48.360> like<00:05:48.510> fifty<00:05:48.810> eight<00:05:48.930> dollars

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
because he got like fifty eight dollars

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.290 
because he got like fifty eight dollars
or<00:05:49.410> 57<00:05:49.800> goals<00:05:50.040> or<00:05:50.250> something<00:05:50.610> I<00:05:50.760> think<00:05:51.180> his

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
or 57 goals or something I think his

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.060 
or 57 goals or something I think his
shooting<00:05:51.690> should<00:05:51.930> still<00:05:52.230> be<00:05:52.350> just<00:05:52.560> one<00:05:52.800> point

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
shooting should still be just one point

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.070 
shooting should still be just one point
higher<00:05:53.640> than<00:05:53.880> his<00:05:54.000> passing<00:05:54.540> but<00:05:54.690> nonetheless

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
higher than his passing but nonetheless

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.650 
higher than his passing but nonetheless
I'm<00:05:56.040> looking<00:05:56.520> forward<00:05:56.730> to<00:05:56.910> that<00:05:56.940> card<00:05:57.360> more

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
I'm looking forward to that card more

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.290 
I'm looking forward to that card more
than<00:05:57.690> ronaldo<00:05:58.200> in<00:05:58.530> FIFA<00:05:58.890> 16<00:05:59.070> just<00:05:59.640> because<00:06:00.060> I

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
than ronaldo in FIFA 16 just because I

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.790 
than ronaldo in FIFA 16 just because I
think<00:06:00.870> the<00:06:01.080> way<00:06:01.230> they're<00:06:01.440> going<00:06:01.650> with

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
think the way they're going with

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.230 
think the way they're going with
dribbling<00:06:02.250> and<00:06:02.370> stuff<00:06:02.610> like<00:06:02.820> Messi's

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
dribbling and stuff like Messi's

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.690 
dribbling and stuff like Messi's
obviously<00:06:03.690> an<00:06:03.870> absolute<00:06:04.740> magician<00:06:05.190> on<00:06:05.580> the

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
wonders in FIFA 16 I'd love to try them

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.290 
wonders in FIFA 16 I'd love to try them
out<00:06:10.680> I<00:06:10.860> can't<00:06:11.160> wait<00:06:11.250> until<00:06:11.730> the<00:06:11.850> game<00:06:12.000> comes

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300
