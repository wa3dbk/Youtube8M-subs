00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500 
hi in a session I'm going to show you

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.340 
hi in a session I'm going to show you
how<00:00:01.860> to<00:00:01.890> use<00:00:02.370> smart<00:00:02.580> art<00:00:03.000> to<00:00:03.389> enhance<00:00:03.750> your

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
how to use smart art to enhance your

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.309 
how to use smart art to enhance your
bullet<00:00:04.830> points<00:00:05.089> so<00:00:06.089> what<00:00:06.240> is<00:00:06.330> smart<00:00:06.629> art<00:00:06.899> well

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
bullet points so what is smart art well

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.919 
bullet points so what is smart art well
smart<00:00:07.710> art<00:00:07.950> is<00:00:08.130> basically<00:00:08.820> a<00:00:09.300> visual

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
smart art is basically a visual

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.459 
smart art is basically a visual
representation<00:00:10.530> of<00:00:11.570> information<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:12.809> in<00:00:13.230> our

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
representation of information and in our

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.589 
representation of information and in our
case<00:00:13.769> it's<00:00:14.070> going<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.309> be<00:00:14.429> visual<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:15.000> visual

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
case it's going to be visual a visual

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.380 
case it's going to be visual a visual
representation<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.500> your<00:00:17.130> text<00:00:17.490> so<00:00:17.640> let's<00:00:17.850> say

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
representation of your text so let's say

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.960 
representation of your text so let's say
for<00:00:18.600> example<00:00:18.960> you've<00:00:19.080> got<00:00:19.160> this<00:00:20.160> text<00:00:20.760> these

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
for example you've got this text these

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.609 
for example you've got this text these
bullet<00:00:21.330> points<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.810> text<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.320> want<00:00:22.500> to

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
bullet points of text and you want to

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.160 
bullet points of text and you want to
make<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.890> look<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.189> little<00:00:23.279> bit<00:00:23.430> more<00:00:23.670> visual

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
make it look a little bit more visual

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.170 
make it look a little bit more visual
something<00:00:25.170> like<00:00:25.320> this<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.980> you've<00:00:26.789> got<00:00:26.939> some

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
something like this and you've got some

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.330 
something like this and you've got some
you've<00:00:27.779> got<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.050> set<00:00:28.230> up<00:00:28.349> in<00:00:28.500> these<00:00:28.680> blocks<00:00:29.010> and

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
you've got to set up in these blocks and

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.330 
you've got to set up in these blocks and
also<00:00:29.820> these<00:00:30.720> images<00:00:31.260> here<00:00:31.470> or<00:00:31.619> let's<00:00:32.130> say<00:00:32.219> for

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
also these images here or let's say for

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.920 
also these images here or let's say for
example<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.700> if<00:00:32.790> you're<00:00:33.270> putting<00:00:33.510> together<00:00:33.690> a

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
example you if you're putting together a

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.290 
example you if you're putting together a
timeline<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:35.250> wanted<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.610> look<00:00:35.760> at<00:00:35.910> make

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
timeline and you wanted to look at make

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.819 
timeline and you wanted to look at make
it<00:00:36.420> look<00:00:36.540> like<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.840> pretty<00:00:37.110> easily<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.710> not

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
it look like this pretty easily and not

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.139 
it look like this pretty easily and not
have<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.100> worry<00:00:38.250> about<00:00:38.370> putting<00:00:38.610> shapes<00:00:38.940> and

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
have to worry about putting shapes and

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.290 
have to worry about putting shapes and
individually<00:00:39.750> or<00:00:40.379> let's<00:00:41.370> say<00:00:41.579> for<00:00:41.879> example

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
individually or let's say for example

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.290 
individually or let's say for example
you're<00:00:42.809> creating<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.260> hierarchy<00:00:43.559> or<00:00:44.040> an<00:00:44.579> org

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
you're creating a hierarchy or an org

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.319 
you're creating a hierarchy or an org
chart<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.870> want<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.260> make<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.649> look<00:00:46.860> like

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
chart and you want to make it look like

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.950 
chart and you want to make it look like
this<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:49.170> all<00:00:49.649> in<00:00:50.010> one<00:00:50.219> easy<00:00:50.579> step<00:00:50.760> well<00:00:51.300> that

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
this and all in one easy step well that

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.110 
this and all in one easy step well that
can<00:00:52.110> all<00:00:52.230> be<00:00:52.440> done<00:00:52.620> with<00:00:52.920> SmartArt<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:53.940> let's

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
can all be done with SmartArt so let's

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.630 
can all be done with SmartArt so let's
go<00:00:54.239> into<00:00:54.420> our<00:00:54.930> examples<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.770> how<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:55.980> create<00:00:56.340> it

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
go into our examples of how to create it

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.729 
go into our examples of how to create it
so<00:00:56.850> good<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.690> went<00:00:57.930> ahead<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.170> already<00:00:58.410> copied

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
so good I went ahead and already copied

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.250 
so good I went ahead and already copied
some<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.699> bullet<00:00:59.940> points<00:00:59.989> it's<00:01:00.989> actually

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
some of the bullet points it's actually

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.340 
some of the bullet points it's actually
fairly<00:01:01.440> easy<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:02.390> enhance<00:01:03.390> your<00:01:03.690> text<00:01:04.170> and

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
fairly easy to enhance your text and

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.620 
fairly easy to enhance your text and
convert<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.129> SmartArt<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:06.090> what<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.450> need

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
convert to the SmartArt so what you need

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.929 
convert to the SmartArt so what you need
to<00:01:06.720> do<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.110> once<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.860> type<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.280> type<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.850> your

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
to do is once you type it type in your

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.550 
to do is once you type it type in your
text<00:01:09.150> or<00:01:09.390> your<00:01:09.510> bullet<00:01:09.720> points<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.170> can

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
text or your bullet points you can

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.480 
text or your bullet points you can
select<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.310> under<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.540> Home<00:01:12.930> tab<00:01:12.960> go<00:01:13.530> to

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
select it and under the Home tab go to

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.149 
select it and under the Home tab go to
the<00:01:15.150> paragraph<00:01:15.509> group<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.200> click<00:01:16.439> on<00:01:16.710> convert

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
the paragraph group and click on convert

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.710 
the paragraph group and click on convert
to<00:01:17.430> SmartArt<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.119> once<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.390> click<00:01:18.570> on<00:01:18.659> that

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
to SmartArt so once you click on that

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.560 
to SmartArt so once you click on that
you<00:01:19.049> can<00:01:19.080> have<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.650> range<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.520> things<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:21.119> select

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
you can have a range of things to select

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.039 
you can have a range of things to select
from<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.530> let's<00:01:22.650> say<00:01:22.799> for<00:01:23.009> example<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:24.049> didn't

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
from so let's say for example I didn't

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.020 
from so let's say for example I didn't
want<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.290> see<00:01:25.500> any<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:25.950> if<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.850> hover

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
want to see any of this if you hover

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.780 
want to see any of this if you hover
over<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.570> will<00:01:27.780> actually<00:01:28.200> give<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.829> view

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
over it it will actually give you a view

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.030 
over it it will actually give you a view
of<00:01:29.880> what<00:01:30.150> it's<00:01:30.420> going<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.659> look<00:01:30.810> like<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.320> let's

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
of what it's going to look like so let's

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.020 
of what it's going to look like so let's
say<00:01:32.130> for<00:01:32.280> example<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.970> wanted<00:01:33.180> something<00:01:33.450> like

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
say for example I wanted something like

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.020 
say for example I wanted something like
let's<00:01:36.030> see<00:01:36.210> maybe<00:01:36.570> something<00:01:36.900> like<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.200> I

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
let's see maybe something like this I

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.660 
let's see maybe something like this I
click<00:01:39.030> on<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.630> I've<00:01:40.380> got<00:01:40.590> my<00:01:40.829> SmartArt

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
click on that and I've got my SmartArt

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.100 
click on that and I've got my SmartArt
or<00:01:41.790> created<00:01:42.090> for<00:01:42.240> me<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.509> now<00:01:42.630> all<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.810> need<00:01:42.869> to

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
or created for me and now all I need to

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.590 
or created for me and now all I need to
do<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.500> just<00:01:43.850> tweak<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.030> little<00:01:45.060> bit<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.450> so

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
do is just tweak it a little bit and so

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.630 
do is just tweak it a little bit and so
maybe<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:45.990> want<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.229> go<00:01:46.409> under<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.829> design<00:01:47.100> tab

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
maybe I want to go under the design tab

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.639 
maybe I want to go under the design tab
within<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.329> SmartArt<00:01:48.689> contextual<00:01:49.439> tab

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
within the SmartArt contextual tab

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.800 
within the SmartArt contextual tab
change<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.579> colors<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:50.970> let's<00:01:51.420> say<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.630> would

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
change the colors and let's say I would

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.710 
change the colors and let's say I would
like<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.520> like<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.640> have<00:01:53.729> some<00:01:53.970> bright<00:01:54.270> colors

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
like I like to have some bright colors

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.289 
like I like to have some bright colors
not<00:01:54.960> too<00:01:55.229> bright<00:01:55.619> maybe<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.729> would<00:01:56.909> do<00:01:57.060> and

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
not too bright maybe this would do and

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.080 
not too bright maybe this would do and
then<00:01:58.170> maybe<00:01:58.950> change<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.670> some<00:01:59.909> of<00:01:59.939> the

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
then maybe change of the some of the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.990 
then maybe change of the some of the
styles<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.810> make<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.680> look<00:02:01.860> kind<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.250> neat<00:02:02.460> so

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
styles and make it look kind of neat so

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.639 
styles and make it look kind of neat so
there's<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.299> lot<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.540> things<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:03.930> can<00:02:04.110> do<00:02:04.320> with

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
there's a lot of things you can do with

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.920 
there's a lot of things you can do with
the<00:02:04.770> smart<00:02:05.130> art<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.579> with<00:02:05.820> in<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.600> example

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
the smart art and with in this example

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.779 
the smart art and with in this example
I'm<00:02:07.079> just<00:02:07.229> going<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.409> choose<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:08.039> effect

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
I'm just going to choose this effect

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.260 
I'm just going to choose this effect
here<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.209> these<00:02:10.200> circles<00:02:11.129> already<00:02:11.700> represent

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
here and these circles already represent

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.000 
here and these circles already represent
an<00:02:12.510> image<00:02:13.140> icon<00:02:13.290> where<00:02:13.739> you

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
an image icon where you

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.800 
an image icon where you
insert<00:02:14.400> an<00:02:14.519> image<00:02:14.640> so<00:02:14.970> all<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.360> need<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.510> do<00:02:15.659> is

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
insert an image so all you need to do is

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.490 
insert an image so all you need to do is
select<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.290> image<00:02:16.650> here<00:02:16.980> or<00:02:17.340> select<00:02:18.060> that

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
select the image here or select that

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.649 
select the image here or select that
circle<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:19.709> physical<00:02:20.459> science<00:02:20.909> astronomy

circle and physical science astronomy

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.699 
circle and physical science astronomy
I'm<00:02:21.750> going<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:21.959> collect<00:02:22.260> that<00:02:22.620> image<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.510> then

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
I'm going to collect that image and then

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.690 
I'm going to collect that image and then
now<00:02:25.709> I'm<00:02:25.799> going<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:25.980> tweak<00:02:26.190> this<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.430> little<00:02:26.549> bit

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
now I'm going to tweak this a little bit

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.360 
now I'm going to tweak this a little bit
and<00:02:26.819> go<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.239> right-click<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:28.040> format<00:02:29.040> shape

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
and go and right-click and format shape

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.680 
and go and right-click and format shape
and<00:02:30.140> maybe<00:02:31.140> in<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.250> fill<00:02:32.549> that's<00:02:33.180> what<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.569> is

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
and maybe in the fill that's what it is

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.350 
and maybe in the fill that's what it is
it's<00:02:34.019> actually<00:02:34.319> filling<00:02:34.799> the<00:02:35.099> circle<00:02:35.580> with<00:02:36.209> an

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
it's actually filling the circle with an

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.170 
it's actually filling the circle with an
image<00:02:37.160> there's<00:02:38.160> these<00:02:38.340> offsets<00:02:38.879> I<00:02:39.030> can

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
image there's these offsets I can

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.520 
image there's these offsets I can
increase<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:40.709> offset<00:02:40.860> or<00:02:41.959> see<00:02:42.959> increase<00:02:43.379> the

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
increase the offset or see increase the

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.339 
increase the offset or see increase the
offset<00:02:43.829> here<00:02:44.099> over<00:02:44.549> to<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.849> right<00:02:45.319> make<00:02:46.319> a

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
offset here over to the right make a

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.319 
offset here over to the right make a
look<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.680> little<00:02:46.769> bit<00:02:47.010> nicer<00:02:47.489> those<00:02:48.150> law<00:02:48.299> things

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
look a little bit nicer those law things

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.530 
look a little bit nicer those law things
you<00:02:48.720> can<00:02:48.900> tweak<00:02:49.110> here<00:02:49.379> you<00:02:49.500> know<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:50.269> this<00:02:51.269> one

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
you can tweak here you know and this one

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.460 
you can tweak here you know and this one
I'm<00:02:51.690> just<00:02:51.720> going<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:51.959> go<00:02:52.109> ahead<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.319> finish

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
I'm just going to go ahead and finish

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.949 
I'm just going to go ahead and finish
this<00:02:52.769> one<00:02:53.010> life<00:02:53.220> science<00:02:53.700> this<00:02:53.970> is<00:02:54.180> DNA<00:02:54.660> I'll

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
this one life science this is DNA I'll

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.000 
this one life science this is DNA I'll
insert<00:02:55.319> that<00:02:55.590> we've<00:02:56.099> got<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.400> DNA<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:58.010> symbol

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
insert that we've got the DNA and symbol

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.910 
insert that we've got the DNA and symbol
or<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.370> DNA<00:02:59.750> or<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:00.780> think<00:03:01.049> it's<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.319> helix<00:03:01.680> there

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
or the DNA or I think it's a helix there

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.259 
or the DNA or I think it's a helix there
go<00:03:02.609> ahead<00:03:02.819> and<00:03:03.200> go<00:03:04.200> ahead<00:03:04.319> and<00:03:04.410> click<00:03:04.560> that<00:03:05.269> so

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
go ahead and go ahead and click that so

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.789 
go ahead and go ahead and click that so
this<00:03:06.390> is<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.569> social<00:03:06.930> science<00:03:07.049> put<00:03:07.560> something

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
this is a social science put something

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.259 
this is a social science put something
like<00:03:07.829> anthropology<00:03:08.640> in<00:03:08.700> there<00:03:08.819> I<00:03:08.849> think<00:03:09.150> these

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
like anthropology in there I think these

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.000 
like anthropology in there I think these
in<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:09.599> this<00:03:09.750> is<00:03:09.959> some<00:03:10.230> people<00:03:10.410> doing<00:03:10.739> a<00:03:10.799> dig

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
in it this is some people doing a dig

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.430 
in it this is some people doing a dig
there<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:11.599> there<00:03:12.599> we<00:03:12.720> have<00:03:12.930> our<00:03:12.959> bullet

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
there and there we have our bullet

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.309 
there and there we have our bullet
points<00:03:13.819> that<00:03:14.819> have<00:03:15.209> been<00:03:15.629> converted<00:03:15.989> into

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
points that have been converted into

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.660 
points that have been converted into
SmartArt<00:03:16.859> to<00:03:16.980> make<00:03:17.099> it<00:03:17.220> look<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.430> little<00:03:17.519> bit

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
SmartArt to make it look a little bit

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.000 
SmartArt to make it look a little bit
more<00:03:17.849> visually<00:03:18.239> appealing<00:03:18.630> now<00:03:19.620> let's<00:03:19.859> go

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
more visually appealing now let's go

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.890 
more visually appealing now let's go
into<00:03:20.160> our<00:03:20.340> second<00:03:20.790> example<00:03:21.120> where<00:03:21.510> we<00:03:21.720> have<00:03:21.870> a

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
into our second example where we have a

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.390 
into our second example where we have a
timeline<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:22.620> this<00:03:22.859> is<00:03:22.980> actually<00:03:23.280> fairly

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
timeline and this is actually fairly

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.449 
timeline and this is actually fairly
easy<00:03:23.669> too<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:24.209> we<00:03:24.690> can<00:03:24.840> select<00:03:25.319> this<00:03:25.709> this

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
easy too and we can select this this

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.610 
easy too and we can select this this
group<00:03:26.970> of<00:03:27.150> texts<00:03:27.510> convert<00:03:27.870> their<00:03:28.019> SmartArt

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
group of texts convert their SmartArt

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.059 
group of texts convert their SmartArt
and<00:03:29.130> let's<00:03:29.459> do<00:03:29.609> a<00:03:29.639> process<00:03:30.000> so<00:03:30.930> if<00:03:31.410> you<00:03:31.919> don't

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
and let's do a process so if you don't

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:33.289 
and let's do a process so if you don't
like<00:03:32.160> any<00:03:32.340> of<00:03:32.459> these<00:03:32.639> here<00:03:32.970> you<00:03:33.060> can<00:03:33.180> actually

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
like any of these here you can actually

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.360 
like any of these here you can actually
go<00:03:33.510> to<00:03:33.540> more<00:03:33.870> SmartArt<00:03:34.380> graphics<00:03:34.919> here<00:03:35.160> and

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
go to more SmartArt graphics here and

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.970 
go to more SmartArt graphics here and
there's<00:03:36.090> a<00:03:36.150> list<00:03:36.569> of<00:03:36.840> different<00:03:37.079> categories

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
there's a list of different categories

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.569 
there's a list of different categories
and<00:03:38.209> then<00:03:39.209> go<00:03:39.299> ahead<00:03:39.359> and<00:03:40.040> move<00:03:41.040> that<00:03:41.220> up<00:03:41.370> there

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
and then go ahead and move that up there

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.059 
and then go ahead and move that up there
and<00:03:41.730> this<00:03:42.239> is<00:03:42.299> basically<00:03:42.780> a<00:03:42.930> process<00:03:43.230> we<00:03:43.680> kind

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
and this is basically a process we kind

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.370 
and this is basically a process we kind
of<00:03:44.160> think<00:03:44.280> of<00:03:44.400> it<00:03:44.489> as<00:03:44.639> a<00:03:44.669> process<00:03:45.209> going<00:03:45.419> from

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
of think of it as a process going from

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.530 
of think of it as a process going from
one<00:03:47.130> quarter<00:03:47.549> to<00:03:47.669> the<00:03:47.700> next<00:03:48.060> quarter<00:03:48.419> and

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
one quarter to the next quarter and

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.370 
one quarter to the next quarter and
maybe<00:03:49.109> we<00:03:49.349> can<00:03:49.500> use<00:03:49.769> something<00:03:50.280> like<00:03:51.380> let's

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
maybe we can use something like let's

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.580 
maybe we can use something like let's
see<00:03:52.530> what<00:03:52.859> does<00:03:52.950> that<00:03:53.069> look<00:03:53.220> like<00:03:54.380> so<00:03:55.380> maybe

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
see what does that look like so maybe

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.050 
see what does that look like so maybe
can<00:03:55.680> suits<00:03:55.889> do<00:03:56.040> something<00:03:56.310> like<00:03:56.430> that<00:03:56.639> or<00:03:57.000> if

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
can suits do something like that or if

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.000 
can suits do something like that or if
you<00:03:57.150> don't<00:03:57.269> like<00:03:57.389> that<00:03:57.660> you<00:03:57.720> can<00:03:58.019> go<00:03:58.200> do

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
you don't like that you can go do

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.640 
you don't like that you can go do
something<00:03:59.040> like<00:03:59.400> that<00:03:59.700> or<00:04:00.349> there's<00:04:01.349> a<00:04:01.410> whole

too<00:04:35.250> much<00:04:35.700> for<00:04:36.060> folks<00:04:36.330> now<00:04:37.230> let's<00:04:37.380> go<00:04:37.470> into<00:04:37.620> our

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
too much for folks now let's go into our

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.560 
too much for folks now let's go into our
next<00:04:38.010> example<00:04:38.160> which<00:04:38.610> is<00:04:38.760> the<00:04:38.790> hierarchy<00:04:39.150> and

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
next example which is the hierarchy and

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.440 
next example which is the hierarchy and
and<00:04:39.840> basically<00:04:40.710> the<00:04:41.160> each<00:04:41.340> level<00:04:42.210> of

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
and basically the each level of

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.000 
and basically the each level of
hierarchy<00:04:42.720> that<00:04:42.900> goes<00:04:43.170> lower<00:04:43.440> you<00:04:43.680> have<00:04:43.830> to

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
hierarchy that goes lower you have to

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.930 
hierarchy that goes lower you have to
tab<00:04:44.250> on<00:04:44.490> out

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
tab on out

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.870 
tab on out
so<00:04:45.270> we<00:04:45.870> have<00:04:46.110> our<00:04:46.230> CEO<00:04:46.650> at<00:04:46.890> the<00:04:46.920> top<00:04:47.490> wherever

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
so we have our CEO at the top wherever

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.950 
so we have our CEO at the top wherever
CFO<00:04:48.480> CIO<00:04:49.290> and<00:04:49.500> CIO<00:04:49.800> and<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:50.280> as<00:04:51.180> we<00:04:51.540> go<00:04:51.690> further

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
CFO CIO and CIO and the as we go further

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.230 
CFO CIO and CIO and the as we go further
down<00:04:52.260> the<00:04:52.410> chain<00:04:52.440> we<00:04:53.400> tab<00:04:53.730> out<00:04:54.060> so<00:04:55.190> for<00:04:56.240> example

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
down the chain we tab out so for example

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.590 
down the chain we tab out so for example
if<00:04:57.360> I<00:04:57.510> say<00:04:57.720> for<00:04:57.960> example<00:04:57.990> with<00:04:58.890> add<00:04:59.100> a<00:04:59.600> let's

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
if I say for example with add a let's

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.960 
if I say for example with add a let's
add<00:05:00.780> a<00:05:00.810> director<00:05:01.440> here<00:05:01.919> to<00:05:02.070> this<00:05:02.190> level<00:05:02.430> all

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
add a director here to this level all

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.250 
add a director here to this level all
right<00:05:03.060> so<00:05:03.450> this<00:05:03.570> is<00:05:03.720> already<00:05:03.810> Chabot<00:05:04.230> to

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
right so this is already Chabot to

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.110 
right so this is already Chabot to
manager<00:05:04.650> I'm<00:05:04.710> going<00:05:04.890> to<00:05:04.950> go<00:05:05.010> ahead<00:05:05.100> and<00:05:05.250> and<00:05:05.790> go

manager I'm going to go ahead and and go

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.870 
manager I'm going to go ahead and and go
ahead<00:05:06.419> and<00:05:06.690> decrease<00:05:07.410> the<00:05:07.800> list<00:05:08.010> level<00:05:08.310> and

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
ahead and decrease the list level and

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.620 
ahead and decrease the list level and
let's<00:05:09.180> say<00:05:09.270> there's<00:05:09.480> another<00:05:09.690> director<00:05:10.200> here

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
let's say there's another director here

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.270 
let's say there's another director here
and<00:05:12.630> I<00:05:12.840> press<00:05:13.169> enter<00:05:13.560> you<00:05:13.590> can<00:05:13.740> see<00:05:13.830> that<00:05:14.010> it's

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
and I press enter you can see that it's

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.590 
and I press enter you can see that it's
still<00:05:14.460> stayed<00:05:14.700> within<00:05:14.880> that<00:05:15.060> level<00:05:15.240> so<00:05:15.510> I'm

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
still stayed within that level so I'm

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.150 
still stayed within that level so I'm
going<00:05:15.750> to<00:05:15.810> go<00:05:15.900> ahead<00:05:15.990> and<00:05:16.169> press<00:05:16.770> the<00:05:16.919> tab<00:05:17.130> key

can<00:05:24.180> just<00:05:24.360> go<00:05:24.450> in<00:05:24.570> and<00:05:24.690> convert<00:05:24.960> SmartArt<00:05:25.410> and

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
can just go in and convert SmartArt and

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.450 
can just go in and convert SmartArt and
we're<00:05:25.830> going<00:05:26.100> to<00:05:26.510> select<00:05:27.510> the<00:05:27.930> other<00:05:28.460> category

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
we're going to select the other category

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.870 
we're going to select the other category
here<00:05:29.730> and<00:05:29.910> hierarchy<00:05:30.750> and<00:05:30.930> maybe<00:05:31.520> if<00:05:32.520> I<00:05:32.640> wanted

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
here and hierarchy and maybe if I wanted

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.630 
here and hierarchy and maybe if I wanted
pictures<00:05:33.090> I<00:05:33.510> can<00:05:33.660> add<00:05:34.220> this<00:05:35.220> picture

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
pictures I can add this picture

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.340 
pictures I can add this picture
organization<00:05:36.240> chart<00:05:36.510> and<00:05:36.690> you'd<00:05:36.840> have<00:05:37.020> to<00:05:37.200> go

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
organization chart and you'd have to go

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.650 
organization chart and you'd have to go
ahead<00:05:37.650> and<00:05:37.800> put<00:05:38.250> pictures<00:05:38.640> of<00:05:38.850> folks<00:05:39.210> in<00:05:39.450> there

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
ahead and put pictures of folks in there

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.200 
ahead and put pictures of folks in there
but<00:05:40.350> in<00:05:40.860> this<00:05:40.979> example<00:05:41.370> not<00:05:41.640> going<00:05:41.850> to<00:05:41.940> do<00:05:42.060> that

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
but in this example not going to do that

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.719 
but in this example not going to do that
just<00:05:42.270> go<00:05:42.600> with<00:05:42.750> the<00:05:42.840> regular<00:05:43.290> org<00:05:43.890> chart<00:05:44.430> here

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
just go with the regular org chart here

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:48.350 
just go with the regular org chart here
and<00:05:45.950> with<00:05:46.950> the<00:05:47.220> org<00:05:47.400> chart<00:05:47.520> there's<00:05:48.000> actually

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
and with the org chart there's actually

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.060 
and with the org chart there's actually
ways<00:05:48.570> that<00:05:48.780> you<00:05:48.900> can<00:05:49.050> format<00:05:49.260> it<00:05:49.500> so<00:05:49.860> you<00:05:49.950> can

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
ways that you can format it so you can

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.760 
ways that you can format it so you can
see<00:05:50.220> here<00:05:50.430> that<00:05:50.610> there<00:05:51.450> is<00:05:51.479> a<00:05:51.780> way<00:05:52.350> that<00:05:52.560> it's

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
see here that there is a way that it's

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.740 
see here that there is a way that it's
lined<00:05:53.160> up<00:05:53.400> so<00:05:53.669> you<00:05:53.760> can<00:05:53.910> actually<00:05:54.060> go<00:05:54.360> here<00:05:54.630> and

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
lined up so you can actually go here and

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.530 
lined up so you can actually go here and
change<00:05:54.990> it<00:05:55.290> oops<00:05:56.100> so<00:05:56.790> if<00:05:56.970> I<00:05:57.060> can<00:05:57.210> go<00:05:57.330> up<00:05:57.419> in<00:05:57.479> the

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
change it oops so if I can go up in the

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.120 
change it oops so if I can go up in the
top<00:05:57.720> level<00:05:58.050> I<00:05:58.080> can<00:05:58.260> also<00:05:58.380> I<00:05:58.500> can<00:05:58.740> change<00:05:58.950> the

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
top level I can also I can change the

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.510 
top level I can also I can change the
layout<00:05:59.310> the<00:06:00.240> standard<00:06:00.690> both<00:06:01.530> hanging<00:06:02.370> right

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
layout the standard both hanging right

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.250 
layout the standard both hanging right
hanging<00:06:02.820> so<00:06:02.970> let's<00:06:03.240> go<00:06:03.390> to<00:06:03.450> an<00:06:03.690> example<00:06:03.990> down

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260 
hanging so let's go to an example down

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.050
