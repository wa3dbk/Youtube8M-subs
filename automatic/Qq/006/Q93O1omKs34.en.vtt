00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.300
 and 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.580
 hello how about commenting a tutorial 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:15.790
 pretty quick about the average catch 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.189
 hd if I have it for nothing now I'm 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.730
 doing a tutorial because I had a 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:25.699
 pretty problem 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:30.449
 enough puzzle for something else 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:33.870
 which is that I recorded yesterday's video that is 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.940
 the flash tuning I have it here this is 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.769
 the file starts with the average view and 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.170
 it was 25 minutes then we had it 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:43.980
 putting it in fast camera and such but 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:48.050
 the problem was that by adding it to 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.120
 the mega project was added normal 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.329
 but as you see here I did not put anything of the 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.210
 spikes sound then weird and good 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.970
 if he's a stranger but here you see what 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.170
 happens and is that adding it to Vegas is 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:05.869
 added the 25 minutes were added 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.020
 how much was 4 seconds and 2 thousandths is 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:12.240
 tell 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.579
 no video was added so I've 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.540
 been eating a little coconut and such and 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:21.790
 well at the end take the form why 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.550
 converting it to another format either 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.900
 neither did he leave me a convert 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.330
 another type of bird so he would not lose 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.560
 neither did he leave then, why not 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.240
 have to upload it to youtube and this 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.650
 download them to do for example same 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.680
 that I did lesbian in some videos that 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.990
 they come out corrupt 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.210
 they are shorter not this was 25 minutes and 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.430
 I did not feel like receiving them 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.190
 then there is simply this program 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.960
 game capture is due 4 wilder that is 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.820
 to convert from there to 4 simple 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.740
 of quality but I did not convert it 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.800
 I added it and then when I gave 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.540
 to be in he put the salinetas 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.400
 gave to be and gives me an error that from 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.950
 that could not be converted by the way 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.439
 problems 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.990
 and we already think a lot although it does not have 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.539
 many problems here you have seen a 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.190
 little your caster with this program in the 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.690
 I had catcher that is free to leave the 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.150
 link in the description that does not have 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.180
 a lot of trouble is searching in google search 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:19.140
 be the one that comes out the first you get the 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.090
 softonic and nothing because that simply there 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.920
 I had to do art once 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.880
 you have it 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.880
 you start 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.299
 you give dad a video converter because 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.440
 has a very good video converter 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:37.250
 and just add the video 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.220
 what do you have 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:44.600
 then you give in profile to go to mp3 of 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.340
 44 thousand 100 hertz high quality 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.980
 and put it where you want in this 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.190
 I'll put it on the desk 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.190
 Let's see 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.140
 if a greater web moment has painted 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.060
 montilla 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.410
 you put it on the desk and you give 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.850
 convert then it will become and 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.670
 pretty fast because the only thing that's going to 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.280
 to do is to convert the sound 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:11.490
 the video is going to eat and well now 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.890
 I come and go with the monkey, not when 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.600
 finish you will have the video archive of 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.580
 the 25 minutes with whatever time 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.890
 your video completely and already 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.240
 just add salt paste the video and 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.480
 you have the audio part the 4 seconds 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.920
 this and add the audio that has left you 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.100
 and that's it and you just have 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.420
 your audio and without any problem 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.000
 and well that has been all I hope that you 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:37.140
 I liked a pretty short tutorial 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.519
 Not even four minutes, but well, that's 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.640
 I hope you liked commenting 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.350
 subscribe to 'music and so on and without 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.640
 more than saying I say goodbye and see you in 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.640
