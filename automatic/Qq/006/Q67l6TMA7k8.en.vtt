00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.740
 wolverine showdown that I've 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.570
 recommended from 6 to 12 years

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.989

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:41.449
 I wanted to send a greeting to our friend 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.370

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.649
 revisions of the marvel collection and 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:52.429
 of several figures of saer as a greeting 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:55.299
 friend and this video is for you and we are going to 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:56.719
 see what comes within the 

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:59.680
 package 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.680
 Now I show you 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.360
 ok, that's how you see all the 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.760
 bags before you start putting this together 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.730
 is what this set should include as 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.220
 also here is the big bag a 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:18.020
 medium bag and smaller bag 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.020
 with all the pieces 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.090
 also here we are seeing a 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.030
 instructive 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.520
 and a surprise to all of you and that 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:33.580
 I also thought it was excellent 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:36.120
 idea that is that it includes a small comic 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.770
 more or less narrating the adventure of 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.070
 this set of the confrontation of the goal 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.730
 bring and also something very interesting is 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.200
 that does not bring dialogues like that scene 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.820
 nothing else is narrated through the 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.310
 movement this is a very good idea 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.070
 because if it's not the safest thing, I'm going to 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.320
 come in English and many little ones or 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.480
 many friends that would not have 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.620
 also liked that we are seeing 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:07.590
 advertising of the set that there is of 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:10.670
 avengers' look here announce us one of 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.970
 ultimate spider-man 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.190
 this I did not know I'm watching the 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.850
 comic book and I think it's an excellent 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:24.950
 news because here we are confirming 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:28.040
 then he will also take back sets 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:32.360
 excellent news that seems fabulous to me 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:35.440
 because I'm a fan of spiderman let's go 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.440
 to continue watching the comic 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:43.100
 this is the little comic that includes 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.100
 this set and well let's continue 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.640
 ok then we are already watching the set 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.580
 fully armed we are seeing everything 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.740
 what the helicopter includes 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.780
 these artists who are here in the 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.970
 bottom part that roll pretty well 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.970
 in order to have mobility in the 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.209
 helicopter the propellers move 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.880
 also our small indexes that 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.340
 has the back 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.580
 light 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.550
 ailerons that comes here to the sides 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.230
 they are also free and have the 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.790
 possibility of shooting is not going to do 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.650
 strong because it jumped flying and then not 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.470
 I find them 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.810
 this helicopter now let's see the 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.170
 part that will like to you 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:34.080
 which is that we are seeing wolverine 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:36.220
 have with his motorcycle we are going to return 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.330
 to lower it 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.610
 here we are looking at the figure 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.860
 with his original costume which is what most 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.100
 I liked it because I got the costumes from the 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.480
 I do not like the movie in the least 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:53.440
 we are looking at the back here 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.430
 we can see that it simulates the mask 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.980
 wolverine 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.130
 as well 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.570
 His claws 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.570
 We can remove them 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:10.090
 we are also seeing something very father of 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:14.080
 these figures we specify the hair 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:17.299
 we can change the faction of the face 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:20.840
 there we are seeing the other face that 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:23.500
 include this figure now let's see 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.500
 magnetto 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.270
 here we are seeing 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:33.240
 ready 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.240
 leaving to have his coat that style 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:41.520
 The helmet also will be removed for 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:43.440
 see the face the helmet is true 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.080
 enough father brings him to me I liked 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.660
 a lot because they are the original costumes 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.640
 that we all know in comics and 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.310
 we are seeing the helmet also the 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:57.620
 magnetix figure is quite father and 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.620
 let's see articles 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.380

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.380
 comes 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:07.360
 a small town hall word for 

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:11.229
 can save their sabers 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:14.319
 with a weapon as we are seeing here already 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:16.139
 whether you can use the saber or the 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:20.340
 weapon 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:23.550
