plateau<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:30.810> we<00:00:30.900> can<00:00:31.050> kind<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.320> just<00:00:31.380> have<00:00:31.619> a

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
plateau so we can kind of just have a

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.370 
plateau so we can kind of just have a
nice<00:00:31.890> little<00:00:32.040> look<00:00:32.340> here<00:00:32.719> going<00:00:33.719> between<00:00:33.899> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
nice little look here going between the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.490 
nice little look here going between the
two<00:00:35.660> two<00:00:36.660> sides<00:00:36.930> here<00:00:37.140> we<00:00:37.230> do<00:00:37.320> have<00:00:37.440> a

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
two two sides here we do have a

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.670 
two two sides here we do have a
destructible<00:00:37.950> rock<00:00:39.079> inside<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.230> base<00:00:40.410> here

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
destructible rock inside the base here

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.060 
destructible rock inside the base here
on<00:00:40.800> on<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.219> right<00:00:41.640> side<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.300> boxer<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.649> ramp

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
on on the right side of boxer and a ramp

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.069 
on on the right side of boxer and a ramp
there<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.300> ramp<00:00:45.480> going<00:00:45.690> off<00:00:45.870> right

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
there it is the ramp going off right

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.290 
there it is the ramp going off right
here<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.500> they<00:00:46.590> have<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> nice<00:00:46.920> little<00:00:47.100> run<00:00:48.090> way

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
here so they have a nice little run way

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.119 
here so they have a nice little run way
that<00:00:48.480> they<00:00:48.570> can<00:00:48.629> go<00:00:48.870> through<00:00:49.200> on<00:00:49.440> both<00:00:49.500> sides

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
that they can go through on both sides

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.610 
that they can go through on both sides
of<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.370> map<00:00:50.579> again<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.510> same<00:00:51.690> setup<00:00:51.960> here<00:00:52.230> for

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
of the map again the same setup here for

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.869 
of the map again the same setup here for
the<00:00:53.160> STC<00:00:54.649> just<00:00:55.649> kind<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:55.949> mirroring<00:00:56.430> both

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
the STC just kind of mirroring both

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.029 
the STC just kind of mirroring both
sides<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.480> they<00:00:57.539> are<00:00:57.660> starting<00:00:57.930> really<00:00:58.680> close

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
sides and they are starting really close

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.500 
sides and they are starting really close
to<00:00:59.160> each<00:00:59.250> other<00:00:59.340> not<00:00:59.579> starting<00:01:00.000> across<00:01:00.300> the

map<00:01:00.690> you're<00:01:00.960> starting<00:01:01.199> on<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.350> same<00:01:01.590> side<00:01:01.829> of

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
map you're starting on the same side of

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.680 
map you're starting on the same side of
the<00:01:02.039> map<00:01:02.219> should<00:01:02.879> be<00:01:02.969> interesting<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.420> see<00:01:03.570> if

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
the map should be interesting to see if

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.450 
the map should be interesting to see if
they<00:01:03.870> Scout<00:01:04.229> off<00:01:04.409> early<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:04.860> see<00:01:05.189> where<00:01:05.430> each

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
they Scout off early and see where each

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.399 
they Scout off early and see where each

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
that patch 1.2 change I would imagine

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.870 
that patch 1.2 change I would imagine
and<00:01:12.740> you<00:01:13.740> know<00:01:13.860> getting<00:01:14.100> ready<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.490> have<00:01:14.729> to

have<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.240> supply<00:01:15.630> depot<00:01:15.930> down<00:01:16.110> before<00:01:16.650> our

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
have that supply depot down before our

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.310 
have that supply depot down before our
racks<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.420> look<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:18.659> this<00:01:18.840> side<00:01:19.080> we<00:01:19.140> have

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
racks and you look on this side we have

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.440 
racks and you look on this side we have
the<00:01:19.470> same<00:01:19.740> deal<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.549> looks<00:01:20.790> like<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.090> same

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
the same deal it looks like the same

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.539 
the same deal it looks like the same
build<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.170> be<00:01:22.259> honest<00:01:22.650> here<00:01:22.920> as<00:01:23.930> we<00:01:24.930> go<00:01:25.080> on<00:01:25.549> both

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
build to be honest here as we go on both

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.240 
build to be honest here as we go on both
sides<00:01:26.850> now<00:01:27.030> we<00:01:27.210> do<00:01:27.450> have<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.689> boxer<00:01:28.680> going<00:01:28.979> for

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
sides now we do have a boxer going for

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.020 
sides now we do have a boxer going for
that<00:01:29.430> refinery<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.979> you<00:01:31.979> know<00:01:32.100> not<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:32.909> the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
STC sides as of yet but we will probably

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.399 
STC sides as of yet but we will probably
see<00:01:35.880> some<00:01:36.150> gas<00:01:36.360> starting<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.780> come<00:01:36.900> from<00:01:37.049> STC

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
see some gas starting to come from STC

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.260 
see some gas starting to come from STC
as<00:01:37.770> we<00:01:38.610> move<00:01:38.850> on<00:01:39.060> here<00:01:39.770> and<00:01:40.770> again<00:01:41.520> sec<00:01:42.090> now

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
as we move on here and again sec now

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.940 
as we move on here and again sec now
going<00:01:42.600> out<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.899> scouting<00:01:43.320> saying<00:01:43.590> hey<00:01:43.740> let's

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
going out and scouting saying hey let's

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.670 
going out and scouting saying hey let's
go<00:01:44.159> find<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.700> box<00:01:44.909> or<00:01:45.149> we<00:01:45.240> do<00:01:45.390> not<00:01:45.750> want<00:01:46.590> to

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
go find that box or we do not want to

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.230 
go find that box or we do not want to
get<00:01:46.829> out<00:01:46.950> scouted<00:01:47.369> by<00:01:47.399> box<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.000> looks<00:01:48.149> like

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
get out scouted by box and it looks like
