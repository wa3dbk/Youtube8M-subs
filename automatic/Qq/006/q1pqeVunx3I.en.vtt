00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:02.530
 hello to all styles 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:07.150
 if the parlor today I am with it article 9 3 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.690
 we overcame the flame was civil party 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.889
 domination over Paris but this time a little special 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.529
 because I decided to test the 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.300
 the actor 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.269
 it's great it's beautiful 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.179
 saying it on this weapon to get started 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.669
 so at first I had to do some parts to get used to before doing 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:30.340
 part of this stopover it is useless 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.990
 and the roma is weird 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.790
 jessie some difference attachment and what does not arrange siddique 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.090
 chelsea had used to alep so fast so firing the small deal 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.400
 at the same power as the cassette tries to 74 p 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.000
 in a case as you can see unfortunately to kill someone 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.510
 it's jacques viguier because my charger 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.100
 not enough there I told myself 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.890
 infanto do not forget you hire more popular so I learned that there is 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.000
 and because I ticked tiles france 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 these are gates at a dead end to recover ammunition 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.290
 m look 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.180
 and to himself he quickly satire not super school 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.010
 on the spot it will be their next target with fists yes 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.590
 is it not huge easy 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.219
 and not with eatable commands not really afp already before I had his 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:20.220
 close a heavy pack but 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.720
 cases when I was little homeless people next to each other 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.590
 a civilian helicopter outside researchers 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.590
 and they absolutely have to be able to reload supervises so if they 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.100
 decided not to go 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.640
 so that the prerequisite is associated with a 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.110
 it's really good but let's start from a distance there it starts to get tough 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.960
 tactically I thought 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.770
 a better deal remove the small bursts should start in 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.040
 the artichoke apparently the mayor there I start to do 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.530
 the Olympic Committee fortunately because it is more or less happy the 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.009
 records brought to 6% 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.430
 do not get started in the battle of parliament 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.860
 yeah because that's what was stopped and that to kill a glittering enemy 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.160
 St Raphael Pasqua 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.729
 small animals so fast to shoot 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.590
 max bullets in the body of the enemy and therefore for the same power as at 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.899
 94 street 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.050
 at 1 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.239
 it was real small trafalgar square 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.209
 when you drop into a well without the shooter's touch 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.139
 the singer fighter chargers and the bicots announced her clique do not 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:22.950
 still know how to manage life we ​​unpack more titillated called to fetch 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.810
 also back all the time to reload because if you start with a 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.739
 charger jaures 15 max pdg changing his only by bullets everything starts 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.929
 with a fifteen-ball magazine 

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:35.479
 it's not going to be obvious so buy it with little-train fans away because 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:38.149
 these people immediately removed from afar 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:42.029
 the balloons leave super fast and there's still a lot of hindsight so hours 

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:45.479
 the possibility of having a handful 

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:48.839
 I will try with the warlords the site not obvious 

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:53.199
 frankly that's my tip of the day for mac os 9 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.669
 ah yes looters 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:58.669
 space and pirates 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.560
 even criticized for his wake 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.150
 kolda what quarter study is about the unusable clinch saying it 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.359
 always aims why 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:13.760
 but because that's so famous brand I did not suffer from greenhouse shifted from 

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:17.249
 baltard so fast it is absolutely not the case I miss because 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:19.259
 China ceases the sea port of sète 

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:20.620
 six pirates in the summer 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.580
 I'll have more bullets the kid to shoot so either he sang 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.169
 sliced ​​on the covers 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:27.979
 and to know 

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:31.129
 so is it July 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.129
 on the contrary you will see that these cases 

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:37.949
 gone through the first part with the mac we compare ourselves we love his health 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:38.930
 it's afp 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.359
 abidjan the third 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:45.439
 alas to hers still makes a good score and finish with the 38 4 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:47.869
 ammar naceur the content of the agreement 

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:49.040
 it was 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.829
 so like the one animated at his former subsidiary 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:56.119
 to plane spy helios with a black border where it snows it is a little copied 

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:59.930
 more than usual used by steve jobs and I told myself why can 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:00.709
 because 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.279
 we try to take part in the fight 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:07.189
 l active you waiting mahinmi m as I made a name 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:10.599
 and I wanted to have the match equilibrium that case either I'm 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.119
 sense in a secure area and so I know I can call my friend be 

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:18.530
 I am for his part that I die and then when I walk active lyon ii and 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.189
 then after at delvaux rame 

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:24.619
 an artmedia black come back to Damascus and the elimination for example of the kgb bar 

00:04:24.619 --> 00:04:26.719
 I could easily in the agglo 

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:29.410
 it's gone so I'm going to bed 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.819
 and I exhausted him 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:33.189
 I'm three years old 

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:35.120
 therefore for school 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.469
 g to protect them 

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:40.559
 France must face cros New Yorker 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:45.460
 you have a good ten ump fifteen girls I think that's all 

00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:49.379
 what he has cia has ever thought maybe English technician next door 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:54.050
 1 buildings the case and if you see buildings the fish often 1 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.199
 and often the holes in the roofs and to build through the roofs as I 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.479
 think I made a game at stake 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:00.700
 nokia too 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.009
 for those who for example who they are 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:07.729
 who starts at black lake city either at least him against the fair of times before 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:09.069
 in a strategic country 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:11.160
 I want to clarify that compared to a small 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.259
 these flanges on the rise with the cops inc 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:15.040

 gold he says to rio and you're chances the first time someone 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:18.880
 made inability to see 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.910
 one night he played 21 games to draw off debt rockets 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:27.259
 13% the day before the very poor and even if their pack and participate 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:28.990
 and then the second time 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.100
 final playout it will be destroyed 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.099
 before this time I managed to get out on March 5th with him 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:37.680
 the agent actively blackburn and I continued 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.330
 it was first he even made a small 10% 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.550
 this will be there let's go
