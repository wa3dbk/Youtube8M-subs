00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
guys here so this is the output right

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.399 
guys here so this is the output right
here<00:03:22.769> your<00:03:23.459> connector<00:03:23.879> right<00:03:23.970> here<00:03:24.169> but<00:03:25.169> you

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409 
here your connector right here but you

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.589 
here your connector right here but you
need<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.739> put<00:03:25.979> this<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:26.489> your<00:03:26.579> camera<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.419> it

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
need to put this to your camera and it

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.640 
need to put this to your camera and it
didn't<00:03:27.870> come<00:03:28.199> with<00:03:28.229> that<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:30.810> reason<00:03:31.229> why

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
didn't come with that and the reason why

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.339 
didn't come with that and the reason why
is<00:03:32.269> it's<00:03:33.269> wireless<00:03:34.370> but<00:03:35.370> some<00:03:35.840> some<00:03:36.840> of<00:03:37.139> them

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
is it's wireless but some some of them

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.740 
is it's wireless but some some of them
don't<00:03:37.680> have<00:03:38.419> the<00:03:39.419> wireless<00:03:40.139> thing<00:03:40.409> so<00:03:41.750> that

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
don't have the wireless thing so that

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.619 
don't have the wireless thing so that
was<00:03:43.319> a<00:03:43.349> big<00:03:43.739> down<00:03:44.040> my<00:03:44.489> camera<00:03:44.940> does<00:03:45.209> not<00:03:45.419> have
