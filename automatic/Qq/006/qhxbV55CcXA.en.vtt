00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:07.509
 hello guys and girls I'm javier 9 and today 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.559
 I bring you here for a tutorial more in 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.180
 the one that I'm going to teach how to make a 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.180
 elevator with the command block 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.980
 good what we are going to need is going to be 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:21.779
 a block of commands 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.009
 a bad buttons and posters material 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.570
 of the command block is that only 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:27.060
 you can find in the creative and you do not know 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.279
 can do the survival but 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.529
 Well this is for servers but neither 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.480
 a server of a friend of yours and that for 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.059
 go up look at that is the beginning and this 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.850
 of the elevator that I carry here I say 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.890
 plant one would have plant 1 plant 1 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.460
 and I want to go back to the elevator by throwing him 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.739
 the button we are already here and 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:52.350
 We are on the 2nd floor although it does not look like 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.350
 to the bugs 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.719
 Believe it or not is a two look 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.719
 three and four floors 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.260
 and we are going to learn how this is done 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.180
 well first let's do here a 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.030
 kind of wall to put it up to the 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.770
 buttons 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.979
 and in what of command so that we 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.979
 I carried 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:20.420
 so it's worth 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:23.149
 and a gap here let's do it here 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.970
 two plants only worth to salt many 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.500
 suspenders 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.070
 but you can do it all 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.840
 what do you want 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.190
 we put here the command block that 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.620
 I like it today but 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:41.530
 and put in here what I touch 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:44.380
 ok we cover it like that 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.940
 we put here is button and button and here 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.940
 we put for example first floor 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.560
 and here second half 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.020
 will eliminate as we then have the 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.729
 just like this we are going to do one thing and 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.830
 we change the button for the wooden 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.959
 new or we change the block but I'm going 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.959
 to change the block directly by one 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.810
 what yesterday 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.350
 it's worth the button now here behind 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.040
 good as we still do not know the command 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.950
 We will not have him difficult to 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.530
 we want to do that I do and I go back 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.580
 well in fact the good building is a 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.020
 building yes I have done to the bad thing 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.900
 I would mistake put some lips after another 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.750
 Orchard program taught him how it is 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.550
 give them a room and here behind is 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.980
 the command block here what to 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.870
 iron and here the button is ok and now and it's 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.870
 the one below is there, it's worth button 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.870
 iron 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.360
 so we're going to put the command that 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.160
 we want it to be worth it now it was taught 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.890
 to put it 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.740
 first we will have to know why this 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.260
 command is going to be a teleportation if 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:14.450
 this is this one here is the first 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:18.180
 plant here we have to put bar pp 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:22.400
 the name of the player in my case javier 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:26.239
 9 and here you have to put the 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.160
 this was that he taught him the most remedy 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.540
 possible 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.110
 for example here let's say the c3 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.230
 And I feel 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:42.960
 and we get that it's minus 496 I'm going to 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:44.890
 aim less 496 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:48.270
 56 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.840
 and less 311 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.530
 OK 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.700
 and in the top up in the top one 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:01.160
 it is this one does not come out 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.160
 - 496 same 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:10.810
 60s height and minus 311 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.980
 it's worth waiting for all the pointed ones are 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.680
 these 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.640
 is here on the left of the screen x 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.620
 and Z 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.350
 not only until the coma 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.000
 we removed it and we will leave 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.750
 here 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.750
 and we put it 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:31.110
 this the first plant we put 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:34.090
 javier to 9 and after that we put 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:38.949
 directly script that follows at least 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:43.220
 400 96 56 and minus 311 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:45.949
 that's what is called more and here in the other 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:50.229
 would be the second floor we do the same 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.229
 pp javier 9 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.400
 the 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:05.320
 things of these that would be less 496 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:07.040
 60 and less 300 years 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.310
 and let's go to two 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.680
 By then it was time now if 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.160
 I give here to floor 16 brings us to the 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.160
 plant 1 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:24.610
 us that goes out here 495 the wrong one 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.620
 if you go out 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.270
 try to at least put it right since 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.270
 put as much in the middle as possible 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:40.200
 and now we go with the return that would be 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:42.650
 put a block as a button and see the 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:46.870
 that we have here the 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:52.080
 statistics so to say that day 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:55.080
 If I'm not mistaken but there fly 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.080
 -488 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.830
 56 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.440
 and minus 321 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:07.100
 okay so let's go to the two from outside 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:11.409
 what would this be and why 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:19.259
 pepe xabi gamer 9 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:19.259
 - 488 56 and minus 321 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:26.899
 and the same in the other 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.899
 this the same here is worth 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:36.740
 9 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:36.740
 - 468 56 and minus 321 

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:42.340
 and read 2 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:44.230
 and now let's go here we give vale first 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.470
 plant and we are already on the first floor 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:49.420
 we give the button and we come back here 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:51.460
 second floor we go to the second floor 

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:55.030
 ok look, let's go to the second floor 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:56.620
 we go to the button and we come back here it's worth 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.810
 up to here the tutorial 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.060
 If you have any questions leave me the comments 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:04.620
 and I will try to solve them if it has served you 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.620
 in like it 'favorites and goodbye
