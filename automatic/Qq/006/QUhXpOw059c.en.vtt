00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.180
 They are not allowed to talk about their grief today with the media 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.080
 is the Bundeswehr leadership the soldiers the last preparations for the 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.370
 official funeral of their Trier fallen comrades meet 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:17.140
 Against it citizens against their grief and anger over the 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.419
 do not hide afghanistan use 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:23.799
 if you think and appreciate it yourself children's orchestra tweets 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:27.669
 no matter where you are 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.569
 how high the consumption is not to rest 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:32.240
 Union becomes clear 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.240
 it is therefore that is being produced 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.750
 inhabited to my family 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.130
 the latter were fully recovered 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.850
 so is the most valuable 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.240
 it's not in my view 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.280
 also prove 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.280
 You do not have to look for the Bundeswehr reform 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.320
 in the nearby Landorff where one of the three soldiers is supposed to be the files he lived 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.550
 the streets are almost empty this morning 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.760
 The mayor tells that many Langdorfer after the death message 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.100
 of the 30-year-old family man 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.720
 but behind the doors Pitt also here on the meaning of the Afghanistan-use 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.190
 discussed 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.890
 Many hope for an answer in the official funeral service on 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:14.810
 afternoon 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.030
 especially from him defense minister karl -theodor zu Guttenberg 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.540
 over a canvas at the Regener market that the population can ecumenical 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.170
 Watching worship in the parish church of St. Michael 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.140
 next to Chancellor Angela Merkel he points the fallen soldier of the 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.520
 Panzergrenadierbataillons in the 12 also Prime Minister Horst Seehofer the 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.860
 last honor 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.570
 The dead were shot dead by an Afghan soldier 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.330
 German camps should actually protect 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.380
 in just a few days would be the use of the 30-year sergeant horse 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.010
 with soy over 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.820
 also born the relatives of the 22-year-old corporal Konstantin Menz 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.230
 born in Backnang and it's 21-year-old Georg Geyser Georg Kurat 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.230
 Munich had already been looking forward to their return 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.130
 Defense Minister zu Guttenberg finds very personal words 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.049
 but he sticks to the insert 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.769
 too painful was horrible that incident is it may not support 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.959
 leading laboriously constructed 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.639
 and to endanger 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:19.139
 it would be the wrong consequence 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.969
 and we would be the culprit from last Friday 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:23.459
 later 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.459
 help to the terrible triumph 

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:30.899
 and we let that help us not to dissuade our difficult way 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:35.089
 we are the dead and the wounded 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:38.569
 and we owe it to our soldiers who are also on site in the hour 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.409
 Afghanistan in action 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:45.799
 48 German soldiers have fallen in Afghanistan so far 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.859
 At the end of this year the deduction is to start 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.859
 too late for the three comrades from the Regener Bayerwaldkaserne 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:56.149
 their families will probably never understand the purpose of the mission
