turned out it's kind of a hybrid between

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.389 
turned out it's kind of a hybrid between
a<00:00:51.840> guardian<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.440> Citadel<00:00:52.890> sa-do's<00:00:53.280> a

a guardian and a Citadel sa-do's a

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.970 
a guardian and a Citadel sa-do's a
normal<00:00:53.879> 12<00:00:54.180> D<00:00:54.360> with<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.539> mid<00:00:54.780> pocket<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.379> a

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
normal 12 D with a mid pocket and a

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.500 
normal 12 D with a mid pocket and a
guardian<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.520> normally<00:00:56.850> 20<00:00:57.090> D<00:00:57.180> with<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.329> lower

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
guardian is normally 20 D with the lower

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.510 
guardian is normally 20 D with the lower
pocket<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.020> it's<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.289> 12<00:00:58.559> deep<00:00:58.739> with<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.340> lower

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
pocket so it's a 12 deep with the lower

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.069 
pocket so it's a 12 deep with the lower
pocket<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.239> which<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.449> think<00:01:00.480> it's<00:01:00.690> really<00:01:00.899> nice

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
pocket to which I think it's really nice

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.869 
pocket to which I think it's really nice
and<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.770> little<00:01:01.829> bit<00:01:02.010> simpler<00:01:02.340> shooter<00:01:02.609> stuff<00:01:02.789> I

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
and a little bit simpler shooter stuff I

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.759 
and a little bit simpler shooter stuff I
mean<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.149> user<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.480> little<00:01:03.690> bit<00:01:03.809> crazier<00:01:04.650> to

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
mean the user a little bit crazier to

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.320 
mean the user a little bit crazier to
some<00:01:04.949> people<00:01:05.250> but<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.519> really<00:01:05.700> works<00:01:05.970> out<00:01:06.180> with

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
some people but it really works out with

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.910 
some people but it really works out with
this<00:01:06.420> combination<00:01:06.720> with<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.110> nice<00:01:07.260> deep<00:01:07.500> pocket

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
this combination with a nice deep pocket

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.130 
this combination with a nice deep pocket
and<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.520> channel<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.299> channel<00:01:09.330> has<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> really

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
and the channel the channel has a really

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.929 
and the channel the channel has a really
nice<00:01:10.260> kind<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.680> peak<00:01:10.920> point<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.460> instead<00:01:11.850> of

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
nice kind of peak point to it instead of

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.630 
nice kind of peak point to it instead of
being<00:01:12.180> really<00:01:12.420> overly<00:01:12.810> defined<00:01:13.229> or<00:01:13.500> wide<00:01:14.340> and

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
that way but very simple and I like I

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.969 
that way but very simple and I like I
like<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.390> depth<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.110> also<00:01:31.619> like<00:01:31.860> the

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
like the depth of it I also like the

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.140 
like the depth of it I also like the
change-up<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.520> throw<00:01:32.700> we<00:01:32.790> normally<00:01:33.030> do

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
change-up in the throw we normally do

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
softer but I uses kind of two side wall

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
really really cool look to it I'm very

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.630 
really really cool look to it I'm very
simple<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.470> like<00:01:40.710> how<00:01:40.890> deep<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.400> like<00:01:41.520> the
