00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.250 

I<00:00:00.250> think<00:00:01.180> any<00:00:01.300> mother<00:00:01.540> would<00:00:01.599> look<00:00:01.930> back<00:00:02.080> and

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:02.260 
I think any mother would look back and

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.170 
I think any mother would look back and
say<00:00:02.470> that<00:00:03.280> you<00:00:03.430> never<00:00:03.580> know<00:00:03.760> how<00:00:03.910> it's<00:00:03.940> going

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:04.180 
say that you never know how it's going

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.730 
say that you never know how it's going
to<00:00:04.240> affect<00:00:04.299> you<00:00:04.569> until<00:00:04.779> you're<00:00:04.899> there<00:00:05.019> and<00:00:05.259> I

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:05.740

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.349

remember<00:00:05.799> becoming<00:00:06.519> a<00:00:06.669> mother<00:00:06.819> on<00:00:06.999> the<00:00:07.029> gate

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:07.359 
remember becoming a mother on the gate

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:09.930 
remember becoming a mother on the gate
thinking<00:00:07.689> this<00:00:07.839> is<00:00:07.990> not<00:00:08.140> part<00:00:08.500> of<00:00:08.620> my<00:00:08.940> my
