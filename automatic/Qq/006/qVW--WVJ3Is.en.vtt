 hello youtube friends welcome to 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.210
 this new video tutorial and good at 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.029
 this video will beat them as power 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.560
 customize our windows are four 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.200
 very simple well basic programs 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.690
 for the customization of our 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.890
 the first are some little eyes that yes in 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.150
 what is the good mouse we are going to 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.100
 download it all the links will be the 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.930
 creation of the video are all uploaded 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.760
 for me so that there is no 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.609
 confusion 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.129
 well let's install here right click 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:49.020
 wait here will leave us what is this 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.500
 binder 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.230
 let's double- click on the 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.620
 following 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:01.440
 I accept next we install 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.420
 it seems to me this mistake they want to omit 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.420
 and we give them the finished 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.670
 and it would be showing us what it is 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.990
 the little eyes to enlarge them because 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.080
 you sure resolve to be good 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.620
 little boy then we give in we go 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.620
 to an edge 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:27.229
 we give him we see how many the 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.890
 size and they would leave it and here for sure 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:34.890
 you can see them like that then 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.470
 we give a right click transparency 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.930
 and we give them 0% to make them look good 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.820
 whites 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.810
 if you want it only seen in the 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.369
 desk 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.560
 we leave it like that and if we give it a top 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:52.200
 let's go here and we will appear in 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.060
 any page that we go 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.570
 and then we click 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.130
 right we highlight the ticket only 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.130
 we will appear 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.979
 on the desk already 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.250
 ok the second is to swim meters that 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:12.030
 I was rita and you are seeing 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:15.440
 well we go here to the folder 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.440
 and in the installer 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.580
 in accepting me send me this error 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.220
 because I already have it installed but 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.620
 you normally follow with the 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.879
 installation 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:34.659
 then let's set up the let's 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:37.720
 give you right click preferences position 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:39.459
 here you want you see here 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.830
 can see anywhere in a tea 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.250
 we give it in the above we give in 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.250
 Apply 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.010
 and it can be up right down or right 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.500
 left 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:57.070
 I'll let him down give him to apply 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.070
 we are going to topics I have that theme 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:04.070
 there's a lot 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.070
 studied I'll leave here it's fine to apply 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.349
 and here in sounds good here you go 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.390
 to go configuring how you want 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.480
 for each effect that you add 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.980
 they give in apply then when it is already in 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.030
 everyone we give in to accept and we 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.790
 would already be the custom bar 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.270
 the third that are some cursors with 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.220
 installers 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.470
 to change 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:30.010
 to change what is the typical arrow 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.230
 white I have it installed by you 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.560
 you can see another cursor then we 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.160
 let's go to the folder are many cursors 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.440
 for any preference 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.290
 we must install to see any 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.730
 and this 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.530
 I have a problem with the thumbnails 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.469
 since they do not move they look like 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.269
 white some leaves but here always 

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:54.280
 where I say information about 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.970
 installation is going to be this is going to be the 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.450
 installer everything else 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.770
 they are normal miniatures then we 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.910
 we go to information on installation 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:07.180
 right click install 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.630
 we go to the control panel plan 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.120
 let's go to mouse 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.370
 and we give it up where it says pointers 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.519
 and here we are going to look for the cursor that 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.040
 we have installed 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.730
 but 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.139
 I was there 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.280
 this kit poplar 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.889
 we give in applying 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.669
 and it 's about 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:37.030
 changed the course 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:39.840
 we changed the course and the last one is that 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.840
 the water effect 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:46.040
 let's double- click on it and we'll have 

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:49.120
 what it is 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.120
 the water effect 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:59.189
 If you want to avoid it, we just give you 

00:04:55.649 --> 00:05:02.039
 right click here and here you go to 

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:03.270
 edit how they want if it's called big 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.830
 so 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.350
 and as it is 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.020
 Well, I hope you have served them 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.789

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:18.520

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:21.850
