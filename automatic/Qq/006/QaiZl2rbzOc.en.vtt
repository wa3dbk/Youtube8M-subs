00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
I've got to move quickly to do the finer

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.780 
I've got to move quickly to do the finer
lines<00:01:06.780> then<00:01:07.350> I'm<00:01:07.500> just<00:01:07.680> using<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.189> edge<00:01:08.400> of

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
lines then I'm just using the edge of

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.760 
lines then I'm just using the edge of
the<00:01:08.880> catalyst<00:01:09.360> blade<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:09.990> way<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.590> can

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
the catalyst blade and that way I can

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.399 
the catalyst blade and that way I can
get<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.159> finer<00:01:11.850> detail<00:01:12.450> then<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.020> could<00:01:13.229> when<00:01:13.380> I

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
get a finer detail then I could when I

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.039 
get a finer detail then I could when I
was<00:01:13.500> using<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:14.010> more<00:01:14.130> as<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> spatula<00:01:14.840> keep<00:01:15.840> in

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
was using it more as a spatula keep in

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.960 
was using it more as a spatula keep in
mind<00:01:16.320> with<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.830> if<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.009> don't<00:01:17.340> have<00:01:17.520> one<00:01:17.939> of

mind with this if you don't have one of

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.359 
mind with this if you don't have one of
these<00:01:18.150> catalyst<00:01:18.689> tools<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.560> can<00:01:19.830> cut<00:01:20.040> up<00:01:20.070> an

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
these catalyst tools you can cut up an

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.149 
these catalyst tools you can cut up an
old<00:01:20.610> hotel<00:01:21.119> key<00:01:21.509> card<00:01:21.750> or<00:01:21.930> credit<00:01:22.049> card<00:01:22.229> you

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
could use a heavy piece of cardstock

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.870 
could use a heavy piece of cardstock
that<00:01:25.350> you've<00:01:25.650> cut<00:01:25.860> down<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.610> would<00:01:26.759> do

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
that you've cut down that would do

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.270 
that you've cut down that would do
