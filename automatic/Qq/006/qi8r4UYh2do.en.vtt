 whole we give here below to export side 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:55.010
 and very important because if not skiing 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:58.400
 the minecraft will recognize us in 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:00.760
 png file the one that I'm the first of 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.139
 all because if not you will not recognize it 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:07.629
 png 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:07.629
 you give to save I'm going to put 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:14.830

 and I'm going to save it in the desktop 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:22.360
 and we give you to save 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:26.439
 and this this does not need to be 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:31.060
 deis what of 15 14 13 good the seconds 

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:33.069
 that count back that does not matter and host 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.659

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:39.659

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:51.040
 it is very important very important 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.890
 because otherwise I do not know what happens now with the 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.620
 program this continue good this is already 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:59.530
 if you want to upload a skin or something this already 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.930
 we can remove it very important because 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.550
 if not the minecraft does not recognize or not 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.910
 will recognize the skin 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.910
 we have to give him right click 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.910
 properties 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.700
 to see if I can 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.250

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.250
