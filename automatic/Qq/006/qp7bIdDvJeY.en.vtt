00:00:03.226 --> 00:00:06.766
 Pentagram TAB 7.5 is a tablet that is comfortable to use, 

00:00:06.886 --> 00:00:09.080
 maybe a bit heavier than competitors, 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.460
 but it is equipped with a large amount of RAM. 

00:00:12.686 --> 00:00:16.400
 It is worth mentioning also the front webcam serving mainly 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.520
 to conduct conversations via the Internet, and posted here. 

00:00:21.873 --> 00:00:24.333
 And what else can this tablet be useful for? 

00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:28.040
 Small size and included in the set of headphones 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.040
 encourage mobile entertainment. 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.606
 - in other words, to enjoy music. 

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.660
 The built-in tablet will be useful for this purpose 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.580
 an application with a lot of talking called Music. 

00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:43.233
 PENTAGRAM TAB 7.5 lists all songs found 

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:47.480
 in memory according to several criteria, such as an album or a performer. 

00:00:47.993 --> 00:00:50.793
 Music is useful when listening to music 

00:00:50.793 --> 00:00:53.720
 fast muting or sound reproduction. 

00:00:53.906 --> 00:00:57.993
 Because the tablet does not have a hardware button for this purpose, 

00:00:58.226 --> 00:01:03.040
 the volume change option appears on the Android taskbar at the bottom of the screen. 

00:01:04.146 --> 00:01:07.453
 By touching icons with a loudspeaker we change the level of sounds. 

00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:13.506
 Tablet Pentagram TAB 7.5 Dual Core IPS P5341 

00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.506
 equipped with a digital voice recorder. 

00:01:15.833 --> 00:01:18.993
 The Hi-Q MP3 Recorder app is used for 

00:01:19.193 --> 00:01:20.746
 which has many options. 

00:01:21.646 --> 00:01:24.846
 For example, you can easily set the file size, for example 

00:01:25.026 --> 00:01:27.926
 after which the recording will be stopped. 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.033
 Similarly, we also have the right to set the so-called bit rate, 

00:01:32.033 --> 00:01:36.280
 the speed at which the digital signal flows through the communication channel, 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.866
 and therefore the quality of the recording. 

00:01:38.046 --> 00:01:41.560
 Access to various options is obtained by clicking the icon 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.560
 placed in the upper right corner of the screen. 

00:01:44.213 --> 00:01:48.566
 We're using multimedia, so it's worth mentioning the Movie Player application, 

00:01:48.693 --> 00:01:51.633
 of course, playing different kinds of movies. 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.900
 Importantly, the tablet plays a large number of file formats, 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.320
 so there are no problems with converting them. 

00:01:58.966 --> 00:02:01.346
 Of course, the application also supports subtitles. 

00:02:01.906 --> 00:02:04.086
 Thanks to the USB On-The-Go function 

00:02:04.086 --> 00:02:06.973
 and the adapter attached to the device, 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.926
 the tablet can play videos straight from the pendrive. 

00:02:11.113 --> 00:02:14.473
 Importantly, despite the screen resolution smaller than HD 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.213
 the tablet supports 720p and even 1080p. 

00:02:19.773 --> 00:02:22.033
 If we connect PENTAGRAM TAB 7.5 

00:02:22.033 --> 00:02:24.800
 using an HDMI cable for a TV with HD 

00:02:24.933 --> 00:02:27.680
 we can play videos using this application 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.580
 whether to view photos in the highest quality available. 

00:02:33.073 --> 00:02:36.513
 At first glance, the PENTAGRAM TAB 7.5 tablet 

00:02:36.666 --> 00:02:38.913
 gives the impression of being solid, 

00:02:38.913 --> 00:02:40.773
 quite a heavy device. 

00:02:40.773 --> 00:02:43.920
 It does not look as stylish as the more expensive devices, 

00:02:44.133 --> 00:02:48.893
 but it has most of the features that are useful in a tablet of this size. 

00:02:49.093 --> 00:02:52.220
 My attention was paid to a durable battery 

00:02:52.386 --> 00:02:54.646
 and pre-installed software. 

00:02:54.746 --> 00:02:58.680
 I have to say goodbye and go back to testing other devices. 

00:02:59.086 --> 00:03:02.080
 I encourage you to visit our website, 

00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:06.140
 where a lot of information from the world of mobile entertainment awaits.
