00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.190 
have a serious problem under here maybe
a<00:02:00.180> little<00:02:00.329> bit<00:02:00.509> more<00:02:00.659> than<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.930> average

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
a little bit more than the average

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.649 
a little bit more than the average
person<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.369> instantly<00:02:02.969> ageless<00:02:03.210> is

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
person and so instantly ageless is

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.530 
person and so instantly ageless is
really<00:02:04.079> less<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.560> best<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.219> so<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:05.969> still<00:02:06.360> want

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
really less is best and so I still want

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.300 
really less is best and so I still want
to<00:02:06.630> use<00:02:06.810> less<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.350> want<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.649> use<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.920> Chinese

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
to use less I want to use the Chinese

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.800 
to use less I want to use the Chinese
little<00:02:08.640> amount<00:02:08.879> that<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.119> could<00:02:09.300> possibly<00:02:09.450> use

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
little amount that I could possibly use

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.369 
little amount that I could possibly use
and<00:02:10.319> so<00:02:11.280> in<00:02:11.520> order<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.180> get<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.450> spread<00:02:13.110> over

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
and so in order to get that spread over

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.720 
and so in order to get that spread over
the

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
the

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.530 
the
whole<00:02:14.090> bag<00:02:14.480> of<00:02:14.750> my<00:02:15.080> eye<00:02:15.110> I<00:02:16.000> use<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.269> brush

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
whole bag of my eye I use the brush

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.399 
whole bag of my eye I use the brush
because<00:02:18.349> instantly<00:02:19.280> ageless<00:02:19.510> works<00:02:20.510> Wallace

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
because instantly ageless works Wallace

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:24.759 
because instantly ageless works Wallace
drying<00:02:21.799> and<00:02:22.269> I<00:02:23.269> don't<00:02:23.720> want<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:24.170> rub<00:02:24.530> it<00:02:24.650> in

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
drying and I don't want to rub it in

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.160 
drying and I don't want to rub it in
it's<00:02:25.069> not<00:02:25.310> supposed<00:02:25.549> to<00:02:25.849> be<00:02:25.940> rubbed<00:02:26.209> in<00:02:26.510> which

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
it's not supposed to be rubbed in which

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.960 
it's not supposed to be rubbed in which
is<00:02:27.349> why<00:02:27.560> you<00:02:28.159> just<00:02:28.400> would<00:02:28.610> either<00:02:28.790> tap<00:02:29.209> it<00:02:29.450> in

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
is why you just would either tap it in

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.789 
is why you just would either tap it in
but<00:02:31.970> I<00:02:32.000> like<00:02:32.299> to<00:02:32.330> spread<00:02:32.750> it<00:02:32.930> very<00:02:33.230> thin<00:02:33.590> that

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
but I like to spread it very thin that

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:39.729 
but I like to spread it very thin that
