 struck the base color is bright red but here 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:03.309
 words and cosmetics but to be honest with you 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:07.180
 this lacquer I sat down so to speak too 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:10.119
 I like it for a long time 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:15.100
 the quality of this varnish and if used 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:20.950
 with such a drying or base coat 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:23.920

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.210

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.619
 try so let's get to our 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.470
 recruitment 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:38.610
 from fix price 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:42.350
 what comes in firstly is a stamp and here 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.350
 such a disk with pictures 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.340
 and here is this one thing with a scraper how I them 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.970
 call 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.490
 I do not use it as it is in time 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.570
 does not scratch the surface and can somehow 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.150
 damage drawing 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.020
 I usually use unnecessary plastic 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.020
 card 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:12.280
 Well, respectively, of course, the base varnish 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:14.650
 red and black for drawing so 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.910
 we will need liquid for you 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:21.950
 nail polish remover 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:25.340
 and cotton pads and so on the nameless to 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.310
 dots we carried you black lacquer let's 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.730
 Now we choose the picture that we have 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.950
 will be the main and let it be here 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.010
 this is a wonderful rose in 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.140
 the middle 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.200
 play on the clear contrast of the pattern and 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.750
 basecoat we are not as yet 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:49.690
 try to create a lightweight effect 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:53.080
 and carrying this pattern and so 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.060
 and so on the black coating on our 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.940
 nameless finger we'll be with you 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:02.730
 apply red lacquer apply on 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.730
 the surface of our disk is thick 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.480
 then we take a plastic card and under 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.150
 45 degree angle 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.180
 easy movement just remove the extra 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.700
 lacquer on the work surface 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:26.990
 something in style because of getting dirty 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:30.080
 just reed just a nightmare everything will be varnishes 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:33.830
 and so first we have a plastic card 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:36.080
 remove excess varnish from our disk further 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.050
 rolling and motions applied to 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:43.070
 stamp already given from the stamp put 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:45.830
 on the nail well that's how you see nothing 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:50.110
 it's not all that complicated 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:54.140
 just everything can be done by yourself 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:57.550
 stamping is a lot of different now 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:01.190
 pictures different colors 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:06.260
 so everything is just your county everything 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:09.640
 depends on your imagination and so are ours 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:12.260

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.260

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.590
 times after using stemping and we 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:22.190
