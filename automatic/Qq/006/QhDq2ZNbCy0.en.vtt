00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.890 

the<00:01:01.950> same<00:01:02.220> rhythm<00:01:02.640> as<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.820> claw<00:01:03.210> hammer<00:01:03.240> which

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
the same rhythm as a claw hammer which

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:11.290 
the same rhythm as a claw hammer which
is<00:01:07.490> the<00:01:08.490> difference<00:01:09.050> being<00:01:10.050> a<00:01:10.350> claw<00:01:11.070> hammer

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
is the difference being a claw hammer

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.940 
is the difference being a claw hammer
you<00:01:12.300> strike<00:01:12.690> with<00:01:12.720> your<00:01:13.050> nail<00:01:13.260> going<00:01:13.680> down

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
you strike with your nail going down

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.260 
you strike with your nail going down
like<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:15.200> then<00:01:16.200> strike<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.620> strings<00:01:17.270> strum

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
like this then strike the strings strum

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.290 
like this then strike the strings strum
the<00:01:18.420> strings<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.870> hit<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.440> fifth<00:01:20.300> pete

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
the strings and hit the fifth pete

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.570 
the strings and hit the fifth pete
seeger<00:01:21.540> style<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.650> actually<00:01:23.010> pluck<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
seeger style you actually pluck the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.780 
seeger style you actually pluck the
string<00:01:23.850> coming<00:01:24.240> up<00:01:24.390> from<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.930> bottom<00:01:25.790> then

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
string coming up from the bottom then

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.250 
string coming up from the bottom then
you<00:01:26.820> strum

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.270 

so<00:01:31.070> let<00:01:31.280> me<00:01:31.370> do<00:01:31.490> that<00:01:31.610> really<00:01:31.850> slowly<00:01:32.210> for<00:01:32.600> you

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
so let me do that really slowly for you

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.070 
so let me do that really slowly for you
it's<00:01:34.280> I'm<00:01:35.510> the<00:01:35.600> first<00:01:35.840> string<00:01:36.200> up

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
it's I'm the first string up

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.500 
it's I'm the first string up
strumming<00:01:39.080> down<00:01:39.350> with<00:01:39.500> my<00:01:39.650> fingers<00:01:40.330> and<00:01:41.330> then

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
strumming down with my fingers and then

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.390 
strumming down with my fingers and then
hitting<00:01:42.230> the<00:01:42.260> fifth<00:01:42.590> string

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:56.410 

really<00:01:46.400> slow

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.960 

so<00:01:57.420> there's<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.689> couple<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.170> things<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.530> can<00:01:58.560> do

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
so there's a couple of things you can do

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.520 
so there's a couple of things you can do
to<00:01:59.970> sort<00:02:00.150> of<00:02:00.270> get<00:02:00.450> your<00:02:00.659> hand<00:02:00.900> ready<00:02:01.200> for<00:02:01.439> this

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
to sort of get your hand ready for this

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.469 
to sort of get your hand ready for this
one<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:02.390> learning<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.509> pick<00:02:04.940> just<00:02:05.940> grabbing

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
one is learning to pick just grabbing

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.240 
one is learning to pick just grabbing
again<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.960> first<00:02:07.200> string<00:02:07.440> is<00:02:07.470> easiest<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.130> get

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
again the first string is easiest to get

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.090 
again the first string is easiest to get
to<00:02:08.489> so<00:02:08.789> just<00:02:08.819> get<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.590> come<00:02:10.590> up<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:11.039> don't

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
to so just get that come up you don't

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.770 
to so just get that come up you don't
want<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.370> hook<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:11.910> just<00:02:12.150> want<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.390> grab<00:02:12.540> it

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
want to hook it you just want to grab it

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.350 
want to hook it you just want to grab it

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.020 
so I'm picking out those strings melody
notes<00:05:24.680> with<00:05:24.890> the<00:05:25.370> upstroke<00:05:25.820> of<00:05:26.000> the<00:05:26.120> finger

strumming and hanging the fifth you can
use<00:05:33.230> it<00:05:33.380> for<00:05:33.560> just<00:05:33.650> playing<00:05:33.950> chords

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.600 

so<00:05:44.690> another<00:05:44.960> good<00:05:45.200> exercise<00:05:45.680> is<00:05:46.010> to<00:05:46.220> just<00:05:46.460> take

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
so another good exercise is to just take

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.140 
so another good exercise is to just take
an<00:05:46.730> open<00:05:47.000> G<00:05:47.920> and<00:05:48.920> play<00:05:49.280> the<00:05:49.400> first<00:05:49.639> string<00:05:49.790> and

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
an open G and play the first string and

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.700 
an open G and play the first string and
then<00:05:50.270> the<00:05:50.420> second<00:05:50.810> string

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.300 

Oh

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:08.010 

you<00:06:00.310> feelin<00:06:00.700> pretty<00:06:01.300> good<00:06:01.480> try<00:06:01.930> to<00:06:01.990> third

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.559 

I<00:06:08.340> think<00:06:09.340> the<00:06:09.430> beginning<00:06:09.550> of<00:06:09.970> well<00:06:10.150> the<00:06:10.240> circle

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:10.569 
I think the beginning of well the circle

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:12.420 
I think the beginning of well the circle
be<00:06:10.690> unbroken<00:06:10.720> you<00:06:11.259> can<00:06:11.410> do<00:06:11.560> with<00:06:11.860> a<00:06:11.889> second

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
be unbroken you can do with a second

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.219 
be unbroken you can do with a second
third<00:06:12.669> is<00:06:12.940> it<00:06:13.060> 2nd<00:06:13.479> 3rd<00:06:13.599> and<00:06:13.629> 4th<00:06:13.780> strings

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 
third is it 2nd 3rd and 4th strings

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:20.640 
third is it 2nd 3rd and 4th strings
let's<00:06:14.410> see<00:06:18.599> so<00:06:19.599> that's<00:06:19.810> just<00:06:19.990> the<00:06:20.199> second

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
let's see so that's just the second

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.499 
let's see so that's just the second
string<00:06:21.099> the<00:06:21.340> B<00:06:21.699> string<00:06:22.800> g<00:06:23.800> string

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:25.509 
string the B string g string

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:30.159 
string the B string g string
love<00:06:25.779> these<00:06:25.990> three

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:30.169 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:36.680 

okay<00:06:31.009> so<00:06:31.069> that's<00:06:31.430> how<00:06:31.550> Pete<00:06:31.939> does<00:06:32.180> it

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.690 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.200 

are<00:06:37.690> you<00:06:37.840> gonna<00:06:38.050> try
