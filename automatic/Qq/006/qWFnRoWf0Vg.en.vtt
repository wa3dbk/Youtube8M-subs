this thing oh well this fire to be

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.820 
this thing oh well this fire to be
honest<00:00:12.599> actually<00:00:12.900> has<00:00:12.990> multiple<00:00:13.230> different

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
honest actually has multiple different

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.400 
honest actually has multiple different
issues<00:00:14.089> what<00:00:15.089> originally<00:00:15.330> happened<00:00:15.599> here<00:00:16.139> was

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
issues what originally happened here was

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.859 
issues what originally happened here was
a<00:00:16.650> tread<00:00:17.010> separation<00:00:17.449> where<00:00:18.449> if<00:00:18.539> there<00:00:18.750> was

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
a tread separation where if there was

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.740 
a tread separation where if there was
air<00:00:19.109> in<00:00:19.260> his<00:00:19.350> tires<00:00:19.410> again<00:00:20.119> nice<00:00:21.119> big<00:00:21.449> bulge

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
air in his tires again nice big bulge

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.210 
air in his tires again nice big bulge
sticking<00:00:22.260> out<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.500> while<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:22.890> was<00:00:22.980> on<00:00:23.100> the

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
sticking out of that while it was on the

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.070 
sticking out of that while it was on the
car<00:00:23.460> because<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.150> was<00:00:24.180> on<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.449> inside<00:00:24.660> this

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
car because it was on the inside this

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.750 
car because it was on the inside this
particular<00:00:25.650> customers<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.279> from<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.609> other

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
particular customers is from the other

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.200 
particular customers is from the other
one<00:00:27.029> um<00:00:28.160> they<00:00:29.160> just<00:00:29.369> said<00:00:29.490> as<00:00:29.640> I'm<00:00:29.789> driving

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
one um they just said as I'm driving

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.330 
one um they just said as I'm driving
that<00:00:30.300> field<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.689> steering<00:00:31.080> wobbling<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.099> little

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
that field is steering wobbling a little

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.320 
that field is steering wobbling a little
bit<00:00:32.489> like<00:00:32.669> wobble<00:00:33.090> wobble

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.330 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.750 

vibration<00:00:37.330> so<00:00:38.290> I<00:00:38.320> said<00:00:38.710> well<00:00:39.370> let's<00:00:39.610> have<00:00:39.700> a

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
vibration so I said well let's have a

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.160 
vibration so I said well let's have a
look<00:00:39.850> at<00:00:40.060> the<00:00:40.120> car<00:00:40.330> and<00:00:40.480> see<00:00:40.630> what's<00:00:40.780> going<00:00:41.080> on

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
look at the car and see what's going on

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.780 
look at the car and see what's going on
and<00:00:41.380> we<00:00:41.470> got<00:00:41.620> on<00:00:41.740> the<00:00:41.830> inside<00:00:42.010> and<00:00:42.400> notice<00:00:42.670> that

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
and we got on the inside and notice that

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.820 
and we got on the inside and notice that
the<00:00:42.910> separation<00:00:43.390> when<00:00:44.230> you<00:00:44.350> drive<00:00:44.590> on<00:00:44.800> a

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:44.830 
the separation when you drive on a

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.640 
the separation when you drive on a
seperation<00:00:45.550> II<00:00:45.730> I<00:00:46.150> was<00:00:46.360> lead<00:00:46.570> way<00:00:46.750> into<00:00:47.140> when

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
seperation II I was lead way into when

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.500 
seperation II I was lead way into when
you<00:00:47.740> drive<00:00:47.980> on<00:00:48.160> a<00:00:48.190> separation<00:00:48.910> it<00:00:49.120> waives<00:00:49.360> that

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
you drive on a separation it waives that

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.720 
you drive on a separation it waives that
one<00:00:49.870> spot<00:00:50.200> because<00:00:50.440> it's<00:00:50.920> touching<00:00:51.400> the<00:00:51.550> road

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
one spot because it's touching the road

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.160 
one spot because it's touching the road
while<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:52.060> rest<00:00:52.390> of<00:00:52.510> the<00:00:52.570> tread<00:00:52.810> is<00:00:52.840> not

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
while the rest of the tread is not

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.050 
while the rest of the tread is not
that's<00:00:53.980> why<00:00:54.160> I<00:00:54.190> have<00:00:54.340> all<00:00:54.460> the<00:00:54.550> wires<00:00:54.790> and

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.060 
that's why I have all the wires and

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.360 
that's why I have all the wires and
stuff<00:00:55.150> hanging<00:00:55.450> and<00:00:56.290> it<00:00:56.410> happens<00:00:56.770> to<00:00:56.860> be<00:00:56.950> and

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
stuff hanging and it happens to be and

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.460 
stuff hanging and it happens to be and
there<00:00:58.270> will<00:00:58.390> be<00:00:58.420> a<00:00:58.480> slight<00:00:58.750> example<00:00:59.380> of

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
there will be a slight example of

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.020 
there will be a slight example of
separation<00:01:00.070> before<00:01:00.400> it's<00:01:00.520> come<00:01:00.730> all<00:01:00.880> the<00:01:01.000> way

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
separation before it's come all the way

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.870 
separation before it's come all the way
open<00:01:01.540> and<00:01:02.020> this<00:01:02.920> part<00:01:03.190> here<00:01:03.250> sort<00:01:03.670> of<00:01:03.760> looks

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:03.880 
open and this part here sort of looks

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.700 
open and this part here sort of looks
like<00:01:03.940> alignment<00:01:04.600> way<00:01:04.780> this<00:01:05.230> is<00:01:05.410> generally

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
like alignment way this is generally

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.110 
like alignment way this is generally
what<00:01:05.830> you<00:01:05.980> would<00:01:06.100> see<00:01:06.250> on<00:01:06.280> an<00:01:06.490> alignment<00:01:06.850> where

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
what you would see on an alignment where

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.300 
what you would see on an alignment where
situation<00:01:07.810> kind<00:01:08.020> of<00:01:08.110> like<00:01:08.260> over<00:01:08.470> here<00:01:08.800> how

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
situation kind of like over here how

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.920 
situation kind of like over here how
this<00:01:09.520> trend<00:01:09.729> is<00:01:09.910> taller<00:01:10.180> that<00:01:10.420> this<00:01:10.600> part<00:01:10.840> is

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
this trend is taller that this part is

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.830 
this trend is taller that this part is
born<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.700> it's<00:01:12.880> really<00:01:13.000> got<00:01:13.240> alignment<00:01:13.690> wear

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
born so it's really got alignment wear

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.690 
born so it's really got alignment wear
and<00:01:14.170> tread<00:01:14.410> separation<00:01:14.650> but<00:01:15.250> now<00:01:15.430> that<00:01:15.580> you

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
and tread separation but now that you

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.130 
and tread separation but now that you
asked<00:01:16.000> I<00:01:16.060> haven't<00:01:16.300> laid<00:01:16.420> a<00:01:16.479> table<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:16.960> one

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
asked I haven't laid a table the one

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.340 
asked I haven't laid a table the one
we're<00:01:17.440> here<00:01:18.450> now<00:01:19.450> this<00:01:19.660> came<00:01:19.840> off<00:01:19.960> a<00:01:20.020> Dodge

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
we're here now this came off a Dodge

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.609 
we're here now this came off a Dodge
Neon<00:01:20.650> SRT<00:01:21.340> four<00:01:21.690> we<00:01:22.690> worked<00:01:22.930> on<00:01:23.080> the<00:01:23.229> other<00:01:23.380> day

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
Neon SRT four we worked on the other day

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.520 
Neon SRT four we worked on the other day
as<00:01:23.890> you<00:01:24.820> can<00:01:25.000> see<00:01:25.210> you<00:01:25.390> have<00:01:25.420> good<00:01:25.869> tread<00:01:26.229> and

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
as you can see you have good tread and

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.510 
as you can see you have good tread and
you're<00:01:26.680> starting<00:01:26.950> to<00:01:27.010> get<00:01:27.100> a<00:01:27.160> little<00:01:27.340> little

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
you're starting to get a little little

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.800 
you're starting to get a little little
wine<00:01:27.790> that<00:01:27.940> we're<00:01:28.090> here<00:01:28.420> where<00:01:28.660> it's

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
wine that we're here where it's

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.810 
wine that we're here where it's
smoothing<00:01:29.260> at<00:01:29.380> that<00:01:29.530> kind<00:01:29.770> of<00:01:29.890> arc<00:01:30.220> to<00:01:30.400> angle

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
smoothing at that kind of arc to angle

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.750 
smoothing at that kind of arc to angle
that<00:01:31.630> arc<00:01:31.930> angle<00:01:32.170> is<00:01:32.440> caused<00:01:32.770> by<00:01:33.100> usually

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
that arc angle is caused by usually

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.300 
that arc angle is caused by usually
camber<00:01:34.240> issues<00:01:34.660> where<00:01:35.440> instead<00:01:35.800> of<00:01:35.860> the<00:01:36.100> time

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
camber issues where instead of the time

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.070 
camber issues where instead of the time
sitting<00:01:36.760> like<00:01:36.910> this<00:01:36.940> on<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:37.510> road<00:01:37.690> while<00:01:37.869> it's

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
sitting like this on the road while it's

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.480 
sitting like this on the road while it's
on<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.290> car<00:01:38.470> it's<00:01:38.770> sitting<00:01:39.040> kind<00:01:39.220> of<00:01:39.310> like

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
on the car it's sitting kind of like

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.389 
on the car it's sitting kind of like
this<00:01:39.700> because<00:01:40.119> the<00:01:40.270> alignment<00:01:40.720> specs<00:01:40.990> are<00:01:41.140> out

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
this because the alignment specs are out

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:44.520 
this because the alignment specs are out
so<00:01:42.399> this<00:01:42.610> right<00:01:42.820> here<00:01:43.119> another<00:01:43.750> huge<00:01:44.110> example

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
so this right here another huge example

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.840 
so this right here another huge example
of<00:01:44.649> camber<00:01:45.009> but<00:01:45.130> it's<00:01:45.280> starting<00:01:45.429> to<00:01:45.610> go<00:01:45.700> into

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
of camber but it's starting to go into

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.700 
of camber but it's starting to go into
the<00:01:46.000> actual<00:01:46.300> internal<00:01:46.660> threads<00:01:47.140> of<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.470> tire

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
the actual internal threads of the tire

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.980 
the actual internal threads of the tire
so<00:01:48.009> that<00:01:48.460> way<00:01:48.759> the<00:01:48.910> thread<00:01:49.179> spoke<00:01:49.479> out<00:01:49.690> a<00:01:49.720> lot

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
so that way the thread spoke out a lot

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.120 
so that way the thread spoke out a lot
of<00:01:50.020> times<00:01:50.259> you'll<00:01:50.500> be<00:01:50.530> riding<00:01:50.770> down<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.039> road

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
of times you'll be riding down the road

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.639 
of times you'll be riding down the road
thinking<00:01:51.610> my<00:01:51.759> tires<00:01:52.030> perfectly<00:01:52.570> fine<00:01:52.780> but<00:01:53.530> on

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
thinking my tires perfectly fine but on

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:55.800 
thinking my tires perfectly fine but on
the<00:01:53.770> inside<00:01:53.950> you<00:01:54.460> have<00:01:54.610> all<00:01:54.789> this<00:01:54.910> where<00:01:55.210> these

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
the inside you have all this where these

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.270 
the inside you have all this where these
are<00:01:56.020> things<00:01:56.229> that<00:01:56.410> we<00:01:56.530> notice<00:01:56.830> when<00:01:56.950> the<00:01:57.070> cars

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
are things that we notice when the cars

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.300 
are things that we notice when the cars
are<00:01:57.460> up<00:01:57.520> on<00:01:57.729> the<00:01:57.820> lift<00:01:58.950> other<00:01:59.950> than<00:02:00.190> that

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
are up on the lift other than that

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.740 
are up on the lift other than that
that's<00:02:00.460> generally<00:02:00.970> how<00:02:01.000> that<00:02:01.240> works

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
that's generally how that works

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.540 
that's generally how that works
guess<00:02:02.110> this<00:02:02.289> turned<00:02:02.500> into<00:02:02.560> a<00:02:02.710> video<00:02:03.009> it's<00:02:03.369> been

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
guess this turned into a video it's been

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.910 
guess this turned into a video it's been
