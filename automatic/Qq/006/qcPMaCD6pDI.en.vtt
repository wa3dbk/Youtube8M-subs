the<00:01:09.930> difference<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.409> drastic<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.369> mean<00:01:13.159> as<00:01:14.159> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
the difference is drastic I mean as the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.219 
the difference is drastic I mean as the
arm<00:01:14.549> comes<00:01:15.000> up<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.420> doesn't<00:01:15.720> sound<00:01:15.840> as<00:01:15.990> much

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
drivetrain of the engine and it pretty

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.950 
drivetrain of the engine and it pretty
much<00:01:19.500> eliminates<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.189> exhaust<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:21.390> engine

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
much eliminates the exhaust the engine

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.950 
much eliminates the exhaust the engine
