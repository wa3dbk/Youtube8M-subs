means is you can now put it off to where
you<00:01:57.630> know<00:01:57.750> when<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.049> queue<00:01:58.649> for<00:01:58.829> an<00:01:58.890> instance

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
you know when you queue for an instance

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.300 
you know when you queue for an instance
and<00:01:59.520> you<00:02:00.090> find<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.780> finally<00:02:01.140> pops<00:02:01.380> say<00:02:02.009> the

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
and you find it finally pops say the

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.830 
and you find it finally pops say the
group<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.700> like<00:02:02.939> halfway<00:02:03.270> through<00:02:03.689> the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
group is like halfway through the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.560 
group is like halfway through the
instance<00:02:04.530> if<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:05.670> find<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.060> annoying<00:02:06.360> you
