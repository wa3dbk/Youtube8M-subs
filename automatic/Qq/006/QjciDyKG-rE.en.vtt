00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello dear friends of the craft cellar 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.649
 Today's a little video about ours 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.599
 quadcopter here next to thomas too 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:17.730
 we see now we have this regulation 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.960
 finally true adapted and very good 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.470
 maybe you can still work 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.760
 very little bit divide around but 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.210
 I would be enough for this video now 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.949
 say 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.900
 and we still have three 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.369
 different speed levels 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.950
 programmed with it a bit 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.120
 can decorate better in which 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.680
 speeds the thing so well 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.629
 maybe we should work 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.170
 Now we are far away from the microphone 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.660
 will be called the current which flows 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.230
 that will flow so that soja 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.670
 So it stood 5 amps have so einstand 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.890
 cast around the 5 amps 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.660
 But that's not the gas for the thing 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.410
 that can only be tested and floated 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.230
 then the next higher power spoon has 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.229
 ando 25 amps and full power then has 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.020
 a 50 ampere that there are two engines 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.060
 distributed on two motors 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.630
 then the league is exactly its limits 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.579
 and therefore for the short-term everything 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.280
 can see together 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:19.860
 well I have the remote control of the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.960
 hand our beautiful joystick first time 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.030
 shortly after minerals and now I go 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.030
 just that and gas 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.350
 each cell of controls 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.690
 think ahead 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.690
 H 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.560
 again and again has beautiful in the 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.560
 balance 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.780
 Of course you can do more now 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.399
 move that is in them 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.399
 can award different coalitions 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.100
 you can already see the angle beautiful 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.530
 The angles now appear a bit 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.600
 we can do that much steeper 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.910
 adjust when we see how that works 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.670
 flight behavior then expresses to maximum 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.820
 both directions set 50 degrees 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.060
 and of course the slow one too 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.060
 tempo 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:59.829
 you can save now completely we can 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.599
 that's not why the league can be there 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.599
 not supposed to guide that well, not even 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.120
 which somehow has become weaker 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.050
 you can also see a little bit 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.360
 a picture that is the whole inventory 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.599
 Raise a bit when you go full throttle 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.599
 gives 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:43.580
 yes, probably it is in the 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.650
 Folk is a bit too much power like that 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.840
 that things are a bit down 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.110
 or not ours otherwise 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.430
 it can be so powerful 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.580
 that I'm a bit out of it 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.790
 balance almost a bit 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.209
 get out that 's it for now 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.760
 this time 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.430
 and he knows what he video the next 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.740
 contrary to blog 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.030
 Do not let yourself be surprised 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.190
 explain because the factions of the 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.570
 Remote control completely the function of 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.760
 family, well , because he's pretty 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.370
 we can do that too 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.930
 in the year so not now next time 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.519
 Video I meant next year 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.859
 good idea to make your next video 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.590
 we this because already quite long 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.780
 I think and which one here 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.840
 Just want to see then look again 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.630
 or subscribe or join us 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.919
 we also write something on facebook 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.660
 there is something new or what we are doing right now 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.850
 do 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.860
 and yes we are looking forward to and 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.669
 Reunion comes then I switch first 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.590
 at times 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.840
 so are already the motors are active 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.240
 Now you can see how it is here 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.090
 change any sensor values ​​here 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.759
 but the whole construct moves 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:57.160
 I let it open for a minute 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:05:00.069
 the temperature between wool and 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:03.300
 Cotton did not slow down the judges 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:03.300
 set correctly 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:11.339
 next is now closing 

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:11.339
 etch and complete the
