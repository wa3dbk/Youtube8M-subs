 How about friends, this time we're going to 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.710

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.520
 first ones that come out for this generation 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.170
 of consoles that really gave to look 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.780
 for its graphics its great graphics 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.140
 for that moment that he took out let's see in 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.140
 this package 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.170
 well for the part of good for the part 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.830
 lateral good only says grant and 04 and by 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.920
 the back 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.430
 welcome to liberty city let's see 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.430
 the content 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.740
 I do not know if it's the map of the game seems like a 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.740
 poster 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.090
 it is effectively the guarantee map 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.850
 pardon of liberty city 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.840
 quite big from the other side comes 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.840
 you 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.360
 there's also a survival here 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.360
 in liberty Zionism 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.509
 and another small manual 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.910
 knowing that is compatible with the 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.910
 xbox 360 control 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.479
 and the discs that it includes 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.090
 believe there are two discs 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.080
 for the complete installation of the game 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:12.570
 on your computer 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.130
 while installing gta 4 I commented 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.260
 that the natal form to control niko 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.210
 bellic will be the keyboard and the mouse without 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.980
 However if they have a pad they can use it 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.900
 just configure it otis search and it 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.340
 will be ready to play but also 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.800
 are the option to use a control 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.630
 after 360 gta being a game of 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.770
 games for windows guarantees the total 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.660
 compatibility with control 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.330
 microsoft however there are two variants 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.880
 one that uses is a bus control 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.310
 360 wired which have connection 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.070
 usb although this type of controls are not 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.840
 so common so another option would be 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.090
 in case you have a bus control 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.250
 360 wireless that I knew you is a 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.750
 USB receiver for said control said 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.550
 receiver you can get it by 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.340
 separately or in a package that contains a 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.080
 control of our 60 but for pc 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.090
 once the connection with the 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.769
 control after 360 is set 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.330
 automatically only so that 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.150
 enjoy the game and do not fight 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.200
 be mapping button by button 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.940
 remember that this game is a great 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.319
 game that requires a mid-range PC 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.360
 to be able to run it properly 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.370
 there are also two official parts of 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.840
 rockstar which correct errors and 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.720
 you optimize the game to get some 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.190
 frames per second extras gta 4 good 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.200
 it 's worth playing so much on consoles 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.209
 as in pc but many choose to play 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.010
 the PC version since this can be 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.450
 modified in certain respects as 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.430
 made to put more traffic in the 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.840
 streets adjusts the graphic options and 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.670
 improve the visual experience of the game 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.319
 as well as the large number of motorcycles 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.420
 graphics that can install come 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.750
 even improve a lot in quality 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.750
 the tone 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.180

 they also know that they can get it in 

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:49.840
 digital version but good many gamers 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:52.569
 who are collectors like 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.519
 You will probably feel that what you buy 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.709
 what they play rather they have in 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.170
