00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.210
 hello friends with you Anton 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.569
 Dyachenko 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.840
 and in this video it means how to break 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:14.219
 hard drive means windows 7 and 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.350
 windows 8 so go to start select 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.289
 point about my computer click right 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.289
 mouse button and select the control point 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:29.010
 on the left we choose disk management 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:31.769
 Here we choose our physical disk 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.890
 I have already converted it dynamically 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.250
 since this dabbled choose 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.690
 the section that we need to hold 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:44.489
 choose the biggest one we press the right one 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:48.030
 mouse button and you need to squeeze there is 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.340
 it is compressed $ 1 not moved 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.110
 file from the end then it can be 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.989
 paging file if you have on this 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.920
 disk file swap it to 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.410
 another drive 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.379
 or if you have system protection enabled 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.769
 that is, there may be located 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.350
 disable system protection file remove disable 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.100
 system protection on this disk transfer 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.750
 files on felicity swap file on 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.580
 another drive and then click there and so 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.979
 can tom click on four hundred 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.420
 eighty gigabytes we don't need us 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:31.020
 you need let's say 20 is given in megabytes 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:34.740
 20 thousand megabytes and click to compress so 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:40.770
 need to wait a little while 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:42.630
 Now shrink under compression is not that 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.799
 distributed space 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.610
 that which is how much we chose 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.990
 gigabyte that is now necessary 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.799
 create a section with the right mouse button 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.299
 click and choose to create a simple volume 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.990
 manifest master in which we press 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.329
 here we choose our megabytes 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.430
 which we released you can choose 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:09.509
 put others if you need let's say 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:12.250
 from this make two sections and click 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:16.030
 further assign the letter not 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.610
 disco let's say any push further 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.150
 here it is recommended to leave everything by 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:26.920
 By default, only change the valid label 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.770
 drive on z too and click next 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:34.180
 check all parameters created 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:37.470
 section and click done that's what 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:41.650
 you more data on the disk mean 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:47.350
 the longer this operation will take you now 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:53.440
 we go into my computer and here we are 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:58.320
 there is a disk our z on which 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:02.410
 can copy information and bury 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:05.400
 so the data here if you he 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.500
 suddenly not needed we can again 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.130
 right mouse button 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.230
 press delete volume while it is empty again 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.140
 there will be unallocated space and 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.650
 add it to the standing disk 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.410
 right mouse button there is a function 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.120
 expand ie manifest again 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.090
 the master who will help us in this 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.420
 push further also change nothing 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.900
 further ready we all returned everything back 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.940
 like this we can very quickly 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.360
 and without additional without installation 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.790
 additional programs to resize 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.070
 our 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.709
 sections and so it is worth paying 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.200
 attention that on one hard physical 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:53.410
 hard drive then maybe up 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.390
 the four sections it can be either 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:00.700
 four main sections 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:02.829
 either three main one extra in 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.940
 optional extra 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:10.840
 section can be broken even if you need 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:13.720
 on several sections limit 2000 section 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.180
 that is, if you want to create more 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.820
 main partitions then your drive will be 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.310
 transformed dynamically what happened to 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:27.030
 my CD we're nothing but terrible 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.469
 here are such things thank you for your attention with 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.819
 you was Anton Dyachenko
