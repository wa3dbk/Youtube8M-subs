00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
to heal either so we have to do is get

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.090 
to heal either so we have to do is get
the<00:01:15.689> succubus<00:01:15.960> power<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.590> go<00:01:16.860> up<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.009> these

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
the succubus power and go up to these

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.300 
the succubus power and go up to these
lamps<00:01:17.429> use<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.409> you'll<00:01:19.409> actually<00:01:19.590> gain<00:01:19.920> HP

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
lamps use it and you'll actually gain HP

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.050 
lamps use it and you'll actually gain HP
from<00:01:20.549> hitting<00:01:21.119> some<00:01:21.420> lamps<00:01:21.770> imagine<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:23.060> so

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
from hitting some lamps imagine that so

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.270 
from hitting some lamps imagine that so
I<00:01:24.090> guess<00:01:24.450> lamps<00:01:25.140> tastes<00:01:25.470> pretty<00:01:25.590> good<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.890> soma

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
I guess lamps tastes pretty good to soma

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.249 
I guess lamps tastes pretty good to soma
I<00:01:26.640> don't<00:01:26.819> know<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.390> don't<00:01:27.720> know<00:01:27.840> what's<00:01:28.020> going

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
I don't know I don't know what's going

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.889 
I don't know I don't know what's going
on<00:01:28.350> but<00:01:29.069> the<00:01:29.310> lamps<00:01:29.850> also<00:01:30.210> when<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.450> use<00:01:30.659> the

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
on but the lamps also when you use the

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:33.169 
on but the lamps also when you use the
succubus<00:01:31.229> power<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:31.740> them<00:01:31.890> they'll<00:01:32.610> also<00:01:32.819> drop

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
succubus power on them they'll also drop

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:34.969 
succubus power on them they'll also drop
hearts<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:33.960> you'll<00:01:34.140> never<00:01:34.259> really<00:01:34.560> run<00:01:34.799> out<00:01:34.950> of

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
hearts so you'll never really run out of

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.709 
hearts so you'll never really run out of
magic<00:01:35.670> points<00:01:36.030> while<00:01:36.299> you're<00:01:36.450> doing<00:01:36.569> that

00:01:38.449 --> 00:01:38.459 
either so it's an infinite grinding

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:39.949 
either so it's an infinite grinding

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
was using google back before where you'd

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.720 
was using google back before where you'd
light<00:03:46.379> a<00:03:46.409> fire<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:46.739> you<00:03:47.040> kind<00:03:47.159> of<00:03:47.430> predict

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
light a fire and you kind of predict

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.209 
light a fire and you kind of predict
where<00:03:47.879> he<00:03:47.939> was<00:03:48.060> going<00:03:48.180> to<00:03:48.239> be<00:03:48.980> so<00:03:49.980> that<00:03:50.129> you

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:50.219 
where he was going to be so that you

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:51.380

just<00:03:50.370> light<00:03:50.549> a<00:03:50.579> fire<00:03:50.849> and<00:03:50.879> then<00:03:51.150> you<00:03:51.239> could

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
just light a fire and then you could

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.660 
just light a fire and then you could
like<00:03:51.989> he<00:03:52.290> would<00:03:52.409> run<00:03:52.560> into<00:03:52.829> it<00:03:52.859> but<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.430> ill<00:03:53.549> go

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670
