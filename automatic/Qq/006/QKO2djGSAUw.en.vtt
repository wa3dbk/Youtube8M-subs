00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.340
 and now the exclusive advances of the 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.059
 new animated movie of dreamworks the 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.059
 Penguins of Madagascar 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.189
 Antarctica is inhospitable to my son-in-law 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.960
 but even here in the butt 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.630
 frozen from the ground 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.180
 we found life and not just any 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.660
 lifetime 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:31.540
 life jiggling penguins cheerful 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.300
 Playful pretty and chubby 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.760
 look at them falling on their cushions 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.900
 Booty who could take these 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.640
 playful snow clowns seriously 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:47.160
 someone has an idea where we are 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:49.260
 marching me is not good either we will fly 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.780
 in front of the row to see us 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.830
 same as skiing rich and mission 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.830
 aerial surveillance 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:02.740
 but that's felipe it seems we do not fly 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.740
 then this is for what 

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:10.890
 yes 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:15.170
 I like it and this could be our thing 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.390
 as we call it the yucal 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.369
 from someone else saw that is a game every 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.920
 year we lose a couple of games like that is the 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.330
 nature is said one thing I reject the 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:40.770
 nature who is with me 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:43.369
 [Music] 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.369
 how 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.310
 the old ship no one has ever left 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.310
 I live from there 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.930
 quiet kowalski there is a bird there 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.300
 Look down it 's fine 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.140
 seals of birth the scorpions of the 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.230
 nature 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.960
 there were already the scorpions that if I live 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.460
 in the tundra penguin they have the egg 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.410
 help me down 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.180
 now the only thing we would have to do 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.180
 is to gather 100 meters of dried seaweed 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.209
 small and helpless the baby penguins 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:23.130
 they are paralyzed with fear they know that if 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:25.500
 they fall to the safe precipice they will die 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.090
 hunter such is a push guiding the 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.900
 jellyfish that we train to obey 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.900
 simple commands 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:38.689

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.099
 9 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:08.280

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.280
 what happens if they look very to the left 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.210

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.300
