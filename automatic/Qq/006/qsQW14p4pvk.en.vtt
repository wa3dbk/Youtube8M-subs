00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
there and get up here so they had that

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.200 
there and get up here so they had that
only<00:00:46.829> have<00:00:46.980> three<00:00:47.280> small<00:00:47.520> cages<00:00:47.850> all<00:00:48.059> together

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
only have three small cages all together

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.389 
only have three small cages all together
and<00:00:48.930> that's<00:00:49.079> one<00:00:49.230> big<00:00:49.410> cage<00:00:49.590> right<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.070> don't

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
and that's one big cage right I don't

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.330 
and that's one big cage right I don't
know<00:00:50.489> just<00:00:50.730> why<00:00:51.719> don't<00:00:51.780> know<00:00:51.960> just<00:00:52.170> don't<00:00:52.440> try

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
know just why don't know just don't try

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.790 
know just why don't know just don't try
to<00:00:53.399> prove<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.820> I'll<00:00:54.750> put<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.320> vessel<00:00:55.710> be

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
to prove it I'll put the vessel be

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.650 
to prove it I'll put the vessel be
rotated<00:00:56.190> here<00:00:58.910> so<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.030> will<00:01:00.210> be<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.359> new

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
rotated here so this will be a new

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.380 
rotated here so this will be a new
female<00:01:01.109> cage<00:01:04.760> those<00:01:05.760> only<00:01:05.909> ones<00:01:06.090> not<00:01:06.150> gonna<00:01:06.330> be

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
female cage those only ones not gonna be

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.910 
female cage those only ones not gonna be
here<00:01:06.450> much<00:01:06.510> longer<00:01:06.689> it's<00:01:07.260> kind<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.530> getting

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
here much longer it's kind of getting

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.010 
here much longer it's kind of getting
like<00:01:08.070> but<00:01:10.640> or<00:01:11.640> unless<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.030> also<00:01:12.240> jump<00:01:12.510> off<00:01:12.659> or

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
like but or unless you also jump off or

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.870 
like but or unless you also jump off or
climb<00:01:13.560> down<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:14.040> like<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.220> ladder<00:01:14.430> beats<00:01:14.760> you

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
climb down it like a ladder beats you

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.120 
climb down it like a ladder beats you
can<00:01:15.000> climb<00:01:15.150> up<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.479> down<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:15.900> said<00:01:16.080> or<00:01:17.009> as

and<00:01:46.900> you<00:01:47.710> can<00:01:47.830> see<00:01:47.950> that<00:01:47.980> these<00:01:48.220> are<00:01:48.520> got<00:01:49.360> to

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
and you can see that these are got to

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.650 
and you can see that these are got to
art<00:01:49.780> sets<00:01:50.110> and<00:01:50.650> the<00:01:51.550> box<00:01:51.820> will<00:01:52.060> dominant<00:01:52.510> role

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
art sets and the box will dominant role

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.760 
art sets and the box will dominant role
heavy<00:01:52.930> dominoes<00:01:53.380> in<00:01:54.930> here<00:01:55.930> that's<00:01:56.560> going<00:01:56.680> to

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
heavy dominoes in here that's going to

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.950 
heavy dominoes in here that's going to
hold<00:01:56.860> this<00:01:56.980> up<00:01:57.340> so<00:01:57.610> this<00:01:57.790> is<00:01:58.000> this<00:01:58.810> is

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
hold this up so this is this is

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.610 
hold this up so this is this is
proportional<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:01.090> there's<00:02:02.080> your<00:02:02.200> water<00:02:02.350> bowl

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
proportional and there's your water bowl

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.950 
proportional and there's your water bowl
still<00:02:02.950> it<00:02:03.460> has<00:02:03.640> a<00:02:03.670> mood<00:02:06.000> this<00:02:07.000> little<00:02:07.810> this<00:02:07.840> is

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
still it has a mood this little this is

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.749 
still it has a mood this little this is
a<00:02:08.110> little<00:02:08.380> achy<00:02:08.560> and<00:02:08.800> it's<00:02:09.220> a<00:02:09.280> clean<00:02:09.490> it<00:02:09.610> so<00:02:09.729> I
