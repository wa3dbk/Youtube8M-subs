00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
to put that on the video last night and

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.710 
to put that on the video last night and
we<00:02:35.430> got<00:02:35.550> that<00:02:35.760> pretty<00:02:35.910> much<00:02:36.090> done<00:02:36.330> in<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.510> back

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
we think this is a little too much of a

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.660 
we think this is a little too much of a
high<00:02:39.030> gloss<00:02:39.300> on<00:02:39.870> here<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:40.800> we're<00:02:41.100> most<00:02:41.460> likely

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
high gloss on here so we're most likely

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.590 
high gloss on here so we're most likely
going<00:02:42.240> to<00:02:42.330> pay
