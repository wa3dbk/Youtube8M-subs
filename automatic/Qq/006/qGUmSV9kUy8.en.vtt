thing I really liked about this hits it

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.590 
thing I really liked about this hits it
when<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:16.920> saw<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:17.220> first<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.789> all<00:00:17.940> was<00:00:18.150> that<00:00:18.180> you

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
when I saw it first of all was that you

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.120 
when I saw it first of all was that you
can<00:00:18.750> actually<00:00:18.900> peer<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.680> two<00:00:19.830> devices

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
can actually peer it to two devices

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.060 
can actually peer it to two devices
simultaneously<00:00:20.990> so<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.380> can<00:00:22.680> listen<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.980> my

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
simultaneously so I can listen to my

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.759 
simultaneously so I can listen to my
ipod<00:00:23.220> touch<00:00:23.720> via<00:00:24.720> bluetooth<00:00:25.199> headset<00:00:25.619> and

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
ipod touch via bluetooth headset and

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.419 
ipod touch via bluetooth headset and
also<00:00:26.580> peer<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.820> up<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.029> my<00:00:27.150> motorola<00:00:27.510> q<00:00:27.720> 9h<00:00:28.279> if<00:00:29.279> I

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
also peer it up to my motorola q 9h if I

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.650 
also peer it up to my motorola q 9h if I
get<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.580> phone<00:00:29.760> call<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.210> would<00:00:30.359> just<00:00:30.480> pull

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
get a phone call and it would just pull

easy like most you need to get into

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.670 
easy like most you need to get into
pairing<00:00:45.809> mode<00:00:46.550> to<00:00:47.550> turn<00:00:47.730> on<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.780> j<00:00:48.989> boot<00:00:49.170> 200

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
pairing mode to turn on the j boot 200

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.209 
pairing mode to turn on the j boot 200
you<00:00:50.340> use<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:51.480> power<00:00:51.660> button<00:00:51.840> here<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.289> you

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
you use the power button here and you

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
all into pairing mode and as you can see

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.350 
all into pairing mode and as you can see
you've<00:01:16.140> got<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.409> red<00:01:16.590> lights<00:01:17.270> pairing<00:01:18.270> mode

you've got the red lights pairing mode

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.240 
you've got the red lights pairing mode
for<00:01:18.659> both<00:01:19.110> devices<00:01:19.680> are<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.979> little<00:01:20.100> bit

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
for both devices are a little bit

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.800 
for both devices are a little bit
different<00:01:20.900> with<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.430> motorola<00:01:23.810> basically

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
different with the motorola basically

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.030 
different with the motorola basically
what<00:01:24.930> I've<00:01:25.020> just<00:01:25.049> done<00:01:25.320> there<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.770> how<00:01:25.979> you

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
what I've just done there is how you

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.830 
what I've just done there is how you
appear<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.729> then<00:01:27.000> having<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.360> go<00:01:27.600> into

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
appear it and then having to go into

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.990 
appear it and then having to go into
your<00:01:28.110> settings<00:01:29.150> in<00:01:30.150> pyridine<00:01:30.930> your<00:01:31.140> bluetooth

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
your settings in pyridine your bluetooth

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.640 
your settings in pyridine your bluetooth
access<00:01:33.000> code<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.479> pretty<00:01:33.930> standard<00:01:34.170> at<00:01:34.470> four

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
access code is pretty standard at four

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.920 
access code is pretty standard at four
zeros<00:01:35.990> but<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.110> motorola<00:01:37.439> q9<00:01:37.829> has<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.189> stereo

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
zeros but the motorola q9 has a stereo

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.929 
zeros but the motorola q9 has a stereo
hits<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.110> part<00:01:41.070> as<00:01:41.189> well<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.700> can<00:01:41.790> actually

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
hits it part as well so you can actually

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.700 
hits it part as well so you can actually
sit<00:01:42.240> up<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.630> get<00:01:42.720> stereo<00:01:43.079> headset<00:01:43.439> can<00:01:43.619> we

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
sit up so you get stereo headset can we

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.300 
sit up so you get stereo headset can we
throw<00:01:43.860> on<00:01:43.920> your<00:01:43.979> phone<00:01:44.220> calls<00:01:46.220> basically<00:01:47.220> i

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
found this is very light considering

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.200

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
two units the cable i found doesn't get

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.670 
two units the cable i found doesn't get
in<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:54.960> way<00:01:55.079> at<00:01:55.470> all<00:01:55.649> when<00:01:55.860> i<00:01:55.890> was<00:01:56.070> using<00:01:56.250> it

basically<00:02:03.439> what<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.530> have<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.829> do<00:02:04.979> the

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
basically what you have to do the

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.800 
basically what you have to do the
starting<00:02:05.759> off<00:02:05.850> point<00:02:06.090> is<00:02:06.299> making<00:02:06.600> sure<00:02:06.780> that

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
starting off point is making sure that

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.300 
starting off point is making sure that
the<00:02:07.049> actual<00:02:07.940> hitting<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.030> off<00:02:10.039> all<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.160> got<00:02:11.280> to

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
the actual hitting it off all you got to

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.180 
the actual hitting it off all you got to
do<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:11.790> just<00:02:12.330> hold<00:02:12.599> it<00:02:12.720> down
