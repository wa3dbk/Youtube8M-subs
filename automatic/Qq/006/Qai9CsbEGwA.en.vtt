00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:09.730
 or the queen's because I already had time that 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.930
 I had not uploaded video 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:16.590
 so I wanted to tell you that 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.570
 I miss them now that I have not 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.720
 had time to go up and so blah blah 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.779
 blah good I wanted to tell you some tips 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.640
 of how you do not mistreat your hair 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.570
 when I painted it for you so it had was not 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.570
 nothing bad treated 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.320
 because more than anything was that because I 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:42.420
 have asked a lot about how he does that 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:46.539
 as well as how you and I is that you can 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.190
 for each hair lathe, I'll tell you 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:50.589
 you have to decolor good less for 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.260
 the dark ones true but for colors like that 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:56.859
 you have to discolor them a lot then 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.020
 what I do is first what color 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:01.780
 once 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:06.260
 and then I know it covered and I put a 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.060
 hydration treatment after 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.340
 I do the same thing or I go back to 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.460
 bleach and again I can put on the 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.200
 hydration treatment so you do not 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.030
 be mistreated then 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.170
 in hydration treatments 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:26.500
 it always comes to you that ten minutes 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:30.850
 ten minutes or use it for five minutes 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:33.909
 or so I always use me good 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:38.079
 color more or less already at night appointment and 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:40.630
 I bathe my hair dry well in the 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:43.539
 I put the hydration treatment but 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.259
 I sleep with him, that is, since he has not 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:49.390
 the boat or I fall asleep with the 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.570
 treatment put on the hair to 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.280
 that is not mistreated 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.530
 and so and then 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.030
 in the morning I go back to rinse the 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:04.490
 hair so that I can fall 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:07.720
 treatment also because I do that I do 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.000
 that every day that is 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.720
 every day that in the morning in the 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.720
 night or so 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.570
 like three days until good 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.770
 the time it takes to get to the 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:25.110
 color that you need to be able to 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.620
 put the color you want or that is 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.319
 example usually 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.890
 to get a color like these 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.730
 you have to get almost to the target 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.860
 so if it's something 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.110
 difficult good more than anything is stressful 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.590
 because you usually want a color and 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.970
 you want it already already already already then if 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.740
 is something so stressful of what 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.570
 bring a hat so good me when 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.240
 when I color my hair and then 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.830
 obviously it's pure colorado 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.319
 reflected it looks like that nothing with 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.049
 then of that then 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.810
 I wear a hat 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.550
 hat all day 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.470
 and I bring my hair combed to 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:15.100
 back well 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:17.890
 or you can wear wigs is another so 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.470
 They can wear wigs while they bring a 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.380
 bleached hair down I use a 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.050
 little hat so that all watered down aguadito 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.030
 and it covers everything to me then nobody gives 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.770
 mind that I bring it red but 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.170
 I also do not see any hair 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.890
 pérez colino with cancer but it's fine 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.890
 While 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:41.670
 he always worth waiting for t 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.569
 then also something else that they can 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.579
 do from what 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.670
 when they are good if you 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:53.299
 they discolor hair you alone do not 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.700
 go to comb it, so try to 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.749
 when they are bleaching hair 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.180
 always accommodate it for the side that is 

00:03:56.749 --> 00:04:02.750
 I combed it for example I combed it for 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.639
 here is that I wear the color art 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.799
 for this side this I do for 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:10.669
 down we can not dye it down 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:12.170
 so that the hair does not feel that 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:14.800
 what 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:18.859
 good so you do not mistreat yourself as much as 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:22.070
 do not mistreat yourself as you should treat or 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:25.340
 be it because if they stick it to your so 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.500
 can destroy or if you comb it xosé to 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.050
 put coloring for one side or for the 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.180
 another and so when it's colored 'no and 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.830
 if the hair is bent or so 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.400
 it can also be processed 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.400
 Let's see 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.720
 also then 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.139
 if they are going to use a color and then what 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:50.770
 they want to change from one to another, do not use 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:54.790
 of color before 40 if they can use 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:56.620
 of 20 is better because if not also 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:01.300
 they are going to trace their hair using a 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.930
 color before 20 or so to be 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.740
 may last 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.940
 Y 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.790
 what else can I tell you 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:14.440
 do not comb 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:18.140
 well do not despair is the main thing 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.910
 the main reason why one is 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.850
 mistreat the hair do not despair 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:26.780
 nothing a thousand times prefer to have a 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:28.880
 nice and healthy hair to bring 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.370
 a good father color but all 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.040
 mistreated is better to bring a hair 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:37.129
 nice care to bring a color 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.320
 extravagant and cali ugly hair 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:42.680
 and then 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.570
 that's all, do not despair if 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.580
 They look bad the bleached hair 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.460
 endure the being until they have the 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:52.010
 color you want because it's always worth the 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:55.190
 sorry in the end bring the nice color and 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:58.310
 careful and there is nothing better as a 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:01.010
 nice color and that moves so that 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.180
 spend the air and move the hair is 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:08.190

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:12.030

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:25.560
 it's all changed my hair color 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:28.860
 red to this color I did not tutorial for 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.720
 the same thing because it took me like a week 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.910
 more or less that I was discolored in the 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.890
 night and I would also throw myself back and for 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.420
 that I did not tutorial because I was not going to 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:39.480
 be recording everything every night 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:43.230
 every night but well I do 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:46.710
 since as I just explained them like that 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:49.310
 I make my colors and this color I did 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:52.860
 they always ask me how I do the blue color 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:56.340
 the aqua blue color this color I did 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.750
 with green with blue and with white what 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:01.680
 they can do also instead of white 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:06.180
 with silver they stir it and make a color 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:09.030
 let it be like dark water color that 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.249
 color is the one that is going to keep them 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:14.879
 well that clear water 

00:07:11.249 --> 00:07:18.359
 the mixture has to see dark water and 

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:21.239
 right now I do not bring the color so strong 

00:07:18.359 --> 00:07:25.499

00:07:21.239 --> 00:07:27.989

00:07:25.499 --> 00:07:31.049
 I'll just replace them and 

00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:32.789
 I can do a tutorial on how to 

00:07:31.049 --> 00:07:35.099
 replace the hair that is already 

00:07:32.789 --> 00:07:38.159
 very easy only applies and there 

00:07:35.099 --> 00:07:42.059

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:43.380
