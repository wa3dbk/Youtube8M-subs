00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
take to make that transition be a good

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.710 
take to make that transition be a good
one<00:03:44.490> is<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:45.030> time<00:03:45.240> that<00:03:45.270> we're<00:03:45.540> going<00:03:45.600> to

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
one is the time that we're going to

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.320 
one is the time that we're going to
spend<00:03:45.960> on<00:03:46.140> it<00:03:46.290> so<00:03:46.500> even<00:03:47.400> though<00:03:47.520> it's<00:03:47.700> free<00:03:48.120> to

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
spend on it so even though it's free to

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.730 
spend on it so even though it's free to
the<00:03:48.420> family<00:03:48.840> it's<00:03:49.050> really<00:03:49.170> kind<00:03:49.650> of

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
the family it's really kind of

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.950 
the family it's really kind of
invaluable<00:03:50.100> because<00:03:50.550> there's<00:03:50.910> no<00:03:51.240> time

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:51.960 
invaluable because there's no time

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.380 
invaluable because there's no time
constraint<00:03:52.530> there's<00:03:53.070> no<00:03:53.280> limit<00:03:53.760> to<00:03:53.790> what<00:03:54.330> we

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
constraint there's no limit to what we

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.200 
constraint there's no limit to what we
can<00:03:54.660> do<00:03:54.870> as<00:03:55.560> long<00:03:55.890> as<00:03:56.160> we<00:03:56.400> carry<00:03:56.880> through<00:03:57.120> to

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 
can do as long as we carry through to

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.410 
can do as long as we carry through to
find<00:03:57.630> the<00:03:57.810> good<00:03:58.530> end<00:03:58.860> result<00:03:59.550> and<00:03:59.760> this<00:04:00.240> is<00:04:00.390> a

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
find the good end result and this is a

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.420 
find the good end result and this is a
really<00:04:00.660> important<00:04:01.170> thing<00:04:01.230> for<00:04:01.380> me<00:04:01.680> is<00:04:02.040> to<00:04:02.280> make

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
really important thing for me is to make

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.550 
really important thing for me is to make
sure<00:04:02.460> that<00:04:02.640> the<00:04:03.060> seniors<00:04:03.660> independence<00:04:04.320> and

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
sure that the seniors independence and

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.820 
sure that the seniors independence and
their<00:04:05.070> dignity<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:05.730> their<00:04:05.820> privacy<00:04:06.540> is<00:04:06.870> kept

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
their dignity and their privacy is kept

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.150 
their dignity and their privacy is kept
so<00:04:08.640> that<00:04:09.480> is<00:04:09.750> really<00:04:10.080> another<00:04:10.500> important

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
so that is really another important

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.560 
so that is really another important
factor<00:04:11.520> to<00:04:11.550> make<00:04:11.790> sure<00:04:11.970> that<00:04:12.120> all<00:04:12.300> of<00:04:12.450> those

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
factor to make sure that all of those

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.530 
factor to make sure that all of those
things<00:04:12.840> can<00:04:13.140> be<00:04:13.170> taken<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:13.980> new<00:04:14.100> place

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
things can be taken to the new place

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.170 
things can be taken to the new place
if<00:04:15.780> you<00:04:16.170> preserve<00:04:16.710> that<00:04:16.980> part<00:04:17.489> of<00:04:17.640> their<00:04:17.850> lives

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
if you preserve that part of their lives

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.450 
if you preserve that part of their lives
then<00:04:18.570> it's<00:04:18.930> an<00:04:19.170> easier<00:04:19.530> transition<00:04:19.799> for<00:04:20.370> them

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:20.460 
then it's an easier transition for them

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.070 
then it's an easier transition for them
you<00:04:21.000> know<00:04:21.120> it<00:04:21.210> makes<00:04:21.359> them<00:04:21.510> a<00:04:21.600> lot<00:04:21.720> happier

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
you know it makes them a lot happier

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.740 
you know it makes them a lot happier
because<00:04:22.500> they<00:04:23.010> don't<00:04:23.220> feel<00:04:23.400> so<00:04:23.670> invaded<00:04:24.330> by

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
because they don't feel so invaded by

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.600 
because they don't feel so invaded by
people<00:04:25.140> coming<00:04:25.530> in<00:04:25.680> or<00:04:25.800> people<00:04:26.130> being<00:04:26.250> around

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
people coming in or people being around

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.790 
people coming in or people being around
them<00:04:26.940> more<00:04:27.180> it<00:04:27.630> makes<00:04:27.870> them<00:04:28.050> feel<00:04:28.260> good<00:04:28.290> you

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
them more it makes them feel good you

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.950 
them more it makes them feel good you
know<00:04:28.830> they<00:04:29.130> feel<00:04:29.370> safe<00:04:29.640> because<00:04:30.030> really<00:04:30.660> you

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
know they feel safe because really you

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.920 
know they feel safe because really you
are<00:04:31.290> you're<00:04:32.280> helping<00:04:32.910> them<00:04:33.120> live<00:04:33.510> a<00:04:33.720> better

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
are you're helping them live a better

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.220 
are you're helping them live a better
life<00:04:34.320> they<00:04:34.950> just<00:04:34.980> don't<00:04:35.490> know<00:04:35.670> it<00:04:35.820> yet<00:04:35.850> and<00:04:36.270> the

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
life they just don't know it yet and the

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.930 
life they just don't know it yet and the
whole<00:04:37.410> idea<00:04:37.800> is<00:04:37.890> that<00:04:37.980> we<00:04:38.250> can<00:04:38.430> preserve<00:04:38.880> the

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
whole idea is that we can preserve the

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.830 
whole idea is that we can preserve the
family<00:04:39.360> dynamic<00:04:40.050> so<00:04:40.230> that

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
family dynamic so that

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.510 
family dynamic so that
you<00:04:41.199> know<00:04:41.350> the<00:04:41.620> little<00:04:41.889> problem<00:04:42.220> that<00:04:42.250> there

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
you know the little problem that there

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.939 
you know the little problem that there
was<00:04:42.699> can<00:04:43.180> be<00:04:43.330> over<00:04:43.810> and<00:04:43.990> we're<00:04:44.440> bringing<00:04:44.800> a<00:04:44.919> new

was can be over and we're bringing a new

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:48.420 
was can be over and we're bringing a new
life<00:04:45.630> situation<00:04:46.630> and<00:04:46.919> making<00:04:47.919> it<00:04:48.010> better

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
life situation and making it better

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.340 
life situation and making it better
you<00:04:49.300> really<00:04:49.540> only<00:04:49.570> have<00:04:49.780> to<00:04:49.990> go<00:04:50.110> through

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
you really only have to go through

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.080 
you really only have to go through
something<00:04:50.590> like<00:04:50.740> this<00:04:51.040> once<00:04:51.610> or<00:04:51.820> twice<00:04:52.030> in
