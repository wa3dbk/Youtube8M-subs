now<00:00:07.950> this<00:00:08.069> is<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.219> 250<00:00:08.820> watt<00:00:08.940> motor<00:00:09.120> but<00:00:09.360> it's

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
now this is a 250 watt motor but it's

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.409 
now this is a 250 watt motor but it's
redesigned<00:00:09.929> for<00:00:10.169> more<00:00:10.320> torque<00:00:10.969> of<00:00:11.969> course<00:00:12.209> if

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:12.419 
redesigned for more torque of course if

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:13.850 
redesigned for more torque of course if
you're<00:00:12.599> any<00:00:12.749> familiar<00:00:13.200> with<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.410> bionics

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
you're any familiar with the bionics

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.650 
you're any familiar with the bionics
they're<00:00:14.039> all<00:00:14.160> torque<00:00:14.459> assist<00:00:14.789> they've<00:00:15.450> got

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
they're all torque assist they've got

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.600 
they're all torque assist they've got
the<00:00:15.780> safe<00:00:16.080> programming<00:00:16.860> this<00:00:16.950> bike<00:00:17.190> will<00:00:17.370> not

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.610 
the safe programming this bike will not

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.810 
the safe programming this bike will not
go<00:00:18.170> until<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.440> want<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.950> it<00:00:20.070> have<00:00:20.370> senses

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
go until you want it to it have senses

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.520 
go until you want it to it have senses
it's<00:00:21.000> going<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.450> or<00:00:21.570> 3<00:00:21.720> miles<00:00:21.870> an<00:00:22.080> hour

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:22.530 
it's going to or 3 miles an hour

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.100 
it's going to or 3 miles an hour
so<00:00:23.040> many<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.310> these<00:00:23.370> Turkishness<00:00:23.790> bikes<00:00:24.150> they

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
so many of these Turkishness bikes they

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.650 
so many of these Turkishness bikes they
are<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:25.530> dangerous<00:00:25.770> believe<00:00:26.580> me<00:00:26.790> you<00:00:27.330> get<00:00:27.510> on

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
are so dangerous believe me you get on

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.480 
are so dangerous believe me you get on
them<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.050> motor<00:00:28.230> will<00:00:28.350> crank<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.310> just

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
them and the motor will crank you just

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.590 
them and the motor will crank you just
put<00:00:29.640> your<00:00:29.700> foot<00:00:29.820> on<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.000> pedal<00:00:30.180> and<00:00:30.480> you're

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:30.600 
put your foot on the pedal and you're

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.179 
put your foot on the pedal and you're
practically<00:00:30.960> doing<00:00:31.200> a<00:00:31.260> wheelie<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.770> danger

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
practically doing a wheelie and danger

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.950 
practically doing a wheelie and danger
zone<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:32.640> bionics<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:34.609> the<00:00:35.609> ethos<00:00:36.600> are<00:00:36.839> the

only<00:00:37.170> bikes<00:00:37.499> with<00:00:37.829> torque<00:00:38.039> assist<00:00:38.309> I've

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
only bikes with torque assist I've

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.329 
only bikes with torque assist I've
really<00:00:38.760> written<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.420> are<00:00:39.539> safe<00:00:39.780> okay<00:00:40.339> let's

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:41.339 
really written that are safe okay let's

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:44.149 
really written that are safe okay let's
go<00:00:41.519> cargo<00:00:41.940> riding<00:00:42.269> like<00:00:43.260> every<00:00:43.530> biotics<00:00:43.980> it's

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:44.159 
go cargo riding like every biotics it's

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:46.250 
go cargo riding like every biotics it's
got<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> really<00:00:44.519> nice<00:00:44.699> display<00:00:44.940> unit<00:00:45.480> torque

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
got a really nice display unit torque

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.049 
got a really nice display unit torque
assist<00:00:46.589> and<00:00:46.859> a<00:00:46.920> throttle<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.879> we're<00:00:47.999> in

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
assist and a throttle so we're in

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.169 
assist and a throttle so we're in
maximum<00:00:48.449> assist<00:00:48.809> right<00:00:48.989> now<00:00:49.460> got<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> belt<00:00:50.760> get

00:00:51.169 --> 00:00:51.179 
maximum assist right now got a belt get

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:53.299 
maximum assist right now got a belt get
a<00:00:51.210> little<00:00:51.420> shifting<00:00:51.780> let's<00:00:52.559> go<00:00:52.769> I<00:00:52.800> can<00:00:53.039> say<00:00:53.190> if

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
a little shifting let's go I can say if

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.680 
a little shifting let's go I can say if
I'm<00:00:53.460> sitting<00:00:53.760> here<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:53.969> can<00:00:54.149> push<00:00:54.269> the<00:00:54.390> throttle

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
I'm sitting here I can push the throttle

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.479 
I'm sitting here I can push the throttle
button<00:00:54.839> nothing<00:00:55.079> put<00:00:56.010> up<00:00:56.100> my<00:00:56.190> foot<00:00:56.339> on<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
button nothing put up my foot on the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.549 
button nothing put up my foot on the
pedals<00:00:56.819> but<00:00:56.940> once<00:00:57.089> we're<00:00:57.210> ready<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.449> go<00:00:57.600> we're

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
pedals but once we're ready to go we're

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.809 
pedals but once we're ready to go we're
going<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.129> get<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.249> little<00:00:59.339> speed<00:00:59.609> down<00:00:59.789> the

00:00:59.809 --> 00:00:59.819 
going so you get a little speed down the

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:01.819 
going so you get a little speed down the
throttles<00:01:00.239> working<00:01:00.479> on<00:01:00.569> something<00:01:00.780> but<00:01:00.899> with

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
throttles working on something but with

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.739 
throttles working on something but with
pedaling<00:01:02.339> it<00:01:02.699> senses<00:01:03.179> how<00:01:03.359> hard<00:01:03.600> you're

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:03.749 
pedaling it senses how hard you're

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:07.100 
pedaling it senses how hard you're
pedaling<00:01:04.140> adds<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.769> power<00:01:04.949> automatically<00:01:06.110> so

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
pedaling adds the power automatically so

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.770 
pedaling adds the power automatically so
this<00:01:07.259> is<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.500> cargo<00:01:07.740> bike<00:01:08.009> I<00:01:08.390> got<00:01:09.390> moving<00:01:09.630> back

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
this is the cargo bike I got moving back

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.539 
this is the cargo bike I got moving back
there<00:01:10.049> for<00:01:10.380> all<00:01:10.469> kinds<00:01:10.829> of<00:01:10.890> goodies<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.490> now

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
there for all kinds of goodies and now

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.870 
there for all kinds of goodies and now
the<00:01:11.610> rider<00:01:11.880> or<00:01:12.119> two

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
the rider or two

the rider or two
got<00:01:14.330> the<00:01:14.450> extra<00:01:14.750> power<00:01:14.960> to<00:01:15.140> make<00:01:15.290> it<00:01:15.410> happen<00:01:15.710> if

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
got the extra power to make it happen if

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.590 
got the extra power to make it happen if
I<00:01:15.920> had<00:01:16.040> a<00:01:16.070> couple<00:01:16.340> kids<00:01:16.550> on<00:01:16.760> the<00:01:16.850> back<00:01:17.030> here
