 Find out how you are doing for this 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.140
 competition today on very good evenings 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.000
 Well, we are preparing ourselves very hard 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.370
 giving the best in each training 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.770
 dieting and we're four 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.910
 weeks we are closed and we have three 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.860
 more to throw to eat us 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.420
 how is it that they started being in this 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.090
 sport how is it that catches your attention 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.900
 and you get in there 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:01.130
 Well, I've been in the gym for some time 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:04.010
 I've been five years but competing since 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:08.110
 last year it did not get my attention 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:10.780
 I went to Mr. Mexico and the competitors 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:15.360
 and you are to be admired 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.360
 when I saw them clearly 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.770
 to this discipline and I imagine that 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.240
 you thought about the first days 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.979
 what represents all the 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.979
 sacrifice all discipline all the 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.929
 rigor to leave certain issues for 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.729
 enter fully as 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:34.250
 if you leave many things but I think that 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.490
 When is your passion and is what you want 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:41.200
 it does not cost to work to me nowadays I do not 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:44.959
 It costs work to live with my diet and 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:48.870
 with my training days or leave 

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:53.220
 with my friends and there's no problem 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:56.040
 what brings the food issue with 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.260
 a nutritionist who is the main thing 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.530
 must carry in the food a 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.270
 competitor 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:07.020
 Well obviously I have a preparer 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.690
 called ricardo sÃ¡nchez and basically because 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.710
 the diet is 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:16.640
 of chicken fish beef many 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:19.210
 vegetable complex carbohydrates like 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.210
 the oats 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:27.040
 from water a lot of water 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.040
 of soft drinks sugars 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:35.870
 and I imagine that apart from this 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.870
 activity 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.530
 these 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:50.220
 I am acting now 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:52.230
 and the time to work normally 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.840
 how long must it be in the foundation 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.740
 in the gym I try to do my routine 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:02.800
 in 2 hours and 40 minutes of cardio and my 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:05.830
 weights routine another 40 minutes 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.930
 and now this event in acapulco no 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.220

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.590
 the rest to your fellow 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.860
 selected and because we represent 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.840
 our country 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.620
 we're not going to do it very well, I think 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.620
 there is a good level 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.610
 the models I think we're all 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.260
 Working hard 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.660
