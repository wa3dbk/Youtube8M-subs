my guess would be thunder king would be

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.330 
my guess would be thunder king would be
a<00:02:10.830> pretty<00:02:11.039> good

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
a pretty good

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.490 
a pretty good

out what he would summon because i'm
pretty<00:02:18.540> sure<00:02:18.629> that<00:02:18.660> wouldn't<00:02:18.989> stop<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.260> little

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739

so<00:05:19.340> i<00:05:19.520> guess<00:05:19.880> as<00:05:20.030> soon<00:05:20.150> as<00:05:20.240> he<00:05:20.330> declares<00:05:20.720> his

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
so i guess as soon as he declares his

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.440 
so i guess as soon as he declares his
attack<00:05:21.169> is<00:05:21.550> essentially<00:05:22.550> one<00:05:22.700> if<00:05:23.150> i<00:05:23.270> could

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450

kind<00:05:33.890> of<00:05:33.919> miracle<00:05:34.220> fusion<00:05:34.370> one<00:05:34.820> more<00:05:35.000> time<00:05:35.210> and

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
kind of miracle fusion one more time and

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.890 
kind of miracle fusion one more time and
he's<00:05:36.440> sent<00:05:36.740> a<00:05:36.800> volcanic<00:05:37.100> Shalu<00:05:37.720> pretty<00:05:38.720> good

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
he's sent a volcanic Shalu pretty good

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.060 
he's sent a volcanic Shalu pretty good
stuff<00:05:39.110> I'd<00:05:39.320> say<00:05:39.590> with<00:05:39.979> gem<00:05:40.850> nights<00:05:41.090> so<00:05:42.070> well

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
stuff I'd say with gem nights so well

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.129 
stuff I'd say with gem nights so well
connect<00:05:43.310> shell<00:05:43.520> is<00:05:43.700> his<00:05:44.330> effect<00:05:44.630> is<00:05:44.780> you<00:05:44.990> can

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:45.139 
connect shell is his effect is you can

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:47.440 
connect shell is his effect is you can

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
volcanic shelf from your deck turn 10

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.779 
volcanic shelf from your deck turn 10
once<00:05:49.460> per<00:05:50.120> turn<00:05:50.150> so<00:05:51.080> it<00:05:51.440> allows<00:05:51.740> you<00:05:51.919> to<00:05:52.130> keep<00:05:52.639> a

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 
once per turn so it allows you to keep a

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:55.180 
once per turn so it allows you to keep a
lot<00:05:52.970> of<00:05:53.000> cars<00:05:53.270> in<00:05:53.510> your<00:05:53.900> hand<00:05:54.710> essentially

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
lot of cars in your hand essentially

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.950 
lot of cars in your hand essentially
that's<00:05:55.340> what<00:05:55.580> makes<00:05:55.910> the<00:05:56.150> agenda<00:05:56.539> fusion<00:05:56.810> so

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
that's what makes the agenda fusion so

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.710 
that's what makes the agenda fusion so
good<00:05:57.430> so<00:05:58.430> you<00:05:58.490> can<00:05:58.610> keep<00:05:58.910> those<00:05:59.270> card

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 
good so you can keep those card

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.740 
good so you can keep those card
advantages<00:06:00.169> pretty<00:06:01.070> well<00:06:01.910> with<00:06:02.270> the<00:06:02.419> chem

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:02.750 
advantages pretty well with the chem

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.540 
advantages pretty well with the chem
excels<00:06:03.110> and<00:06:03.380> you<00:06:03.950> just<00:06:04.039> have<00:06:04.190> to<00:06:04.280> really<00:06:04.400> go

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
of hours to be super live and so we see

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.390

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
eight Jim Mike few times so oh so you

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.070 
eight Jim Mike few times so oh so you
some<00:06:16.940> of<00:06:17.030> them<00:06:17.090> want<00:06:17.150> for<00:06:17.389> someone<00:06:17.600> can<00:06:17.990> you

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
some of them want for someone can you

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.740 
some of them want for someone can you
really<00:06:18.229> do<00:06:18.470> that<00:06:18.500> I<00:06:18.770> didn't<00:06:19.070> know<00:06:19.160> that<00:06:19.190> oh<00:06:19.750> wow

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:20.750 
really do that I didn't know that oh wow

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.120 
really do that I didn't know that oh wow
it<00:06:20.990> doesn't<00:06:21.289> it<00:06:21.500> doesn't<00:06:21.530> think<00:06:21.860> I<00:06:21.950> know<00:06:22.010> it

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.130 
it doesn't it doesn't think I know it

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.529 
it doesn't it doesn't think I know it
doesn't<00:06:22.280> negate<00:06:22.520> the<00:06:22.700> effect<00:06:23.000> because<00:06:23.270> that

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:23.539 
doesn't negate the effect because that

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:23.760 
doesn't negate the effect because that
would

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
would

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.710 
would
make<00:06:24.669> it<00:06:24.789> not<00:06:24.940> as<00:06:25.060> good<00:06:25.270> but<00:06:27.360> so<00:06:28.360> he's<00:06:28.539> going<00:06:28.660> to

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 
make it not as good but so he's going to

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.490 
make it not as good but so he's going to
remove<00:06:28.930> another<00:06:29.349> gem<00:06:29.680> night<00:06:29.860> and<00:06:31.199> he<00:06:32.199> can<00:06:32.349> add

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
remove another gem night and he can add

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.140 
remove another gem night and he can add
it<00:06:32.620> back<00:06:32.710> to<00:06:32.860> his<00:06:32.979> hand<00:06:33.250> that<00:06:33.669> was<00:06:33.819> interesting

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.150 
it back to his hand that was interesting

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.330 
it back to his hand that was interesting
so<00:06:34.599> I<00:06:34.810> guess<00:06:35.259> I'll<00:06:35.560> play<00:06:35.770> realized<00:06:36.129> it<00:06:36.250> was

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
so I guess I'll play realized it was

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.580 
so I guess I'll play realized it was
game<00:06:36.659> so<00:06:37.659> I'm<00:06:37.780> trying<00:06:37.900> to<00:06:38.050> think<00:06:38.080> of<00:06:38.289> what<00:06:38.409> he

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.590 
game so I'm trying to think of what he

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.050 
game so I'm trying to think of what he
would<00:06:38.680> be<00:06:38.740> doing<00:06:38.830> I<00:06:39.250> know<00:06:39.370> you<00:06:39.520> can<00:06:39.639> add<00:06:39.819> it

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060 
would be doing I know you can add it

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.059 
would be doing I know you can add it
somewhere<00:06:40.330> as<00:06:40.389> monks<00:06:40.659> effect<00:06:41.020> once<00:06:41.409> again<00:06:41.800> and

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:42.069 
somewhere as monks effect once again and

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:44.730 
somewhere as monks effect once again and
that<00:06:42.099> is<00:06:42.879> interesting<00:06:43.360> because<00:06:43.419> someone<00:06:44.349> went

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:44.740 
that is interesting because someone went

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.760 
that is interesting because someone went
to<00:06:44.949> two<00:06:45.310> and<00:06:45.490> no<00:06:45.729> one<00:06:45.879> really<00:06:46.120> cared<00:06:46.710> but<00:06:47.710> the

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
to two and no one really cared but the

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.260 
to two and no one really cared but the
thing<00:06:48.039> is<00:06:48.099> you<00:06:48.310> can<00:06:48.430> see<00:06:48.460> how<00:06:48.729> weight<00:06:48.909> might<00:06:49.150> be

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270 
thing is you can see how weight might be

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.999 
thing is you can see how weight might be
viable<00:06:49.509> in<00:06:49.720> gem<00:06:49.960> nights<00:06:50.169> because<00:06:50.349> that<00:06:50.889> is<00:06:50.979> a

00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:51.009 
viable in gem nights because that is a

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:52.770 
viable in gem nights because that is a
good<00:06:51.220> tech<00:06:51.490> because<00:06:51.789> you<00:06:51.879> can<00:06:52.030> summon<00:06:52.539> monk

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:52.780 
good tech because you can summon monk

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:53.939 
good tech because you can summon monk
for<00:06:52.930> summoner<00:06:53.139> monk<00:06:53.349> and<00:06:53.470> you<00:06:53.650> just<00:06:53.800> bring

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:53.949 
for summoner monk and you just bring

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:55.860 
for summoner monk and you just bring
back<00:06:54.099> the<00:06:54.190> gem-knight<00:06:54.400> fusion<00:06:54.550> so<00:06:55.509> that<00:06:55.720> was<00:06:55.840> a

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:55.870 
back the gem-knight fusion so that was a

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.110 
back the gem-knight fusion so that was a
pretty<00:06:56.110> cool<00:06:56.380> interesting<00:06:57.220> way<00:06:57.370> to<00:06:57.400> play<00:06:57.789> as

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.120 
pretty cool interesting way to play as

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.730 
pretty cool interesting way to play as
far<00:06:58.300> as<00:06:58.449> playing<00:06:58.659> gem<00:06:58.870> nights<00:06:59.080> because<00:06:59.500> I'm

00:06:59.730 --> 00:06:59.740 
far as playing gem nights because I'm

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:00.870 
far as playing gem nights because I'm
not<00:06:59.889> really<00:06:59.979> too<00:07:00.159> familiar<00:07:00.280> with<00:07:00.520> gem<00:07:00.729> nights

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880 
not really too familiar with gem nights

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.430 
not really too familiar with gem nights
but<00:07:01.090> if<00:07:01.569> you're<00:07:01.810> looking<00:07:01.990> for<00:07:02.020> Gemma<00:07:02.229> nights

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:02.440 
but if you're looking for Gemma nights

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.469 
but if you're looking for Gemma nights
perhaps<00:07:02.889> you<00:07:03.069> can<00:07:03.159> try<00:07:03.370> summoner<00:07:03.759> monk<00:07:04.000> out<00:07:04.210> I

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:04.479 
perhaps you can try summoner monk out I

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:06.420 
perhaps you can try summoner monk out I
mean<00:07:04.990> I<00:07:05.050> know<00:07:05.080> there's<00:07:05.349> no<00:07:05.530> max<00:07:05.770> seeds<00:07:06.069> or

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:06.430 
mean I know there's no max seeds or

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.249 
mean I know there's no max seeds or
sailors<00:07:07.000> that<00:07:07.150> would<00:07:07.270> really<00:07:07.419> hurt<00:07:07.659> sonam<00:07:08.199> up

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:08.259 
sailors that would really hurt sonam up

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:09.990 
sailors that would really hurt sonam up
because<00:07:08.409> you<00:07:08.470> go<00:07:08.560> minus<00:07:08.830> 1<00:07:09.039> and<00:07:09.220> sunder<00:07:09.880> muck

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 
because you go minus 1 and sunder muck

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.360 
because you go minus 1 and sunder muck
it<00:07:10.120> really<00:07:10.300> isn't<00:07:10.569> too<00:07:10.690> strong<00:07:11.080> on<00:07:11.349> the<00:07:12.130> field

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.370 
it really isn't too strong on the field
