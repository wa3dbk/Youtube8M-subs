bath one and ghosts and you can kind of
hear<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.640> oh<00:01:27.500> and<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.979> shades<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
hear that oh and the shades of the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.660 
hear that oh and the shades of the
colors<00:01:30.000> are<00:01:30.360> nice<00:01:30.650> the<00:01:31.650> yellow<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.070> really

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
colors are nice the yellow is really

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.560 
colors are nice the yellow is really
bright<00:01:33.140> because<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.259> doesn't<00:01:34.290> blend<00:01:35.009> in

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
bright because it doesn't blend in

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.390 
bright because it doesn't blend in
because<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.840> cube<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.320> white<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.829> this<00:01:37.979> cube

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
because this cube is white and this cube

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.620 
because this cube is white and this cube
also<00:01:38.909> only<00:01:39.450> comes<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.049> white<00:01:40.259> um<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.630> this

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
also only comes and white um and this

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.090 
also only comes and white um and this
cube<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.229> not<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.860> screw<00:01:44.280> school<00:01:44.670> instruction

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
cube is not a screw school instruction

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.410 
cube is not a screw school instruction
so<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.130> can't<00:01:47.640> cut<00:01:47.880> corners<00:01:47.909> very<00:01:48.630> well<00:01:48.930> but

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
so I can't cut corners very well but

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.770 
so I can't cut corners very well but
after<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.450> while<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:52.530> cuts<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:53.009> little<00:01:53.369> bit<00:01:53.780> not

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
after a while it cuts a little bit not

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.179 
after a while it cuts a little bit not
like<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.860> dying<00:01:56.369> coupon<00:01:56.899> which<00:01:57.899> can<00:01:58.229> cut<00:01:58.560> all

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
like the dying coupon which can cut all

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.720 
like the dying coupon which can cut all
the<00:01:59.490> way<00:01:59.610> out<00:01:59.640> here

or the ling young or any of those cubes

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.630 
or the ling young or any of those cubes
because<00:02:09.570> it<00:02:10.260> is<00:02:10.470> not<00:02:10.740> a<00:02:10.770> screw<00:02:11.250> spring

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
because it is not a screw spring

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.530 
because it is not a screw spring
structure<00:02:12.300> now<00:02:13.290> as<00:02:13.500> for<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.890> pieces<00:02:15.320> tusk<00:02:16.320> you

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
structure now as for the pieces tusk you

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:24.350 
structure now as for the pieces tusk you
it's<00:02:18.540> kind<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:18.840> hard<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.080> get<00:02:19.230> out<00:02:22.940> okay<00:02:23.940> so<00:02:24.000> ask

it's kind of hard to get out okay so ask
for<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.750> edge<00:02:24.930> um<00:02:26.030> it's<00:02:27.030> it's<00:02:27.360> cut<00:02:27.990> right

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
for the edge um it's it's cut right

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.820 
for the edge um it's it's cut right
there<00:02:28.320> like<00:02:29.180> you<00:02:30.180> cannot<00:02:30.480> see<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:32.330> and

see it's not a screw spring structure I

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.520 
see it's not a screw spring structure I
have<00:03:35.400> no<00:03:35.580> clue<00:03:35.820> what<00:03:36.120> that<00:03:36.150> is<00:03:36.570> it's<00:03:37.050> just<00:03:37.290> part

of the for the core kinda reminds me of
transformers<00:03:44.330> that's<00:03:45.330> all<00:03:45.510> green<00:03:45.920> is

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
transformers that's all green is

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.750 
transformers that's all green is
definitely<00:03:48.000> not<00:03:48.209> a<00:03:48.570> normal<00:03:48.750> core<00:03:52.010> so<00:03:53.010> I<00:03:53.459> don't

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
definitely not a normal core so I don't

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.150 
definitely not a normal core so I don't
know<00:03:53.850> I<00:03:54.890> haven't<00:03:55.890> tried<00:03:56.190> lube<00:03:56.520> a<00:03:56.670> little<00:03:57.300> bit

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
know I haven't tried lube a little bit

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.770 
know I haven't tried lube a little bit
it<00:03:59.160> could<00:03:59.400> be<00:03:59.580> better<00:03:59.760> but<00:03:59.910> I<00:04:00.709> lived<00:04:01.709> it<00:04:01.950> with

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
it could be better but I lived it with

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:11.140 
it could be better but I lived it with
crc<00:04:03.780> and<00:04:04.620> Maru<00:04:05.459> lube<00:04:05.910> and<00:04:06.860> it<00:04:07.860> came<00:04:08.160> out

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:21.219 

turning<00:04:12.730> it<00:04:13.730> turns<00:04:14.230> really<00:04:19.840> it's<00:04:20.840> actually

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
turning it turns really it's actually

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:28.960 
turning it turns really it's actually
kind<00:04:21.500> of<00:04:21.530> loud<00:04:22.750> so<00:04:27.280> just<00:04:28.280> it<00:04:28.460> doesn't<00:04:28.639> cut

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
kind of loud so just it doesn't cut

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.469 
kind of loud so just it doesn't cut
corners<00:04:29.000> at<00:04:29.750> all<00:04:29.930> so<00:04:31.030> you<00:04:32.030> know<00:04:32.150> you<00:04:32.240> can't

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
corners at all so you know you can't

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.719 
corners at all so you know you can't
expect<00:04:32.930> it<00:04:33.139> to<00:04:33.289> cut<00:04:33.470> corners<00:04:33.680> because<00:04:34.100> smaller

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
expect it to cut corners because smaller

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.090 
expect it to cut corners because smaller
screw<00:04:35.150> springs<00:04:35.509> treasure<00:04:35.870> now<00:04:36.770> when<00:04:36.979> you

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
screw springs treasure now when you

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.340 
screw springs treasure now when you
first<00:04:37.370> get<00:04:37.699> this<00:04:37.940> cube<00:04:38.360> you'll<00:04:38.900> notice<00:04:39.169> that

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
first get this cube you'll notice that

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.400 
first get this cube you'll notice that
the<00:04:39.710> center<00:04:40.160> caps<00:04:40.400> will<00:04:41.240> keep<00:04:41.690> popping<00:04:42.199> off

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
the center caps will keep popping off

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.469 
the center caps will keep popping off
and<00:04:42.889> I<00:04:43.280> just<00:04:44.030> put<00:04:44.270> some<00:04:44.449> sticky<00:04:45.050> tack<00:04:45.940> on<00:04:46.940> some

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
and I just put some sticky tack on some

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:50.550 
and I just put some sticky tack on some
of<00:04:47.660> them<00:04:47.810> some<00:04:48.590> of<00:04:48.710> the<00:04:48.860> wines<00:04:49.100> falling<00:04:49.669> off<00:04:49.850> so

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
of them some of the wines falling off so

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.770 
of them some of the wines falling off so
yeah<00:04:51.560> and<00:04:52.370> the<00:04:52.610> reason<00:04:52.970> why<00:04:53.180> they<00:04:53.389> call<00:04:53.630> this

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
yeah and the reason why they call this

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.879 
yeah and the reason why they call this
cube<00:04:54.199> the<00:04:54.949> foot<00:04:55.370> cube<00:04:55.729> is<00:04:56.090> because<00:04:56.650> suppose<00:04:57.650> to

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
cube the foot cube is because suppose to

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:00.340 
cube the foot cube is because suppose to
solve<00:04:58.160> it<00:04:58.370> with<00:04:58.490> your<00:04:58.669> feet<00:04:58.970> and<00:04:59.539> yes<00:05:00.320> that

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
solve it with your feet and yes that

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:09.960 
solve it with your feet and yes that
does<00:05:00.650> mean<00:05:01.130> it<00:05:01.340> turned<00:05:01.699> extremely<00:05:01.990> fast<00:05:07.360> what

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
does mean it turned extremely fast what

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.240 
does mean it turned extremely fast what
an<00:05:10.970> interesting<00:05:11.270> thing<00:05:12.020> about<00:05:12.320> the<00:05:12.979> tourney

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
an interesting thing about the tourney

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.189 
an interesting thing about the tourney
is<00:05:13.400> it<00:05:14.000> kind<00:05:14.449> of<00:05:14.599> like<00:05:15.220> it's<00:05:16.220> smooth<00:05:16.849> but<00:05:17.389> when

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:18.199 
is it kind of like it's smooth but when

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:23.020 
is it kind of like it's smooth but when
you<00:05:18.320> like<00:05:19.840> glide<00:05:20.840> it<00:05:21.050> like<00:05:21.229> that<00:05:21.849> it<00:05:22.849> like

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
you like glide it like that it like

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.129 
you like glide it like that it like
makes<00:05:23.060> a<00:05:23.479> really<00:05:23.720> bumpy<00:05:24.169> noise<00:05:24.800> I<00:05:26.139> think

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:27.139 
makes a really bumpy noise I think

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:30.460 
makes a really bumpy noise I think
that's<00:05:27.380> because<00:05:27.680> on<00:05:28.250> the<00:05:28.789> pieces<00:05:29.330> inside<00:05:29.780> are

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
that's because on the pieces inside are

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:36.670 
that's because on the pieces inside are
all<00:05:30.620> cut<00:05:32.650> um<00:05:33.650> now<00:05:34.370> also<00:05:34.639> for<00:05:35.510> lockups<00:05:36.110> this

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
all cut um now also for lockups this

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.310 
all cut um now also for lockups this
cube<00:05:37.070> locks<00:05:37.370> up<00:05:37.729> a<00:05:38.000> little<00:05:38.270> bit<00:05:41.050> maybe<00:05:42.050> it's

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
cube locks up a little bit maybe it's

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.730 
cube locks up a little bit maybe it's
just<00:05:42.440> because<00:05:42.800> it's<00:05:43.460> so<00:05:43.970> big<00:05:44.510> and<00:05:44.810> my<00:05:45.440> hands

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
just because it's so big and my hands

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.689 
just because it's so big and my hands
are<00:05:46.159> used<00:05:46.639> to<00:05:46.820> a<00:05:46.849> cubed<00:05:47.270> outside<00:05:47.960> but<00:05:48.949> um<00:05:49.220> I

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:49.699 
are used to a cubed outside but um I

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:52.540 
are used to a cubed outside but um I
don't<00:05:50.300> know<00:05:50.510> I<00:05:50.599> think<00:05:50.810> it<00:05:51.139> does<00:05:51.289> walk<00:05:51.560> because

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
don't know I think it does walk because

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.600 
don't know I think it does walk because
I<00:05:52.580> can't<00:05:53.000> cut<00:05:53.240> corners<00:05:53.560> and<00:05:54.560> it<00:05:54.889> turns<00:05:55.370> really

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
I can't cut corners and it turns really

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.680 
I can't cut corners and it turns really
fast<00:05:56.120> so<00:05:56.800> kind<00:05:57.800> of<00:05:57.860> like<00:05:57.949> the<00:05:58.099> e<00:05:58.130> Sheen's<00:05:58.699> they

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
fast so kind of like the e Sheen's they

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.070 
fast so kind of like the e Sheen's they
lock<00:05:59.930> up<00:06:00.199> a<00:06:00.349> lot<00:06:00.560> also<00:06:00.909> so<00:06:01.909> this<00:06:02.659> is<00:06:02.840> like<00:06:03.020> a

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
lock up a lot also so this is like a

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.500 
lock up a lot also so this is like a
giant<00:06:03.199> eating<00:06:04.130> through<00:06:04.400> batteries<00:06:04.430> kind<00:06:05.330> of

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
giant eating through batteries kind of

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:12.040 
giant eating through batteries kind of
um<00:06:06.940> but<00:06:07.940> yeah<00:06:09.490> so<00:06:10.490> um<00:06:10.940> I<00:06:11.300> don't<00:06:11.419> think<00:06:11.630> there's

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
um but yeah so um I don't think there's

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.950 
um but yeah so um I don't think there's
really<00:06:12.349> anything<00:06:12.979> else<00:06:13.430> too

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
really anything else too
