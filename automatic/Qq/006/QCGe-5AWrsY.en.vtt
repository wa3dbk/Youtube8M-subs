00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.320
 ah 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:12.349
 Y 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:15.680
 Hi, my friends, today I come to bring you 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:21.050
 this video is to tell you how 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:23.300
 I use this my little hand of practice is a 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.119
 of the basic ones that the best some of 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.039
 you already have is this plastic 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.190
 that he feels that he is super character 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:34.010
 this heavy weighs something is fine 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:36.550
 solid is pure plastic there is another that is 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.550
 plus 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.670
 it's lighter and it's lighter but 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.430
 Well, that's the one I have and the 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.710
 true that as I had left a little 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.390
 this I have not bought now in a 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.620
 another then what am I doing and 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.620
 Well, I take it off and put it back on 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.760
 I would be four friends 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.430
 this is my way as I use 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.980
 the hand ok I know it's very difficult because 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.990
 it's made of plastic look, or is it just for 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.420
 open the fingers cost I fight 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.950
 also with this and the last time I tried 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.800
 to put a plastic here so that 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.490
 trotted will try to separate them 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.530
 first how you separated it that's the first thing 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.200
 because it's so uncomfortable just to 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.210
 win and be here and it's uncomfortable for me to 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.850
 example I can grab any little boat 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.800
 of plastic or something that is round and that 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.750
 can fit whoever is in these 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.230
 separations right now I will use 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.490
 these sponges that are for makeup 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.259
 and these are 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.299
 you can use whatever you want 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.780
 are cotton nothing but this is the 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.670
 they can wrap as well as a taquito 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.149
 then they put it here then of this 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.149
 way 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.480
 this way many are already more 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.230
 separated 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.660
 okay 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.670
 so here I have two other preparations 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.470
 and those are the ones that I'm going to do as well 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.500
 a little bit because I'm going to work 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.500
 in this and then they put it like this 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.140
 if it is good it is very difficult because 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.630
 this is very hard forgiving and if they occur 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.730
 account is already separated and leaves me 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.300
 put my fingers here and be able to work 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:23.960
 with her or the same if I want to encourage 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.750
 I hurt the other girl 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.720
 okay 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.990
 a problem we have with this hand is 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.990
 what 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.130
 they are like who says very dignified very 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:40.910
 deep this if you realize me here 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.430
 I have an acrylic layer on the 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.459
 almond this because they are actually 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.170
 super sunken and this and you can not 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.050
 work with them like that to hit them 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.390
 tip because it's super down 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:57.560
 so what I recommend is to 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:00.800
 make an almond a bed of the 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.160
 nail do it as they want with 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.570
 reverse or do it anything more basic 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.870
 do it to be able to start working already 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.629
 be with 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.659
 the way to nail the paper the one 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:18.630
 we have here high I 'll show you how 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:22.140
 I put it or as you said I will be 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:25.020
 the kind as you put it to me almost the 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.510
 I really do not work with tips on these 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:30.120
 hands I like more with shapes in tips 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.240
 I only do my nails but also not 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.610
 it is too much to treat it not then right now 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.660
 what I 'm going to do is this 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.660
 I will open this 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.820
 then you can use something in the 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.670
 yoga part I occupy the inn roll 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.890
 my forms but you can occupy something down 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.940
 so that your hand and power can be supported here 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:57.090
 work then like this 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.370
 and then we go to what I did here 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.370
 I already have my almond made then 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.310
 what I'm going to do here I'm going to paste this 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.690
 ok type and already well thus not 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.580
 I have to battle because it's up 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.550
 down and I'm going to be very sunken 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.890
 so then I paste it and right now 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.590
 I'm going to show you what I'm going to use 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.330
 my organic resin or any 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.320
 anybody I also have others for 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.079
 year 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.510
 we apply our 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.850
 our glue 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.000
 and this one and we're going to paste it and then 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.230
 just like that then you proceed to 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.400
 do the design 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.400
 that you want 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.110
 something that is a bit difficult to work 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.700
 with the tips on the practice fingers 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.180
 is that if you want to make a model 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.010
 short it is much battle then but 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.340
 equal to all the solution is sought not 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:53.050
 girls is not like there's this we're not going 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.550
 to find the way we have to 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.850
 find her 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:00.460
 adapt with what we have and this and 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.380
 well, so it takes a little longer and 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.620
 this and then now I'm going to 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.060
 show how to paste with the form ok equal 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.600
 they have to clean it a little so that 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:13.750
 is rough and this and can absorb a 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.970
 little bit the glue as I say is my 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.500
 way I do not tell them to do so is 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.870
 my way and everyone is learning 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.900
 something new when experimenting with your 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:25.960
 own products ok let's hope that 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.540
 that harden and horta come back girls 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.690
 this want to show this is how I 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.970
 I hit as you realize and this is the 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.900
 Almond of the nail has acrylic because 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.170
 I told them 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.240
 fill in to hit the tip that's 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:42.760
 my way as I use it if they are given 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.580
 account fills up more proceed until the 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.620
 design and it's super easy this or 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.600
 cut it not and so with these 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.969
 separators because the only thing that I can already 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:56.039
 use the cutter 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:59.199
 and now I'm going to use this form ok 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:02.499
 This is the way I use it. 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:05.110
 many many ways that you the 

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:07.989
 can they use ok they paste this that the 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:11.259
 part of here they stick enough I do not know 

00:06:07.989 --> 00:06:13.019
 how they paste here there are not many that 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:17.199
 they take off depending if it is very 

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:18.800
 lawful many what they do is paste the 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:22.909
 tips 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.560
 first that's a way they stick it 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:27.889
 they are at fault 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:31.750
 can use a form with which I 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:31.750
 he did not fight much is like that 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:40.330
 that's how I do not fight there is 

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:43.050
 then there they have the form already stuck 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.050
 there is 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:48.639
 there is 

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:51.270
 do not fight or be 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:51.270
 and ready 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:04.470
 here is then they saw that I do not fight 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:06.180
 use the same to remove it 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.249
 I think I'll leave it there because I'm going to 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.039
 make a model but 

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:13.560
 that's the way I like it and 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:16.169
 I say thing here is 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:19.550
 and they can give it so that it does not open 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:22.680
 and then she's ready to work then 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:25.380
 this girls that's my way I know 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:28.380
 I recommend you have here do the 

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:34.980
 almendrita or neo but there I did not see things 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:39.120
 appetizer in opinion of ruiz and for you 

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:41.510
 guys choice tv news 

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.510
 r 

00:07:45.129 --> 00:07:51.669
 and well, as I say that simply 

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:53.789
 regular tips and that's all I hope them 

00:07:51.669 --> 00:07:53.789
 like 

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.160
 ah
