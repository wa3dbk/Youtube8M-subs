that's<00:01:52.350> along<00:01:52.619> spinach<00:01:53.009> does<00:01:53.189> for<00:01:53.430> use<00:01:53.579> all

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
that's along spinach does for use all

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.359 
that's along spinach does for use all
things<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.240> do<00:01:54.360> with<00:01:54.390> your<00:01:54.600> digestive<00:01:55.110> system

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
things to do with your digestive system

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.110

among<00:01:56.369> many<00:01:56.610> other<00:01:56.820> things<00:01:57.149> like<00:01:57.360> let<00:01:57.570> me<00:01:57.689> have

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
among many other things like let me have

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.170 
among many other things like let me have
so<00:02:00.120> it<00:02:00.930> likes<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.290> grow<00:02:01.470> on<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.400> trellis<00:02:02.760> you<00:02:02.910> can

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
so it likes to grow on a trellis you can

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.850 
so it likes to grow on a trellis you can
see<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.570> will<00:02:03.690> just<00:02:03.870> keep<00:02:04.080> growing<00:02:04.320> up<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.740> up

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
see it will just keep growing up and up

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.320 
see it will just keep growing up and up
if<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.130> don't<00:02:05.250> put<00:02:05.550> it<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.760> trellis<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.240> and

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
if you don't put it on a trellis it and

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.389 
if you don't put it on a trellis it and
kind<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.660> grow<00:02:07.080> and<00:02:07.110> up<00:02:07.440> and<00:02:07.740> then<00:02:07.830> flop<00:02:08.160> down

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
kind of grow and up and then flop down

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.880 
kind of grow and up and then flop down
again<00:02:08.790> so<00:02:08.820> it<00:02:09.240> looks<00:02:09.450> better<00:02:09.660> on<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.869> trellis<00:02:10.229> it

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
again so it looks better on a trellis it

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.370 
again so it looks better on a trellis it
likes<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.400> bit<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.580> shade<00:02:12.000> but<00:02:12.240> also<00:02:12.510> Sun<00:02:13.020> so

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
likes a bit of shade but also Sun so

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.830 
likes a bit of shade but also Sun so
this<00:02:13.650> gets<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.100> afternoon<00:02:14.460> westerly<00:02:15.000> Sun<00:02:15.240> but

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
this gets the afternoon westerly Sun but

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.750 
this gets the afternoon westerly Sun but
it<00:02:15.930> gets<00:02:16.080> some<00:02:16.320> shade<00:02:16.590> as<00:02:16.770> well<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.220> it<00:02:17.610> will

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
it gets some shade as well and it will

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.460 
it gets some shade as well and it will
see<00:02:18.030> where<00:02:18.240> it<00:02:18.330> once<00:02:18.600> but<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:19.080> noticed<00:02:19.380> it

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
see where it once but I noticed it

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.790 
see where it once but I noticed it
generally<00:02:20.150> will<00:02:21.150> germinate<00:02:21.660> in<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.290> shady<00:02:22.590> or

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
generally will germinate in the shady or

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.340 
generally will germinate in the shady or
wetter<00:02:23.040> zones<00:02:23.460> so<00:02:23.880> it's<00:02:24.090> not<00:02:24.240> a<00:02:24.270> wet<00:02:24.570> foot<00:02:24.870> but

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
wetter zones so it's not a wet foot but

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.740 
wetter zones so it's not a wet foot but
it<00:02:25.440> likes<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.800> bit<00:02:25.980> of<00:02:26.010> wet<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.490> it<00:02:27.000> could<00:02:27.630> go

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
it likes a bit of wet and it could go

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.030 
it likes a bit of wet and it could go
like<00:02:27.780> this<00:02:28.050> no<00:02:28.230> tomorrow<00:02:28.620> there<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.860> most
