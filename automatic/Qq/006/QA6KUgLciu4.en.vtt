00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hey people and welcome to mikes like 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:14.790
 Today I explain something to you 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:16.830
 the cat is worldwide this 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.710
 plushy parts here actually as 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.970
 dead cats called dead cats sounds 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.039
 now a bit macabre but that has 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.240
 nothing with dead cats or the field 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.010
 to do a dead cat 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.840
 it just looks a little bit 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.710
 like the cat's hide and that's why 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.300
 is called that way 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.910
 There are also the terms or dog 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.530
 or two, I think only of 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.300
 stefan raab was called into being and 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.950
 not recognized at all is as it should be 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.469
 but I think the concept is right 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.989
 funny what does that part but 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.510
 actually that's a cover for 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.309
 Microphones to keep you from strong wind 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.960
 inclusions to protect so that the 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.640
 sound recordings are not going to be that bad 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.920
 you also know it from maybe 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.960
 any television recordings 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.460
 such a microphone as I like it 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.390
 wear then there are also such small ones 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.850
 plushy parts 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.830
 that's a bit bigger now 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.299
 plushy part in fact really 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.280
 happy and now if you have eyes 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.140
 closes and upward strokes could 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.390
 one assumes one must now one 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.220
 cat might be stroking it 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.400
 term and there are different varieties 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.850
 of which I have the first sws here 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.990
 200 and the first sws 100 and the first 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.439
 difference as you can see clearly 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.869
 is the size which means that is 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.790
 Actually, that simply means 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.070
 that these two dead cats for 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.600
 Different types of microphone are suitable 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.020
 are and just for different times 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.079
 sizes that sws 200 is for example 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.250
 the sgm 1000 that here i put on here 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.290
 the camera or that it gmx of 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.630
 first suitable is also a longer one 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.509
 directional microphone and this is for 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.759
 example, for the smx ten or twenty 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:59.210
 These are smaller stereo microphones from 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:04.290
 first or the etz 990 or the sg 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.579
 npd 2 that is basically the only one 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.259
 difference between these two 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.110
 that's why it's practically that first time 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.090
 away because I have the that it gm 1000 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.270
 I'll deal with it sooner 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.310
 also again 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.590
 test recordings first I explain 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.620
 to the functioning of it completely 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.630
 you just pull this over here 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.210
 Microphone one takes this protection here 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.310
 away and wind is strong wind 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.630
 in fact , these parts are only with 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.330
 strong wind used 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:36.790
 that also has a reason it is clear 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:41.140
 no magic piece here was the 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.990
 absolute hurricane wind completely minimized 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.210
 or clear if you are now 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.850
 somewhere on the baltic sea would film and there 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.010
 blew hurricane tornado or something like that 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.140
 you can still hear noises from the wind 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.360
 have in there so you may not wonderful 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.580
 expect these parts but you 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.620
 definitely minimize these 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.570
 Noises why are you using them now 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.070
 not always so why do I have 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.660
 that part not just always in it 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.420
 but very simple reason because 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.610
 of course it is now something 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.040
 over the microphone that means of course 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.980
 as if I am the hand before the 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.170
 keep my mouth you hear me worse or 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.820
 the sound becomes a bit duller 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.700
 worse to hear 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.740
 that's why you only ever use them 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.030
 if you really need them now 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.310
 here we have stronger wind 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.440
 you probably hear the wind now 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.360
 I was not in my climb microphone 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.880
 my turn, I'll be right now 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.000
 also few test shots showed me 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.190
 and how it sounds without and then you will 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.440
 you see what the difference clearly 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.440
 it is not more than that 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.700
 what the dead cats the dead 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.620
 Cats I hope you understood now 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.520
 what they are for and when they are 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.980
 really should only use what stops 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.299
 you have used it from dadc so you have 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.440
 you ever used such a dead cat 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.380
 Do you have such a dead cat for one ? 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.680
 microphone or do you risk the one 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.390
 and picks up disturbing noises from the wind 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.910
 likes to write down in the comments 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.890
