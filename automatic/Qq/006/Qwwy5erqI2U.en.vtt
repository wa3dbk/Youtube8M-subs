00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:22.090
 My name is Karen of 11 I'm a skater 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:28.570
 hot oil has been operating for 13 years since 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:32.200
 2000 and I was once world champion in 2005 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.420
 then world champion in 2008 and 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.540
 now in 2013 I'm convincing a lot 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.510
 world to try the three-time 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.860
 The skateboard for me is a perfect sport to 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.130
 people are always stimulating 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.380
 creativity so much in the maneuvers 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.150
 how much to dress in the part 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:55.660
 music video because it's too 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:58.120
 connected and was very impressed 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.660
 with color and then I think it's over 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.490
 translating into the way I dress 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.280
 a very skateboarding way 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.770
 I 'm always a colorful advisor and a 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.680
 of each color 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.320
 it's not an expression it's an it 's a 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.900
 printing is something that I finish 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.180
 getting out the inside is not that I 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.860
 I want to show our others how 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.640
 I do not color but I like to have 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.210
 colors around me close to me in the 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.210
 in the objects 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.980
 I was impressed by 5 things and 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.750
 vibrant colorful thing so i try 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.200
 put as much color as possible in the 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.200
 my life 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.880
 What could I tell people 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.310
 sit and listen and give this chance 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.140
 possible because sometimes it is not 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.760
 easy you can believe in themselves 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.430
 even when everyone is talking 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.410
 On the contrary, I am very aware of this 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.630
 a girl in the middle of skateboarding and I had 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.670
 what a great deal to face 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.710
 a lot when everybody told me 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.429
 What was wrong that I had to do? 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.459
 what everyone did at some point 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.700
 I believed what I was doing. 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.370
 it was zero for me, I think I 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.250
 It was not so wrong so I can 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.920
 Talk to you, that's what you believe in. 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.570
 and if no chance of getting the 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.870
 that you really think that you 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.870
 they want to do
