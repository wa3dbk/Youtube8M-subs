I<00:00:30.650> used<00:00:30.860> this<00:00:31.100> one<00:00:31.250> as<00:00:31.430> well<00:00:31.610> to<00:00:31.820> reduce<00:00:32.119> the

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
I used this one as well to reduce the

cooldown on my shoe well not exactly

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.400 
cooldown on my shoe well not exactly
sure<00:00:34.789> if<00:00:34.940> I<00:00:35.059> use<00:00:35.239> that<00:00:35.420> in<00:00:35.510> my<00:00:35.539> last<00:00:35.930> build<00:00:36.260> or

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
sure if I use that in my last build or

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.069 
sure if I use that in my last build or
not<00:00:36.699> maybe<00:00:37.699> not<00:00:37.879> maybe<00:00:38.210> I<00:00:38.360> switched<00:00:38.840> it<00:00:39.020> over

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
not maybe not maybe I switched it over

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.229 
not maybe not maybe I switched it over
for<00:00:39.410> something<00:00:39.680> else

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
for something else

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.240 
for something else

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
one-handed weapon specialization

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.799 
one-handed weapon specialization
increases<00:00:43.700> the<00:00:43.820> damage<00:00:44.180> you're<00:00:44.300> dealing<00:00:44.690> by

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
increases the damage you're dealing by

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.500 
increases the damage you're dealing by
10%<00:00:45.350> basically<00:00:45.829> in<00:00:46.010> negating<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:46.700> penalty

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
10% basically in negating the penalty

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.450 
10% basically in negating the penalty
you<00:00:47.690> get<00:00:47.899> when<00:00:48.260> you're<00:00:48.440> switching<00:00:48.710> into<00:00:49.250> the

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
you get when you're switching into the

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.370 
you get when you're switching into the
fencing<00:00:49.760> stance

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.380 
fencing stance

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.660 
fencing stance
actually<00:00:51.380> the<00:00:51.500> ffensive<00:00:51.829> stance<00:00:52.070> was<00:00:52.250> only<00:00:52.430> 5%

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
actually the ffensive stance was only 5%

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.990 
actually the ffensive stance was only 5%
now<00:00:53.300> I<00:00:53.329> think<00:00:53.950> vigilance<00:00:54.950> 1<00:00:55.190> talents<00:00:55.640> it's

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
now I think vigilance 1 talents it's

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
now I think vigilance 1 talents it's
very<00:00:56.270> useful<00:00:56.690> to<00:00:56.719> have<00:00:56.840> it<00:00:57.170> on<00:00:57.290> your<00:00:59.020> highest

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
very useful to have it on your highest

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.830 
very useful to have it on your highest
dps<00:01:00.379> err<00:01:00.829> because<00:01:01.700> you<00:01:01.820> will<00:01:01.940> be<00:01:02.059> making<00:01:02.239> a<00:01:02.600> lot

strength<00:01:26.450> stamina<00:01:26.900> and<00:01:27.470> expertise<00:01:28.180> basically

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
strength stamina and expertise basically

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.660

Lich King sword and board it used to be

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.020 
Lich King sword and board it used to be
more<00:02:08.030> useful<00:02:08.269> but<00:02:08.750> now<00:02:09.079> with<00:02:09.379> the<00:02:09.649> revenge<00:02:10.610> and

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
more useful but now with the revenge and

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.300 
more useful but now with the revenge and
devastate<00:02:11.870> you<00:02:12.500> kind<00:02:12.739> of<00:02:12.799> use<00:02:12.950> your<00:02:13.129> shield

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310

slams<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:13.790> little<00:02:14.029> less<00:02:14.180> but<00:02:14.419> still<00:02:14.450> it's<00:02:15.019> very

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:15.409 
slams a little less but still it's very

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:18.190 
slams a little less but still it's very
good<00:02:15.950> because<00:02:16.159> basically<00:02:16.790> it<00:02:17.629> reduces<00:02:17.989> the

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
good because basically it reduces the

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.390 
good because basically it reduces the
cost<00:02:18.379> of<00:02:18.499> a<00:02:18.559> shields<00:02:18.859> time<00:02:19.010> for

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
cost of a shields time for

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.490 
cost of a shields time for
percent<00:02:19.819> so<00:02:20.000> basically<00:02:20.329> that's<00:02:20.629> the<00:02:20.930> threat

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
percent so basically that's the threat

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.979 
percent so basically that's the threat
of<00:02:21.530> a<00:02:21.799> shield<00:02:22.010> slam<00:02:22.310> for<00:02:22.519> zero<00:02:22.790> rage<00:02:23.120> so<00:02:23.840> if<00:02:23.900> you

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
of a shield slam for zero rage so if you

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.750 
of a shield slam for zero rage so if you
consider<00:02:24.349> that<00:02:24.439> yeah<00:02:25.129> considering<00:02:25.549> that

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
consider that yeah considering that

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.309 
consider that yeah considering that
shield<00:02:26.030> slam<00:02:26.209> is<00:02:26.360> always<00:02:26.659> in<00:02:26.780> your<00:02:26.900> rotation

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
and that's it for the protection tree I

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.520 
and that's it for the protection tree I
think<00:02:46.220> I<00:02:46.310> pretty<00:02:46.519> much<00:02:46.640> covered<00:02:47.150> everything
