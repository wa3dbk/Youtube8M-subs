00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.269
 good greetings again beautiful people and 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.299
 Welcome back to this little one 

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:13.000
 channel about games this time 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:17.420
 I bring you I come to show you something 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.840
 special that I want to show my feet 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.840
 and those are my feet and those are my hands 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.660
 also this mode is called immersive 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.349
 first first person and it's a way that 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.020
 modify the way you see the 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.949
 first person perspective download 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.030
 As you can see , I can walk 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:37.030
 watching my feet 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.239
 it is also modified in the case of 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.190
 combat because they remember the bow in the 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.100
 case for example if I draw a bow and it goes 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.530
 down I see my hands with bow and 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.480
 done when I shot 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.090
 well this is when I go running you see 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.980
 the bow differently and if I shoot he will not 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.690
 it modifies a lot you can always work 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.710
 same but when moving we see the 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.710
 movement of the bow 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.070
 now this is very different from the 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.410
 perspective that the normal person of 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.410
 be in what is this 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.479
 how can you see things change a lot 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.729
 the bow does not move when we run and if 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.180
 we see below because the hand moves 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:24.240
 with us 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.370
 the same goes for combat weapons 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.860
 body to body we will give a dagger 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.570
 in the case of the dagger, that's how we see 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.610
 with first person 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.210
 with the first person forgiveness mode 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.460
 that was given to me in the room and you can not see 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.440
 a lot of arm movement and first 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.440
 normal person shot and looks like this 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.200
 now the mode also comes with its 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.510
 own configuration menu goes to 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.150
 need the sky or there is for this but it 's 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.670
 a total tangle of configuration and 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.130
 profiles brings things like for example what 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.200
 most interesting or most importantly the 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.350
 key that helps us change the 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.030
 first person perspective because no 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.149
 does not occupy the perspective of having the 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.460
 Download person that is the f key but 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.640
 that occupies a different perspective are 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.860
 independent I recommend occupying a 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.120
 key for example the g that is what I 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.680
 occupy the g key that is not used 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.630
 in the normal scaping unless 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.880
 you set it up personally for 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.560
 another thing and this facebook that the 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.830
 I really do not know what they do not do 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.170
 I understood well and this comes with another 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.770
 kind of view now in the case of the 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.560
 Profiles 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.360
 are questions such as how much 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.610
 is the angle that we can that we can 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.680
 move face up or down 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.320
 when we go mounted when we are in 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.830
 fight as I tell you is a lot of 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.690
 data 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.210
 I did not understand it well and I did not have a chance 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.690
 to be completely reviewing myself 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.880
 I recommend that you review it and 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.310
 that they configure it if they do not want 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.280
 set up in your own personal way of 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.810
 game but leave it by default as is 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.540
 that the truth that is quite functional 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.540
 as well as how it comes by default 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.220
 now it has some utility 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.040
 practice this mode that allows us to see 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.190
 the feet while we run the truth 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.770
 that is not a simple way of change 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.200
 that changes the perspective of how 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.540
 we see the world download but in uses 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.769
 practical I do not see him much we can see in 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.180
 the shadow 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.340
 we can see our hands while 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.300
 we are fighting or see them in a way 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:42.300
 different but not really in the 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.220
 question of the game as such only 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.350
 makes things more immersive because there are 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.180
 a good one is a good option if 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.730
 They want to try it and see how they like it 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.380
 if you like it but I do not feel like it said they are 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.380
 ways of those indispensable for 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.269
 download so well let's not pass 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.130
 when we read so much and I'm going to teach 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.410
 If the house has liked how it works 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:05.880
 I'll teach then how 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:08.260
 install and ok this mold immersive feeder 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.560
 person or as devils to pronounce 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.260
 has scarce is not they need it 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.639
 of three things need to take place their 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:22.479
 scale and naturalized version 1.9 32 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:24.200
 They need the sk and they need the sky 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:27.110
 white 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.730
 about the sk e &amp; c and the sky I already have 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.590
 video so I'm just going to 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.170
 leave in the description of this video 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.750
 the links so they can see how to install 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.310
 these two things so assuming that 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.050
 she has the only thing that we are going to 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.400
 to do is download the tablet that 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.100
 will also be in the description of 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.620
 I'm going to open this video and we're going to 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.020
 put these four elements inside the 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.540
 data of our cargo simply 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.570
 copy and paste to me asks me if I 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.920
 I want to overwrite because I already had it 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.420
 but you put it overwrite for 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.190
 anything 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.110
 and I've done this next thing what 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.090
 let's just do is enter the 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.920
 announces the download and make sure 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.310
 that this one has executed to activate 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:11.340
 here in data files we look for the 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:13.530
 mersin fp and we leave it checked with 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.780
 this is already not going to run it from 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.300
 here from playing as we need leszek 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:21.420
 to that then we have to execute it 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.580
 from the link that is the shortcut 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.560
 that leaves us the sk e &amp; c to play is 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.480
 karen if you do not do it from cant of not 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.750
 they will work and they will not have 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:33.390
 access to the menu that appears from lezkairu 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.880
 so good that 's all as I told you 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.730
 it's not an especially good way that you 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.100
 radically change the errors mode 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.350
 carding and it really is a curiosity 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:46.050
 It can be good for people if at all 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:49.260
 he likes to have a much more perspective 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:52.860
 personal and much more immersive of the 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:55.110
 game so good is everything if you like 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.660
 my videos and my work as always 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.820
 I invite you to subscribe to the channel 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.070
 that they share my videos that they give 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.900
 like in the fanpage and let me 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.630
 to reach many more people with my work 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.480
 Spanish-speaking you play street like this 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:12.620
 how good is all thanks for watching and we 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.620
 we see another time
