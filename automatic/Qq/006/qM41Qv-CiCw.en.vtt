off of that do you see more injuries as

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.080 
off of that do you see more injuries as
you<00:01:28.289> go<00:01:28.409> through<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.829> year<00:01:29.039> or<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.609> it<00:01:29.909> pretty

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
you go through the year or is it pretty

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.670 
you go through the year or is it pretty
consistent<00:01:30.600> throughout<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.840> whole<00:01:30.930> year<00:01:31.170> so

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
consistent throughout the whole year so

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.170 
consistent throughout the whole year so
definitely<00:01:32.100> more<00:01:32.430> towards<00:01:32.789> in<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.909> year<00:01:33.149> like

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
definitely more towards in a year like

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.639 
definitely more towards in a year like
once<00:01:33.450> we<00:01:33.570> start<00:01:33.810> getting<00:01:33.930> through<00:01:34.200> summer<00:01:34.469> if

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
once we start getting through summer if

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.109 
once we start getting through summer if
they<00:01:34.740> start<00:01:34.979> stacking<00:01:35.399> up<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:35.609> us<00:01:35.789> a<00:01:35.820> lot<00:01:36.000> of

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
they start stacking up on us a lot of

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.399
