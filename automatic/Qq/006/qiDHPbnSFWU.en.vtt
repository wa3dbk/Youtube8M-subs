00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.750
 one of the jewish novelties that 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:15.509
 new guarantees will emerge the times 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:19.109
 polycarbonate blacks on the high- 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.600
 which is among the most fashionable and 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.800
 my opinion and have their indications 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.840
 such as doing 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.349
 treatment for cases 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.560
 class where only small case in 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.050
 and an important detail is 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.920
 he does not touch then infractions case 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.760
 no chance to make a case with him 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:46.020
 relatively light alignment they are 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.899
 very efficient and are the most 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.210
 aesthetics that exists in the market one day 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.149
 an important detail how to close 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.610
 the door had it because I have to 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:01.559
 to deal with a faithful son in the 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.960
 lots with enough 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.060
 Look, this double continent he has 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.409
 that trying to stick the son down there 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.130
 lots will close the lid 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:20.240
 completely just look at the other O 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:20.240
 Look, I was just going to the bottom of the lots. 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.670
 good 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.399
 good 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.959
 [Music] 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.490
 O 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:48.310
 always carry well in the bottom of the slot and there it is 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:52.960
 bombshell lalli to be able to carry 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:57.310
 bottom of the lots I could only close the 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:03.130
 A little something that's what 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:08.739
 I would like to say that we 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:11.220
 the beginnings of the highly aesthetic 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.220
 polycarbonate 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.770
 I wanted to give my position 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.770
 with brief relations 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.620
 [Music] 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.620
 my position with regard to buildings 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.130
 technicians have required principals efe 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.670
 began to emerge 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.400
 I told myself it was not for everything. 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.730
 good for certain cases 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.330
 specific antenna remain same 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.580
 conduct has to be dealt with by 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.280
 conventional west philosophy 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.920
 there are cases that the statue deals with 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.260
 fitch philosophies in case of abandonment 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.870
 to make high-gloss metallic and 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.740
 have house to deal with high on of 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.590
 polycarbonates each its indication 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.640
 each with its way of working 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.910
 specific 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:19.170
 It's funny because when we talk 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:22.080
 that we use the term not always the 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:27.960
 people sometimes interpret as never 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:30.480
 and label us like when I say 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.570
 this brief should not always be used 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.650
 as if he had philosophy and 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.910
 it 's not like that 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.130
 How nice that you had the opportunity to 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.980
 make it clear to everyone who 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.980
 You can admit that, thank you.
