here<00:00:37.660> is<00:00:37.809> actually<00:00:38.290> uses<00:00:38.829> a<00:00:38.860> different

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
here is actually uses a different

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.880 
here is actually uses a different
technique<00:00:39.730> from<00:00:40.059> corner<00:00:40.690> to<00:00:40.719> corner<00:00:40.870> which<00:00:41.710> is

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
technique from corner to corner which is

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.319 
technique from corner to corner which is
kind<00:00:42.220> of<00:00:42.310> nice<00:00:42.430> because<00:00:42.700> it's<00:00:42.940> a<00:00:43.000> lot<00:00:43.150> easier

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
kind of nice because it's a lot easier

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.380 
kind of nice because it's a lot easier
to<00:00:43.570> do<00:00:43.870> I<00:00:44.190> don't<00:00:45.190> imagine<00:00:45.490> it<00:00:45.790> hold<00:00:46.000> up<00:00:46.150> real

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
to do I don't imagine it hold up real

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.280 
to do I don't imagine it hold up real
well<00:00:46.540> in<00:00:46.780> the<00:00:46.960> wind<00:00:47.890> but<00:00:48.370> I<00:00:48.610> think<00:00:49.060> for<00:00:49.300> what

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
well in the wind but I think for what

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.870 
well in the wind but I think for what
we're<00:00:50.440> expecting<00:00:50.770> here<00:00:51.160> this<00:00:51.370> should<00:00:51.520> be<00:00:51.670> just

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:51.880 
we're expecting here this should be just

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.060 
we're expecting here this should be just
fine<00:00:52.210> we'll<00:00:52.570> see

and<00:00:57.280> if<00:00:57.370> we<00:00:57.520> come<00:00:57.730> over<00:00:57.760> the<00:00:58.090> other<00:00:58.240> hand<00:00:58.630> of

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
and if we come over the other hand of

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.970 
and if we come over the other hand of
this<00:00:58.870> whole<00:00:59.080> thing<00:00:59.320> you<00:00:59.350> can<00:00:59.500> see<00:00:59.800> how<00:00:59.920> that

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980

the<00:01:41.829> Tonys<00:01:42.250> camp<00:01:42.610> they<00:01:42.850> chose<00:01:43.210> to<00:01:43.450> use<00:01:43.720> a<00:01:43.750> a

pole in the center if it was me I would

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.929 
pole in the center if it was me I would
probably<00:01:49.319> bury<00:01:50.319> that<00:01:50.649> pole<00:01:51.039> a<00:01:51.069> little<00:01:51.280> bit<00:01:51.670> so

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939
