00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.179 
matching jewelry in them and they are a
to<00:01:43.740> gauge<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.310> have<00:01:44.520> little<00:01:45.409> silicone<00:01:46.409> your

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
to gauge I have little silicone your

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.130 
to gauge I have little silicone your
skins<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.180> then

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.690 

um<00:01:52.640> and<00:01:53.640> then<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:54.240> year<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.780> have<00:01:55.770> this

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
um and then this year I have this

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.210 
um and then this year I have this
doesn't<00:01:57.030> go<00:01:57.120> through<00:01:57.300> cartilage<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:57.930> it's<00:01:58.050> my

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
doesn't go through cartilage so it's my

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:07.100 
doesn't go through cartilage so it's my
third<00:01:59.220> level<00:02:00.470> 2<00:02:01.470> 12<00:02:02.310> gauge<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:04.010> have<00:02:05.010> a<00:02:06.110> level

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
third level 2 12 gauge I have a level

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.779 
third level 2 12 gauge I have a level
lower<00:02:07.320> helix<00:02:07.950> because<00:02:08.190> this<00:02:08.369> goes<00:02:08.550> through

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
lower helix because this goes through

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.510 
lower helix because this goes through
cartilage<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.479> it's<00:02:09.630> a<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.990> gauge<00:02:10.320> and<00:02:10.800> then<00:02:11.220> I

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
cartilage and it's a to gauge and then I

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.680 
cartilage and it's a to gauge and then I
have<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:13.430> 14-gauge<00:02:14.430> cartilage<00:02:15.060> piercing<00:02:15.420> above

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
have a 14-gauge cartilage piercing above

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.460 
have a 14-gauge cartilage piercing above
that<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.170> then<00:02:17.209> it<00:02:18.209> goes<00:02:19.190> through<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:22.230> to

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
that and then it goes through the to

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.690 
that and then it goes through the to
gauge<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.730> then<00:02:23.850> i<00:02:23.910> have<00:02:24.060> my<00:02:24.090> industrial<00:02:25.700> and

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
gauge and then i have my industrial and

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.240 
gauge and then i have my industrial and
it's<00:02:27.540> like<00:02:27.690> an<00:02:27.810> 18<00:02:28.230> gauge<00:02:28.560> it's<00:02:28.800> really<00:02:29.010> small

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
it's like an 18 gauge it's really small

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.330 
it's like an 18 gauge it's really small
I'm<00:02:29.550> going<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.790> go<00:02:29.910> bigger<00:02:30.090> go<00:02:30.739> then<00:02:31.739> in<00:02:32.040> this

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
I'm going to go bigger go then in this

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
orbital down below but it is it's two

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.039 
orbital down below but it is it's two
separate<00:03:33.030> piercings<00:03:33.420> with<00:03:33.569> one<00:03:33.720> piece<00:03:33.900> of

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
separate piercings with one piece of

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.680 
separate piercings with one piece of
jewelry<00:03:34.379> sort<00:03:34.830> of<00:03:34.890> like<00:03:34.980> an<00:03:35.129> industrial<00:03:35.690> but

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
jewelry sort of like an industrial but

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.150 
jewelry sort of like an industrial but
on<00:03:36.780> a<00:03:36.810> smaller<00:03:37.080> scale<00:03:37.670> like<00:03:38.670> that<00:03:39.680> with<00:03:40.680> the

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
on a smaller scale like that with the

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.240 
on a smaller scale like that with the
hoop<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:42.299> big<00:03:42.870> cartilage<00:03:43.349> one<00:03:43.590> it's<00:03:43.829> the

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
hoop and the big cartilage one it's the

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.870 
hoop and the big cartilage one it's the
same<00:03:44.489> idea<00:03:44.819> but<00:03:45.060> they're<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.959> same<00:03:46.170> size<00:03:46.230> and

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
same idea but they're the same size and

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.250 
same idea but they're the same size and
then<00:03:47.880> I<00:03:48.209> have<00:03:48.329> a<00:03:48.390> really<00:03:48.750> small<00:03:49.230> stud<00:03:50.900> and<00:03:51.900> it's

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
then I have a really small stud and it's

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.319 
then I have a really small stud and it's
it's<00:03:52.799> just<00:03:52.950> another<00:03:53.310> cartilage<00:03:53.819> piercing<00:03:54.209> and

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
it's just another cartilage piercing and

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.600 
it's just another cartilage piercing and
it<00:03:54.390> goes<00:03:54.540> look<00:03:54.750> straight<00:03:55.319> up<00:03:55.349> while<00:03:56.280> she<00:03:56.310> goes

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
it goes look straight up while she goes

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.479 
it goes look straight up while she goes
back<00:03:56.879> a<00:03:56.940> little<00:03:57.209> bit<00:03:57.390> but<00:03:57.750> and<00:03:58.430> now<00:03:59.430> for
