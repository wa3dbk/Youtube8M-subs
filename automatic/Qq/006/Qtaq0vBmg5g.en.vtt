00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.830
 hello everyone welcome in the 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.050
 balrog replays today it's going to be 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:34.220
 a diag game in live foam jag 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.510
 some say I believe that the real 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.880
 pronunciation it is yagg 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:42.110
 but I say jag here it is like that 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:44.020
 so the jag pzk trt which is the next 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.820
 after the stucco 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.430
 I will give you a presentation but 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:53.510
 it's not necessarily the best we go 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.970
 so say a part where I'm not too much 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.220
 misplaced seen a few of the third 6 and that 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.500
 this tank and yesterday 6 that this hunter's 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.430
 tanks and yesterday 6 against it for sure 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.270
 for a map 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.320
 I do not appreciate it so we go 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.680
 see what we can do 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:14.270
 but in fact it's going to be a very good 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:16.910
 part and I'm going to get an intimate from 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.910
 mastery I do not say which pc has 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.960
 surprised 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:28.700
 because political police 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.700
 so suddenly i'm going to go 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.960
 put me in position 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.320
 expectations mission 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.830
 at first because I 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.400
 were singing ours not necessarily 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:45.300
 to assault this tank is not 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.300
 what we all do 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.970
 suddenly 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.630
 I will go to the middle for 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.100
 smolder 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.100
 the kid of the map 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.020
 bz 2 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.230
 kate had the same idea against here 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:09.810
 but which of me is a little embarrassing and 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:14.430
 here I am positioning myself and there is more than 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.980
 wait for the client so we see that 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.260
 some were spot and middle east 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.150
 on the other hand, there is only one 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:26.750
 only bear coming 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.050
 on the left side of the amap try to 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.360
 help 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.360
 so there I succeed a case of ascq stoned 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:40.340
 the wall I succeed in neptune who are 328 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.050
 I succeed in nimes and windows that has 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:48.170
 past because she has four the 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:51.920
 end by cons at kvs where I spent 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.200
 a little more shoot and at this moment 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.670
 I hope very much that our ordeal 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.440
 it's a little better than theirs because 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.940
 than 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.830
 I want to be able to be big 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:08.440
 thing this distance the face to a pv has 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:14.350
 left an interest in this game so appears 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:17.300
 that I know neither the pc of the fires so 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.370
 here and I put a second dose but 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.020
 I think it's the kiss since the 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:27.320
 terminus and that's the bz that the 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:29.330
 so ends a case vs. 2 months note 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:34.820
 caviar who got rid of the cair 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:37.610
 and red so they move forward I 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.110
 also go to accompany him but I 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.190
 see that there are a lot of people in fact 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.260
 on the right of the map 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.260
 so I will try to position ourselves 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.060
 on the left you can pull out on the 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.060
 right we'll say 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.900
 I look at this little one to his case 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.900
 s 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.170
 I could not so suddenly I stand 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.710
 ready because they are safe 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.610
 on the other side 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.610
 by the way there is a small 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.689
 these two 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:14.689
 light tanks coming to me hop hop 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:19.370
 here and come back but he was running away in 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:22.370
 the other sense rushing towards me there 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.650
 I see a cable pulling me from 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.960
 to say that he falls on the corner of the nose 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.180
 so suddenly I go back a little bit 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:33.139
 I'm looking at the situation 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.360
 I see that I can shoot in a cellar 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.639
 is a gift of the shot I shoot him 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.870
 this is where more people are shot 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.270
 this turret 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:47.990
 it's like that target gene a little bit more 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:48.950
 big there is a real case that I had 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.730
 seen 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.730
 who was motionless 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:05:03.310
 another that I would be there at the height 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:05.410
 said I too was helped 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:09.970
 someone else who has it that has me 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:11.470
 helped in the started one year the middle and 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:17.100
 clean up and stays more than at interest at 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:21.360
 his grids blocked at what is happening 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:24.610
 it remains public I head for the cape 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.360
 in six years that I have 3es 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.360
 li on the way 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.410
 it's really a tank so I 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.240
 put me in the cape of pals are 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.940
 gone looking they did not find that 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.770
 there is city ​​and spots and but it is 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.419
 out of reach there is someone they 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.490
 like it comes back 2 even though I'm moving 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:53.110
 if I go out of the cable I will lose the 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:58.060
 a few points that I will reap in 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:06:01.440
 cape years who sleeps and have had before I 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:04.750
 manages to do a lot of distance 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:07.840
 so on fight it's actually it's a 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.490
 Char geoffrey the presentation but knows 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.430
 we are a little disappointed when we come from 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.630
 stucco because it lacks some armor 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.280
 but I'll tell you more when 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.720
 presentation and it's not so I wanted 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.430
 you show it because as I do you 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.110
 I said I did a Masters badge 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.330
 with this part and it's a 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:26.500
 assassins of mastery h 10 place du 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:29.440
 tank that I did on this part so 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.850
 on this I'm going to just tell you that 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.610
