00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.590 
of this footage it's really nice I like
the<00:02:54.980> finger<00:02:55.280> guard<00:02:55.489> down<00:02:55.700> here<00:02:55.940> get<00:02:56.480> your

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
the finger guard down here get your

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.690 
the finger guard down here get your
finger<00:02:56.900> in<00:02:56.930> there<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.230> it<00:02:57.470> does<00:02:57.709> do<00:02:58.430> a<00:02:58.459> nice

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
finger in there and it does do a nice

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.789 
finger in there and it does do a nice
job<00:02:59.000> when<00:02:59.239> you're<00:02:59.360> thrusting<00:03:00.079> keeping<00:03:00.709> your

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
job when you're thrusting keeping your

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.800 
job when you're thrusting keeping your
hand<00:03:00.980> from<00:03:01.070> slipping<00:03:01.280> forward<00:03:01.670> what<00:03:02.510> I<00:03:02.540> have

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
hand from slipping forward what I have

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.330 
hand from slipping forward what I have
like<00:03:03.020> maybe<00:03:03.349> a<00:03:03.470> little<00:03:03.500> more<00:03:03.770> traction<00:03:04.069> up

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
like maybe a little more traction up

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.940 
like maybe a little more traction up
here<00:03:04.520> maybe<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:06.080> but<00:03:06.500> it<00:03:06.590> is<00:03:06.620> thick<00:03:06.920> enough

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
here maybe and but it is thick enough

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.410 
here maybe and but it is thick enough
you<00:03:07.430> could<00:03:07.550> probably<00:03:07.700> put<00:03:08.000> some<00:03:08.120> tracks

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
you could probably put some tracks

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.610 
you could probably put some tracks
tape<00:03:08.630> up<00:03:08.750> there<00:03:08.930> if<00:03:09.050> you<00:03:09.140> really<00:03:09.349> wanted<00:03:09.590> to

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
tape up there if you really wanted to

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.220 
tape up there if you really wanted to
