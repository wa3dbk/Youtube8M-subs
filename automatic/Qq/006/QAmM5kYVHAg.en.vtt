zoom<00:04:12.470> in<00:04:13.060> okay<00:04:14.060> I<00:04:14.410> use<00:04:15.410> as<00:04:15.560> much<00:04:15.770> force<00:04:16.100> as<00:04:16.160> I

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
zoom in okay I use as much force as I

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.150 
zoom in okay I use as much force as I
can<00:04:16.730> with<00:04:16.910> that<00:04:17.140> so<00:04:18.140> I<00:04:18.200> scribbled<00:04:18.800> on<00:04:18.980> the

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
fourth line and you can't even see it so

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.860 
fourth line and you can't even see it so
it<00:04:21.650> definitely<00:04:22.250> doesn't<00:04:22.550> bleed<00:04:22.940> through<00:04:23.300> so<00:04:23.810> I

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
it definitely doesn't bleed through so I

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.570 
it definitely doesn't bleed through so I
will<00:04:24.020> definitely<00:04:24.170> recommend<00:04:24.590> these<00:04:25.010> pens<00:04:25.340> if

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580
