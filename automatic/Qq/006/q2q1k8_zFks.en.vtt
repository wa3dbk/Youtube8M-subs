00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
started conservatively and it was great

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.600

probably<00:01:18.540> about<00:01:18.689> 40<00:01:19.409> miles<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.220> started<00:01:20.520> to

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
probably about 40 miles and I started to

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.120 
probably about 40 miles and I started to
feel<00:01:20.640> really<00:01:21.119> often<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.500> was<00:01:22.680> partly<00:01:22.950> my<00:01:23.070> fault

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
and I'm a little bit embarrassed to

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.660 
and I'm a little bit embarrassed to
admit<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:25.049> but<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.710> had<00:01:26.009> some<00:01:26.159> nutrition

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
issues okay which is funny because I'm

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.609 
issues okay which is funny because I'm
always<00:01:29.070> talking<00:01:29.280> about<00:01:29.930> nutrition<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.170> you

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619

know<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.770> just<00:01:32.009> had<00:01:32.159> some<00:01:32.430> challenges<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.210> I

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
know I just had some challenges and I

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.090 
know I just had some challenges and I
wasn't<00:01:33.960> able<00:01:34.050> to<00:01:34.230> get<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.500> fuel<00:01:34.710> down<00:01:34.920> they

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
wasn't able to get the fuel down they

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.220 
wasn't able to get the fuel down they
needed<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.670> got<00:01:35.850> behind<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.020> kind<00:01:37.170> of

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.230 
needed so I got behind and that kind of

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.290 
needed so I got behind and that kind of
set<00:01:37.470> me<00:01:37.620> up<00:01:37.650> for<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.730> canyons<00:01:39.150> were

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
set me up for the canyons were

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.210 
set me up for the canyons were
distraught<00:01:39.690> and<00:01:39.990> then<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:40.830> never<00:01:40.980> came

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
distraught and then I just never came

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.490 
distraught and then I just never came
back<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.700> sometimes<00:01:42.390> with<00:01:42.750> nutrition<00:01:43.290> you

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
back so sometimes with nutrition you

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.440 
back so sometimes with nutrition you
know<00:01:43.830> and<00:01:44.340> it's<00:01:44.550> happening<00:01:44.970> what's<00:01:45.210> going

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
know and it's happening what's going

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.880 
know and it's happening what's going
wrong<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.900> sometimes<00:01:46.260> you<00:01:46.500> never<00:01:46.620> figured

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
wrong and sometimes you never figured

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.170 
wrong and sometimes you never figured
out<00:01:47.190> and<00:01:47.370> sometimes<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.760> figure<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.060> out

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
out and sometimes you figure it out

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 
just kind of funny 8 more on the the

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.210 
just kind of funny 8 more on the the
faster<00:06:25.750> races<00:06:26.110> which<00:06:26.260> is<00:06:26.410> not<00:06:26.560> my<00:06:26.860> natural

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220
