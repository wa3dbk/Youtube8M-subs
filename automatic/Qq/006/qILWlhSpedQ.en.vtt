00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.210 
to know is Z spot I will not be covering
that<00:00:06.720> because<00:00:06.960> I<00:00:07.049> covered<00:00:07.319> an<00:00:07.410> e<00:00:07.710> pop<00:00:07.950> but<00:00:08.130> I'll

description see I could check out the Z
spot<00:00:12.030> breakdown<00:00:12.540> but<00:00:13.530> as<00:00:13.769> you<00:00:14.009> can<00:00:14.070> see<00:00:14.219> here

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
spot breakdown but as you can see here

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.150 
spot breakdown but as you can see here
FL<00:00:14.820> drive<00:00:15.150> is<00:00:15.480> our<00:00:15.750> deep<00:00:16.020> pass<00:00:16.289> quick<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.710> table

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
FL drive is our deep pass quick a table

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.269 
FL drive is our deep pass quick a table
in<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:17.910> formation<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.750> single<00:00:19.080> back<00:00:19.279> bunch

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
in this formation the single back bunch

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.910 
in this formation the single back bunch
and<00:00:20.779> you<00:00:21.779> know<00:00:21.900> it's<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.380> really<00:00:22.619> effective

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
and you know it's a really effective

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.220 
and you know it's a really effective
play<00:00:23.310> especially<00:00:23.699> against<00:00:24.359> man<00:00:24.570> defense<00:00:25.050> but

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
play especially against man defense but

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.589 
play especially against man defense but
also<00:00:25.410> getting<00:00:25.769> zone<00:00:26.070> one<00:00:26.939> thing<00:00:27.119> i<00:00:27.180> like<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.359> do

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
also getting zone one thing i like to do

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.929 
also getting zone one thing i like to do
again<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.500> slant<00:00:28.830> outside<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.400> outside<00:00:29.730> live

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
again is slant outside that outside live

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.330 
again is slant outside that outside live
receiver<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.650> again<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.859> running<00:00:32.189> back

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
receiver and again that running back

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.860 
receiver and again that running back
route<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.790> really<00:00:33.210> just<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.600> suck<00:00:33.840> him

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
route is really just going to suck him

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.380 
route is really just going to suck him
in<00:00:34.079> now<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:35.130> deep<00:00:35.399> tendon<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.210> that

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
in now that deep tendon in that that

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.470 
in now that deep tendon in that that
inside<00:00:37.140> receivers<00:00:37.620> on<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.890> middle<00:00:38.100> receiver

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
inside receivers on the middle receiver

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.360 
inside receivers on the middle receiver
we<00:00:39.480> can<00:00:39.629> hit<00:00:39.780> him<00:00:39.989> for<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.230> quick<00:00:40.469> pass<00:00:40.680> or<00:00:40.950> often

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
we can hit him for a quick pass or often

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.340 
we can hit him for a quick pass or often
you<00:00:41.640> know<00:00:41.760> just<00:00:42.030> hit<00:00:42.510> him<00:00:42.690> up<00:00:42.870> because<00:00:43.020> he's

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
you know just hit him up because he's

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.650 
you know just hit him up because he's
right<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.739> between<00:00:43.860> those<00:00:44.250> zones<00:00:44.489> now<00:00:45.420> again

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
right in between those zones now again

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.360 
right in between those zones now again
that<00:00:45.840> angle<00:00:46.230> route<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.620> also<00:00:47.039> really<00:00:47.250> good

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
that angle route is also really good

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.190 
that angle route is also really good
against<00:00:47.730> man<00:00:47.940> deep<00:00:48.149> into<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.570> ghans<00:00:48.750> own<00:00:48.960> it

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
against man deep into the ghans own it

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.139 
against man deep into the ghans own it
often<00:00:49.530> gets<00:00:49.649> underneath<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.340> zones<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.879> you

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
often gets underneath the zones and you

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.510 
often gets underneath the zones and you
can<00:00:51.300> hit<00:00:51.480> him<00:00:51.629> up<00:00:51.870> now<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.500> wide<00:00:53.160> receiver<00:00:53.430> on

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
can hit him up now the wide receiver on

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.010 
can hit him up now the wide receiver on
the<00:00:53.610> left<00:00:53.820> side<00:00:54.000> he's<00:00:54.270> right<00:00:54.539> kind<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
the left side he's right kind of in the

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.860 
the left side he's right kind of in the
seam<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.350> zomo<00:00:56.039> zones<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.940> we<00:00:57.059> can<00:00:57.239> hit<00:00:57.390> him<00:00:57.600> for

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
seam of zomo zones so we can hit him for

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.020 
seam of zomo zones so we can hit him for
a<00:00:57.899> nice<00:00:58.109> face<00:00:58.410> throw<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.980> or<00:00:59.550> spect<00:00:59.850> catch

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
a nice face throw and or spect catch

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.150 
a nice face throw and or spect catch
animation<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.410> course<00:01:01.440> if<00:01:01.829> they<00:01:01.949> leave

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
animation and of course if they leave

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.250 
animation and of course if they leave
the<00:01:02.309> running<00:01:02.609> back<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.510> that's<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.809> man<00:01:04.049> or

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
the running back and that's a man or

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.640 
the running back and that's a man or
zone<00:01:04.290> we<00:01:05.100> can<00:01:05.220> go<00:01:05.369> ahead<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.580> hit<00:01:05.850> him<00:01:06.090> up<00:01:06.650> now

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
zone we can go ahead and hit him up now

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.830 
zone we can go ahead and hit him up now
against<00:01:08.490> man<00:01:08.760> defense<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.330> where<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:09.600> play

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
against man defense is where this play

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.539 
against man defense is where this play
is<00:01:09.900> really<00:01:10.409> effective<00:01:10.830> because<00:01:10.979> we<00:01:11.340> can

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
is really effective because we can

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.340 
is really effective because we can
create<00:01:11.760> all<00:01:12.000> sorts<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.600> man<00:01:12.780> switches<00:01:13.229> from

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
create all sorts of man switches from

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.950 
create all sorts of man switches from
this<00:01:13.530> formation<00:01:13.860> um<00:01:14.390> first<00:01:15.390> off<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.750> want<00:01:15.930> to

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
this formation um first off I want to

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.109 
this formation um first off I want to
note<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.320> wide<00:01:16.650> receiver<00:01:17.040> if<00:01:17.520> we<00:01:17.820> slant

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
note that this wide receiver if we slant

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.120 
note that this wide receiver if we slant
out<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.479> inside<00:01:19.259> tied<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.740> instead<00:01:20.070> of

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
out that inside tied in instead of

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.969 
out that inside tied in instead of
having<00:01:20.369> him<00:01:20.610> on<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.790> angle<00:01:20.939> route<00:01:21.240> is

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
having him on the angle route is

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.080 
having him on the angle route is
basically<00:01:22.979> heuliez<00:01:23.310> guarded<00:01:23.700> by<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:23.970> we're

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
basically heuliez guarded by and we're

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.749 
basically heuliez guarded by and we're
in<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.210> quarter<00:01:24.509> formation<00:01:24.990> right<00:01:25.110> now<00:01:25.290> so

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
in a quarter formation right now so

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.660 
in a quarter formation right now so
imagine<00:01:26.759> another<00:01:26.939> formation<00:01:27.330> um<00:01:27.659> but<00:01:27.990> uh

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
imagine another formation um but uh

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.010 
imagine another formation um but uh
basically<00:01:29.670> he's<00:01:29.909> going<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.210> tear<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.570> up<00:01:30.630> now

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
basically he's going to tear that up now

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.170 
basically he's going to tear that up now
right<00:01:31.380> here<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:31.920> another<00:01:32.310> man<00:01:32.670> switch<00:01:33.000> that

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
right here is another man switch that

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.819 
right here is another man switch that
i'm<00:01:33.299> going<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.479> show<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.659> if<00:01:33.960> we<00:01:34.380> leave<00:01:34.650> the

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
i'm going to show you if we leave the

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.649 
i'm going to show you if we leave the
tight<00:01:35.040> end<00:01:35.220> on<00:01:35.310> an<00:01:35.400> angle<00:01:35.700> route<00:01:35.850> basically

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
tight end on an angle route basically

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.450 
tight end on an angle route basically
the<00:01:37.110> running<00:01:37.500> back<00:01:37.680> has<00:01:37.860> left<00:01:38.130> unattended

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
the running back has left unattended

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.219 
the running back has left unattended
because<00:01:38.909> he<00:01:39.270> has<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.479> be<00:01:39.750> guarded<00:01:40.079> by<00:01:40.170> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
because he has to be guarded by the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.749 
because he has to be guarded by the
corner<00:01:40.500> on<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.770> left<00:01:40.799> side<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.280> field<00:01:41.490> as

corner on the left side of the field as

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.870 
corner on the left side of the field as
you<00:01:42.180> can<00:01:42.299> see<00:01:42.479> here<00:01:42.780> um<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.829> either<00:01:44.130> way<00:01:44.430> either

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
you can see here um so either way either

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.370 
you can see here um so either way either
you're<00:01:45.180> running<00:01:45.479> back<00:01:45.630> or<00:01:45.840> your<00:01:46.110> tight<00:01:46.350> end

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
you're running back or your tight end

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.929 
you're running back or your tight end
depending<00:01:46.829> on<00:01:47.070> if<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.310> slam<00:01:47.549> them<00:01:47.729> out<00:01:47.820> or

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
depending on if you slam them out or

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.090 
depending on if you slam them out or
leave<00:01:48.090> him<00:01:48.119> on<00:01:48.420> his<00:01:48.450> angle<00:01:48.899> route<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.290> going<00:01:50.009> to

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
leave him on his angle route is going to

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.830 
leave him on his angle route is going to
be<00:01:50.220> left<00:01:50.430> unguarded<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.420> right<00:01:51.570> side<00:01:51.810> of

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
be left unguarded on the right side of

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.149 
be left unguarded on the right side of
the<00:01:51.960> field<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.619> going<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.799> force<00:01:53.009> our

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
the field so this is going to force our

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.139 
the field so this is going to force our
opponents<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.549> either<00:01:53.640> probably<00:01:54.000> put<00:01:54.119> a

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
opponents to either probably put a

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.060 
opponents to either probably put a
purple<00:01:54.509> out<00:01:54.630> there<00:01:54.869> or<00:01:55.110> flat<00:01:55.649> zone<00:01:55.890> or

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
purple out there or flat zone or

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.380 
purple out there or flat zone or
something<00:01:56.100> out<00:01:56.399> there<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:57.030> that's<00:01:57.210> going<00:01:57.329> to

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
something out there and that's going to

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.999 
something out there and that's going to
take<00:01:57.540> one<00:01:57.600> defender<00:01:58.350> away<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.710> could<00:01:58.890> be

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
take one defender away that could be

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.080 
take one defender away that could be
blitzing<00:01:59.369> they're<00:01:59.460> doing<00:01:59.670> something<00:01:59.880> else

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
blitzing they're doing something else

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.800 
blitzing they're doing something else
and<00:02:00.360> then<00:02:01.460> once<00:02:02.460> they<00:02:02.610> start<00:02:02.909> doing<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.329> we

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
and then once they start doing that we

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.709 
and then once they start doing that we
have<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.170> angle<00:02:04.320> route<00:02:04.649> coming<00:02:04.920> back<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:06.060> you

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
have the angle route coming back so you

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:07.999 
have the angle route coming back so you
know<00:02:06.840> that's<00:02:07.079> something<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.469> you<00:02:07.770> have<00:02:07.979> to

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
know that's something that you have to

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.559 
know that's something that you have to
have<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.310> zone<00:02:08.580> on<00:02:08.759> as<00:02:08.879> well<00:02:09.030> because<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.450> angle

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
have a zone on as well because the angle

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.479 
have a zone on as well because the angle
route<00:02:09.840> destroys<00:02:10.170> man<00:02:10.440> every<00:02:10.860> single<00:02:11.009> time<00:02:11.160> and

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
route destroys man every single time and

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.700 
route destroys man every single time and
then<00:02:12.239> of<00:02:12.420> course<00:02:12.690> we<00:02:12.840> have<00:02:12.959> our<00:02:12.989> streaks

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
then of course we have our streaks

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.580 
then of course we have our streaks
the<00:02:13.830> same<00:02:14.630> another<00:02:15.630> thing<00:02:15.840> we<00:02:15.870> can<00:02:16.140> do<00:02:16.230> is<00:02:16.260> let

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
the same another thing we can do is let

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.290 
the same another thing we can do is let
