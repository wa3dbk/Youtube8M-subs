00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.630
 director of nothing 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.790
 a very uncomfortable position and I have 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:51.770
 wrong to press the ho key 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:58.150

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:58.150

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:56.430

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.640
 Mamma Mia 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.880
 sorry I 'm beginning palate but I was 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.380
 really tense because the keyboard is there 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.270
 also wants the microphone because there is a 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.550
 belly-only keyboard microphone 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:13.720
 yes you do not imagine how I am 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:16.510
 recording tonight and then I'll have to 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.660
 keep everything in balance as well 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.180
 keyboard with microphone 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.930
 I have to do well and I have to watch the 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.580
 compass and I have to concentrate and I have to 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:32.710
 keep your breath to keep from falling 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:35.890
 microphone and do not speak softly but it is 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:41.650
 however let's focus on thun be 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:47.970
 oh God they fell I don't believe it 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.970

00:03:50.530 --> 00:04:03.569
 here it is, since I don't want to do it 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.569
 go up to get away 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:22.060
 here is that it starts shooting today used 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:32.100
 a bit too much after effects so obvious 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:32.100
 this kind of shit forest 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:47.110
 ok perfect we're all out of this one 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:49.670
 forest that I don't understand anything 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.700
 excellent who wants who wants who 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.970
 he wants to come out even if I'm not 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.970
 out 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:06.310
 shit and that i think is above no see 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:11.860
 I'm getting someone 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.860

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:31.180

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:41.689
 I read with super saiyan 4 ok it was closed 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:50.469
 for 6 to 1 4 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:54.080
 i was strong and goku perfect one on one 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:59.449
 let's pick it up from ciocci 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:02.120
 so I use sepa star tactics 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:05.180
 away from the opponent with the bow is the 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.490
 smartest thing though much if not mistaken 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:13.699
 and don't immediately change wide by putting the 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:15.349
 sword if the fried or you're fucked no 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:18.319
 we hope it's not high in this one 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:20.509
 map or what tall little hand I had made 

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:24.139
 once in a video but it was for pure 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:27.310
 because I could not do black psa and it is me 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:27.310
 happened to stay over 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:32.020
 who knows what they are doing this here 

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:38.919
 I have to look up and down this 

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:43.430
 the rip-off 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:45.649
 they also don't understand where I think that 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:48.339
 both at the bottom think of I think it follows the 

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:48.339
 rasi village 

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:54.189
 well village now even i 

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:54.189
 mushrooms 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:07:12.900
 ok ok now will do the agira in tactic 

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:12.900
 here it is worked 

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:27.480
 killed I risked and won five 

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.700
 cois a win however you have seen 

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.770
 almost risked dying between what he had 

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.300
 if I'm not mistaken he had the rock sword 

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:36.060
 sarroch ness 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:39.240
 that is, every cesar thing is enough for me you are 

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:41.550
 frigate calls four hearts removed or if 

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.800
 I remember well, however, you will see it 

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:49.740
 how much but removed but is still gone 

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:51.330

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.940

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:59.840
