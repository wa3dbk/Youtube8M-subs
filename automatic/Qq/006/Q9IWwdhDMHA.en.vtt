00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.520 
hopefully add some some more I don't
know<00:01:47.520> flavor<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.509> world<00:01:48.720> as<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.350> play

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
know flavor to the world as you play

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.810 
know flavor to the world as you play
through<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.070> think<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.640> biggest

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
through it I think the biggest

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.090 
through it I think the biggest
difference<00:01:51.200> that<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.500> can<00:01:52.649> see<00:01:52.799> right<00:01:52.979> away

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
difference that you can see right away

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.359 
difference that you can see right away
in<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.430> demo<00:01:53.759> between<00:01:54.329> Cortana<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.070> the

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
in the demo between Cortana and and the

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.830 
in the demo between Cortana and and the
ghost<00:01:56.549> is<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.600> ghost<00:01:57.810> has<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.700> physical

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
ghost is the the ghost has a physical

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
ghost is the the ghost has a physical
form<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.380> world

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
form in the world

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.860 
form in the world
and<00:02:02.010> to<00:02:02.670> saw<00:02:02.820> in<00:02:02.940> the<00:02:03.000> demo<00:02:03.270> as<00:02:03.420> he<00:02:03.510> goes<00:02:03.660> off

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
and to saw in the demo as he goes off

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.170 
and to saw in the demo as he goes off
and<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.350> turns<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.340> lights<00:02:05.520> on<00:02:05.700> in<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.970> space

and and turns the lights on in the space

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.999 
and and turns the lights on in the space
he's<00:02:06.420> actually<00:02:06.630> going<00:02:07.020> on<00:02:07.170> interacting<00:02:07.860> with

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
he's actually going on interacting with

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.370 
he's actually going on interacting with
the<00:02:08.160> world<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.700> Cortana<00:02:09.690> did<00:02:09.930> a<00:02:09.960> little<00:02:10.259> bit

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
the world and Cortana did a little bit

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.730 
the world and Cortana did a little bit
of<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.619> but<00:02:11.070> not<00:02:11.390> not<00:02:12.390> nearly<00:02:12.900> not<00:02:13.470> not

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
of that but not not nearly not not

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.230 
of that but not not nearly not not
nearly<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.130> same<00:02:14.340> as<00:02:14.400> far<00:02:14.730> as<00:02:14.820> having<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:15.090> real

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
nearly the same as far as having a real

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.850 
nearly the same as far as having a real
physical<00:02:15.660> form<00:02:15.840> of<00:02:15.960> presence<00:02:16.380> that<00:02:16.650> takes

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
physical form of presence that takes

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.740 
physical form of presence that takes
action<00:02:17.250> in<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.430> world<00:02:17.550> it's<00:02:18.120> highly<00:02:18.570> likely

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
action in the world it's highly likely

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.770 
action in the world it's highly likely
that<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.230> ghosts<00:02:19.560> will<00:02:19.710> be<00:02:20.630> customizable<00:02:21.630> by

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
that the ghosts will be customizable by

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.780 
that the ghosts will be customizable by
the<00:02:21.840> player<00:02:22.140> yes<00:02:22.500> yeah<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.610> gameplay

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
the player yes yeah and the gameplay

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.510 
the player yes yeah and the gameplay
demo<00:02:24.500> you<00:02:25.500> were<00:02:25.590> looking<00:02:25.890> primarily<00:02:26.070> at<00:02:26.370> the

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
demo you were looking primarily at the

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.220 
demo you were looking primarily at the
Fallen<00:02:27.270> I<00:02:27.360> think<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.600> was<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.810> house<00:02:27.960> of

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
Fallen I think it was the house of

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.140 
Fallen I think it was the house of
devils<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:29.490> Fallen<00:02:29.880> are<00:02:30.770> there<00:02:31.770> a<00:02:31.800> race<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:32.760> a

abilities he's on there as he's warping

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.620 
abilities he's on there as he's warping
and<00:04:40.890> doing<00:04:41.130> an<00:04:41.220> area<00:04:41.400> of<00:04:41.460> effect<00:04:41.580> attack<00:04:41.880> it's

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
and doing an area of effect attack it's

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.970 
and doing an area of effect attack it's
definitely<00:04:42.960> a<00:04:42.990> tougher<00:04:43.350> opponent<00:04:43.380> that's

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
definitely a tougher opponent that's

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.430 
definitely a tougher opponent that's
better<00:04:44.190> tackled<00:04:44.700> in<00:04:44.850> groups<00:04:45.390> it's<00:04:46.080> definitely

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
better tackled in groups it's definitely

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.530 
better tackled in groups it's definitely
fair<00:04:46.590> to<00:04:46.710> say<00:04:46.860> I<00:04:46.890> mean<00:04:47.250> the<00:04:47.280> revival<00:04:47.730> system<00:04:48.120> in

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
and certainly in that case it was a

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.240 
and certainly in that case it was a
great<00:05:48.870> example<00:05:49.110> of<00:05:49.410> a<00:05:49.500> weapon<00:05:49.860> that<00:05:50.040> had<00:05:50.220> a

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
pretty aggressive upgrade path there'll

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.940 
pretty aggressive upgrade path there'll
be<00:05:53.820> a<00:05:53.910> wide<00:05:54.150> range<00:05:54.450> it's<00:05:55.350> something<00:05:55.680> we'll<00:05:55.830> be

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950 
be a wide range it's something we'll be

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.340 
be a wide range it's something we'll be
tweaking<00:05:56.490> and<00:05:56.580> tuning<00:05:56.729> as<00:05:57.060> we<00:05:57.210> play<00:05:57.450> it<00:05:57.630> by<00:05:58.320> the

know that's not so the public event you

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.840 
know that's not so the public event you

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:38.850 
saw in the demo is a is something that's

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:40.880 
saw in the demo is a is something that's
gonna<00:06:39.090> be<00:06:39.240> a<00:06:39.300> typical<00:06:39.780> activity<00:06:40.080> to<00:06:40.350> happen<00:06:40.680> in

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:40.890 
gonna be a typical activity to happen in

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:43.160 
gonna be a typical activity to happen in
what<00:06:41.730> we<00:06:41.820> call<00:06:41.970> public<00:06:42.300> spaces<00:06:42.540> which<00:06:42.870> is<00:06:43.020> sort

what we call public spaces which is sort

what we call public spaces which is sort

I<00:06:44.580> guess<00:06:44.630> public<00:06:45.630> events<00:06:45.870> are<00:06:45.960> optional<00:06:46.520> as
