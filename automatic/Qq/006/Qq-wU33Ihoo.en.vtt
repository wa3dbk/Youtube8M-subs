that hard to pull rock oh this is the

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.109 
that hard to pull rock oh this is the
best<00:00:27.480> zinger<00:00:28.169> look<00:00:28.559> enough<00:00:29.399> tension<00:00:29.669> just<00:00:29.820> so

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
best zinger look enough tension just so

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.560 
best zinger look enough tension just so
that<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.509> drops<00:00:30.750> right<00:00:31.590> on<00:00:31.800> yeah<00:00:32.790> just<00:00:33.510> a

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
that it drops right on yeah just a

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.630 
that it drops right on yeah just a
little<00:00:33.660> bit<00:00:33.809> but<00:00:34.590> yeah<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.860> was<00:00:35.220> just<00:00:35.340> telling

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
little bit but yeah I was just telling

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.420 
little bit but yeah I was just telling
wrong<00:00:36.050> that<00:00:37.050> it's<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.130> one<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.340> the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
wrong that it's it this is one of the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.510 
wrong that it's it this is one of the
first<00:00:38.670> models<00:00:38.940> it's<00:00:39.980> the<00:00:40.980> new<00:00:41.100> ones<00:00:41.340> are

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
first models it's the new ones are

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.420 
first models it's the new ones are
powder<00:00:41.850> coated<00:00:42.000> but<00:00:42.680> it<00:00:43.680> sure<00:00:43.860> saves<00:00:44.070> on<00:00:44.310> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
powder coated but it sure saves on the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.040 
powder coated but it sure saves on the
arms

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
arms

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.010 
arms
you<00:00:46.380> just<00:00:46.500> have<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.740> have<00:00:46.860> enough<00:00:47.070> tension<00:00:47.280> to

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
you just have to have enough tension to

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.620 
you just have to have enough tension to
just<00:00:49.020> like<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.260> rope<00:00:50.160> on<00:00:50.310> the<00:00:50.430> spool<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.760> up

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:51.630 
just like the rope on the spool and up

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:58.299 
just like the rope on the spool and up
straight<00:00:52.020> up<00:00:52.170> right<00:00:53.100> on

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.310 

so<00:00:58.850> how<00:00:59.030> deep<00:00:59.239> how<00:00:59.539> deep<00:00:59.570> you<00:00:59.870> figure<00:01:00.140> you're

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
so how deep how deep you figure you're

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.729 
so how deep how deep you figure you're
got<00:01:00.980> them<00:01:01.100> down<00:01:01.250> here<00:01:01.550> probably<00:01:02.300> 15<00:01:02.629> 60<00:01:02.930> 50<00:01:03.410> 60

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
got them down here probably 15 60 50 60

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.960 
got them down here probably 15 60 50 60
feet<00:01:03.920> in<00:01:04.479> but<00:01:05.479> this<00:01:06.260> is<00:01:06.409> lead<00:01:06.619> line<00:01:06.920> I<00:01:07.220> believe

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
feet in but this is lead line I believe

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.050 
feet in but this is lead line I believe
Daniel<00:01:08.270> connects<00:01:08.690> to<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:08.930> lead<00:01:09.110> core<00:01:09.350> line<00:01:10.060> so

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
Daniel connects to the lead core line so

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.550 
Daniel connects to the lead core line so
that<00:01:11.360> you<00:01:11.570> don't<00:01:11.780> need<00:01:11.840> to<00:01:12.080> put<00:01:12.229> a<00:01:12.259> weight<00:01:12.530> on

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
that you don't need to put a weight on

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.320 
that you don't need to put a weight on
keep<00:01:13.040> your<00:01:13.070> ropes<00:01:13.340> with<00:01:13.549> rope<00:01:13.820> feet<00:01:14.060> up<00:01:14.210> and

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
keep your ropes with rope feet up and

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.109 
keep your ropes with rope feet up and
down<00:01:14.479> so<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:15.560> the<00:01:15.920> ropes<00:01:16.130> not<00:01:16.310> a<00:01:16.369> navigational

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
down so the the ropes not a navigational

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.290 
down so the the ropes not a navigational
hazard<00:01:17.390> for<00:01:17.540> other<00:01:17.659> boats

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
hazard for other boats

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.300 
hazard for other boats
we've<00:01:20.300> only<00:01:20.420> had<00:01:20.570> them<00:01:20.780> down<00:01:20.930> for<00:01:21.170> a<00:01:21.590> short<00:01:22.040> set

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
we've only had them down for a short set

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.550 
we've only had them down for a short set
but<00:01:22.630> looks<00:01:23.630> like<00:01:23.720> there's<00:01:24.049> going<00:01:24.200> to<00:01:24.259> be<00:01:24.320> some

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560
