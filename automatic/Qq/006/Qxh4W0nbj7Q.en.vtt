00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.970
 ours is a great project in which 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.850
 we wanted to convey ours 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.940
 research on the subject of course 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.850
 modernity, however, seen through this 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.239
 extraordinary lens that the report has 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.420
 between painting, theater and writing 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.370
 theatrical is a truly unpublished exhibition by 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.220
 this view that crosses a 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.820
 100 years of history of losing something 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:14.170
 more because it pushes back a little 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:18.509
 towards the beginning of the neoclassical era 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:21.930
 then, with david, romanticism flows 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.520
 comes to naturalism to Impressionism 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.460
 passes through symbolism and that 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.710
 naturally it ends because it begins 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.100
 another story is over history 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.100
 nineteenth 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.780
 here we say that in this sense the 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:46.040
 show sees everything but proposes a newness 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:50.300
 reading this unpublished reading tells us 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.670
 that between the arts and it is this one on 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.940
 which the works of the 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.360

 to finish in stone these artists 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.140
 worked in this direction 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:15.650
 to invent a new virtuoso in 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.590
