00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
that and then this it smells a lot like

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.110 
that and then this it smells a lot like
my<00:02:19.440> mom<00:02:19.620> does<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.310> I'm<00:02:20.550> probably<00:02:20.670> going<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.060> be

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
my mom does so I'm probably going to be

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.790 
my mom does so I'm probably going to be
using<00:02:21.270> it<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:21.630> much<00:02:21.840> because<00:02:22.110> it's<00:02:22.440> like<00:02:22.560> her

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
using it that much because it's like her

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.280 
using it that much because it's like her
scent<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.850> I<00:02:23.940> hate<00:02:24.150> stealing<00:02:24.690> people's<00:02:25.020> sense

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
scent and I hate stealing people's sense

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.670 
scent and I hate stealing people's sense
but<00:02:25.760> it<00:02:26.760> was<00:02:26.880> 1050<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:27.870> she<00:02:27.990> bought<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.200> for<00:02:28.500> me

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
but it was 1050 and she bought it for me

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.590 
but it was 1050 and she bought it for me
so<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.010> guess<00:02:29.310> I'll<00:02:29.490> use<00:02:29.700> it<00:02:29.730> once<00:02:30.240> in<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.450> while

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
so I guess I'll use it once in a while

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.750 
so I guess I'll use it once in a while
like<00:02:30.930> after<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.320> shower<00:02:31.560> on<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.130> weekends<00:02:32.640> and

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.210 
like after a shower on the weekends and
stuff<00:02:33.170> but<00:02:34.170> I<00:02:34.260> just<00:02:34.440> don't<00:02:34.650> want<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:34.950> smell

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
stuff but I just don't want to smell

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.150 
stuff but I just don't want to smell
like<00:02:35.280> this<00:02:35.670> for<00:02:35.910> some<00:02:36.090> reason<00:02:36.980> but<00:02:37.980> it's

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
like this for some reason but it's

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.460 
like this for some reason but it's
japanese<00:02:38.700> cherry<00:02:39.060> blossom<00:02:39.240> and<00:02:39.990> it's<00:02:40.260> just<00:02:40.380> a

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
japanese cherry blossom and it's just a

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.110 
japanese cherry blossom and it's just a
hand<00:02:40.680> lotion<00:02:41.130> so<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.520> doesn't<00:02:41.790> really<00:02:41.850> matter

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
hand lotion so it doesn't really matter

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.790 
hand lotion so it doesn't really matter
it's<00:02:42.420> not<00:02:42.510> like<00:02:42.720> I'm<00:02:42.900> all<00:02:43.260> going<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.620> smell
