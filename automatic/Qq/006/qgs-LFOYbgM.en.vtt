00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.279
 new front that has come to the market 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:19.970
 the wild the speed elec a frontal 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:23.359

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:27.410

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:29.050
 see with a support to be able to hook 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.180
 on the bicycle handlebars 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:36.829
 easily with a small lamp that 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:39.320
 It gives us 90 meters away easily 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.930
 removable to adapt the different 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.019
 pieces with which the kit comes 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:50.649
 adapt it for example to this kind of 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:50.649
 adhesive support to put on helmets 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:58.460

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.320
 put on tape also helmet and 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.400
 finally one of the ones that we use the most 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.550
 those who are going to run the banners a 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.340
 Easily support to put on the 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:14.310
 elastic tape with latex so that it does not 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.530
 move us very easy to place 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.740
 with a technical detail 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.480
 to keep the cable that makes 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.090
 well placed 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:29.300
 and when we have this tape mounted 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.380
 we can plug in the lamp 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.920
 to the battery 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.380
 It lasts 12 hours 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.780
 and to not load cervical we can 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.600
 place the battery in what would be the 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.659
 vest pants what could be the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.590
 backpack that you have assembled we can 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.899
 decide if we want to put the flask on 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.490
