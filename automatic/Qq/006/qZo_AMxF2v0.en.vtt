our cleaning this when we saw this spot

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.499 
our cleaning this when we saw this spot
on<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.409> bathroom<00:01:37.950> wall<00:01:38.220> we<00:01:38.490> had<00:01:38.670> Carolina<00:01:39.240> put

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
on a bathroom wall we had Carolina put

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.630 
on a bathroom wall we had Carolina put
it<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.869> test<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.920> wiped<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.340> spot

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
it to the test and it wiped the spot

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.179 
it to the test and it wiped the spot
right<00:01:41.909> off<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.869> what's<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.409> drawback<00:01:43.920> and

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
right off so what's the drawback and

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.700 
right off so what's the drawback and
that's<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.640> would<00:01:44.700> be<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:45.180> shelf-life

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
that's that would be the shelf-life

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.080 
that's that would be the shelf-life
because<00:01:46.710> it's<00:01:47.040> not<00:01:47.280> something<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.939> can

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
because it's not something that you can

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.200 
because it's not something that you can
