00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
 good 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.760
 hello friends from the tonic garden today 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.100
 you have me here in a new series of 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.370
 videos that I will try to do about 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:20.310
 how to get the seeds out of our 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.890
 plants to get our 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.560
 own seeds the importance of 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.130
 get our own seeds is 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.040
 fundamentally for improving or 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.980
 adapting the plants to our garden 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.200
 our climate and thereby improve the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.059
 productivity us for example the 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.570
 last year, good, we've been several years 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.570
 sowing 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.320
 pilgrim pumpkins we have here 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.350
 three clear examples of pumpkin 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.750
 pilgrim of different sizes that his 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.590
 brought for you to see 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.900
 obviously the seed is going to 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.180
 get the best fruit that is of 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.500
 here in the middle is simply the 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.880
 has brought today taught for the 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.560
 see 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.620
 I personally love the 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.300
 pilgrim pumpkins because they are very 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.100
 decorative and good since we are in the 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.440
 camino de santiago well that better 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.960
 way to pay tribute by planting 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.300
 these pumpkins then this I give them to 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.090
 my mother to decorate them paint them 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.120
 and they look pretty in this case in the 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.340
 case of the pilgrim pumpkins for 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.310
 take out the seed is very simple you have to 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.930
 leave the pumpkin on the plant until 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.000
 end of the harvest more or less about 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.930
 September the plant starts to dry and 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.270
 already cold in the first cold 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.820
 and we are seeing the ripe fruits 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.590
 then we leave them at the plant and 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.460
 then when it is drying and the 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:48.970
 We cut and store them in a place that 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.190
 So, do not let the sun shine on you. 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.470
 give light and that is ventilated that does not 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.680
 have moisture is also important for 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.360
 that fungi do not flourish and there 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.610
 have to wait a few months i for example 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.220
 is the collection in October and now 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.810
 We are in March I will take out the seed 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.340
 because I'm going to start planting the 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.340
 let's see how to get the seed 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.250
 and in another video we'll see how we do the 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.950
 seedbed to plant our own 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.370
 pilgrim pumpkin seeds in this 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.730
 case we have chosen the best pumpkin 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.670
 where we want to go this year 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.709
 similar fruits and then we're going to 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.980
 open us as we want to keep it 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.260
 to paint it and decorate it, we're going to have 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.870
 very careful to open it 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.700
 if it was not like that, hit the 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.530
 end ends leaving 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.209
 I'm going to take it out here because it's going 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.780
 to try to make it a jar to see the 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.060
 Water 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.870
 then like a knife or something 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:52.150
 sharp we are trying to penetrate 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.150
 in the pumpkin with care 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.840
 and it would be open 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.860
 we could pumpkin and go out 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.489
 and these would be the seeds of 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.010
 pumpkin we've got these 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.870
 whites are the rest of what would be the 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.520
 pumpkin itself once we have pulled out 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.370
 the seeds what we do is put them 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.650
 in water to clean them well then 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.170
 we put them in water 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.200
 we have a while to then go washing 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.510
 the 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.550
 once spent a while in water what 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.950
 we do is go rubbing the so that 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.170
 they are losing all the rest of lime 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.540
 down we also discard the seeds 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.190
 that are unformed there are some once 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.610
 that we have been cleaning them, let's go 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.910
 taking out the giving them one last review and 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:44.819
 We are putting them on something that is 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:48.450
 absorbent type a rag the paper is not 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:50.760
 good idea because it stays stuck let's go 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.900
 removing the ones we see that are not worth 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.900
 let's dry for a while in the sun 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.420
 once the seed is dry 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.820
 we should stay like that from the seeds 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.000
 that we have removed we will select 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:11.420
 a few about 10 12 15 and we're going to 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.670
 prove his germinative power is to say 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.800
 do not risk putting them in the nursery 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.829
 let's not leave any, let's check 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.200
 if they finish well before saving them there 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.540
 to check that they finish for it 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.180
 let's use a very simple method that 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.840
 is to put them in a napkin a tupper 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:32.200
 or an albal paper and we place the 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.200
 seeds 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.110
 so we're going to cover it with a napkin 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.180
 and we're going to moisten them and we're going to 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.580
 leave inside a place where there 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.410
 heat on top of there are people who put it 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.870
 on top of the router on top of the TV in 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:49.940
 a site that has a source of heat for 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.940
 so that it ends as soon as we would vote 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.330
 once covered we deserve it well 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:01.620
 it's just moistening this is done because 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:03.240
 wet the pumpkin that we have then it has not 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.090
 seeds went well did not come 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.230
 well and it does not help us then before 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.590
 save it you have to check 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:13.540
 if the seed germinates or the percentage of 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.850
 germination that you simply have with 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.800
 see if you have root or not or if it starts 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:21.790
 leave the root and we would be worth it until 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.140
 here comes the video I will not continue to 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.060
 see if they have germinated or not because that 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.250
 good everyone to try it with her 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.840
 own pumpkins but this is a bit 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.530
 the general idea to get the 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.880
 pumpkin seeds to Berlin 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.880
 we have since dried the 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.950
 we have to save everything depending on 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.360
 see if they end or it will not be a 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.740
 new series of videos that I'm going to make 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.290
 which I find quite interesting for 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.840
 people who do not know how to get their 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.670
 seeds I will try to make videos about 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.470
 the whole process and so we're getting 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:53.260
 our own seeds we forget 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:56.080
 to buy we forgot to have 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.730
 genetically modified seeds we 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.150
 We forget to have seeds that are not 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.830
 ecological 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.810
 all this kind of soft stuff 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.610
 of greater satisfaction that you see using 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.350
 our seeds year after year and you 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.730
 I will show other videos on how to get out 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:14.390
 from seeds to other plants later 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.390
 until the next video
