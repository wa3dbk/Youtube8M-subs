00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.650
 Yes 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.180
 hello everybody knows 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.880
 morals and welcome to this new 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.960
 gameplay so first of all I'm great 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.970
 glad to comment on its gameplay 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.330
 because for me the tests of the bac is 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.340
 finished I do not have to overhaul this is it 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.879
 a weight less is the holidays I 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.650
 can relax me so I'm going to you 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.170
 present may have its gameplay so 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.000
 we are in a loaded ball on call 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.760
 of duty black ops from the last of the 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.320
 license so you'll see that it's 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.300
 of this ball charge this part of a 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.239
 loaded ball will go pretty well 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.839
 for me with a good ratio to the key jmm 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.910
 diarra m 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:11.590
 very good reassures with the key especially for 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:14.410
 a nice load and so it's a fashion 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.000
 of play that for me really is not 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.470
 at all shown on the chains 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.540
 community and it's really very 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.880
 a shame because it's a game mode that 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.030
 very pleasant and very tactical especially 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.619
 when we stay in one against one so he 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.420
 must manage his movements and 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.130
 you must not miss the ball 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.119
 is otherwise it's one against one at 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.369
 knife so if you see lags or 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.860
 knives that passes so I'm not 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:42.250
 sure their serves that's normal I'm in 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.200
 the studio mode and the studio word is a 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.450
 little weird about videos but I 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.819
 do not go in there 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.190
 so here I would just like to put in 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:55.119
 place a debate in the comments 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.860
 valliÃ¨res there is a difference so 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.649
 first of all the 3 is over since a 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.450
 little moment and that she is the console 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.720
 next gen who convinced you the most 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.899
 which disappointed you simply on 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.580
 what advice are you not surprised 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.220
 these new functionalities 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.230
 safe or you do not have comment 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.540
 So here is what you expect 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.470
 buy a next gen console 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.730
 yes right out or one in a year after 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.160
 when the sinkers makes a little down 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.480
 that there will be more exclusivity that's it 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.250
 you have to put a comment 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.720
 so the general scrum is over so 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.630
 here I am ending on a score of 12 1 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.190
 part of a trunk loads is very 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.580
 quick 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.989
 so here I hope you answer 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.350
 in the comments 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.970

 perfect in general scrum 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.350
