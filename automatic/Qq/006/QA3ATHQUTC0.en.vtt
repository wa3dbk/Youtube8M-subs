 Two paints on a brush. Author: Irina Lyamshina. 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.680
 Hello. My name is Irina Lyamshina. 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.200
 And I am glad to welcome you on my channel called irishkalia. 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:26.000
 Today I would like to talk with you about the techniques of painting, which use two colors on the brush. 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.660
 I will use a few brushes to show what techniques are. 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.320
 The first is a Chinese goat hair tassel. 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:52.280
 The next one is a synthetic flat with a rounded oval top. 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:01.280
 The next brush is also flat synthetics of a rectangular shape. 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:13.960
 Flat synthetic. The peculiarity of her is that she has a trapezoidal shape. 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:23.000
 This flat brush is made from a hair column. It has a dome shape. 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.500
 Next - round columns. 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.800
 So let's get started. 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.140
 The brush has a flat shape, rounded at the edges. 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:53.600
 Due to the fact that it is so oval, you can make such strokes. 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:11.060
 This part turns out to be rounded precisely because the brush has an oval shape. 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:31.260
 On one side we collect blue paint, and on the other - white. Those. not on the edge of the brush, but on the sides. 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.940
 One plane is white, and the other is blue. 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:03:04.560
 And such a smear. It turns striped: white stripes mixed with blue. 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.500
 Veins well imitate flower petals. 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:32.980
 You can see my video where I use this brush. 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:44.720
 I paint the box in it. I also have a video where I talk about how I do a smear. 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.400
 Here I just show. 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.620
 You can draw a plane and edge. 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.320
 I really like it. 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:13.380
 It combines both the properties of a flat brush and a round one. 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.100
 With the help of it you can make a double smear, droplets. 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.000
 Before us is a regular flat rectangular tassel. 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:50.620
 It is universal and it can make transitions. 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:07.100
 Convenient to draw stripes and other strokes. Twist. 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:39.140
 Universal brush for double stroke. 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.360
 The next flat brush is cut at an angle. 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:51.680
 She is very comfortable to draw leaves. 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:55.200
 Such a brush is convenient to do such turns at the expense of the bevel. 

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:14.360
 We take a round brush and type green on it - the main color. 

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:20.120
 Now at the very tip we type white. 

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.940
 And do a smear. 

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:48.040
 These are the strokes we get. 

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:54.280
 To be continued.
