and I think I called up this here so it

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.780

like<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.650> first<00:02:46.860> twenty<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:47.400> think<00:02:47.730> we<00:02:47.820> played

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
like the first twenty I think we played

like the first twenty I think we played
a<00:02:48.090> who<00:02:48.900> played<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.230> game<00:02:49.380> we<00:02:49.709> we<00:02:50.190> have<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.459> play

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
and it was it was pretty good but then

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.670 
and it was it was pretty good but then
second<00:02:53.430> period<00:02:53.870> wasn't<00:02:54.870> much<00:02:55.110> food<00:02:55.320> I'm<00:02:55.500> now

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
second period wasn't much food I'm now

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.479 
second period wasn't much food I'm now
the<00:02:56.030> third<00:02:57.030> one<00:02:57.209> wasn't<00:02:58.019> one<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.560> way<00:02:58.709> we<00:02:58.920> want

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
the third one wasn't one the way we want

offensive man as you head into the

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.780

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
better like last six five games we

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.520 
better like last six five games we
haven't<00:03:17.550> played<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.790> way<00:03:17.880> we<00:03:18.120> we<00:03:18.750> can<00:03:18.960> play<00:03:19.230> so

we executed tonight there's times we

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.750 
we executed tonight there's times we
didn't<00:04:07.590> execute<00:04:07.860> way<00:04:08.130> enough<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:08.549> we're<00:04:08.670> just

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
didn't execute way enough and we're just

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.039

gonna<00:04:08.880> have<00:04:09.090> to<00:04:09.120> execute<00:04:09.540> a<00:04:09.750> little<00:04:09.930> bit

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
gonna have to execute a little bit

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.320 
gonna have to execute a little bit
better<00:04:10.200> Jeff<00:04:10.950> you<00:04:11.070> scored<00:04:11.340> six<00:04:11.880> goals<00:04:11.940> in<00:04:12.269> the

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
first game of the month I think he just

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.159 
first game of the month I think he just
scored<00:04:14.760> your<00:04:15.000> sixth<00:04:15.390> for<00:04:15.690> the<00:04:15.750> rest<00:04:15.959> of<00:04:16.109> the

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
bump I mean I asked team with the same

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.759 
bump I mean I asked team with the same
question<00:04:18.510> are<00:04:18.930> you<00:04:19.049> a<00:04:19.080> little<00:04:19.229> nervous<00:04:19.470> about

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
question are you a little nervous about

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.039 
question are you a little nervous about
your<00:04:20.070> offensive<00:04:20.609> consistency<00:04:20.910> as<00:04:21.720> we<00:04:21.930> head

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
your offensive consistency as we head

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.810 
your offensive consistency as we head
into<00:04:22.080> the<00:04:22.290> next<00:04:22.410> season<00:04:22.650> you<00:04:23.100> know<00:04:23.220> I'm<00:04:23.669> not

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
into the next season you know I'm not

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.790 
into the next season you know I'm not
I'm<00:04:24.210> not<00:04:24.240> really<00:04:24.660> in<00:04:24.990> a<00:04:25.080> sense<00:04:25.290> I<00:04:25.440> mean<00:04:25.560> we<00:04:25.680> got

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
I'm not really in a sense I mean we got

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.770 
I'm not really in a sense I mean we got
to<00:04:25.890> score<00:04:26.040> more<00:04:26.220> than<00:04:26.370> that<00:04:26.550> for<00:04:26.820> sure<00:04:27.030> but<00:04:27.360> I

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
to score more than that for sure but I

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.260 
to score more than that for sure but I
see<00:04:28.560> guys<00:04:28.740> getting<00:04:28.950> chances<00:04:29.280> a<00:04:29.580> guy<00:04:29.880> like<00:04:30.090> team

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
see guys getting chances a guy like team

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.880 
see guys getting chances a guy like team
who<00:04:30.390> for<00:04:30.540> example<00:04:30.990> those<00:04:31.410> pucks<00:04:31.650> are<00:04:31.800> gonna

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
who for example those pucks are gonna

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.950 
who for example those pucks are gonna
start<00:04:32.250> going<00:04:32.550> in<00:04:32.669> for<00:04:32.910> more<00:04:33.180> he's<00:04:33.660> got<00:04:33.780> to<00:04:33.870> hit

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
start going in for more he's got to hit

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.510 
start going in for more he's got to hit
the<00:04:34.080> net<00:04:34.200> a<00:04:34.229> little<00:04:34.350> bit<00:04:34.590> more<00:04:34.770> I<00:04:34.979> think<00:04:35.190> our

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
the net a little bit more I think our

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.650 
the net a little bit more I think our
powerpoints<00:04:36.090> probably<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:36.479> biggest

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
powerpoints probably the biggest

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.330 
powerpoints probably the biggest
difference<00:04:36.900> between<00:04:37.290> the<00:04:37.800> amount<00:04:38.070> that<00:04:38.160> we

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
difference between the amount that we

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.460 
difference between the amount that we
scored<00:04:38.700> in<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:39.450> previous<00:04:39.840> games<00:04:40.080> two<00:04:40.290> moments

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
scored in the previous games two moments

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.810 
scored in the previous games two moments
ago<00:04:40.770> recently<00:04:40.979> report<00:04:41.400> for<00:04:41.490> it<00:04:41.550> hasn't<00:04:41.760> been

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
ago recently report for it hasn't been

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:42.950 
ago recently report for it hasn't been
good<00:04:41.970> enough<00:04:42.060> so<00:04:42.270> we're<00:04:42.390> gonna<00:04:42.510> get<00:04:42.660> our<00:04:42.780> power

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
good enough so we're gonna get our power

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.719 
good enough so we're gonna get our power
play<00:04:43.169> about<00:04:43.350> going<00:04:43.680> and<00:04:43.830> back<00:04:43.919> real<00:04:44.190> effective

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
play about going and back real effective

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:45.909 
play about going and back real effective
that's<00:04:44.850> probably<00:04:45.210> the<00:04:45.300> number<00:04:45.419> one<00:04:45.690> thing

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
that's probably the number one thing

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.320 
that's probably the number one thing
from<00:04:46.919> an<00:04:47.070> offensive<00:04:47.400> standpoint<00:04:47.760> that<00:04:48.120> we<00:04:48.210> got

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
from an offensive standpoint that we got

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.940 
from an offensive standpoint that we got
to<00:04:48.390> be<00:04:48.450> better<00:04:48.630> at<00:04:48.810> I<00:04:48.960> think<00:04:49.320> five<00:04:49.500> on<00:04:49.680> five

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
to be better at I think five on five

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.830 
to be better at I think five on five
that's<00:04:50.430> the<00:04:50.640> oven<00:04:50.910> flow<00:04:51.090> of<00:04:51.210> game<00:04:51.360> some<00:04:51.630> teams

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
that's the oven flow of game some teams

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.390 
that's the oven flow of game some teams
are<00:04:52.050> more<00:04:52.200> defensive<00:04:52.740> some<00:04:52.919> teams<00:04:53.130> are<00:04:53.280> more

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
are more defensive some teams are more

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.680 
are more defensive some teams are more
offensive

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
offensive

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
offensive
so<00:04:55.020> that'll<00:04:55.620> that<00:04:55.830> 11<00:04:56.160> flow<00:04:56.340> a<00:04:56.370> little<00:04:56.520> bit
