00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.280
 when we are artisanal fishermen already 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.780
 almost over 35 dances at first I 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.639
 always understand the idea of ​​forming a 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.639
 company with a family business 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:33.290
 but what productive travel expenses of the 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.989
 staff but do not have the support 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.330
 logistics that they should have for the 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.400
 Development in the attic city exists 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.680
 a problem that the fisherman does not 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:52.630
 receives a fair payment for the activity 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:52.630
 that develop these fishermen of love 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:59.320
 We are working on a joint project 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.399
 with the company rate with this project 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.750
 we seek to encourage development 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.830
 economic and social in the attic area 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.540
 benefiting one of our groups of 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.520
 major attractions such as 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.770
 fishermen because here in the 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:17.990
 Attic cutting there are four products 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:20.210
 viable that are seafood and parakeet boots 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.130
 ovas ovas of flying fez this we 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.229
 it serves as a job work plan 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.050
 pilot so that others see this 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.710
 time and they can follow it even though the 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.890
 fisherman change his mind what to do 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.320
 bad company is not contrary to 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.420
 company is good but you also have to 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.790
 receive enough training them 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.479
 with this they will improve their quality of 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.479
 lifetime 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.000
 we first develop a diagnosis that 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.790
 identifies a reality that the 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.860
 fishermen are 100% extractors of 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.290
 products but not marketers 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.780
 we are working directly and not as 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.239
 We are the collector 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.180
 we cater directly in 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.580
 the second stage we intervene 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.989
 through formalization and 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.450
 strengthening of their capabilities 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.120
 business is important because 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.400
 formalize already has aspirations to 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.400
 work with private companies 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.280
 we have avoided the intermediary 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.810
 and look for our direct buyers 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.510
 we know that we are governing the price 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.910
 real products no longer no longer 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.910
 we depend on nobody we are direct 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.980
 for us 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.450
 these are see 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.450
 and to all 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.710
 Y 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.940
 but we trust that we believe 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:24.390
 that is, it is generally good to walk to a 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.390
 fellow can trust him 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.510
 and where the tickets 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.680
 a plan of 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:37.210
 consortium marketing we're going to 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.760
 to have the interest or attention of 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:43.950
 major markets then the issue is that 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.100
 it is true where we establish 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.380
 and the objectives 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.740
 the one we 're always used to 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.420
 is local then we want to enter the 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.090
 major leagues and will see what it is 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.210
 different in opportunities for each 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.610
 only those who want to do it can 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.140
 that already depends on each one and that's what 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.180
 what are we doing? 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.760
 the consortium then we have seen viable 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.860
 the four companies join that 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.260
 way a fishing consortium has been made 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.310
 the consortium convenes nine 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.050
 boats 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.910
 these are holidays with all the 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.550
 structure and support that you already have 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.830
 organization can take orders to 

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:24.370
 exporters of great importance at the 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.370
 national 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:39.729
 what is important also in this project 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:42.370
 occupation is always down 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:45.039
 wives now we have a 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.900
 vision more towards the future no longer 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:50.169
 confessed if not as trained as 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.629
 company as a businessman someone at least 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:55.059
 that does not charge anything in this case 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:56.949
 it will simply give you advice gives you 

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:59.979
 the accompanying information in the 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:01.270
 process we are very grateful the way 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.629
 of my family's life has changed 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.629
 enormously 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:24.289
 once
