 Hello everyone, I am Colin from Gigabyte Technology. 

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:13.413
 Due to the work relationship, I often need to perform computer assembly or performance comparison. 

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:20.860
 If you have assembled a computer, you should have or often enter the BIOS to adjust the system settings. 

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:22.789
 However, the design of traditional BIOS is often very unfriendly. 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.393
 This situation also makes it difficult for users to change the BIOS settings. 

00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:32.665
 For such a situation. GIGABYTE has made some efforts to develop an easy-to-use tool that allows users to tune the BIOS. 

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:39.139
 Now on the machine in front of me, showcasing Gigabyte's latest technology, TouchBIOS. 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:48.248
 As you can see, there are many different logos on the screen, and each one represents a different BIOS function. 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.620
 TouchBIOS is fairly simple to use, you can use the mouse to control it; 10 00:00:53,620 --&gt; 00:00:59,726 But as its name "TouchBIOS" shows, if you happen to have a touch screen, you also You can use your fingers to manipulate it. 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.864
 As you can see, there are many different logos on the screen, and each one represents a BIOS function. 

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:10.704
 This one is an overclocking option; this option allows you to change your password. 

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:15.342
 TouchBIOS also allows you to call and open some of Gigabyte's exclusive tools. 

00:01:15.342 --> 00:01:18.578
 A logo like this allows you to start @BIOS to update the system BIOS. 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:29.220
 TouchBIOS also lets you... Monitor different system conditions, including system temperature and voltage, to give you an idea of ​​the current state of the system. 

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:36.296
 So, basically, our efforts are to make it as easy as possible for consumers to set the BIOS. 

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:41.301
 Next, let me quickly demonstrate the TouchBIOS interface and change the BIOS settings. 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.804
 I use this overclocking option as an example to illustrate. 19 00:01:45,71 --&gt; 00:01:53,313 As you can see, we tried to increase the width of the reel and increase the font so that consumers can manipulate and control it more easily. 

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:58.718
 At the same time, we put all the main functions related to overclocking in the same option. 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.157
 So as you can see, if you want to change the voltage, just enter the voltage option... 

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:08.161
 And click to adjust the voltage to what it looks like. 

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:15.402
 Suppose we want to change the voltage, just change the settings, then click "Save to CMOS". 

00:02:15.402 --> 00:02:19.539
 Do you want to save it? Yes, then it will be stored. 

00:02:20.774 --> 00:02:24.444
 Of course, we also try to make TouchBIOS customizable. 

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:30.316
 We allow users to arrange the icons in TouchBIOS according to their needs. 

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:34.921
 Regardless of the user's perception that the arrangement is more convenient; or the arrangement is more pleasing. 

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:42.495
 We also offer an option to hide infrequently used feature icons or add new ones. 

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:47.434
 So you can remove some options and press OK to sort out the mode of operation you want. 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.710
 It fits perfectly into your operating habits and is fairly easy to use... 

00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:58.311
 Another feature of TouchBIOS is that you can set the BIOS without rebooting into the BIOS. 

00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:07.787
 You can set it completely through this software, you can set it directly, and the system will automatically apply your settings the next time you turn it on. 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.255
 So now you should understand. 

00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:11.624
 This is Gigabyte's Touch BIOS. 

00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:15.295
 A very innovative way to adjust the BIOS.
