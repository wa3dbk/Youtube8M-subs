00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
hi guys just doing a quick review on the

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.280 
hi guys just doing a quick review on the
u.s.<00:00:06.450> ends<00:00:06.930> whey<00:00:07.319> protein<00:00:08.150> I've<00:00:09.150> been<00:00:09.540> using

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
u.s. ends whey protein I've been using

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.799 
u.s. ends whey protein I've been using
this<00:00:10.530> for<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.830> while<00:00:11.010> in<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.610> mornings<00:00:12.059> it's

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
this for a while in the mornings it's

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.709 
this for a while in the mornings it's
strawberry<00:00:13.679> flavor<00:00:14.130> quite<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.030> nice<00:00:15.269> one<00:00:15.540> it's

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
strawberry flavor quite a nice one it's

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.450 
strawberry flavor quite a nice one it's
quite<00:00:15.990> easy<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.410> mix<00:00:17.449> it's<00:00:18.859> pretty<00:00:19.859> similar<00:00:20.130> to

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
quite easy to mix it's pretty similar to

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.689 
quite easy to mix it's pretty similar to
any<00:00:20.850> other<00:00:21.109> way<00:00:22.109> proteins<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:23.070> tastes<00:00:23.490> really

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
any other way proteins the tastes really

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.019 
any other way proteins the tastes really
good<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.590> doesn't<00:00:25.590> get<00:00:25.740> powdery<00:00:26.279> doesn't<00:00:26.760> clog

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
good it doesn't get powdery doesn't clog

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.450 
good it doesn't get powdery doesn't clog
up<00:00:27.210> your<00:00:27.240> shaker<00:00:27.769> so<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.010> one<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.369> I'd

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
up your shaker so it is one that I'd

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.770 
up your shaker so it is one that I'd
recommend<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.240> get<00:00:31.759> protein<00:00:32.780> contents

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
recommend that you get protein contents

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.069 
recommend that you get protein contents
quite<00:00:34.680> good<00:00:34.950> if<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.579> look<00:00:36.890> you<00:00:37.890> can<00:00:38.070> see<00:00:39.079> 24

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
quite good if you look you can see 24

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.240 
quite good if you look you can see 24
grams<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.559> protein

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
grams of protein

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.240 
grams of protein
I<00:00:41.280> think<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.760> serving<00:00:42.360> size<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.629> just<00:00:43.559> 34

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
I think the serving size is just 34

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.880 
I think the serving size is just 34
grams<00:00:44.550> we'll<00:00:44.820> just<00:00:45.000> have<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> quick<00:00:45.239> check<00:00:46.520> so

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
grams we'll just have a quick check so

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.880 
grams we'll just have a quick check so
34<00:00:49.890> grams<00:00:53.930> I've<00:00:54.930> got<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.140> lot<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.320> sugar<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.800> it

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
34 grams I've got a lot of sugar in it

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.959 
34 grams I've got a lot of sugar in it
Ivor<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.590> their<00:00:58.590> sweeteners<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.489> uses

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
Ivor so and their sweeteners it uses

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.670 
Ivor so and their sweeteners it uses
malted<00:01:00.510> extra<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.559> high<00:01:02.039> GI<00:01:03.350> carb<00:01:04.350> which

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
malted extra so high GI carb which

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.300 
malted extra so high GI carb which
you'll<00:01:05.000> spike<00:01:06.000> your<00:01:06.180> insulin<00:01:06.210> levels<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.950> it's

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
you'll spike your insulin levels so it's

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.149 
you'll spike your insulin levels so it's
going<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.520> get<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.500> sugar<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> muscles

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
going to get the sugar to the muscles

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.100 
going to get the sugar to the muscles
basically<00:01:11.790> helping<00:01:12.150> recover<00:01:14.659> it's<00:01:15.659> got<00:01:15.869> it's

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
basically helping recover it's got it's

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.890 
basically helping recover it's got it's
very<00:01:16.320> good<00:01:16.470> for<00:01:16.799> people<00:01:17.100> who<00:01:18.060> have<00:01:18.780> trouble

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
very good for people who have trouble

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.140 
very good for people who have trouble
digesting<00:01:19.650> lactose<00:01:20.100> as<00:01:20.759> well

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
digesting lactose as well

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.780 
digesting lactose as well
he<00:01:21.540> says<00:01:21.750> it's<00:01:21.960> got<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.430> enzyme<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.670> it's

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
he says it's got a enzyme and it's

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:38.480 
he says it's got a enzyme and it's
lactose<00:01:24.479> enzyme<00:01:27.770> see

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.410 

then<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.360> contains<00:01:40.369> tolerates<00:01:41.369> pH<00:01:41.790> stable

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
then it contains tolerates pH stable

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.560 
then it contains tolerates pH stable
lactose<00:01:42.869> lactose<00:01:43.259> enzyme<00:01:44.250> improves<00:01:44.820> lactose

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
lactose lactose enzyme improves lactose

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.080 
lactose lactose enzyme improves lactose
digestion<00:01:46.110> in<00:01:46.610> individuals<00:01:47.610> who<00:01:47.909> have

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
digestion in individuals who have

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.590 
digestion in individuals who have
difficulty<00:01:48.810> digesting<00:01:49.229> lactose<00:01:50.270> so<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.450> does

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
difficulty digesting lactose so it does

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.179 
difficulty digesting lactose so it does
what<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.840> says<00:01:51.869> on<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.110> tin<00:01:52.380> basically<00:01:52.920> it's

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
what it says on the tin basically it's

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.149 
what it says on the tin basically it's
really<00:01:53.490> good<00:01:57.500> I'm<00:01:58.500> just<00:01:58.679> showing<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:58.979> the
