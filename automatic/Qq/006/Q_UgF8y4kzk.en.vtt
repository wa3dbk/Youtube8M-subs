going to show you I'm sure the other

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.109 
going to show you I'm sure the other
platforms<00:00:14.540> DWS<00:00:15.540> have<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:16.260> sampler<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.119> I'm

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
platforms DWS have a sampler and I'm

platforms DWS have a sampler and I'm
sure<00:00:18.420> this<00:00:18.630> method<00:00:19.020> will<00:00:19.109> work<00:00:19.189> almost

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
sure this method will work almost

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.509 
sure this method will work almost
exactly<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.880> same<00:00:22.160> but<00:00:23.160> you're<00:00:23.310> not<00:00:23.369> gonna

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
exactly the same but you're not gonna

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.470 
exactly the same but you're not gonna
click<00:00:23.760> on<00:00:23.880> this<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.240> bet<00:00:24.420> anyway<00:00:25.019> first<00:00:25.740> method

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
click on this I bet anyway first method

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.109 
click on this I bet anyway first method
as<00:00:27.480> far<00:00:27.689> as<00:00:27.750> logic<00:00:28.080> goes<00:00:28.670> it's<00:00:29.670> kind<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:29.939> cool

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
as far as logic goes it's kind of cool

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.030 
as far as logic goes it's kind of cool
if<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.390> want<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.660> just<00:00:30.779> have<00:00:30.990> like<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.679> drum

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
of kicks I probably should have done

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.530 
of kicks I probably should have done
this<00:00:38.250> before<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.820> tutorial<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.420> don't

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
this before the tutorial so you don't

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.420 
this before the tutorial so you don't
have<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.719> watch<00:00:39.899> me<00:00:39.930> drop<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.829> million<00:00:41.160> kicks

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
have to watch me drop in a million kicks

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.029 
have to watch me drop in a million kicks
and<00:00:42.260> this<00:00:43.309> to<00:00:44.309> get<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.640> pitch<00:00:44.940> Bend<00:00:45.210> option

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
and this to get the pitch Bend option

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:51.430 
and this to get the pitch Bend option
you<00:00:47.039> go<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.219> view<00:00:47.610> hyper<00:00:48.510> draw<00:00:49.039> pitch<00:00:50.039> Bend<00:00:50.340> and

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
you go to view hyper draw pitch Bend and

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:59.840 
you go to view hyper draw pitch Bend and
then<00:00:52.440> what<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.649> can<00:00:52.800> do<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:54.890> draw<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:58.850> by

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
then what you can do is draw in by

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.950 
then what you can do is draw in by
clicking<00:01:00.770> you<00:01:01.770> know<00:01:01.800> down<00:01:02.219> or<00:01:02.719> but<00:01:03.719> whatever

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
clicking you know down or but whatever

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.880 
clicking you know down or but whatever
you<00:01:04.019> want<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.229> do<00:01:05.630> so<00:01:06.630> see<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:06.960> drop<00:01:07.200> down<00:01:07.229> and

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
you want to do so see that drop down and

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.420 
you want to do so see that drop down and
then<00:01:10.760> drops<00:01:11.760> up<00:01:11.970> kind<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.479> cool<00:01:13.189> another<00:01:14.189> way

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
then drops up kind of cool another way

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.289 
then drops up kind of cool another way
that<00:01:15.619> you<00:01:16.619> can<00:01:16.799> do<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.549> way<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
that you can do this and this way the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.350 
that you can do this and this way the
second<00:01:18.689> way<00:01:19.220> will<00:01:20.220> give<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.610> like<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.000> full
