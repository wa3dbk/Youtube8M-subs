00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.380
 you need the regular infos news 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.539
 and updates to battlefield hotline too 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.310
 before you let it go then you are 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.050
 here just right bright how are you 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.519
 do not leave and we'll be back 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.769
 start today with the beginning of a small one 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.029
 quiz format to battlefield did a 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.420
 because i will send you in this format 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.010
 relatively fast and relatively easy 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.170
 explain which innovations and in the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.730
 upcoming shooters will be expecting these 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.620
 Above all, information becomes a community 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.180
 ask include at such example 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.280
 the respective lead designer or 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.890
 developers via twitter or others 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.420
 forums posted and of which would then lie 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.640
 have already been answered and thus 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.920
 were also confirmed as the very first 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.989
 We had the question if there are vehicles with 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.340
 Explosive ammo in the coming 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.770
 beta or in the finished 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.359
 will play as it already is in 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.670
 the July beta was the case 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.899
 the answer to that means no you 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.670
 perhaps you have noticed in the 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.860
 first beta the mure took place 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.530
 there were these armored vehicles the 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.450
 explosive ammunition had been this 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.220
 now, however, removed from the game that 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.590
 means that no more vehicles 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.119
 find explosive bullets 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.619
 personally as my own meat 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.119
 infantry player of course not 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.979
 really, to what extent now the 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.049
 create an easy target for vehicles 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.250
 you can only suspect we would be 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.590
 but then see as soon as the beta 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.720
 It starts as aspects of a 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.280
 bed come the two give a whole 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.930
 interesting question of course 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.329
 diehard fans of the franchise 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.000
 yes, you hardly believe it aspects 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.500
 from a bad company 2 have one too 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.729
 found in battlefield 3 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.360
 because it is on the one hand, the possibility 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.579
 give two of the total four protection 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.869
 Sniper with the so-called magnum 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.310
 to equip ammunition 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.530
 for you the maybe bad company 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.030
 2 could not play the magnum 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.100
 Ammunition is a reinforced one 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.670
 ammunition types special battlefield 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.869
 lend a wheel 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.810
 for example, the impact 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.750
 increased compared to vehicles and moreover 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.700
 the drop off the bullet so the ball 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.290
 reduced the waste of the ball and 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.119
 So let's keep shooting 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.410
 interesting to mention that 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.420
 perhaps that this brand 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.970
 ammunition 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.920
 in spite of that , it will be used in europe 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.540
 means that you are forced 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.940
 to decide if he maybe the 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.800
 classic with that too 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.080
 could reload during the visor 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.270
 take or just the appropriate brand 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.040
 ammunition with your advantages and because 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.750
 We are just like the operators 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.440
 already mentioned there are a total of four 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.690
 sniper Bolzano and 4, ie in the ars 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.670
 give signet marketability because here too 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.980
 the question arose why the weapons list 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.510
 so in terms of these weapon categories 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.730
 However , one wants to be small 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.110
 just some control over the 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.390
 have different weapons around the 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.140
 just better to integrate into the game 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.850
 or the people still the 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.370
 possibility to offer from a certain 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.280
 small pool just all times 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.380
 arms excessively and around equal 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.360
 even at the bad company 2 aspect too 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.880
 let's stay on top of it and stay tuned 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.890
 Although the medi pack is just as bad 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.900
 company 2 will work it will 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.850
 stay so-called reputation or 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.410
 also call reward system 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.150
 Possibility for teamplayer 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.360
 actions or even following 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.150
 order various rings to ascend and 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.130
 with each the choice between two 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.350
 to get upgrades where you just then 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.190
 for example, the cure rate of the medi 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.870
 can increase packs 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.790
 It is important to mention that these ranks 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.989
 be temporary and therefore always 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.510
 have to be played again 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.650
 for all fans out there it will be 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.720
 be interesting that it is now one 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.820
 Handbrake for the vehicles gives the 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.320
 speed of the vehicles was also 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.910
 additionally increased and now have 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.829
 you also the possibility per 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.160
 pressing the key over the space also 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:45.680
 Spacebar on the pc to apply a handbrake 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.630
 pull and therefore also to be curves 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.310
 that was for the two previous ones 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.500
 yes rather share a bit / 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.720
 or so on the ground 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.859
 stapled so easily give the aspect 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.640
 especially if you are on a motorcycle 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.170
 was on the way 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.090
 I hope that these men did that 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.459
 be a bit freer 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.859
 but have this handbrake sliding 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.510
 he may contribute drifting feeling 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:06.980
 a little bit of something and as good 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.470
 Last but not least we would still have the community here 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.530
 ask if in theory it so the 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.900
 Interior of the walk-in building something 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.190
 Well detailed was designed as 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.690
 in the previous part 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.280
 and that's actually the case 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.320
 it was taken care of 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.090
 that the interiors are different 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.570
 building a bit more equipped 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.220
 are and not easy 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.960
 the bald rooms are and maybe 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.430
 even allows you out there 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.680
 under one other desk 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.050
 to seek cover who knows 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.170
 that was the berlin eagle 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.310
 advance news infos and updates to 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.780
 upcoming shooter and if you want more 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.190
 you want to write it after all 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.740
 Below are the comments on the one hand 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.480
 think of these upcoming changes 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.620
 and what you wish and if 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.970
 namely want to support of course 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.350
 gives the whole thumb up because 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.240
 you know how it works in their 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.950
 this sense of both goals and 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.950
 profitable in the eye
