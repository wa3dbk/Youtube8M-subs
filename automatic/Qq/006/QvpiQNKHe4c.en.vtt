00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
are laying out the levels kind of

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.990 
are laying out the levels kind of
interestingly<00:01:00.930> they<00:01:01.530> give<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.010> range<00:01:02.430> you

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
interestingly they give you a range you

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.530 
interestingly they give you a range you
know<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.629> kingpins<00:01:04.470> tier<00:01:05.250> 3<00:01:05.670> mission<00:01:06.060> ranges

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
47 257 they say it doesn't quite hold

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.109 
47 257 they say it doesn't quite hold
true<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.650> bottom<00:01:14.040> end<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.729> will<00:01:14.880> hold

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
true on the bottom end but it will hold

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.140 
true on the bottom end but it will hold
true<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.900> top<00:01:16.140> end<00:01:16.759> what<00:01:17.759> do<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.880> mean<00:01:18.090> by

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
true on the top end what do I mean by

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.060 
true on the top end what do I mean by
that<00:01:19.040> for<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.130> most<00:01:20.280> part<00:01:20.509> the<00:01:21.530> highest<00:01:22.530> level

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
that for the most part the highest level

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.480 
that for the most part the highest level
green<00:01:23.540> in<00:01:24.540> other<00:01:24.659> words<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.830> green<00:01:26.130> right

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
green in other words the green right

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.819 
green in other words the green right
before<00:01:26.909> mobs<00:01:27.299> turn<00:01:27.689> orange<00:01:28.020> for<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.619> mission

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
before mobs turn orange for a mission

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.880 
before mobs turn orange for a mission
will<00:01:29.759> be<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:30.060> levels<00:01:30.659> lower<00:01:30.930> than<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.380> are<00:01:32.509> so

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
will be to levels lower than you are so

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.859 
will be to levels lower than you are so
how<00:01:34.890> do<00:01:34.950> we<00:01:35.189> figure<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.549> up<00:01:35.729> well<00:01:36.030> if<00:01:36.299> I'm<00:01:36.450> 50

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
how do we figure that up well if I'm 50

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:47.469 
how do we figure that up well if I'm 50
that<00:01:37.290> means<00:01:37.500> I'm<00:01:37.619> level<00:01:37.890> 48<00:01:39.229> so<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.650> look<00:01:41.430> at<00:01:41.840> 48

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.160 

now<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.509> notice<00:01:48.780> one<00:01:49.200> thing<00:01:49.229> here<00:01:50.720> there's<00:01:51.720> no

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
now I notice one thing here there's no

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.410 
now I notice one thing here there's no
48<00:01:52.710> there's<00:01:53.100> 46<00:01:53.549> 47<00:01:54.329> 49<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.460> means<00:01:56.460> i'm

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
48 there's 46 47 49 that means i'm

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.289 
48 there's 46 47 49 that means i'm
actually<00:01:57.719> going<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.110> be<00:01:58.369> 47<00:01:59.780> I've<00:02:00.780> got<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:02.299> cheat

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
actually going to be 47 I've got a cheat

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.999 
actually going to be 47 I've got a cheat
sheet<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:03.899> can<00:02:04.110> write<00:02:04.320> down<00:02:04.500> just<00:02:04.890> like

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
sheet that you can write down just like

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.639 
sheet that you can write down just like
the<00:02:05.130> old<00:02:05.159> guide<00:02:05.549> coming<00:02:06.030> up<00:02:06.320> so<00:02:07.320> I'm<00:02:07.439> basically

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
the old guide coming up so I'm basically

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.619 
the old guide coming up so I'm basically
kind<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.280> talking<00:02:08.520> for<00:02:08.879> time<00:02:09.119> so<00:02:09.479> i<00:02:09.539> can

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
kind of talking for time so i can

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.710 
kind of talking for time so i can
actually<00:02:10.410> leave<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:11.160> long<00:02:12.060> enough<00:02:12.300> period<00:02:12.360> of

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
actually leave a long enough period of

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.430 
actually leave a long enough period of
time<00:02:12.900> for<00:02:13.230> your

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
time for your

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.780 
time for your
write<00:02:13.530> everything<00:02:13.800> down<00:02:13.980> without<00:02:14.400> having<00:02:14.700> to

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
write everything down without having to

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:24.770 
write everything down without having to
pause<00:02:14.910> at<00:02:15.180> 10<00:02:15.330> seconds<00:02:19.190> so<00:02:22.130> if<00:02:23.130> you're<00:02:23.250> 48<00:02:23.780> and

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
pause at 10 seconds so if you're 48 and

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.090 
pause at 10 seconds so if you're 48 and
your<00:02:24.900> level<00:02:25.200> is<00:02:25.260> not<00:02:25.380> listed<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:25.830> have<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.040> go

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
your level is not listed you have to go

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.770 
your level is not listed you have to go
to<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.280> next<00:02:26.430> lower<00:02:26.700> level<00:02:27.120> that's<00:02:27.480> going<00:02:27.720> to

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
to the next lower level that's going to

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.920 
to the next lower level that's going to
be<00:02:27.870> 47<00:02:28.500> so<00:02:29.220> at<00:02:29.400> King<00:02:29.670> pains<00:02:29.940> this<00:02:30.630> is<00:02:30.750> going<00:02:30.870> to

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
be 47 so at King pains this is going to

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.530 
be 47 so at King pains this is going to
be<00:02:31.050> topped<00:02:31.320> to<00:02:31.500> your<00:02:31.590> green<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.540> then

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
be topped to your green and then

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.200 
be topped to your green and then
taskmasters<00:02:34.380> will<00:02:34.560> be<00:02:34.710> orange<00:02:35.070> and<00:02:35.910> I'll<00:02:36.030> even

taskmasters will be orange and I'll even

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.130 
taskmasters will be orange and I'll even
be<00:02:36.420> more<00:02:36.690> orange<00:02:37.110> because<00:02:37.440> it's<00:02:37.560> actually<00:02:37.740> 49

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
be more orange because it's actually 49

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.810 
be more orange because it's actually 49
however<00:02:40.140> interesting<00:02:40.920> thing<00:02:41.430> they<00:02:41.580> did<00:02:41.790> is

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
however interesting thing they did is

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.330 
however interesting thing they did is
they<00:02:41.970> coded<00:02:42.510> it<00:02:42.630> so<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.080> next<00:02:43.350> three<00:02:43.770> missions

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
they coded it so the next three missions

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.290 
they coded it so the next three missions
past<00:02:45.150> your<00:02:45.510> your<00:02:45.960> top<00:02:46.320> tier<00:02:46.620> green<00:02:47.010> are<00:02:47.340> always

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
past your your top tier green are always

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.500 
past your your top tier green are always
orange<00:02:48.840> so<00:02:49.680> that<00:02:49.860> would<00:02:50.040> mean<00:02:50.300> kingpins<00:02:51.300> is

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
orange so that would mean kingpins is

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.100 
orange so that would mean kingpins is
green<00:02:51.980> taskmaster<00:02:52.980> hoods<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.730> strikers<00:02:54.330> will

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
green taskmaster hoods and strikers will

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.740

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
orange as well as green maybe for the

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.070 
orange as well as green maybe for the
challenge<00:03:22.400> but<00:03:23.400> if<00:03:23.670> you're<00:03:23.820> just<00:03:24.090> hunting<00:03:24.870> to

challenge but if you're just hunting to

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.729 
challenge but if you're just hunting to
see<00:03:25.290> where<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.770> maximum<00:03:26.420> XP<00:03:27.420> is<00:03:27.630> for<00:03:28.350> the

see where the maximum XP is for the
easiest<00:03:30.470> level<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:31.770> do<00:03:31.980> that's<00:03:32.700> obviously

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
easiest level to do that's obviously

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.120 
easiest level to do that's obviously
going<00:03:33.300> to<00:03:33.450> be<00:03:33.600> your<00:03:34.020> top<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:34.470> your<00:03:34.620> green<00:03:34.830> and

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
going to be your top to your green and

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.180 
going to be your top to your green and
that<00:03:35.220> would<00:03:35.340> be<00:03:35.370> king<00:03:35.700> pins<00:03:36.560> now<00:03:37.560> what<00:03:38.010> is

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
that would be king pins now what is

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.090 
that would be king pins now what is
interesting<00:03:38.400> is<00:03:38.940> as<00:03:39.540> long<00:03:40.080> as<00:03:40.350> your<00:03:40.620> level<00:03:40.980> is

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
interesting is as long as your level is

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.880 
interesting is as long as your level is
listed<00:03:41.610> in<00:03:41.730> between<00:03:42.360> these<00:03:42.630> numbers<00:03:43.140> on<00:03:43.470> the

listed in between these numbers on the

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.150 
listed in between these numbers on the
terminal<00:03:44.160> so<00:03:44.850> you<00:03:45.239> know<00:03:45.330> 46<00:03:45.900> 256<00:03:46.560> for<00:03:46.769> subway

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.199 
terminal so you know 46 256 for subway
I'm<00:03:47.820> 50<00:03:48.450> I'm<00:03:49.050> good<00:03:49.920> don't<00:03:50.519> subtract<00:03:51.000> two

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
I'm 50 I'm good don't subtract two

I'm 50 I'm good don't subtract two
anymore<00:03:51.690> you<00:03:52.290> just<00:03:52.620> subtract<00:03:53.010> to<00:03:53.220> define

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
anymore you just subtract to define

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.080 
anymore you just subtract to define
green<00:03:53.970> so<00:03:54.660> if<00:03:54.810> you<00:03:54.900> were<00:03:55.019> level<00:03:55.260> 48<00:03:56.090> subway

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
green so if you were level 48 subway

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.210 
green so if you were level 48 subway

five<00:04:38.350> or<00:04:38.560> six<00:04:38.680> missions<00:04:38.950> and<00:04:39.280> you<00:04:39.340> either<00:04:39.520> have

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
five or six missions and you either have

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.960 
five or six missions and you either have
to<00:04:40.000> do<00:04:40.120> red<00:04:40.360> or<00:04:40.600> green<00:04:40.830> so<00:04:41.830> it<00:04:41.860> was<00:04:42.669> kind<00:04:42.910> of

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
to do red or green so it was kind of

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.610 
to do red or green so it was kind of
really<00:04:43.090> poor<00:04:43.510> and<00:04:43.540> I<00:04:43.810> kind<00:04:43.990> of<00:04:44.080> stretched<00:04:44.380> out

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
really poor and I kind of stretched out

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.770 
really poor and I kind of stretched out
the<00:04:44.950> emissions<00:04:45.880> now<00:04:46.060> so<00:04:46.300> you<00:04:46.389> can<00:04:46.510> get<00:04:46.630> all

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
the emissions now so you can get all

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.190 
the emissions now so you can get all
your<00:04:46.810> shards<00:04:47.440> and<00:04:48.690> you<00:04:49.690> definitely<00:04:49.870> want<00:04:50.139> to

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
your shards and you definitely want to

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.560 
your shards and you definitely want to
save<00:04:50.410> up<00:04:50.590> a<00:04:50.620> hundred<00:04:51.040> cube<00:04:51.730> shards<00:04:52.180> so<00:04:52.300> you<00:04:52.450> can

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
save up a hundred cube shards so you can

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.379 
save up a hundred cube shards so you can
get<00:04:52.660> your<00:04:52.720> cosmic<00:04:53.290> re-roll<00:04:53.710> as<00:04:54.270> people<00:04:55.270> are

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
get your cosmic re-roll as people are

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:56.820 
get your cosmic re-roll as people are

only 63 shards us I was expecting

that<00:05:14.320> cosmic<00:05:14.830> reroll<00:05:15.190> but<00:05:15.400> it's<00:05:15.550> a<00:05:15.790> hundred

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
that cosmic reroll but it's a hundred

that cosmic reroll but it's a hundred
charts<00:05:16.810> so<00:05:17.650> I<00:05:17.680> got<00:05:18.160> four<00:05:18.669> or<00:05:18.790> five<00:05:18.940> days<00:05:19.150> left

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880

and<00:05:21.880> that's<00:05:22.870> how<00:05:22.990> the<00:05:23.080> green<00:05:23.380> mission

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220 
which is what they used to do but that's

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.460 
which is what they used to do but that's

greens may want to know the best green
to<00:06:22.240> do<00:06:22.390> it<00:06:22.650> just<00:06:23.650> take<00:06:23.860> two<00:06:24.070> off<00:06:24.250> your<00:06:24.430> level

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:24.729 
to do it just take two off your level

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:29.909 
to do it just take two off your level
and<00:06:25.260> you<00:06:26.260> look<00:06:26.440> it<00:06:26.590> up<00:06:26.650> on<00:06:26.890> the<00:06:27.010> chart<00:06:28.440> so<00:06:29.440> you

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 
and you look it up on the chart so you

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:32.460 
and you look it up on the chart so you
don't<00:06:30.100> do<00:06:30.250> 50<00:06:30.700> where<00:06:31.180> it<00:06:31.270> says<00:06:31.419> here<00:06:31.450> 50<00:06:31.990> to<00:06:32.080> 60

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:32.470 
don't do 50 where it says here 50 to 60

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.860 
don't do 50 where it says here 50 to 60
let's<00:06:32.830> hide<00:06:33.010> out<00:06:33.190> we<00:06:33.520> take<00:06:33.729> two<00:06:33.940> off<00:06:34.150> you<00:06:34.660> come

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
let's hide out we take two off you come

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.080 
let's hide out we take two off you come
down<00:06:35.050> to<00:06:35.140> kingpins<00:06:35.760> and<00:06:36.760> that<00:06:36.909> will<00:06:37.000> be<00:06:37.060> the

down to kingpins and that will be the

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.089 
down to kingpins and that will be the

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:39.099 
top to your green 50 will be orange

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:40.770

probably<00:06:40.090> the<00:06:40.180> best<00:06:40.210> orange

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:40.780
