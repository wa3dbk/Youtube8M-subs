00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
battery adapter to help us power up the

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.369 
battery adapter to help us power up the
camera<00:00:34.210> and<00:00:34.719> we're<00:00:34.809> gonna<00:00:34.899> switch<00:00:35.170> out<00:00:35.350> our

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
camera and we're gonna switch out our

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:37.770

cannon<00:00:35.739> battery<00:00:36.219> for<00:00:37.120> a<00:00:37.149> coupler<00:00:37.539> and<00:00:37.690> what

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
cannon battery for a coupler and what

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.090 
cannon battery for a coupler and what
happens<00:00:38.019> with<00:00:38.170> the<00:00:38.230> coupler<00:00:38.559> it<00:00:38.679> has<00:00:38.769> a<00:00:38.800> cable

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
happens with the coupler it has a cable

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.599 
happens with the coupler it has a cable
which<00:00:39.519> powers<00:00:39.910> up<00:00:40.179> and<00:00:40.329> gives<00:00:40.960> our<00:00:41.260> cage<00:00:42.100> life

00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:42.609 
which powers up and gives our cage life

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.579 
which powers up and gives our cage life
so<00:00:43.030> the<00:00:43.210> couple<00:00:43.480> of<00:00:43.539> goes<00:00:43.690> in<00:00:43.899> same<00:00:44.199> way<00:00:44.350> as<00:00:44.469> our

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:44.589 
so the couple of goes in same way as our

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:46.439 
so the couple of goes in same way as our
regular<00:00:44.890> battery<00:00:45.249> pops<00:00:45.579> in<00:00:45.850> and<00:00:46.179> pop<00:00:46.359> your

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
regular battery pops in and pop your

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.389 
regular battery pops in and pop your
cable<00:00:46.839> out<00:00:46.989> close<00:00:47.589> the<00:00:47.739> door

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
cable out close the door

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.549 
cable out close the door
our<00:00:48.699> battery<00:00:49.179> set<00:00:49.480> ready<00:00:49.809> to<00:00:49.899> go<00:00:49.989> but<00:00:50.379> right

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
our battery set ready to go but right

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.049 
our battery set ready to go but right
now<00:00:50.739> I'm<00:00:50.829> gonna<00:00:50.949> build<00:00:51.219> the<00:00:51.370> shoulder<00:00:51.670> rig<00:00:51.819> for

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
5ds you have rolling shutters you have

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.490 
5ds you have rolling shutters you have
different<00:01:33.760> more<00:01:33.940> Ray's<00:01:34.180> that<00:01:34.420> we<00:01:34.540> see<00:01:34.780> having

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
different more Ray's that we see having

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.570 
different more Ray's that we see having
the<00:01:35.710> camera<00:01:36.070> compact<00:01:36.610> to<00:01:36.820> us<00:01:37.030> helps<00:01:37.600> with<00:01:37.780> that

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
the camera compact to us helps with that

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.740 
the camera compact to us helps with that
rolling<00:01:39.580> shutter<00:01:39.790> helps<00:01:40.240> with<00:01:40.390> all<00:01:40.570> those

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
rolling shutter helps with all those

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.230 
rolling shutter helps with all those
different<00:01:40.990> moves<00:01:41.380> because<00:01:41.860> now<00:01:42.220> our<00:01:42.790> sensor

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
different moves because now our sensor

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.150 
different moves because now our sensor
is<00:01:43.390> right<00:01:43.660> close<00:01:43.960> to<00:01:44.200> us<00:01:44.350> so<00:01:44.380> it's<00:01:44.620> not<00:01:44.680> taking

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
is right close to us so it's not taking

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.010 
is right close to us so it's not taking
15<00:01:45.580> years<00:01:45.880> to<00:01:46.120> get<00:01:46.270> what<00:01:46.480> we<00:01:46.600> have<00:01:46.750> to<00:01:46.870> go

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
15 years to get what we have to go

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.450 
15 years to get what we have to go
because<00:01:47.290> the<00:01:47.380> camera<00:01:47.680> fills<00:01:47.980> those<00:01:48.130> moves

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
because the camera fills those moves

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.990 
because the camera fills those moves
also<00:01:49.240> embed<00:01:49.750> it<00:01:49.900> into<00:01:50.110> the<00:01:51.070> base<00:01:51.280> plate<00:01:51.580> is<00:01:51.610> we

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
also embed it into the base plate is we

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.210 
also embed it into the base plate is we
put<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.570> velcro<00:01:52.750> into<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.680> base<00:01:53.800> plate<00:01:54.040> so

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
put the velcro into the base plate so

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.470
