00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
to a completely new level from where

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.039 
to a completely new level from where
they've<00:01:09.960> been<00:01:09.990> before<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:11.570> this<00:01:12.570> particular

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
they've been before and this particular

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.800 
they've been before and this particular
exercise<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.680> not<00:01:13.860> for<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.159> faint<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.520> heart

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
exercise is not for the faint of heart

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.539 
exercise is not for the faint of heart
because<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.020> can<00:01:16.290> be<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.500> little<00:01:16.710> discouraging

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
because it can be a little discouraging

because it can be a little discouraging
at<00:01:17.700> times<00:01:17.729> but<00:01:18.390> on<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.380> other<00:01:19.439> hand<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.890> will

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
at times but on the other hand it will

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.999 
at times but on the other hand it will
take<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.520> help<00:01:20.909> show<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.750> what<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.710> need<00:01:22.740> to

that's<00:02:21.830> little<00:02:22.250> too<00:02:22.460> late<00:02:22.670> because<00:02:22.970> you<00:02:23.120> want

that's little too late because you want

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.040 
that's little too late because you want
about<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.600> same<00:02:23.690> size<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:26.630> they're

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
about the same size and and they're

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.170 
about the same size and and they're
better<00:02:27.290> done<00:02:27.650> with<00:02:27.830> high-resolution<00:02:28.790> images

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
better done with high-resolution images

color what does the color look like well
now<00:03:07.310> in<00:03:07.820> Rembrandt's<00:03:08.600> case<00:03:08.870> a<00:03:09.140> lot<00:03:09.740> of<00:03:09.860> the

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
now in Rembrandt's case a lot of the

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.520 
now in Rembrandt's case a lot of the
that<00:03:10.430> colors<00:03:11.270> may<00:03:11.480> have<00:03:11.600> faded<00:03:11.840> a<00:03:12.140> little<00:03:12.170> bit

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
that colors may have faded a little bit

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.229 
that colors may have faded a little bit
over<00:03:12.770> the<00:03:12.890> years<00:03:12.920> so<00:03:13.370> that's<00:03:13.880> a<00:03:14.060> little

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
over the years so that's a little

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.729 
over the years so that's a little
trickier<00:03:14.660> to<00:03:14.720> do<00:03:14.959> for<00:03:15.200> something<00:03:15.470> a<00:03:15.500> painting

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
trickier to do for something a painting

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.920 
trickier to do for something a painting
this<00:03:16.070> old<00:03:16.400> but<00:03:17.060> if<00:03:17.150> you<00:03:17.209> had<00:03:17.300> a<00:03:17.360> contemporary
