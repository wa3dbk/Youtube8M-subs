00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.369
 Hello everyone, I decided to introduce a new 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.650
 heading on my channel which will 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.060
 be called my budget favorites by 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.369
 as these appear 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.430
 favorites i will shoot a video so 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.410
 today the first part of this video let's 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.070
 start with such a tonal basis from 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.910
 of the company 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.079
 I rimmel it in my shade 100 third 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.120
 a series 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.250
 wake me up i really like this 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.820
 anal basis first its price 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.760
 secondly, this is average 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.470
 the coating can in principle be applied such 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.960
 absolutely easy but you can 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.330
 layering for medium coverage not 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.480
 love tonal frameworks that have 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.530
 thick coating and noticeable on the face 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.810
 so this anal ass on me 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.060
 completely satisfied also gives 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.450
 small effect of powder and trail 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.850
 but just a little bit because 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.130
 me as I said normal skin 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.259
 this is a tonal basis held by me 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.229
 for almost a whole day, that is, I am not 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:14.630
 I also correct very well applied 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.700
 distributed shaded on face 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.679
 so no complaints about this 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.640
 tonal basis there is no only thing 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:24.829
 must say that the tonal framework from 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.420
 rimmel is quite dark therefore 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:30.200
 girls with light complexion 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.469
 snow white we will be very difficult 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.920
 choose the right color as well as 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:36.229
 to me 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.270
 I bought 103 number this is one of the most 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.539
 light shades and can not say that 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.560
 he is definitely not white he is such a good media 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:46.880
 shade so since i use 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.380
 avtozagarom now he suits me he 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.170
 by the way now it’s on my face 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.880
 so you can see 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.490
 so pay attention to the shade and 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.869
 you choose him carefully enough 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.579
 the foundation is really great with 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.369
 I will use it with pleasure 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.590
 yet another product from rim 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:08.149
 or which I really like it here 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:10.580
 These are now blush in a shade of 050 life pink 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.190
 I really like these blush they here 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.690
 such babes too 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.670
 not a plus they are very similar to 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.760
 rouge from us famous orgasm 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.190
 if you like an orgasm from us to you 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.190
 exactly like these blush first 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.500
 they cost four times less than 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.040
 RS which is also a plus of course 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:36.580
 very beautiful color as well as on pc 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.470
 has such a golden sheen and is great 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.450
 keeps well shaded not 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.460
 they are sufficiently pigmented 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.740
 it does not lay down like this here but 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.150
 which you need to shade then north 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.030
 you can send 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.070
 very beautiful blush funky shade 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.740
 very much they gave what they bought and therefore 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.700
 please pay attention 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.130
 the only thing I have to say 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.610
 for example, how do they differ from us 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.890
 orgasm seems to me that a little more 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.370
 intense pink color after all in 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.340
 rouge 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:10.150
 for 1 orgasm here you know it more 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.070
 as if more bed so they are very 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.940
 look great blush with pleasure 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:19.870
 I use very good as me very 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:24.220
 nyx liked the gloss off the series of Batya 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:28.989
 the eye goes here with this one 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:30.790
 the applicator shine is quite dense 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.280
 that i like too i eat it well 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.890
 gives its color to the bottom categories 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.620
 brilliance that go to this floor haze 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.360
 hardly transmits color no with these 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.950
 shine really need to be 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.290
 careful in terms of what you need 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.080
 remove the shade that suits you because 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.739
 that the color is quite obvious to me 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.440
 I like this shade in my room 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:56.290
 01 happy to buy any more 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.310
 shades from this series of gloss for 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.860
 lips from nyx and also he gives such know 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.660
 i.e. intense color is enough plus 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.010
 Such a glossy effect that is very, very 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:10.420
 beautiful so cliff someone you inflicted 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.459
 lipstick and top makeup 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.540
 glitter so these glitters i 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.209
 very very pleased 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.820
 turn your attention one more shine 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.030
 by which 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.280
 also liked already from the company revlon 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:25.360
 This is not a boa shade by the way he 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.440
 very similar to the lips looks 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.080
 almost the same as in the package 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.530
 the only one is not as dense as the mix 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.790
 here it is already a little translucent 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.490
 very beautiful shade 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.910
 It comes with such an applicator 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.280
 same principle as unix 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.920
 the only thing I would like to 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.440
 he was denser meaning he is perfect 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.180
 suitable for day makeup as well 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.820
 Looks beautiful when you do 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.640
 intense eyes and choose not to exude 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.430
 lips i have one of my very 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.140
 tom ford's favorite sparkles in shade 10 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.930
 but he's insanely expensive 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.360
 Here is such a beautiful evening shine I 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:09.320
 trying to find a replacement for him I can not say 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:11.450
 that revlon is a replacement for my 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.700
 favorite tom ford shine but he's at it 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.370
 it looks like the only thing if he would 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.560
 more intense i mean would go to bed 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.510
 more so as tight as lipstick he was 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.790
 would be perfect for me but I very often 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.290
 I use it very happy excellent 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.570
 brilliance so also draw your 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.250
 attention and last resort which I 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:32.060
 I want to show you this 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:34.040
 eyeliner from the company loreal to 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.270
 Sorry I do not know why but this one 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.850
 pencil is not presented in Russian 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.420
 I ordered it through the market 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:43.010
 American site is very sorry 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.660
 great pencil you know what I have it 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:48.740
 I use on the water line 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:50.540
 when the case is intense beautiful makeup i 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.490
 enjoyed quite a lot 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.990
 I can say with pencils that this is the best 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.810
 pencil for the water line which I 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:59.060
 He used her color first 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.600
 very pigmented look what 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.380
 he is bright 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:07.400
 he also fits the water line perfectly 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:09.950
 at the same time exactly and most importantly keeps 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.840
 the whole evening, that is, if I use 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:15.170
 pencil can't help but worry due to 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.360
 the fact that he disappeared somewhere he is perfect 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.930
 applied perfectly keeps me very 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.350
 strong in 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.850
 Love ordered also the same in gray 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.470
