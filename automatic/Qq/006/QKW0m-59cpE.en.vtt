 that will make us gain a lot of precision in 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.100
 fps game 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.979
 super directional unlike 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.810
 normal of xbox 360 this is constituted 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.280
 by four independent buttons per 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.890
 what will prevent us from mistakes you acquire 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.259
 push one button one of the most 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.509
 important are only the keys 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.369
 action that are backlit and with 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.049
 hyper response technology that will do 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.359
 that with a light touch will take 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.820
 out the action let's see your part 

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:32.610
 higher 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.440
 As you can see, it has three trigger buttons 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.140
 It has been designed with one more route 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.150
 short for a better answer the button 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.979
 superior is programmable and we can 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.920
 assign any command action to 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.410
 this button to configure it simply 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.160
 we must press the row button and the key 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.160
 that we want to associate 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.000
 after being a while playing with him he 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.369
 note a great improvement over the command 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.079
 original of xbox 360 since it has a 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.149
 shorter response time and we do not know 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.070
 will reveal by sweat with his dress 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.840
 adjustable will give us some advantage in 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.820
 games like surten and with its button 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.670
 programmable we can perform any 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.900
 action more quickly in summary if 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.580

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.269
