00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.910 
got a carbon reactor from ball crew
supply<00:04:15.580> which<00:04:15.880> is<00:04:15.910> really<00:04:16.360> nice<00:04:16.510> and<00:04:16.930> I<00:04:17.500> like

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
that i was running GFO for a while and I

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.810 
that i was running GFO for a while and I
think<00:04:20.650> it's<00:04:20.799> doing<00:04:21.040> more<00:04:21.190> harm<00:04:21.370> than<00:04:21.580> good<00:04:21.640> so

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
think it's doing more harm than good so

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:28.140 
think it's doing more harm than good so
I<00:04:22.170> stopped<00:04:23.170> using<00:04:23.410> it<00:04:26.520> other<00:04:27.520> than<00:04:27.670> that<00:04:27.880> I
