00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
you get at the grocery store it's from

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.500 
you get at the grocery store it's from
the<00:00:17.490> same<00:00:17.699> family<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.750> as<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.529> matter<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.800> fact

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
the same family and as a matter of fact

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.120 
the same family and as a matter of fact
Native<00:00:21.510> Americans<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.140> North<00:00:22.650> America

Native Americans of North America
actually<00:00:23.310> grew<00:00:23.670> this<00:00:23.820> as<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.029> grain<00:00:24.240> crop<00:00:24.619> I

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
actually grew this as a grain crop I

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.620 
actually grew this as a grain crop I
think<00:00:26.279> they're<00:00:26.369> saying<00:00:26.490> around<00:00:26.670> like<00:00:26.849> 1,500

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
think they're saying around like 1,500

to<00:00:28.470> 2,000<00:00:29.010> years<00:00:29.160> ago<00:00:29.340> where<00:00:30.300> as<00:00:30.480> quinoa<00:00:30.750> in

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
to 2,000 years ago where as quinoa in

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.020 
to 2,000 years ago where as quinoa in
Central<00:00:31.590> America<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:32.040> like<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.369> Aztecs<00:00:32.520> were

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.729 
Central America and like the Aztecs were
actually<00:00:33.300> growing<00:00:33.450> around<00:00:33.660> 5,000<00:00:34.410> years<00:00:34.440> ago

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
actually growing around 5,000 years ago

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.470 
actually growing around 5,000 years ago
now<00:00:35.399> they<00:00:35.550> don't<00:00:35.640> necessarily<00:00:35.850> know<00:00:36.270> whether

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
now they don't necessarily know whether

used<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.000> farm<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.450> before<00:00:42.780> they<00:00:42.870> farmed

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
used to farm this before they farmed

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.619 
used to farm this before they farmed
maize<00:00:43.469> now<00:00:44.190> maize<00:00:44.520> did<00:00:44.820> make<00:00:45.000> its<00:00:45.180> way<00:00:45.300> up<00:00:45.329> from

stick<00:00:49.170> came<00:00:49.289> up<00:00:49.469> here<00:00:49.680> actually<00:00:49.890> more

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
stick came up here actually more

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.889 
stick came up here actually more
agriculture<00:00:51.059> was<00:00:51.180> based<00:00:51.390> around<00:00:51.539> maize<00:00:51.870> and

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
agriculture was based around maize and

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.260 
agriculture was based around maize and
about<00:00:52.289> around<00:00:52.620> corn<00:00:52.949> but<00:00:53.640> they<00:00:53.760> did<00:00:53.969> still

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
about around corn but they did still

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.790 
about around corn but they did still
grow<00:00:54.770> which<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.800> called<00:00:56.160> goosefoot<00:00:56.760> or<00:00:57.000> also

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
grow which is called goosefoot or also

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.740 
grow which is called goosefoot or also
lambsquarters<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.670> got<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.850> couple<00:01:00.090> a

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
lambsquarters and I got a couple a

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.349 
lambsquarters and I got a couple a
couple<00:01:01.070> plants<00:01:02.070> here<00:01:02.219> I'll<00:01:02.370> show<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.609> main

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
couple plants here I'll show you main

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.359 
couple plants here I'll show you main
way<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.660> tell<00:01:03.960> whether<00:01:04.650> it's<00:01:04.860> lambs<00:01:05.100> quarters

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
way to tell whether it's lambs quarters

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.990 
way to tell whether it's lambs quarters
or<00:01:05.790> Guzman<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.990> just<00:01:07.560> look<00:01:07.740> at<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.890> name<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
or Guzman and just look at the name the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.280 
or Guzman and just look at the name the
leaves<00:01:09.299> actually<00:01:09.720> look<00:01:10.200> like<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.770> deuce<00:01:11.580> foot

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
leaves actually look like a deuce foot

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.429 
leaves actually look like a deuce foot
and<00:01:13.290> that's<00:01:13.710> one<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.130> main<00:01:14.340> ways<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.610> tell

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
and that's one of the main ways to tell

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.480 
and that's one of the main ways to tell
sometimes<00:01:16.439> they<00:01:16.710> have<00:01:16.799> different<00:01:17.100> lobes<00:01:17.250> I

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
sometimes they have different lobes I

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.740 
sometimes they have different lobes I
mean<00:01:17.640> if<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.909> look<00:01:18.030> like<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.299> younger<00:01:18.540> leaves

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
mean if you look like the younger leaves

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.539 
mean if you look like the younger leaves
they<00:01:18.960> look<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.200> little<00:01:19.320> bit<00:01:19.530> different<00:01:19.979> they

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
they look a little bit different they

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.070 
they look a little bit different they
don't<00:01:20.729> necessarily<00:01:20.850> look<00:01:21.479> like<00:01:21.689> an<00:01:21.810> actual

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
don't necessarily look like an actual

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.460 
don't necessarily look like an actual
goosefoot<00:01:22.939> but<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.090> know<00:01:24.210> just<00:01:25.110> take<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.290> look

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
goosefoot but you know just take a look

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.140 
goosefoot but you know just take a look
at<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.950> if<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.189> if<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.700> seen<00:01:26.939> one<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.119> my

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
at it and if you if you seen one of my

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.210 
at it and if you if you seen one of my
other<00:01:27.360> videos<00:01:27.420> about<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.020> quinoa<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.650> was

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
other videos about the quinoa I was

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.499 
other videos about the quinoa I was
wondering<00:01:29.490> about<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.759> little<00:01:29.970> crystals<00:01:30.420> that

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
wondering about the little crystals that

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.690 
wondering about the little crystals that
are<00:01:30.630> growing<00:01:30.840> I've<00:01:31.740> actually<00:01:31.920> found<00:01:32.250> out<00:01:32.490> that

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
are growing I've actually found out that

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.859 
are growing I've actually found out that
that's<00:01:33.030> actually<00:01:33.240> calcium<00:01:35.479> quinoa<00:01:36.479> has

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
that's actually calcium quinoa has

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.179 
that's actually calcium quinoa has
actually<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.470> one<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> plants<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.009> has

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
actually is one of the plants that has

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.280 
actually is one of the plants that has
some<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.549> most<00:01:38.670> calcium<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.299> it

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
some of the most calcium in it it

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.429 
some of the most calcium in it it
actually<00:01:41.570> compared<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.659> drink<00:01:42.899> in<00:01:43.020> milk<00:01:43.259> it's

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
actually compared to drink in milk it's

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.760 
actually compared to drink in milk it's
like<00:01:43.590> five<00:01:43.890> times<00:01:44.220> as<00:01:44.869> as<00:01:45.869> good<00:01:46.110> as<00:01:46.200> calcium<00:01:46.439> as

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
like five times as as good as calcium as

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.539 
like five times as as good as calcium as
drinking<00:01:47.159> milk

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
drinking milk

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.109 
drinking milk
now<00:01:48.060> um<00:01:48.360> if<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.619> look<00:01:49.799> real<00:01:50.040> close<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.340> can

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
now um if you look real close you can

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.850 
now um if you look real close you can
