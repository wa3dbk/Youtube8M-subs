actually no you can't cuz before you
could<00:00:51.239> just<00:00:51.449> reset<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.020> animation<00:00:52.500> by<00:00:52.649> biting

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
could just reset the animation by biting

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.350 
could just reset the animation by biting
somewhere<00:00:53.489> someone<00:00:54.770> and<00:00:55.789> it's<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.910> tile<00:00:57.120> like

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
somewhere someone and it's a tile like

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.150 
somewhere someone and it's a tile like
by<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.809> time<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.199> reach<00:00:58.440> somebody<00:00:58.710> they<00:00:59.010> use

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
by the time you reach somebody they use

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.470 
by the time you reach somebody they use
contaminate<00:00:59.730> when<00:00:59.850> you're<00:00:59.969> chasing<00:01:00.149> them

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
contaminate when you're chasing them

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.569 
contaminate when you're chasing them
like<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.440> animation<00:01:02.010> should<00:01:02.219> have<00:01:02.340> been<00:01:02.430> done

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
like the animation should have been done

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.020 
like the animation should have been done
anyway<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.120> it's<00:01:03.600> pretty<00:01:03.930> much<00:01:05.030> pointless

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
anyway so it's pretty much pointless

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.020 
anyway so it's pretty much pointless
stupid<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:07.380> he<00:01:08.220> still<00:01:08.460> needs<00:01:08.640> some<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:08.909> his

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
stupid so he still needs some of his

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.690 
stupid so he still needs some of his
