00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
tie outs match where the tie out points

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.580 
tie outs match where the tie out points
are<00:00:29.210> you<00:00:29.689> can<00:00:29.840> tie<00:00:29.989> your<00:00:30.110> hammock<00:00:30.470> out

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
directly to the line I have this stake

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.120 
directly to the line I have this stake
set<00:00:33.500> staked<00:00:33.890> out<00:00:34.040> separate<00:00:35.620> so<00:00:36.620> that<00:00:36.829> I<00:00:36.860> could

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.130 
set staked out separate so that I could

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.220 
set staked out separate so that I could
show<00:00:37.309> you<00:00:37.340> the<00:00:37.489> difference<00:00:38.030> on<00:00:38.570> how<00:00:38.930> to<00:00:38.989> pull

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
show you the difference on how to pull

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.889 
show you the difference on how to pull
this<00:00:39.380> out<00:00:39.590> now<00:00:39.800> unlike<00:00:40.280> the<00:00:41.239> other<00:00:41.390> rain<00:00:41.630> flies

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
this out now unlike the other rain flies

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.380 
this out now unlike the other rain flies
we're<00:00:42.140> gonna<00:00:42.230> look<00:00:42.500> at<00:00:42.679> today<00:00:43.000> this<00:00:44.000> one<00:00:44.179> is

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
we're gonna look at today this one is

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.020 
we're gonna look at today this one is
connected<00:00:44.780> to<00:00:45.010> the<00:00:46.010> ridge<00:00:46.190> line<00:00:46.219> and<00:00:46.609> that

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
connected to the ridge line and that

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.450 
connected to the ridge line and that
ridge<00:00:47.210> line<00:00:47.260> is<00:00:48.260> connected<00:00:48.769> to<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:49.010> tree<00:00:49.249> so

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
ridge line is connected to the tree so

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.389 
ridge line is connected to the tree so
the<00:00:50.210> tarp<00:00:50.449> itself<00:00:50.899> is<00:00:51.140> not<00:00:51.679> connected<00:00:52.249> to<00:00:52.280> the

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
the tarp itself is not connected to the

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.009 
the tarp itself is not connected to the
tree<00:00:52.699> but<00:00:52.910> it's<00:00:53.030> connected<00:00:53.269> to<00:00:53.480> the<00:00:53.690> hammock

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019 
tree but it's connected to the hammock

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.110 
tree but it's connected to the hammock
ridge<00:00:54.199> line<00:00:54.440> and<00:00:54.710> that's<00:00:55.399> not<00:00:55.609> the<00:00:55.760> preferred

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
ridge line and that's not the preferred

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.149 
ridge line and that's not the preferred
way<00:00:56.329> of<00:00:56.359> doing<00:00:56.510> it<00:00:56.870> because<00:00:57.769> that<00:00:57.920> doesn't

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
way of doing it because that doesn't

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:00.250 
way of doing it because that doesn't
give<00:00:58.999> you<00:00:59.120> much<00:00:59.329> space<00:00:59.690> there<00:00:59.989> in<00:01:00.140> between

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
give you much space there in between

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.559 
give you much space there in between
your<00:01:00.620> hammock<00:01:00.920> and<00:01:01.070> the<00:01:01.190> tarp<00:01:01.429> and<00:01:01.640> it<00:01:02.210> really

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:02.569 
your hammock and the tarp and it really

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:05.500 
your hammock and the tarp and it really
keeps<00:01:03.019> the<00:01:03.260> area<00:01:03.559> tight<00:01:03.829> in<00:01:04.010> there<00:01:04.220> but<00:01:04.730> if<00:01:05.330> you

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
keeps the area tight in there but if you

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.330

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.350 
360 degrees and Counting these blast
doors<00:04:00.680> so<00:04:01.070> it<00:04:01.340> doesn't<00:04:01.670> give<00:04:01.820> you<00:04:01.970> as<00:04:02.180> much

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
doors so it doesn't give you as much

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:09.610 
doors so it doesn't give you as much
space<00:04:02.750> as<00:04:05.770> the<00:04:06.770> hex<00:04:07.010> does<00:04:08.170> and<00:04:09.170> a<00:04:09.260> good<00:04:09.440> way<00:04:09.560> to

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
space as the hex does and a good way to

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.380 
space as the hex does and a good way to
illustrate<00:04:09.830> that<00:04:10.340> if<00:04:10.520> you<00:04:10.640> can<00:04:10.790> see<00:04:10.970> these<00:04:11.150> two

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
illustrate that if you can see these two

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.140 
illustrate that if you can see these two
stools<00:04:11.690> that<00:04:11.930> I've<00:04:12.050> got<00:04:12.230> under<00:04:12.410> it

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
stools that I've got under it

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.460 
stools that I've got under it
we<00:04:14.150> were<00:04:14.300> both<00:04:14.480> sitting<00:04:14.720> under<00:04:15.080> those<00:04:15.200> two

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
we were both sitting under those two

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.860 
we were both sitting under those two
stools<00:04:15.739> under<00:04:16.100> the<00:04:16.220> hex<00:04:16.459> rain<00:04:16.700> fly<00:04:16.940> and<00:04:17.209> now

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
stools under the hex rain fly and now

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.349 
stools under the hex rain fly and now
the<00:04:17.930> grey<00:04:18.380> stool<00:04:18.709> is<00:04:18.980> still<00:04:19.970> under<00:04:20.239> the

the grey stool is still under the

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.420 
the grey stool is still under the
monsoon<00:04:20.840> with<00:04:21.620> the<00:04:21.739> hammock<00:04:22.040> in<00:04:22.160> the<00:04:22.190> same

monsoon with the hammock in the same

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.020 
monsoon with the hammock in the same
place<00:04:22.669> but<00:04:23.540> the<00:04:23.600> red<00:04:23.840> stool<00:04:24.140> it's<00:04:24.740> just

place but the red stool it's just

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.390 
place but the red stool it's just
outside<00:04:26.030> now<00:04:26.660> you<00:04:26.750> can<00:04:27.080> have<00:04:27.350> rain<00:04:28.070> coming

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
outside now you can have rain coming

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.670 
outside now you can have rain coming
from<00:04:28.550> all<00:04:28.730> directions<00:04:29.169> because<00:04:30.169> even<00:04:30.470> at<00:04:30.560> the

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
from all directions because even at the

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.870 
from all directions because even at the
head<00:04:30.830> and<00:04:30.860> the<00:04:31.070> foot<00:04:31.310> you<00:04:31.490> have<00:04:31.520> these

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
head and the foot you have these

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:39.909 
head and the foot you have these
blasters<00:04:32.419> that<00:04:33.350> attach<00:04:35.470> right<00:04:36.470> here<00:04:38.710> both<00:04:39.710> to

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
blasters that attach right here both to

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.470 
blasters that attach right here both to
the<00:04:40.010> top<00:04:40.280> and<00:04:40.520> then<00:04:40.610> on<00:04:40.640> each<00:04:40.940> side<00:04:41.210> you've<00:04:41.450> got

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
the top and then on each side you've got

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.980 
the top and then on each side you've got
velcro<00:04:42.140> and<00:04:42.680> then<00:04:43.130> that<00:04:43.310> velcro<00:04:44.300> goes<00:04:44.750> down

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
velcro and then that velcro goes down

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.860 
velcro and then that velcro goes down
and<00:04:45.490> then<00:04:46.490> on<00:04:46.880> the<00:04:47.090> other<00:04:47.120> ends<00:04:47.540> you've<00:04:47.660> got

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
and then on the other ends you've got

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.570 
and then on the other ends you've got
these<00:04:47.990> little<00:04:48.669> toggles<00:04:49.669> that<00:04:49.729> go<00:04:50.030> through<00:04:51.580> so

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
these little toggles that go through so

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.110 
these little toggles that go through so
one<00:04:52.610> feature<00:04:53.030> I<00:04:53.240> like<00:04:53.479> about<00:04:53.660> the<00:04:54.440> monsoon

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
one feature I like about the monsoon

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.790 
one feature I like about the monsoon
that<00:04:56.120> the<00:04:56.360> other<00:04:56.479> hammocks<00:04:57.140> don't<00:04:57.380> have<00:04:57.560> is

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
that the other hammocks don't have is

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.710 
that the other hammocks don't have is
you've<00:04:58.610> got<00:04:58.850> a<00:04:58.880> elastic<00:04:59.800> shock<00:05:00.800> cord<00:05:01.280> and<00:05:01.720> a

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
you've got a elastic shock cord and a

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.409 
you've got a elastic shock cord and a
string<00:05:03.440> on<00:05:03.740> all<00:05:04.700> the<00:05:05.860> six<00:05:06.860> pockets<00:05:07.300> along<00:05:08.300> the

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
string on all the six pockets along the

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.130 
string on all the six pockets along the
side<00:05:08.630> three<00:05:08.990> on<00:05:09.020> each<00:05:09.260> side<00:05:09.490> so<00:05:10.900> you've<00:05:11.900> got

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
side three on each side so you've got

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.320 
side three on each side so you've got
both<00:05:12.350> choices<00:05:12.380> to<00:05:12.979> use<00:05:13.040> and<00:05:13.340> they<00:05:13.550> both<00:05:13.790> fit<00:05:14.150> in

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
both choices to use and they both fit in

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.500 
both choices to use and they both fit in
this<00:05:15.080> pocket<00:05:15.320> here<00:05:15.710> for<00:05:16.130> storage<00:05:17.090> in<00:05:17.210> between

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
this pocket here for storage in between

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.510 
this pocket here for storage in between
there<00:05:17.660> so<00:05:17.810> I<00:05:17.840> think<00:05:18.110> that's<00:05:18.290> really<00:05:18.500> good<00:05:18.740> this

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
there so I think that's really good this

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.050 
there so I think that's really good this
is<00:05:19.700> what<00:05:19.820> the<00:05:19.970> blast<00:05:20.210> panels<00:05:20.660> look<00:05:20.900> like<00:05:22.060> this

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
is what the blast panels look like this

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.450 
is what the blast panels look like this
is<00:05:23.210> a<00:05:23.240> view<00:05:23.660> from<00:05:23.870> inside<00:05:24.050> and<00:05:24.470> that's<00:05:24.590> the<00:05:24.860> one

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
is a view from inside and that's the one

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.580 
is a view from inside and that's the one
that<00:05:25.610> with<00:05:25.850> the<00:05:26.000> blast<00:05:26.240> panels<00:05:26.690> on<00:05:26.870> and<00:05:27.290> of

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
that with the blast panels on and of

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.989 
that with the blast panels on and of
course<00:05:27.800> you<00:05:27.950> can<00:05:28.100> take<00:05:28.280> those<00:05:28.490> off

00:05:32.989 --> 00:05:32.999 

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:36.449 

I'll<00:05:33.999> just<00:05:34.209> take<00:05:34.419> this<00:05:34.659> out<00:05:34.929> and<00:05:35.169> they<00:05:35.949> detach

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:36.459 
I'll just take this out and they detach

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:38.069 
I'll just take this out and they detach
completely<00:05:37.119> so<00:05:37.299> you<00:05:37.329> can<00:05:37.569> leave<00:05:37.719> them<00:05:37.899> at<00:05:38.049> home

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:38.079 
completely so you can leave them at home

00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:41.219 
completely so you can leave them at home
and<00:05:38.469> then<00:05:39.189> you've<00:05:39.369> just<00:05:39.399> got<00:05:39.759> a<00:05:39.839> rain<00:05:40.839> fly<00:05:40.989> that

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
and then you've just got a rain fly that

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:44.849 
and then you've just got a rain fly that
gives<00:05:41.409> you<00:05:41.559> really<00:05:41.769> good<00:05:42.209> wind<00:05:43.209> coverage<00:05:44.049> and

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:44.859 
gives you really good wind coverage and

00:05:44.859 --> 00:05:47.339 
gives you really good wind coverage and
still<00:05:45.249> gives<00:05:45.429> you<00:05:45.519> great<00:05:45.729> rain<00:05:45.939> coverage<00:05:46.349> so

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:47.349 
still gives you great rain coverage so

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:50.879 
still gives you great rain coverage so
the<00:05:47.529> way<00:05:47.649> this<00:05:47.859> is<00:05:48.039> set<00:05:48.249> up<00:05:48.279> right<00:05:48.579> now<00:05:48.759> I<00:05:49.889> have

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889 
the way this is set up right now I have

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:52.829 
the way this is set up right now I have
eight<00:05:51.099> Stakes<00:05:51.489> holding<00:05:52.179> that<00:05:52.329> down<00:05:52.569> to<00:05:52.749> the

00:05:52.829 --> 00:05:52.839 
eight Stakes holding that down to the

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:55.649 
eight Stakes holding that down to the
ground<00:05:52.869> and<00:05:53.289> it's<00:05:53.619> tied<00:05:53.889> out<00:05:54.299> additionally<00:05:55.299> to

00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:55.659 
ground and it's tied out additionally to

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:58.619 
ground and it's tied out additionally to
the<00:05:55.689> tree<00:05:56.109> in<00:05:56.319> both<00:05:57.159> sides<00:05:57.459> now<00:05:57.789> with<00:05:58.509> this

00:05:58.619 --> 00:05:58.629 
the tree in both sides now with this

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:00.329 
the tree in both sides now with this
monsoon<00:05:59.139> I'll<00:05:59.319> keep<00:05:59.499> this<00:05:59.679> completely

00:06:00.329 --> 00:06:00.339 
monsoon I'll keep this completely

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:02.909 
monsoon I'll keep this completely
independent<00:06:01.029> from<00:06:01.059> the<00:06:01.209> hammock<00:06:01.629> also<00:06:02.049> it

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 
independent from the hammock also it

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:05.579 
independent from the hammock also it
would<00:06:03.129> be<00:06:03.249> a<00:06:03.279> waste<00:06:03.579> to<00:06:04.029> put<00:06:04.479> it<00:06:04.569> here<00:06:04.839> on<00:06:04.989> the

00:06:05.579 --> 00:06:05.589 
would be a waste to put it here on the

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:08.759 
would be a waste to put it here on the
ridgeline<00:06:05.769> with<00:06:06.249> the<00:06:06.399> hammock
