desk<00:00:18.220> game<00:00:18.699> very<00:00:19.660> much<00:00:19.869> in<00:00:20.170> the<00:00:20.410> style<00:00:20.590> of

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
desk game very much in the style of

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.810 
desk game very much in the style of
other<00:00:21.640> trials<00:00:22.179> esque<00:00:22.570> games<00:00:23.529> but<00:00:24.070> this<00:00:24.339> one<00:00:24.580> is

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
other trials esque games but this one is

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.669 
other trials esque games but this one is
different<00:00:24.880> on<00:00:25.509> mobile<00:00:25.900> because<00:00:26.080> it<00:00:26.380> kind<00:00:26.650> of

different on mobile because it kind of

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:28.529 
different on mobile because it kind of
gives<00:00:26.830> you<00:00:26.949> the<00:00:27.099> full<00:00:27.369> trials<00:00:27.970> experience

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
gives you the full trials experience

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.050 
gives you the full trials experience
whereas<00:00:29.199> all<00:00:29.410> my<00:00:29.710> word<00:00:29.949> I<00:00:30.070> just<00:00:30.099> smashed<00:00:30.910> my

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
whereas all my word I just smashed my

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.229 
whereas all my word I just smashed my
own<00:00:31.300> face<00:00:31.509> in<00:00:31.749> whereas<00:00:32.739> some<00:00:33.700> of<00:00:33.850> the<00:00:34.090> other

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
own face in whereas some of the other

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.080 
own face in whereas some of the other
trials<00:00:34.600> games<00:00:35.020> have<00:00:35.710> notably<00:00:36.219> kind<00:00:36.670> of<00:00:36.730> taken

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
trials games have notably kind of taken

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.630 
trials games have notably kind of taken
away<00:00:37.300> the<00:00:37.450> precision<00:00:38.020> of<00:00:38.199> the<00:00:38.920> game<00:00:39.219> you're

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
away the precision of the game you're

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.880 
away the precision of the game you're
very<00:00:39.760> much<00:00:39.969> either<00:00:40.149> leaning<00:00:40.840> back<00:00:40.870> or<00:00:41.440> leaning

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
very much either leaning back or leaning

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.610 
very much either leaning back or leaning
forwards<00:00:42.870> when<00:00:43.870> you're<00:00:44.050> playing<00:00:44.289> something

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
forwards when you're playing something

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.380 
forwards when you're playing something
like<00:00:44.770> a<00:00:44.800> trials<00:00:45.190> frontier<00:00:45.430> this<00:00:45.940> one<00:00:46.149> gives

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
like a trials frontier this one gives

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.599 
like a trials frontier this one gives
you<00:00:46.449> a<00:00:46.510> little<00:00:46.870> bit<00:00:47.020> more<00:00:47.260> finesse<00:00:47.530> when<00:00:48.520> it

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:48.609 
you a little bit more finesse when it

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:50.970 
you a little bit more finesse when it
comes<00:00:48.850> to<00:00:49.149> your<00:00:49.600> positioning<00:00:50.199> of<00:00:50.350> your<00:00:50.410> weight

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
comes to your positioning of your weight

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.009 
comes to your positioning of your weight
so<00:00:51.579> let<00:00:51.850> me<00:00:51.940> just<00:00:52.210> show<00:00:52.390> you<00:00:52.420> what<00:00:52.600> i<00:00:52.629> mean<00:00:52.690> by

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
so let me just show you what i mean by

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:57.209 
so let me just show you what i mean by
that<00:00:53.050> so<00:00:53.350> I'm<00:00:53.769> tilting<00:00:54.430> the<00:00:55.320> device<00:00:56.320> back<00:00:56.920> and

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
that so I'm tilting the device back and

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:59.459 
that so I'm tilting the device back and
forward<00:00:58.120> very<00:00:58.390> very<00:00:58.660> gently<00:00:58.870> and<00:00:59.050> it's<00:00:59.230> giving

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
forward very very gently and it's giving

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.630 
forward very very gently and it's giving
me<00:00:59.500> a<00:00:59.769> certain<00:01:00.489> amount<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.960> control<00:01:02.800> over<00:01:02.949> how

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
me a certain amount of control over how

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.999 
me a certain amount of control over how
much<00:01:03.850> I<00:01:04.059> want<00:01:04.269> to<00:01:04.299> actually<00:01:04.449> move<00:01:05.199> my

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
much I want to actually move my

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.130 
much I want to actually move my
character<00:01:06.909> and<00:01:07.060> that<00:01:07.150> is<00:01:07.600> actually<00:01:07.900> really

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
character and that is actually really

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.289 
character and that is actually really
important<00:01:08.799> to<00:01:08.979> people<00:01:09.130> who<00:01:09.549> play<00:01:09.850> games<00:01:10.210> like

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
important to people who play games like

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.450 
important to people who play games like
this<00:01:10.540> because<00:01:10.689> it<00:01:11.020> allows<00:01:11.290> you<00:01:11.560> to<00:01:11.710> do<00:01:11.860> more

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
this because it allows you to do more

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.499 
this because it allows you to do more
subtle<00:01:12.970> more<00:01:13.150> sort<00:01:13.810> of<00:01:13.869> fine<00:01:15.180> movements<00:01:16.180> more

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
subtle more sort of fine movements more

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.590 
subtle more sort of fine movements more
finesse<00:01:16.960> with<00:01:17.259> your<00:01:17.409> controls<00:01:17.979> so<00:01:18.820> that's

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
finesse with your controls so that's

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.999 
finesse with your controls so that's
kind<00:01:19.930> of<00:01:19.990> like<00:01:20.140> one<00:01:20.439> of<00:01:20.470> the<00:01:20.650> big<00:01:20.799> differences

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
kind of like one of the big differences

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.240 
kind of like one of the big differences
I<00:01:21.549> suppose<00:01:22.000> oh<00:01:22.360> I've<00:01:23.350> been<00:01:23.439> crushed<00:01:23.680> by<00:01:23.829> a<00:01:23.860> car

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
I suppose oh I've been crushed by a car

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.539 
I suppose oh I've been crushed by a car
that's<00:01:24.850> a<00:01:24.970> shame<00:01:25.860> I'm<00:01:26.860> currently<00:01:27.250> playing

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
that's a shame I'm currently playing

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.359 
that's a shame I'm currently playing
with<00:01:27.820> the<00:01:28.229> gyroscopic<00:01:29.229> controls<00:01:29.320> as<00:01:29.860> I<00:01:30.070> say

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
with the gyroscopic controls as I say

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.760 
with the gyroscopic controls as I say
and<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:32.020> I<00:01:32.350> am<00:01:32.560> leaning<00:01:33.280> Oh<00:01:33.430> get<00:01:34.090> out<00:01:34.180> the<00:01:34.299> way<00:01:34.390> I

we go so I'm leaning forward and

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.530 
we go so I'm leaning forward and
backwards<00:01:46.149> by<00:01:46.299> tilting<00:01:46.509> right<00:01:46.899> and<00:01:47.200> left<00:01:47.799> and

some rastafarians on there as well for

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.590 
some rastafarians on there as well for
good<00:02:15.400> measure<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:17.800> bikes<00:02:18.310> are<00:02:18.600> upgradable

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
good measure the bikes are upgradable

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.580 
good measure the bikes are upgradable
there<00:02:19.750> are<00:02:19.810> a<00:02:19.840> couple<00:02:19.960> of<00:02:20.080> different<00:02:20.380> bikes

there are a couple of different bikes

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.670 
there are a couple of different bikes
and<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.490> paths<00:02:22.230> kind<00:02:23.230> of<00:02:23.320> differ<00:02:23.530> as<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:24.330> blow

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
and the paths kind of differ as to blow

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.940 
and the paths kind of differ as to blow
the<00:02:26.680> paths<00:02:27.100> differ<00:02:27.670> as<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.740> which<00:02:29.740> way<00:02:29.890> you

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
the paths differ as to which way you

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.430 
the paths differ as to which way you
want<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.250> go<00:02:30.340> ever<00:02:30.550> so<00:02:30.820> slightly<00:02:31.450> sometimes<00:02:32.230> as

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
want to go ever so slightly sometimes as

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.040 
want to go ever so slightly sometimes as
well<00:02:32.620> so<00:02:32.800> that<00:02:32.920> means<00:02:33.100> that<00:02:33.360> for<00:02:34.360> example<00:02:34.420> you

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
well so that means that for example you

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.480 
well so that means that for example you
might<00:02:35.920> jump<00:02:36.250> over<00:02:36.700> an<00:02:36.820> obstacle<00:02:36.940> oh<00:02:38.490> right

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
might jump over an obstacle oh right

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.190 
might jump over an obstacle oh right
Dolan<00:02:39.940> something<00:02:40.270> I<00:02:40.390> might<00:02:40.660> be<00:02:40.750> able<00:02:40.840> to<00:02:40.960> jump

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
Dolan something I might be able to jump

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.020 
Dolan something I might be able to jump
over<00:02:41.560> an<00:02:41.650> obstacle<00:02:41.770> if<00:02:42.220> I<00:02:42.310> get<00:02:42.460> a<00:02:42.490> better<00:02:42.700> bike

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.520 

rather<00:02:46.030> than<00:02:46.210> have<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.540> kind<00:02:46.720> of<00:02:46.750> navigate<00:02:47.080> my

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
rather than have to kind of navigate my

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.730 
rather than have to kind of navigate my
way<00:02:47.560> around<00:02:48.310> it<00:02:48.580> so<00:02:49.150> for<00:02:49.720> example<00:02:49.810> I<00:02:50.200> might<00:02:50.230> be

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
way around it so for example I might be

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.800 
way around it so for example I might be
able<00:02:50.800> to<00:02:50.950> jump<00:02:51.220> that<00:02:51.460> without<00:02:51.910> having<00:02:52.300> to<00:02:52.450> stop

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
able to jump that without having to stop

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.040 
able to jump that without having to stop
if<00:02:53.080> I<00:02:53.470> can<00:02:53.680> get<00:02:54.130> a<00:02:54.190> better<00:02:54.450> again<00:02:55.450> get<00:02:55.810> a<00:02:55.840> better

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
if I can get a better again get a better

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.440 
if I can get a better again get a better

different ways so yes there's you know
times<00:03:18.940> to<00:03:19.300> get<00:03:19.510> to<00:03:20.020> the<00:03:20.200> end<00:03:20.320> of<00:03:20.440> each<00:03:20.530> stage

times to get to the end of each stage

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.030 
times to get to the end of each stage
and<00:03:21.420> that<00:03:22.420> will<00:03:22.600> whoa<00:03:22.930> that<00:03:23.560> was<00:03:23.650> all<00:03:23.800> skill

and that will whoa that was all skill
obviously<00:03:25.770> there<00:03:26.770> are<00:03:26.800> times<00:03:27.340> to<00:03:27.550> get<00:03:27.730> to<00:03:27.820> the

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
obviously there are times to get to the

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.060 
obviously there are times to get to the
end<00:03:28.000> of<00:03:28.090> each<00:03:28.180> stage<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:28.780> that's<00:03:29.500> one<00:03:29.890> of<00:03:29.920> the

measured upon so you know the length of

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.520 
measured upon so you know the length of
the<00:03:45.160> jump<00:03:45.489> the<00:03:45.730> amount<00:03:45.970> of<00:03:46.150> degrees<00:03:46.630> spun<00:03:47.290> in

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
the jump the amount of degrees spun in

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.620 
the jump the amount of degrees spun in
the<00:03:47.680> air<00:03:47.860> that's<00:03:48.580> sort<00:03:48.970> of<00:03:49.060> a<00:03:49.150> deal<00:03:49.300> so<00:03:49.480> let's

different area the visuals I really like
I<00:05:04.970> think<00:05:05.270> they're<00:05:05.420> quite<00:05:05.630> like<00:05:06.320> dirty<00:05:06.980> and

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
I think they're quite like dirty and

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.460 
I think they're quite like dirty and
gritty<00:05:07.580> and<00:05:07.790> I<00:05:07.940> quite<00:05:08.150> like<00:05:08.390> that<00:05:08.420> the<00:05:09.110> frame

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
gritty and I quite like that the frame

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.740 
gritty and I quite like that the frame
rate<00:05:09.650> isn't<00:05:09.890> a<00:05:10.310> fantastic<00:05:11.060> it<00:05:11.180> does<00:05:11.330> start<00:05:11.660> to

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
rate isn't a fantastic it does start to

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.090 
rate isn't a fantastic it does start to
chug<00:05:12.080> a<00:05:12.110> little<00:05:12.410> bit<00:05:12.530> when<00:05:12.680> there's<00:05:12.860> quite<00:05:13.070> a

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
chug a little bit when there's quite a

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.380 
chug a little bit when there's quite a
lot<00:05:13.280> of<00:05:13.400> stuff<00:05:13.580> going<00:05:13.610> on<00:05:13.940> on<00:05:14.060> the<00:05:14.150> screen

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
lot of stuff going on on the screen

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.260 
lot of stuff going on on the screen
however<00:05:15.200> I<00:05:15.650> should<00:05:16.250> also<00:05:16.550> sort<00:05:16.910> of<00:05:16.970> preface

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
however I should also sort of preface

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.760 
however I should also sort of preface
this<00:05:17.450> by<00:05:17.510> saying<00:05:17.690> that<00:05:18.080> the<00:05:18.200> build<00:05:18.470> that<00:05:18.650> I'm

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
this by saying that the build that I'm

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.830 
this by saying that the build that I'm
playing<00:05:19.070> at<00:05:19.190> the<00:05:19.250> moment<00:05:19.550> is<00:05:19.850> not<00:05:20.120> quite<00:05:20.780> the

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
playing at the moment is not quite the

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.550 
playing at the moment is not quite the
final<00:05:21.500> version<00:05:21.650> so<00:05:22.100> there<00:05:22.250> is<00:05:22.400> the<00:05:23.150> chance<00:05:23.960> for

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
final version so there is the chance for

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.250 
final version so there is the chance for
that<00:05:24.800> to<00:05:25.070> improve<00:05:25.670> by<00:05:26.570> the<00:05:26.660> time<00:05:26.870> that<00:05:26.990> it<00:05:27.020> does

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
that to improve by the time that it does

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:34.740 
that to improve by the time that it does

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:49.160 
checkpoint so you don't have to start at

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.640 
checkpoint so you don't have to start at
the<00:06:49.340> end<00:06:49.460> of<00:06:49.580> each<00:06:49.760> stage<00:06:50.290> at<00:06:51.290> the<00:06:51.380> start<00:06:51.590> of

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:51.650 
the end of each stage at the start of

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.990 
the end of each stage at the start of
each<00:06:51.740> stage<00:06:52.010> if<00:06:52.160> you<00:06:52.220> don't<00:06:52.400> want

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.000 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.360 

there<00:06:55.600> are<00:06:55.720> also<00:06:55.870> touch<00:06:56.680> controls<00:06:57.070> but<00:06:57.280> I

there are also touch controls but I

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.500 
there are also touch controls but I
don't<00:06:57.520> think<00:06:57.700> that<00:06:57.880> they're<00:06:58.060> particularly

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:58.510 
don't think that they're particularly

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.740 
don't think that they're particularly
very<00:06:58.900> good<00:06:59.170> but<00:07:00.040> these<00:07:00.240> tilt<00:07:01.240> ones<00:07:01.480> are

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:01.750
