00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:07.770
 very satisfied with the victory because 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.200
 many times these matches are at risk 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.900
 also foolish because obviously i 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.199
 workloads we only have so many 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.090
 as we said this morning we did 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:19.410
 a very heavy strength session 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.580
 in short, we have also seen enough 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.470
 but planted more than anything else these 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.390
 matches are needed to start giving a 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.400
 bit of playing time 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.969
 obviously then you meet teams that 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.469
 maybe they put their soul into it 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.790
 morning meeting the teams of 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.489
 top players categories of 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.010
 superior category so obviously 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:44.180
 like normality wants in football 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.730
 in summer they are treacherous matches and 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.340
 despite this we won by 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.880
 winning is always beautiful 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.560
 the controversies are avoided and therefore e 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.300
 so okay it's okay that we are 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.100
 working very well I am very happy 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.469
 of the group 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.650
 yes yes no but in these friendlies I have 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.180
 all mixed up for me is not that matters 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.850
 who goes on the field but counts who goes in 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.670
 field is certainly not 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.680
 number of minutes to allow 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.830
 minutage in the legs because in short there is 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.650
 we approach the Italian cup where 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.600
 Unfortunately 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.240
 eight players will have to stay on the field 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.270
 for 90 minutes then inevitably e 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.179
 first look for one and then the art 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.060
 to put some minutes in the legs 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:33.399
 no no I had done for nothing but us 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.570
 I particularly care because anyway 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:40.539
 an important competition for us 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.650
 very important fundamental game 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:45.710
 because anyway 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:49.690
 the starting point of a season la 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.690
 first official match e 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:56.280
 and rewarding to win and reward 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.130
 get over a round and it's rewarding 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.270
 make the first match in front of yours 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.650
 public the official match in front of 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.870
 your audience 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.970
 trying to win by trying to pass 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.400
 the turn then then from there to the beginning 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.209
 changed there is still a long time 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.140
 the goal of going second 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:23.390
 turn to play turin so it's one thing 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:25.250
 beautiful stage you will see 30 and then lonedo 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.080
 round and the history of football teaches us 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.040
 that many times to build one 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.230
 team made up of big names though 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.730
 then you realize that maybe they are not 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.400
 they are functional to what he wants 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.069
 the coach or are not functional one 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.810
 with the other then it is normal that if 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.610
 let's go see the friendlies he is 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.400
 doing cagliari in this in this 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.349
 season between first and second half but ne 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.540
 would miss a third because to men a 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.549
 Enough to do three formations e 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.890
 all important players but then from 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.420
 there to say that killing the championship 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.720
 and this passes by 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.010
 also because I think there will be many 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.810
 teams there are so many teams that 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.560
 however they are equipped are the 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.959
 usual outsiders 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.450
 however the championship is difficult long 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.489
 and certainly has some important chances 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.910
 because the players I was what they are 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:17.040
 players at this wrong I love to think 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.220
 that my team should be 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.019
 absolutely in the first band always 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.599
 because I like to start with the mentality 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.269
 some guys so we start at 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.340
 think of him as first class 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:33.680
 why think of being strong not with 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.680
 presumption but with with 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.280
 the desire to get far this is 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.100
 a starting point for sure 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.660
 important so I will try to 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.130
 transmit in the players' heads e 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.340
 also this thing that the 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.450
 team is a great team that if the 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.500
 can play with anyone 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:57.080
 the purchases have arrived, maybe they are 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.120
 all very good guys then they will have to 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.850
 demonstrate on the field how it should 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.360
 demonstrate the coach in the field though 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.300
 we have a 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.910
 definitely a great team 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.400
 but then as always in football for the 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.920
 But the important field mentality 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.700
 we start from start to do well 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.890
 he says we mean first 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.750
 one of the eight teams that must enter 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.340
 in short, the playoffs are not the first 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.160
 Once I missed I think so 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.690
 I think it's a pretty good team 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.590
 strong that it can achieve this 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.210
 target 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:35.850
 then the championship story will speak from 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:39.780
 alone is not always giving to start well 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:42.210
 because even last year happened that 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.640
 the team started a little late and 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.680
 did a little trouble not to recover 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:50.700
 it succeeded to the end and therefore 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:54.680
 I think it will be fundamental to leave 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:56.790
 good start but I believe all in all 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.020
 if we go to see the men of 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.280
 pescara are 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:05.310
 they are good players that they are 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.819
 arrived I decided together with the 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.759
 society but of course there is always mine 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:16.370
 guarantee and as for your tour of 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:16.370
 sandals and here I say it and here I confirm it
