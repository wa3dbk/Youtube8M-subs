00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
so of course this benchmark test is

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.510 
so of course this benchmark test is
going<00:01:06.540> through<00:01:06.990> tunnel<00:01:07.380> different<00:01:07.860> things

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
it's trying out as with all benchmark

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.830 
it's trying out as with all benchmark
tests<00:01:13.440> that's<00:01:14.190> how<00:01:14.370> they<00:01:14.550> do<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.910> that's<00:01:15.630> on

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
a video like this without a phone for

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.290 
a video like this without a phone for
hit<00:01:21.660> caps<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.229> not<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.250> latest<00:01:23.640> version<00:01:23.790> like

different score I don't know it in my

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.740 
different score I don't know it in my
head<00:01:28.860> right<00:01:28.890> now<00:01:29.100> but<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.940> do<00:01:30.030> have<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.330> video<00:01:30.570> on

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
head right now but I do have a video on

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.080 
head right now but I do have a video on
it<00:01:30.900> single<00:01:31.710> course<00:01:31.950> corner<00:01:32.310> on<00:01:32.490> assistive<00:01:32.910> on

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
it single course corner on assistive on

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.620 
it single course corner on assistive on
multi-core<00:01:34.490> 2776<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.670> mean<00:01:35.820> yeah<00:01:36.330> I<00:01:36.360> don't

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
multi-core 2776 I mean yeah I don't

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.810 
multi-core 2776 I mean yeah I don't
think<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:37.080> they<00:01:37.200> change<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:38.190> don't<00:01:38.759> think

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
think that they change it I don't think

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.320 
think that they change it I don't think
that<00:01:39.090> they<00:01:39.240> stop<00:01:39.780> much<00:01:40.050> improved<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.890> mean<00:01:41.330> it

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
that they stop much improved I mean it

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.700 
that they stop much improved I mean it
probably<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.899> little<00:01:43.080> bit<00:01:43.170> better<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.500> can

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
probably is a little bit better you can

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.109 
probably is a little bit better you can

people always want to have the best I

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.810 
people always want to have the best I
mean<00:02:08.100> if<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.269> can<00:02:09.479> get<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.810> best<00:02:10.019> in<00:02:10.500> phone<00:02:11.280> in

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
mean if you can get the best in phone in

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.729 
mean if you can get the best in phone in
terms<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.120> processor<00:02:12.600> and<00:02:12.989> everything<00:02:13.350> people

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
terms of processor and everything people

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.620 
terms of processor and everything people
want<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.040> deep<00:02:14.250> even<00:02:14.850> though<00:02:15.000> they<00:02:15.450> may<00:02:15.600> not

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
want that deep even though they may not

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.479 
want that deep even though they may not
see<00:02:15.870> big<00:02:16.110> difference<00:02:16.470> in<00:02:16.590> travel<00:02:16.739> games<00:02:17.070> they

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
see big difference in travel games they

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.330 
see big difference in travel games they
always<00:02:17.730> want<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:17.940> be<00:02:18.290> they<00:02:19.290> have<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.830> feeling

always want to be they have the feeling
that<00:02:20.750> that's<00:02:21.750> future<00:02:22.470> proof<00:02:22.739> and<00:02:23.040> that

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
that that's future proof and that

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.550 
that that's future proof and that
definitely<00:02:23.790> it's<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.630> nice<00:02:24.810> little<00:02:24.989> feeling

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560
