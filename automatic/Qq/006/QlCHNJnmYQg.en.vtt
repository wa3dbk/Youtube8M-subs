mixture<00:02:56.600> between<00:02:57.080> two<00:02:57.440> tins<00:02:57.709> equally

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.320 

now<00:03:14.470> these<00:03:14.650> go<00:03:14.920> into<00:03:15.100> the<00:03:15.400> oven<00:03:15.520> for<00:03:15.790> 20<00:03:16.180> to<00:03:16.300> 25

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
now these go into the oven for 20 to 25

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.220 
now these go into the oven for 20 to 25
minutes

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
minutes

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.500 
minutes
keep<00:03:17.680> checking<00:03:17.920> see<00:03:18.490> when<00:03:18.730> they<00:03:18.880> go<00:03:19.090> golden

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
keep checking see when they go golden

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.090 
keep checking see when they go golden
around<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:20.080> take<00:03:20.230> them<00:03:20.380> out<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:20.740> check<00:03:20.950> them

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
around and take them out and check them

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.810 
around and take them out and check them
with<00:03:21.190> a<00:03:21.220> toothpick<00:03:23.070> again<00:03:24.070> while<00:03:24.310> my<00:03:24.460> cake<00:03:24.700> is

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
with a toothpick again while my cake is

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.760 
with a toothpick again while my cake is
baking<00:03:25.150> I'm<00:03:25.300> going<00:03:25.480> to<00:03:25.630> make<00:03:25.750> my<00:03:25.900> icing<00:03:26.410> icing

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
baking I'm going to make my icing icing

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.470 
baking I'm going to make my icing icing
takes<00:03:27.250> extra<00:03:27.580> quite<00:03:27.820> some<00:03:28.000> time<00:03:28.240> to<00:03:28.390> make

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
takes extra quite some time to make

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.150 
takes extra quite some time to make
reduces<00:03:28.960> coconut<00:03:29.440> milk<00:03:29.650> so<00:03:29.800> it<00:03:29.860> takes<00:03:30.040> a<00:03:30.130> bit

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
reduces coconut milk so it takes a bit

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.690 
reduces coconut milk so it takes a bit
longer<00:03:30.310> to<00:03:30.610> whip<00:03:30.970> so<00:03:31.570> first<00:03:32.110> of<00:03:32.320> all<00:03:32.470> bowl<00:03:32.830> and

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
longer to whip so first of all bowl and

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.970 
longer to whip so first of all bowl and
we're<00:03:33.820> going<00:03:33.850> to<00:03:34.060> mix<00:03:34.330> our<00:03:34.540> icing<00:03:35.200> sugar<00:03:35.440> with

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
we're going to mix our icing sugar with

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.670 
we're going to mix our icing sugar with
butter<00:03:36.730> sugar<00:03:39.540> here<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:40.900> a<00:03:41.050> few<00:03:41.320> the<00:03:41.470> butter

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
butter sugar here and a few the butter

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.100 
butter sugar here and a few the butter
so<00:03:42.010> it's<00:03:42.130> easier<00:03:42.459> to<00:03:42.520> mix<00:03:42.730> I'll<00:03:43.660> just<00:03:43.810> place

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
so it's easier to mix I'll just place

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.320 
so it's easier to mix I'll just place
that<00:03:44.140> in<00:03:44.380> here<00:03:44.830> and<00:03:45.130> once<00:03:46.030> it's<00:03:46.209> all

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330
