00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.899
 and a very fast life 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.330
 and shortly we only have to 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.490
 interconnect the magnetron result and 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:23.099
 ccoo with the resistance impulse of 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.099
 he made thrones and cops ready 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:34.349
 they are precisely that is how you can go towards 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.349
 forward stop action slow motion 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.520
 and reverse 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:46.990
 and well what do you think of our invention 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.990
 we're going to try it 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:58.340
 but now he does not give or return a 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.340
 50 page report I'll never finish 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.270
 strange I never took a reading course 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.270
 fast 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.760
 I have to wash so many dishes that one can 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.760
 watch my favorite soap opera 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:28.360
 I guess everything can be done if one 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.040
 he proposes it and the invention of living 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.320
 okay Mr. Wilson we have that we 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.330
 they presented the cookie for the children 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.330
 I must finish wallpapering the walls 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.280
 the world 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.430
 and I had forgotten I ate them 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:12.580
 during lunch 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.580
 They were golden brown stuffed with raspberries 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.240
 because the raspberries are my 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.540
 favorites 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:29.710
 george wilson two hours have elapsed 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.710
 and you have not done anything yet it 's true 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.960
 I feel so tired 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.930
 very well margÃ¡in 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.239
 it must be the Swan Lake ' 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.650
 tell him I see an ugly duck and this is 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.650
 when hunting ducks 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.390
 with the 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:08.680
 I do not know but it's getting late 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.680
 we better return to our homes 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.470
 now that we have more time 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.290
 we just jump to the bank dreams 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.480
 fast friend of mine slows down his 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.319
 ambulatory displacement presses the 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.319
 slow motion button 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.730
 what is happening it seems that we are 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.730
 walking in slow motion 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.230
 stop 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:52.050
 baby they could catch him and he has put a 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.050
 cookie that I did not imagine has happened to them 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.500
 I'm sure the boys are 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.520
 plotting something but what 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.770
 if you are 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.590
 without coming I do not know how they did it but 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:09.350
 I want to work more quickly remember 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.350
 I did something like that and then something like that 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:16.989
 as to help you decide is 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.810
 refers to my new time adjuster 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.600
 he did not consider it wise wilson already 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.720
 it's working like in the beginning 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:30.160
 I assume all good responsibility in 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:32.790
 that case if you insist camera lights 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.790
 action 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.280
 Faster Faster 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:48.910
 this is just what I had to do 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:55.599
 ah 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:03.630
 we will do the only truly sensible thing 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.630
 we will leave here immediately 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.840
 what happens will happen to him I hope 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.770
 what do you speak
