00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:04.399
 takes put 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.510
 3 on fornix 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.770
 start you were seated on the same day 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.750
 emperor and intensive care our children and so this is a very beautiful one 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.959
 addition of this on the counter 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:18.900
 I leave my alarm clock getting stuck and when I do that leaves the fastest 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.250
 both were done about five or so times to reach a quarter past 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.710
 seven started 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.910
 I have collected what I could guess and result-oriented 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.930
 it is the sixth grade but athletes born in the capital collapsed 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.980
 Around that time also at my door says a cruise 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.130
 goes that negative message that it is but I am glad that I am 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.330
 happiest 40s and 50s it will be no different I am staying busy 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.989
 the stock markets the line limburg 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.649
 sitting on the couch without electricity for twelve in the afternoon so it is one 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.510
 weak market in the so-called opinion on the way the others 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.480
 hits in the snow from November 18 every Sunday to see rtl 5 the most beautiful 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:02.479
 what is and remains a fragment i don't know what i said i moved tomorrow 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.499
 to blame the office yes I do not come to anyone 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.980
 we have to do 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.120
 but i hope it is all possible we go to another club 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.100
 why 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.100
 unfortunate but understandable 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.000
 Did you know that this trend will remain intact 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.080
 no manual just yourself yes no manual and that goes anyway 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.620
 nowhere about what you get and experiences 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.760
 van zeijl and that makes sense of course that he needs a part on the ground and the 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.050
 rest must be on top 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.650
 but how it pleases must first and how the actual problem how plan 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.570
 went on say so learns say the pipes in the sense of 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.450
 or let the boys pick up like that after which an elevator started so very cool 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.690
 to take the lead and there came solo over days above the day of looking up 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.230
 these were set up there at the earliest 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.520
 inside out 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.640
 Gandzasar Kapan is doing it naturally when claimed to be running Rijense 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.640
 and I just say they are only nine seconds away 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.329
 the city 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:08.509
 that can this is that is nothing for our range eye in that country give up against it 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.489
 phone call the container with several employees has run out again 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.889
 Israel This was not yours to join in with the letters in the snow 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:18.729
 I didn't know anything about it in the studio and a joke it was just back to 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:19.609
 Canada 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:22.679
 afp ka bah amg a madhouse 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:27.449
 those with canada still have a few things to watch for over five years 

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:32.569
 Amsterdam if you have the ability to riots that outbreaks we want to watch me 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.039
 I think I mean I am telling all my friends a similar one 

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.839
 action 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:38.300
 in addition, commotion 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.889
 musical 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:44.689
 in completely flat can do a thermal underwear and the ski meant against virton 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.879
 muppets movie and I looked like some fool out there at the airport 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.889
 calendar driven a must 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:54.649
 I like what happened to what was on your morning moment we could have done 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:55.679
 with a helicopter 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:58.679
 it was a nice day in your head that buzzards buy 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.269
 yes there i can log on the day were wolfsburg in the silver finally 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.629
 in the snow but yes because there was just no breeder mother nothing was not 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:10.409
 and then not as a high mountain and that was a very annoying 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.620
 traffic controller and dying I saw in the trailer 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.499
 but partially all 

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:19.509
 and i am looking forward to people yes very scarce i would say go and work 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:22.229
 at a time when we are full of the building 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:25.959
 then in the rest of world finals it was still a bit strange 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.699
 for a moment and was getting closer 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:30.449
 and then martijn from the park said a grandmother that move 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:33.249
 and that was difficult because there was still a bit for ladies but that one 

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:37.219
 should be taken it is mainly about the party after the first 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:40.219
 run to the moon 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:44.590
 disagree on twitter 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.589
 even when the children leave 

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:50.589
 the 

00:03:55.869 --> 00:04:00.069
 liters of diesel through an area where there were also wild animals and therefore amounts to 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.549
 Martin had made in the villa would have forgotten which molds would go 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.059
 protect like a hive jeetje with batman film protect yourself in utrecht 

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:11.059
 was studying the device a canister of pepper spray 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.279
 no one was hurt that how many people we were there with the most 

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:19.000
 fifteenth this measure would ensure that a bus would come 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.620
 under a new four mountain jeths ​​for young ajax 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.849
 juncker 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:26.889
 6 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.889
 goals 

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:35.979
 for the Portuguese trainer 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:38.979
 I think that was in the tail 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.490
 witness saw that about homophilia record what a nauseous you have to surrender 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.050
 think about it yourself 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.510
 yes it is a new campaign its name they could give our information and 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:06.039
 so you see that you can actually take it to the driver 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:09.619
 This is surely due to the sessions a paper reads or you are in the area 

00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:13.889
 walk around around three o'clock you see you feel you smell but if you have to be saved 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:14.520
 to become 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.660
 but I think that is quite difficult to think of as reference time 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:18.420
 write 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.610
 third was also far from sounding to let the police know 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.729
 Saturday it is a club with a good place is well put together 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:27.259
 just like what he says bart 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:30.409
 that is it is now in a different way for example missing out 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:32.790
 usually about what year we have 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.250
 And if you get information there and you don't mind once 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.670
 does not experience it 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.610
 we were there and there we also got a species that is looking for a replacement 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:42.400
 to be 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.150
 the train line that happened here this is a nice thing I see here 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.430
 Different things have seen different things even before that 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.339
 so then it is 

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:54.439
 anyway it would be easier to put that on paper to your fellow people 

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:58.539
 unhealthy food for 2010, but that has been going white for almost two years 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:05:59.639
 to step 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:02.550
 i am going to god my son now i want to participate 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.379
 I have seen that where the share has fallen I hope that maria but 

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:09.850
 how do you go no further than anywhere else first episode I think there 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:13.990
 I am grateful to him that I am very satisfied with this nonsense so I made a move 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.259
 my work in i can not be more than this number not found with him 

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:21.099
 3 but there is also a program involving this 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:25.429
 no there does more to the farmer looking for farmer will not go to gaza lukaku that 

00:06:25.429 --> 00:06:26.060
 consists of 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.219
 jealous of 

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:28.990
 examination by various bruises 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.050
 Friday was the national park near the shots farmer year for months on behalf 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.430
 the weird things justify the goal 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.380
 that is clear from nothing against gays was reason to understand me not wrong 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.020
 but babysitter consists of 3 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.909
 let the municipality know 

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:44.409
 work it out tomorrow they will want to leave the wb races about thanks for you 

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:46.219
 coming a studio you are you 

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:49.960
 that you look through the trees the next Sunday at least look at old ones 

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:53.869
 senseo hero 5 what do you expect in terms of ratings I think it goes 

00:06:53.869 --> 00:06:57.909
 explode and if it did not explode I am nice and free to the day one 

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:00.349
 farewell drink is much laughter 

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:04.710
 this would thereby be yesterday after exchange of those costs are still in bed now 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.870
 we were here in the morning called thank you guys forest is still there 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.090
 suspected of being recognized for two years by the region
