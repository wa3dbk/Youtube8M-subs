almost<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:51.050> same<00:01:51.200> thing<00:01:51.260> with<00:01:51.620> the<00:01:51.650> Eco

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
almost the same thing with the Eco

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.600 
almost the same thing with the Eco
Mobius<00:01:52.370> they<00:01:53.270> made<00:01:53.480> it<00:01:53.600> fully<00:01:54.310> upgradeable<00:01:55.310> so

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
Mobius they made it fully upgradeable so

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.460 
Mobius they made it fully upgradeable so
you<00:01:55.700> buy<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:55.910> shell<00:01:56.240> with<00:01:56.990> a<00:01:57.020> certain<00:01:57.320> amount

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
you buy the shell with a certain amount

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.380 
you buy the shell with a certain amount
of<00:01:57.620> specification<00:01:58.070> so<00:01:58.340> you<00:01:58.430> want<00:01:58.580> a<00:01:58.730> quad-core

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
of specification so you want a quad-core

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.240 
of specification so you want a quad-core
processor<00:01:59.930> and<00:02:00.080> later<00:02:00.260> on<00:02:00.410> a<00:02:00.650> octa-core

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
processor and later on a octa-core

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.560

you can just simply remove your

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.220 
you can just simply remove your
processor<00:02:04.010> and<00:02:04.190> replace<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:04.910> processor<00:02:05.360> and

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
processor and replace the processor and

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.360 
processor and replace the processor and
then<00:02:06.440> just<00:02:06.590> pay<00:02:06.770> for<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.010> price<00:02:07.160> of<00:02:07.310> the

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
then just pay for the price of the

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.619 
then just pay for the price of the
processor<00:02:07.760> versus<00:02:08.030> paying<00:02:08.209> for<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:08.420> price<00:02:08.599> of

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
processor versus paying for the price of

processor versus paying for the price of
a<00:02:08.810> new<00:02:08.840> phone

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
a new phone

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.020 
a new phone
it's<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:09.679> great<00:02:09.950> beautiful<00:02:10.340> concept<00:02:10.819> it's

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
it's a great beautiful concept it's

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.030 
it's a great beautiful concept it's
still<00:02:11.180> a<00:02:11.209> concept<00:02:11.599> they<00:02:11.749> have<00:02:11.840> not<00:02:11.989> told<00:02:12.859> us

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
still a concept they have not told us

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.440 
still a concept they have not told us
whether<00:02:13.280> they<00:02:13.459> are<00:02:13.489> going<00:02:13.639> to<00:02:13.700> release<00:02:14.030> it<00:02:14.269> or

they're working on it they just said

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:16.869 
they're working on it they just said
that<00:02:15.950> this<00:02:16.040> is<00:02:16.129> a<00:02:16.159> concept<00:02:16.549> that<00:02:16.670> they

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
that this is a concept that they

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.520 
that this is a concept that they
researched<00:02:17.689> about<00:02:17.840> and<00:02:18.139> they're<00:02:18.260> talking

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
researched about and they're talking

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.830 
researched about and they're talking
about<00:02:18.590> at<00:02:18.950> CES<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:19.549> let's<00:02:19.700> talk<00:02:19.849> about<00:02:19.909> cameras

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
about at CES so let's talk about cameras

about at CES so let's talk about cameras
geo<00:02:21.170> not<00:02:21.349> a<00:02:21.379> French<00:02:21.739> company<00:02:21.920> showed<00:02:22.310> off<00:02:22.519> a

geo not a French company showed off a
360-degree<00:02:23.359> action<00:02:23.870> camera<00:02:24.230> I<00:02:24.409> think<00:02:24.799> this<00:02:24.920> is

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
360-degree action camera I think this is

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.140 
360-degree action camera I think this is
one<00:02:25.069> of<00:02:25.159> the<00:02:25.219> best<00:02:25.370> cameras<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:25.819> have<00:02:25.969> been

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
a large 105 inch or an 85 n sighs what

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:13.719 
a large 105 inch or an 85 n sighs what
this<00:04:12.319> does<00:04:12.530> is<00:04:12.709> that<00:04:12.889> if<00:04:13.280> you<00:04:13.400> are<00:04:13.430> sitting<00:04:13.579> in

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:13.729 
this does is that if you are sitting in

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:14.809 
this does is that if you are sitting in
the<00:04:13.789> center<00:04:13.969> of<00:04:14.120> the<00:04:14.269> screen

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
the center of the screen

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.090 
the center of the screen
the<00:04:15.180> curve<00:04:15.420> will<00:04:15.629> actually<00:04:16.079> keep<00:04:16.350> a<00:04:16.620> distance

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
the curve will actually keep a distance

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.569 
the curve will actually keep a distance
on<00:04:17.430> both<00:04:17.459> sides<00:04:17.880> of<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:19.530> LCD<00:04:19.979> from<00:04:20.310> your<00:04:20.430> eyes

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
on both sides of the LCD from your eyes

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.999 
on both sides of the LCD from your eyes
so<00:04:20.850> both<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.780> edges<00:04:22.079> of<00:04:22.229> the<00:04:22.320> television<00:04:22.680> are

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:23.009 
so both the edges of the television are

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:24.680 
so both the edges of the television are
equidistant<00:04:23.550> from<00:04:23.580> your<00:04:23.820> eyes<00:04:23.970> which<00:04:24.660> makes

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
equidistant from your eyes which makes

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.640 
equidistant from your eyes which makes
it<00:04:25.110> a<00:04:25.310> fantastic<00:04:26.310> fantastic<00:04:26.900> design<00:04:27.900> if<00:04:28.139> you

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650
