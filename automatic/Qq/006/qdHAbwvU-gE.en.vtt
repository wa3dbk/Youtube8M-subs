00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.540
 hello i am today with cÃ©line 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.820
 from peckham christian 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.719
 then you surely have a bag all 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.300
 simple that you would like 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.519
 customize to your liking celine goes 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.190
 show you how to customize a bag 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.210
 without sewing yes so to customize a 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.039
 bag at a glance 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.930
 that's what we need we need a 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:27.330
 iron absorbent paper from the 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.890
 colt to my fixed to white this loan a little 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.109
 bag so that's the bag we want that 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.940
 Ostomy is a fabric with patterns 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.170
 so here it's actually a standby 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.390
 duvet that we found in the bottom of the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.309
 cupboard and recycled in there 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.230
 discovering patterns so we arranged 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.750
 the paper towel to protect our 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.809
 table and we will come and take our 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.899
 Cat patterns upside down so we put it to 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.770
 upside down on the absorbent paper 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.079
 then we take the hot melt glue 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.379
 years and we will close the restless until time 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.379
 of the ball 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.510
 so here we open it and now 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.359
 we are actually sprayed at about 20 cm 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:10.080
 homogeneous layer distance on the 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:13.650
 pattern gently here and so now 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.549
 we come to take our motives and the 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.810
 ask where you want on the bag and so 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.640
 that we will not apply iron to 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.299
 ironing the glue is not final 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:29.430
 we also do the same with the flower and we 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.930
 the pose also on the bag so here 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.189
 now to definitely paste 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.869
 our reasons we have only one 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.549
 step it's the iron 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.900
 so we preheat the iron 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.400
 in average position so two points 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.850
 then we will protect our motives 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.920
 with a fine cotton fabric like these 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.710
 and there is nothing left to do but iron 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.280
 iron for about 40 seconds 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.130
 by supporting and doing 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.729
 rotation movements 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:02.909
 so we remove the protective fabric 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.290
 gently and we'll let it cool to 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.930
 about a minute and now my 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:11.039
 check that it fits so there we see 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.660
 that's fine, and that's our bag 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.120
 is ready so we customized in less than 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.159
 five minutes 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.200
 a bag of little girls but it works 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:19.810
 also with all the cloth objects 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.340
 we can customize t-shirts sags 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.340
 pants everything is possible
