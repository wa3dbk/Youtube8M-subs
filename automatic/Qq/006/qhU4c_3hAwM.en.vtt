00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 today my name is martin bureau and 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.390
 Welcome to the few guys 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.950
 The last week was very sad 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.960
 go on because may 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.730
 who was previously reported that was 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.769
 that is how it works is unfortunately 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.170
 deceased 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.180
 so here's my think button in 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.279
 the last issue of staff for 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.210
 Of course, my deepest condolences to the 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.890
 family 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.330
 Of course, wang was a great one 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.410
 us-marine and may you rest in peace 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.140
 I have it last week 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.059
 reported like ryback on twitter 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.460
 pretty peculiar news 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.260
 has left it now too 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.640
 already with the latest course, more 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.680
 but he has news 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.450
 At the same time, he hopes that all his 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.370
 has deleted messages because its 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.899
 twitter-account was hacked 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.360
 however, there are already 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.309
 is new again because is currently 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.050
 I just claim that 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.899
 transformed 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.309
 because on the right side it should be like that right now 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.980
 get a crazy neck and 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.930
 this twitter story should go there 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.750
 also subtract there are reports about it 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.150
 that will change to a new one 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.860
 that's very clear, that's more likely 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.170
 a bit weird why last 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.360
 thing on twitter is running and also who the 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.060
 last main event issue has seen 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.159
 will see that something was up there 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.860
 every case in planning is the whole thing 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.270
 is probably about castle and 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.680
 That's why you really need it there 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.250
 do not worry about it 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.270
 Still, it's a bit strange 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.189
 possibilities new character of the 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.860
 summit to create a new gimmicks 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.780
 but good is something else writes 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.670
 your opinion in the comments 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.960
 then there were two more this week 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.040
 wants times 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.960
 on the one hand genius and naomi of the 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.670
 married funky lids 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.470
 The relationship of the Rhine was already 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.490
 in the series death it was more than 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.740
 lit enough 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.580
 So for all people the great the what 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.790
 have not seen you look 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.820
 especially against germany because on 27 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.010
 January will also be on the German channel 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.560
 define who does not want it 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:06.310
 So, like in Germany , that means sky 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.960
 can you do great the next thing 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.970
 week from 27 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.410
 looking at january will definitely do something 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.940
 for all people is not seen yet 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.860
 at all with the maybe the 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.110
 not necessarily it would be incredible 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.760
 ball and entertaining is on everyone 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.870
 better than jungle camp so on 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.610
 switch on every case 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.100
 during an interview with the wwe 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.870
 have magazin bring and nikki bella 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.910
 it is omitted that it even 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.660
 Not so bad would add the choice 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.560
 between a wwe divas tag team title 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.930
 use 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.890
 they thought that this was so creative and 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.800
 be talented to be stopped 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.570
 so in liberec the title really is 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.459
 in no case, now bad 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.230
 Enough that love with the title you 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.209
 at the moment have nothing to start 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.090
 and now also a tag team title 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:57.010
 to introduce so that maybe yes 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:59.800
 fields twins naomi and cameron and 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.600
 tamina maybe and as a team could 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.360
 maybe you also nice helga and 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.840
 the change in her pretty soon 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:12.100
 the really cool as techteam with 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:16.170
 but on the day of the woman that is 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:18.670
 but so let me leave a little 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.220
 just at the wwe official too 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.040
 not so big bieberau fans are going 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.650
 I do not suppose that happens and 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.660
 Really often experienced that you believe that 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.519
 something really make sense but then 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.430
 he would even more time the tv 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:35.500
 get and this already too much anyway 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.510
 any fan who does not know the 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.310
 skip the league match if you are 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.720
 Not all live point that 's the time 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.160
 where people go to the toilet 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.250
 I do not know if that 's even higher 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.110
 should set 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.480
 definitely a very strange one 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.030
 just step in a time where everyone 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.280
 To unite titles you need now 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.780
 nine for the love that I would 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.610
 as perfect idiocy selects 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.360
 already normal communities in the 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.220
 Comments 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.750
 and the boxing for this week down here 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.760
 Can you still remember the last two? 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.200
 watch duos videos give the thumb 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.790
 high if you enjoyed the video and 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.390
 Of course, subscribe in no case 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.150
 to forget 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.510
 we are at the next video and 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.510
 skin 3
