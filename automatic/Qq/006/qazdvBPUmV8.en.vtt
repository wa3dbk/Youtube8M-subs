everything<00:01:17.000> going<00:01:17.300> on<00:01:17.540> it<00:01:17.780> was<00:01:17.960> executed<00:01:18.590> very

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
everything going on it was executed very

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
nicely it looks like they drew out

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.600 
nicely it looks like they drew out
little<00:01:20.479> concept<00:01:20.960> arts<00:01:21.320> and<00:01:21.530> just<00:01:21.770> did<00:01:22.040> it<00:01:22.190> you

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
little concept arts and just did it you

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.520 
little concept arts and just did it you
know<00:01:22.729> made<00:01:22.940> in<00:01:23.090> to<00:01:23.240> forge<00:01:23.479> my<00:01:23.840> favorite<00:01:24.350> thing

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
know made in to forge my favorite thing

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.170 
know made in to forge my favorite thing
was<00:01:24.680> the<00:01:24.740> off<00:01:25.009> balance<00:01:25.460> of<00:01:25.580> standing<00:01:26.030> within

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
was the off balance of standing within

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.460 
was the off balance of standing within
the<00:01:26.300> plane<00:01:26.630> always<00:01:26.960> like<00:01:27.200> it<00:01:27.350> when<00:01:27.380> people

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
the plane always like it when people

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.800 
the plane always like it when people
turn<00:01:27.979> the<00:01:28.250> I<00:01:28.640> guess<00:01:28.880> a<00:01:28.910> flat<00:01:29.270> surfaces

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
turn the I guess a flat surfaces

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.200 
turn the I guess a flat surfaces
sideways<00:01:30.320> and<00:01:30.619> it<00:01:30.710> gives<00:01:30.950> us<00:01:31.130> really<00:01:31.430> a<00:01:31.640> weird

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
sideways and it gives us really a weird

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.180 
sideways and it gives us really a weird
feeling<00:01:32.450> of<00:01:32.690> distortion<00:01:33.260> it<00:01:33.380> makes<00:01:33.590> you<00:01:33.799> I

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
feeling of distortion it makes you I

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.890 
feeling of distortion it makes you I
don't<00:01:34.490> know<00:01:34.549> it<00:01:34.700> has<00:01:34.850> this<00:01:35.030> feeling<00:01:35.450> to<00:01:35.600> it<00:01:35.690> and

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
don't know it has this feeling to it and

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.840 
don't know it has this feeling to it and
I<00:01:36.170> also<00:01:36.320> enjoy<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:36.830> barricades<00:01:37.250> that<00:01:37.490> you

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
I also enjoy the barricades that you

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.190 
I also enjoy the barricades that you
know<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.090> zombies<00:01:38.360> have<00:01:38.479> to<00:01:38.570> break<00:01:38.750> down<00:01:38.930> and

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
know the zombies have to break down and

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.380 
know the zombies have to break down and
get<00:01:39.409> past<00:01:39.680> and<00:01:40.010> any<00:01:40.340> like<00:01:40.490> some<00:01:40.670> survival<00:01:41.180> maps

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
get past and any like some survival maps

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.390 
get past and any like some survival maps
have<00:01:41.659> struggled<00:01:42.110> with<00:01:42.140> in<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.470> past<00:01:42.680> the<00:01:43.220> map

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400

for your teammates and really work
together<00:01:50.210> to<00:01:50.689> survive<00:01:50.869> but<00:01:51.110> you<00:01:51.439> know<00:01:51.650> it<00:01:51.770> is

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
together to survive but you know it is

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.070 
together to survive but you know it is
possible<00:01:52.430> which<00:01:52.610> I<00:01:52.729> really<00:01:52.909> do<00:01:53.090> like<00:01:53.299> the<00:01:53.900> map

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
consists of only a few areas but you

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.120 
consists of only a few areas but you
know<00:01:56.750> interesting<00:01:57.229> spots<00:01:57.470> at<00:01:57.619> affinia<00:01:57.860> prompt

the<00:01:58.670> outdoor<00:01:59.210> area<00:01:59.540> sort<00:01:59.990> of<00:02:00.080> a<00:02:00.170> difficult

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
the outdoor area sort of a difficult

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.410 
the outdoor area sort of a difficult
spot<00:02:00.890> to<00:02:01.130> defend<00:02:01.400> from<00:02:01.580> but<00:02:01.820> if<00:02:01.939> everyone<00:02:02.270> has

their<00:02:02.540> pistols<00:02:02.930> out<00:02:03.110> it<00:02:03.259> could<00:02:03.380> be<00:02:03.500> worth<00:02:03.680> a

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
their pistols out it could be worth a

their pistols out it could be worth a
fight<00:02:04.100> for<00:02:04.430> a<00:02:04.580> little<00:02:04.790> while<00:02:05.000> until<00:02:05.210> you<00:02:05.360> run

fight for a little while until you run
out<00:02:05.600> of<00:02:05.750> ammo<00:02:06.140> the<00:02:06.560> top<00:02:06.770> of<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:06.950> ship<00:02:07.100> is<00:02:07.220> also

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
out of ammo the top of the ship is also

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.070 
out of ammo the top of the ship is also
a<00:02:07.490> place<00:02:07.700> for<00:02:07.909> the<00:02:07.970> flood<00:02:08.269> to<00:02:08.450> leap<00:02:08.690> on<00:02:08.899> and

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
a place for the flood to leap on and

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.289 
a place for the flood to leap on and
attack<00:02:09.350> unsuspecting<00:02:10.190> humans<00:02:10.549> and<00:02:10.759> survivors

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299 
attack unsuspecting humans and survivors

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:13.330 
attack unsuspecting humans and survivors
there's<00:02:11.840> also<00:02:12.019> spots<00:02:12.440> around<00:02:12.650> within<00:02:13.130> the

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
there's also spots around within the

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.250 
there's also spots around within the
ship<00:02:13.400> or<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.820> middle<00:02:14.180> of<00:02:14.299> the<00:02:14.390> ship<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:14.780> then

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
ship or the middle of the ship and then

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.930 
ship or the middle of the ship and then
within<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.769> main<00:02:15.950> area<00:02:16.190> which<00:02:16.519> is<00:02:16.700> probably

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
within the main area which is probably

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.280 
within the main area which is probably
where<00:02:17.150> most<00:02:17.209> people<00:02:17.720> will<00:02:17.900> choose<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:18.260> I

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
where most people will choose and I

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.690 
where most people will choose and I
really<00:02:18.530> like<00:02:18.680> this<00:02:18.829> map<00:02:19.010> because<00:02:19.190> usually

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
really like this map because usually

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.330 
really like this map because usually
it's<00:02:20.450> hard<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:20.840> have<00:02:20.989> a<00:02:21.019> map<00:02:21.290> that's<00:02:21.500> large<00:02:21.920> and

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
it's hard to have a map that's large and

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.850 
it's hard to have a map that's large and
you<00:02:22.610> know<00:02:22.730> work<00:02:23.209> for<00:02:23.450> only<00:02:23.959> small<00:02:24.320> amounts<00:02:24.500> of

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
you know work for only small amounts of

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.410 
you know work for only small amounts of
people<00:02:25.100> but<00:02:25.190> this<00:02:25.370> map<00:02:25.549> it<00:02:25.940> can<00:02:26.090> work<00:02:26.239> with

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
people but this map it can work with

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.090 
people but this map it can work with
like<00:02:26.600> three<00:02:26.870> four<00:02:27.380> and<00:02:27.410> then<00:02:27.739> it<00:02:27.860> could<00:02:27.950> also

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
like three four and then it could also

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.460 
like three four and then it could also
work<00:02:28.370> for<00:02:28.430> sixteen<00:02:29.150> people<00:02:29.360> I<00:02:29.750> really<00:02:30.290> love

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
work for sixteen people I really love

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.920 
work for sixteen people I really love

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
that and there's also a major tears tear

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.569 
that and there's also a major tears tear
on<00:02:33.049> the<00:02:33.140> side<00:02:33.350> and<00:02:33.530> when<00:02:33.980> i<00:02:34.010> was<00:02:34.160> playing<00:02:34.370> this

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
on the side and when i was playing this

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.520

people you're playing with to watch out

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
so before I let the gameplay roll

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.600 
so before I let the gameplay roll
without<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.320> commentary<00:02:52.830> so<00:02:53.100> you<00:02:53.160> can<00:02:53.340> kind<00:02:53.550> of

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
without a commentary so you can kind of

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.010 
without a commentary so you can kind of
understand<00:02:54.030> if<00:02:54.150> this<00:02:54.300> is<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.480> map<00:02:54.810> worth

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
understand if this is a map worth

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.140 
understand if this is a map worth
downloading<00:02:55.260> um<00:02:55.830> you<00:02:56.730> know<00:02:56.760> I'm<00:02:56.910> just<00:02:57.000> going

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
downloading um you know I'm just going

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.820 
downloading um you know I'm just going
to<00:02:57.180> give<00:02:57.300> you<00:02:57.360> a<00:02:57.420> tip<00:02:57.570> or<00:02:57.690> two<00:02:57.810> like<00:02:58.440> all<00:02:58.590> maps

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
to give you a tip or two like all maps

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.860 
to give you a tip or two like all maps
is<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.070> good<00:02:59.280> tactic<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.730> stick<00:02:59.970> together<00:03:00.090> watch

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
is a good tactic to stick together watch

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.450 
is a good tactic to stick together watch
for<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.290> barricades<00:03:01.740> because<00:03:02.100> they<00:03:02.250> can't

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
for the barricades because they can't

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.920 
for the barricades because they can't
break<00:03:02.580> them<00:03:02.730> down<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.150> that's<00:03:03.300> how<00:03:03.510> you<00:03:03.570> will
