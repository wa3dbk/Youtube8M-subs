they<00:00:57.059> said<00:00:57.300> password<00:00:57.899> input<00:00:58.500> was<00:00:58.739> complete<00:00:59.250> I

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
they said password input was complete I

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.590 
they said password input was complete I
thought<00:01:00.059> so

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
thought so

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.569 
thought so
you<00:01:00.989> said<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.350> password<00:01:01.590> entry<00:01:02.219> into<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
you said the password entry into the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.700 
you said the password entry into the
black<00:01:02.789> case<00:01:03.180> had<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.960> be<00:01:03.989> made<00:01:04.409> by<00:01:04.650> the

president willingly that's right

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.899 
president willingly that's right
so<00:01:07.500> this<00:01:07.680> means<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.250> president<00:01:08.790> is
