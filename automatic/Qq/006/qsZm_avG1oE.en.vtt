00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
there VIPRE 25 100 point one which is

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.370 
there VIPRE 25 100 point one which is
2,500<00:00:25.859> watts<00:00:25.949> at<00:00:26.220> 2<00:00:26.369> ohms<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:27.539> speakers<00:00:28.050> are

on the speaker is 6 inches in 3/8 so

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.990 
on the speaker is 6 inches in 3/8 so
what<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.809> did<00:00:48.899> was<00:00:49.260> just<00:00:49.289> add<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.770> 3/4<00:00:50.670> piece<00:00:50.879> of
