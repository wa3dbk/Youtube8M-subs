last year you know I'm mulched a lot and

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.110 
last year you know I'm mulched a lot and
I<00:02:56.690> had<00:02:56.840> a<00:02:56.870> big<00:02:57.290> problem<00:02:57.709> with<00:02:57.799> rodents<00:02:58.190> from

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
I had a big problem with rodents from

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.839 
I had a big problem with rodents from
some<00:02:59.390> of<00:02:59.510> that<00:02:59.599> mulching<00:03:00.410> and<00:03:00.769> I<00:03:01.280> also<00:03:01.459> didn't

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
some of that mulching and I also didn't

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.390 
some of that mulching and I also didn't
have<00:03:01.940> things<00:03:02.180> in<00:03:02.360> nice<00:03:02.540> orderly<00:03:03.290> rows<00:03:03.680> that

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
have things in nice orderly rows that

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.009 
have things in nice orderly rows that
probably<00:03:05.090> could<00:03:05.239> have<00:03:05.299> used<00:03:05.390> at<00:03:05.780> things<00:03:05.930> like

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
probably could have used at things like

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.050 
probably could have used at things like
carrots<00:03:06.440> and<00:03:06.560> onions<00:03:06.829> and<00:03:07.040> so<00:03:07.640> I<00:03:07.670> wasn't<00:03:07.910> able

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.430 
carrots and onions and so I wasn't able
to<00:03:08.239> weed<00:03:08.390> them<00:03:08.510> and<00:03:08.810> they<00:03:09.019> just<00:03:09.230> didn't

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
to weed them and they just didn't

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.720 
to weed them and they just didn't
perform<00:03:09.530> that<00:03:09.890> well<00:03:09.950> carrots<00:03:10.430> just<00:03:10.549> got

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
perform that well carrots just got

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.569 
perform that well carrots just got
killed<00:03:11.000> by<00:03:11.180> those<00:03:11.329> voles<00:03:12.010> anyway<00:03:13.010> here<00:03:13.340> so

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.949 
here's one that's kind of a combination
a<00:03:15.500> little<00:03:15.680> more<00:03:15.799> traditional<00:03:16.389> spacing<00:03:17.389> so<00:03:17.900> I

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
a little more traditional spacing so I

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.309

hour<00:03:38.239> or<00:03:38.359> two<00:03:38.389> ago<00:03:38.630> so<00:03:38.810> hopefully<00:03:39.079> those<00:03:39.230> will

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:15.670 
so a little 12-volt pump there's a

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.060 
so a little 12-volt pump there's a
gravity<00:07:16.210> feed<00:07:16.450> hose<00:07:17.020> coming<00:07:17.590> down<00:07:17.770> from<00:07:17.950> a

whole garden really really happy with

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:38.430 
whole garden really really happy with
that<00:07:37.450> system<00:07:37.690> so<00:07:38.050> I'm<00:07:38.170> going<00:07:38.290> to<00:07:38.320> actually

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:38.440 
that system so I'm going to actually

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.690 
that system so I'm going to actually
build<00:07:38.710> a<00:07:38.830> few<00:07:38.980> more<00:07:39.130> of<00:07:39.190> those<00:07:39.250> cards<00:07:39.580> for

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:39.700 
build a few more of those cards for

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.640 
build a few more of those cards for
other<00:07:39.790> parts<00:07:40.090> on<00:07:40.240> the<00:07:40.300> property<00:07:40.720> and<00:07:40.870> have

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:41.650 
other parts on the property and have

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.160 
other parts on the property and have
little<00:07:41.830> 12-volt<00:07:42.280> power<00:07:42.340> points<00:07:42.960> so<00:07:43.960> yeah

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:44.170 
little 12-volt power points so yeah

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:45.690 
little 12-volt power points so yeah
here's<00:07:44.560> the<00:07:44.710> garden<00:07:45.010> this<00:07:45.280> one's<00:07:45.490> going<00:07:45.580> to<00:07:45.640> be

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:45.700 
here's the garden this one's going to be

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.300 
here's the garden this one's going to be
squash<00:07:46.090> and<00:07:46.330> stuff<00:07:46.480> like<00:07:46.660> that<00:07:47.220> coming<00:07:48.220> up

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:48.310 
squash and stuff like that coming up

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:49.740 
squash and stuff like that coming up
soon<00:07:48.490> sticking<00:07:48.970> with<00:07:49.060> that<00:07:49.090> same<00:07:49.390> theory

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:49.750 
soon sticking with that same theory

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:50.970 
soon sticking with that same theory
digging<00:07:50.020> the<00:07:50.080> good<00:07:50.260> soil<00:07:50.440> out<00:07:50.710> where<00:07:50.890> i'm

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:50.980 
digging the good soil out where i'm

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.230 
digging the good soil out where i'm
going<00:07:51.100> to<00:07:51.130> walk<00:07:51.280> on<00:07:51.550> it<00:07:51.700> and<00:07:51.820> i<00:07:51.880> need<00:07:52.030> to<00:07:52.120> do

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:52.240 
going to walk on it and i need to do

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.940 
going to walk on it and i need to do
that<00:07:52.270> throw<00:07:52.810> it<00:07:52.900> up<00:07:52.990> on<00:07:53.080> top<00:07:53.140> of<00:07:53.440> the<00:07:53.500> beds<00:07:53.680> I

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:53.950 
that throw it up on top of the beds I

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.860 
that throw it up on top of the beds I
tend<00:07:54.640> to<00:07:54.700> just<00:07:54.760> bury<00:07:55.150> whatever<00:07:55.510> is<00:07:55.630> under

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:55.870 
tend to just bury whatever is under

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.620 
tend to just bury whatever is under
there<00:07:55.990> that<00:07:56.170> one<00:07:56.290> has<00:07:56.580> big<00:07:57.580> logs<00:07:58.060> under<00:07:58.480> there

00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:58.630 
there that one has big logs under there

00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:59.850 
there that one has big logs under there
but<00:07:58.810> then<00:07:58.960> it<00:07:59.080> was<00:07:59.140> overgrown<00:07:59.410> with<00:07:59.530> grass<00:07:59.680> and

00:07:59.850 --> 00:07:59.860 
but then it was overgrown with grass and

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.560 
but then it was overgrown with grass and
I<00:08:00.040> just<00:08:00.220> flip<00:08:00.400> all<00:08:00.550> that<00:08:00.700> grass<00:08:00.910> and<00:08:00.970> I<00:08:01.120> bury<00:08:01.420> it

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:01.570 
I just flip all that grass and I bury it

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.780 
I just flip all that grass and I bury it
and<00:08:01.720> I<00:08:01.780> know<00:08:01.840> it's<00:08:02.050> going<00:08:02.140> to<00:08:02.200> come<00:08:02.380> back<00:08:02.790> but

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:03.790 
and I know it's going to come back but

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.300 
and I know it's going to come back but
I'm<00:08:03.910> able<00:08:04.120> to<00:08:04.680> keep<00:08:05.680> it<00:08:05.830> clear<00:08:06.040> around<00:08:06.160> the

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:06.310 
I'm able to keep it clear around the

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.550 
I'm able to keep it clear around the
plants<00:08:06.580> that<00:08:06.700> need<00:08:06.730> to<00:08:06.910> be<00:08:06.970> kept<00:08:07.210> clear<00:08:07.450> so<00:08:07.810> all

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560 
plants that need to be kept clear so all
