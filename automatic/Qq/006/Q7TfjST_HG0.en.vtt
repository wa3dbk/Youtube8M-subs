00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.649 
happens is that you actually get more
points<00:04:48.229> if<00:04:48.800> you<00:04:49.009> do<00:04:49.250> the<00:04:49.460> opposite<00:04:50.000> thing<00:04:50.060> so

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:50.659 
points if you do the opposite thing so

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:53.230 
points if you do the opposite thing so
like<00:04:50.840> I<00:04:51.110> got<00:04:51.469> like<00:04:51.680> 600<00:04:52.190> evil<00:04:52.789> points<00:04:53.030> because

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
like I got like 600 evil points because

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.060 
like I got like 600 evil points because
I<00:04:53.360> was<00:04:53.479> really<00:04:53.630> good

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070
