00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.359
 good all of two to a new video 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.370
 good one of the pending issues that 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:08.560
 I was probably left of xbox that was 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.450
 talk about his command and well he we know 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.220
 one of the last details maybe that 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.780
 they were missing for knowing good we're going to 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.430
 explain a little bit above good I'm 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.439
 seeing the image on the screen of what 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.859
 be good, let's start with 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:23.560
 perhaps the changes more visible than the 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:26.619
 button x for example is no longer 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.900
 above and it seems that is a button 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.819
 not even decoration because it seems to work 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.880
 remember that in the original xbox 360 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:35.800
 what we were doing is being able to go to 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.200
 menu and that kind of stuff we do not know how 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.660
 they will replace it or if it is kind of 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.520
 adornment will then have a function in the in 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.880
 the future and they will change it or something for the 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.340
 style is not very clear yet 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.680
 we may even have to go 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.970
 to the menu through the kinect and the service 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.680
 the one that seems to be going to be 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.660
 mandatory to play and 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.610
 possibly because the best thing we have to 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.020
 go to the menu with command I have fire for 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.910
 the style we have to not expect that 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.610
 be with the command and well let's move on 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.610
 also to one of the details also 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.950
 singular , good 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.950
 it seems that the triggers of each 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.920
 trigger will have a kind of vibration 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.300
 individual in which for example in a 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.700
 driving game and tele then 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.170
 we will have a vibration when it comes to 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.510
 slow down and a different one at the time of 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.000
 accelerate it or something that really was a 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.190
 much more improved experience the 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.470
 shooters because something will also happen for the 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.840
 style but good we already know all that 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.700
 this kind of thing a little accuracy 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.080
 and surely everyone deactivates it 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.700
 but well I think for the game of 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.000
 they drive and yes yes that can be 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.360
 a great innovation in that good sense 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.119
 the crosshead change the way you see 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.770
 totally much improved before then 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.869
 for example with games like street 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.000
 fighter and such because you could hardly play 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.640
 well I for example I can not with that 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.710
 The recipe he gave me gave me a lot of disgust and 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.330
 well now we're going to do that is 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.149
 totally different and thanks to the one who has 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.979
 much improved much much according to comments 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.140
 everyone who has tried it 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.940
 is much more improved and now it seems 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.220
 be that more is possible to play games of 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.080
 really struggle because 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.540
 so it was needed you already know that 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.210
 for fighting games a lot of people 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.590
 We use what is perhaps the crosshead and 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.070
 that 's not enough when it comes to playing 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.260
 in xbox another of the changes you already know the 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.270
 button back and being are no longer they are now 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.270
 two different but that will have the 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:29.420
 same functions are new names 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:32.060
 will be view the one on the left and less the 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.250
 on the right with which they remain 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.050
 changed the names and such the 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.190
 joysticks the I am according to says the 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.320
 people also who have tried it and such 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.940
 that are a little smaller than you 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.040
 adapt improve the finger and such and good 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.690
 We will see to see everyone know to try it 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.720
 everything we say here does not have 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.190
 sense until we test the command and 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.860
 so good also what has changed 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.440
 you know is the x the a la bea and the ay 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.380
 the design of the drawings and such now 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.300
 has the effect well 3d and well then nothing 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.070
 more kids are already the review to the control 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.260
 I think it's good to highlight you in the 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.180
 comments if you like an augusta this 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.470
 new command design and see you in the 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.470
 next video is approaching chao
