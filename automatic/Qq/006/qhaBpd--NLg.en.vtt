00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.600 
we can get mad at him about it's just
you<00:06:41.660> know<00:06:41.750> repeating<00:06:42.290> the<00:06:42.890> training<00:06:43.370> and<00:06:43.550> all

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
you know repeating the training and all

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.100 
you know repeating the training and all
that<00:06:43.760> stuff<00:06:44.000> but<00:06:44.210> the<00:06:44.330> most<00:06:44.480> difficult<00:06:44.660> thing

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110 
that stuff but the most difficult thing

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.980 
that stuff but the most difficult thing
I<00:06:45.230> think<00:06:45.260> aside<00:06:45.680> from<00:06:45.830> the<00:06:45.950> training<00:06:46.340> has<00:06:46.520> been

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:46.990 
I think aside from the training has been

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.090 
I think aside from the training has been
teaching<00:06:47.990> my<00:06:48.080> children<00:06:48.440> how<00:06:48.590> to<00:06:48.650> care<00:06:48.860> for<00:06:48.890> an
