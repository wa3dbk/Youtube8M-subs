in my opinion Brock Lesnar needs to go

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.190 
in my opinion Brock Lesnar needs to go
two<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.000> two<00:01:45.329> since<00:01:46.140> he's<00:01:46.290> come<00:01:46.530> back<00:01:46.590> uh<00:01:48.200> and

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
two and two since he's come back uh and

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.380 
two and two since he's come back uh and
I<00:01:49.439> agree<00:01:49.979> with<00:01:50.220> your<00:01:50.399> theory<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:51.060> giving

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
I agree with your theory of giving

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.539 
I agree with your theory of giving
Lesnar<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.110> first<00:01:52.350> two<00:01:52.590> wins<00:01:52.860> in<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.189> left<00:01:53.399> I

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
Lesnar the first two wins in the left I

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.080 
Lesnar the first two wins in the left I
think<00:01:53.790> when<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.119> third<00:01:54.360> man<00:01:54.770> but<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:56.130> don't<00:01:56.909> see

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
think when the third man but I don't see

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.760 
think when the third man but I don't see
any<00:01:57.240> way<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.479> can<00:01:57.719> let<00:01:57.899> CM<00:01:58.200> Punk<00:01:58.469> win<00:01:58.649> this

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
any way you can let CM Punk win this

get some credibility back because WWE

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.159 
get some credibility back because WWE
has<00:04:04.709> completely<00:04:05.099> shot<00:04:05.459> that<00:04:05.729> as<00:04:06.690> far<00:04:06.840> as<00:04:06.900> in

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:07.169 
has completely shot that as far as in

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:10.280 
has completely shot that as far as in
the<00:04:07.290> wrestling<00:04:07.680> world<00:04:07.829> um<00:04:08.599> you<00:04:09.599> know<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:10.169> it

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
the wrestling world um you know and it

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.869 
the wrestling world um you know and it
does<00:04:10.470> so<00:04:10.500> that<00:04:10.889> there's<00:04:11.069> no<00:04:11.159> stipulation

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
does so that there's no stipulation

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:13.520 
does so that there's no stipulation
because<00:04:12.150> that<00:04:12.510> would<00:04:12.959> have<00:04:12.989> made<00:04:13.169> it<00:04:13.319> a<00:04:13.379> lot

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
because that would have made it a lot

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.110 
because that would have made it a lot
more<00:04:13.590> believable<00:04:14.190> that<00:04:14.370> punk<00:04:14.669> was<00:04:14.849> using

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
more believable that punk was using

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.360 
more believable that punk was using
weapons<00:04:15.329> um<00:04:15.780> punk<00:04:16.349> just<00:04:16.590> beaten<00:04:16.859> Lesnar<00:04:17.039> in<00:04:17.280> a

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
weapons um punk just beaten Lesnar in a

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.479 
weapons um punk just beaten Lesnar in a
straight-up<00:04:17.669> match<00:04:18.000> doesn't<00:04:18.570> make<00:04:19.470> any<00:04:19.829> sense

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
straight-up match doesn't make any sense

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.250 
straight-up match doesn't make any sense
at<00:04:20.820> all<00:04:20.849> I<00:04:21.359> mean<00:04:21.510> you<00:04:21.630> wouldn't<00:04:21.840> even<00:04:21.930> it<00:04:22.079> made

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
at all I mean you wouldn't even it made

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.529 
at all I mean you wouldn't even it made
sense<00:04:22.469> before<00:04:22.710> Lesnar's<00:04:23.430> UFC<00:04:23.909> days<00:04:24.120> because

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
sense before Lesnar's UFC days because

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.990 
sense before Lesnar's UFC days because
Punk<00:04:24.930> has<00:04:25.110> no<00:04:25.320> wrestling<00:04:25.830> background

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
Punk has no wrestling background

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.620 
Punk has no wrestling background
um<00:04:27.090> so<00:04:28.020> they<00:04:28.800> got<00:04:28.980> a<00:04:29.010> if<00:04:29.850> they're<00:04:30.150> not<00:04:30.270> gonna<00:04:30.420> go

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
um so they got a if they're not gonna go

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.030 
um so they got a if they're not gonna go
with<00:04:30.720> the<00:04:30.810> stipulation<00:04:31.110> they<00:04:31.500> got<00:04:31.650> to<00:04:31.740> go<00:04:31.860> with

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
with the stipulation they got to go with

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.040 
with the stipulation they got to go with
something<00:04:32.310> where<00:04:32.730> I'm<00:04:32.940> like<00:04:33.390> Bruce<00:04:33.660> said<00:04:33.900> you

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
maybe like he passes out or something

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.460 
maybe like he passes out or something
