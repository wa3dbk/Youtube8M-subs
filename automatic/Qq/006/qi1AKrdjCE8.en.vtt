00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.029
 today we have survival kitchen that 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.630
 we can prepare with a tomato a 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.000
 pepper and a little chicken breast 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:15.259
 Nothing anything as simple as a 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.259
 delicious rice with chicken 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.600
 we started this recipe by cutting the 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.760
 pepper I used a piece of 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.520
 pepper and we're going to cut it first in 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.650
 strips and then we turn it around and what 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.230
 we cut into squares the more 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.660
 small we cut it better it will be for 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.190
 then the sofrito not find us in 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.829
 tripping we are going to peel 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.930
 a tomato I like to use tomato 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.510
 because then there is a little bit more 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.750
 juicy and once we have it peeled 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.020
 we cut it into rooms and take away the 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.159
 part 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.190
 hard part 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.620
 steak masters 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.260
 and we like him with pepper 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.870
 we take a turn and cut on the other 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.180
 we already have enough pieces 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.810
 small to cook in a pan 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.810
 we put a splash of oil and added 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.360
 the pepper and the tomato and we're going to 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.700
 let cook over low heat about 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.620
 minutes meanwhile let's go 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.080
 cutting the chicken I used a 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.850
 chicken breast 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.980
 to which we give some cuts so that 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.980
 we stay more or less in the da2 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.100
 as you can see the vegetables have already been cooked 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.180
 enough and we add the chicken we move it 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.370
 a little 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.380
 and let cook a couple of minutes 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.150
 before adding a little bit of paprika 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.130
 I used paprika 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.600
 sweet smoked but you can use 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.220
 any other 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.939
 and we let it cook a couple of 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.530
 minutes more and let's sauté a little the 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.909
 There are some who say that rice is not necessary 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.069
 but the truth is that I like it 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.130
 sauté the rice if you do not like it 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.920
 you can skip this step without problem 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.230
 I cook it 34 minutes before adding 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.750
 the broth remember that the broth always 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.900
 it has to be hot boiling hot 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.970
 when we are going to add it is double 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.020
 a little more broth than rice and 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.620
 we 're going to leave it for 15 minutes 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.080
 and let it boil as you see it go see 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.340
 perfectly the bubbles 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.460
 rectify salt if it is 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.620
 necessary and after 15 minutes this 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.390
 is the result we are going to cover it and the 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.370
 let's leave five more minutes covered 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.710
 so that it ends up being done 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.500
 perfectly rice 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:51.170
 and this is how we have stayed so that 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.630
 See, I'm going to serve a ration this 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.520
 given for three servings this rice 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.930
 and this is the result I hope that you 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.930
 have liked until another 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:07.080

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.080
 waiting is part of the team
