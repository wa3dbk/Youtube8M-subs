00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
that wraps all the way around and the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.710

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
way that you do that is right within the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.469 
way that you do that is right within the
pocket<00:01:25.400> right<00:01:26.400> down<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.880> very<00:01:27.060> part<00:01:27.390> of

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
pocket right down in the very part of

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.450 
pocket right down in the very part of
the<00:01:27.540> lower<00:01:28.080> part<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.500> pocket<00:01:28.740> you're<00:01:29.340> just

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
the lower part of the pocket you're just

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.219 
the lower part of the pocket you're just
gonna<00:01:29.549> pull<00:01:29.909> up<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.780> then<00:01:31.079> it's

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
gonna pull up on that and then it's

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.640 
gonna pull up on that and then it's
gonna<00:01:31.430> adjust<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:33.210> band<00:01:33.479> down<00:01:33.750> there<00:01:34.110> so

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
gonna adjust the band down there so

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.770 
gonna adjust the band down there so
again<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.250> doesn't<00:01:35.610> go<00:01:35.700> way<00:01:36.000> down<00:01:36.270> which<00:01:36.600> I

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
again it doesn't go way down which I

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.120 
again it doesn't go way down which I
like<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.079> doesn't<00:01:37.530> interfere<00:01:37.740> with<00:01:37.950> the

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
like so doesn't interfere with the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.910 
like so doesn't interfere with the
harness<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.729> pockets<00:01:39.210> are<00:01:39.390> cut<00:01:39.630> high<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.770> if

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
harness the pockets are cut high so if

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.319 
harness the pockets are cut high so if
you<00:01:41.040> are<00:01:41.159> wearing<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.549> harness<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.970> you've<00:01:42.119> got

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
you are wearing a harness and you've got
