00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.000
Sustainable and cheap.
These are two of the characteristics

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.130
of a new type of cement
created by a team of researchers.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.320
The new product, which
is being tested in a laboratory,

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.530
opens business possibilities
for the ceramics industry.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:20.070
This cement is made only
of one waste product: ceramics waste.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.770
An activador solution
is also used,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.940
so it does not contain
portland cement.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.400
Since it doesn't contain portland
cement, the CO2 emissions are reduced

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.160
to make more
sustainable cement.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.840
This product uses waste from bricks
and other ceramic materials.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.820
It has been created
by researchers of the UPV,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.890
the Universitat Jaume I of Castellon,
the Imperial College of London

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.660
and the Universidade Estadual
Paulista of Sao Paulo, in Brazil.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.300
Its strenght is verified.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.040
This is a product
with compressive strenght

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.420
similar or even superior
to original portland cement mortars,

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.150
with a short
period of curing.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.610
It could be used
for prefabricated materials

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.520
or different applications.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.750
From the enviromental point of view,
it is also very important.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.230
The new cement could increase
the value of the ceramics industry.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.090
To manufacture it, researchers have
done tests using waste from bricks,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.280
sanitary ware and porcelain
stoneware, and demolition waste.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.060
We take waste and the starting
material, that was bricks

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.570
and we grind them.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.300
Once they are ground,
we pound the dust

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.060
to reduce the size of the particle,
make it very fine so it can react.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.250
Then, we prepare
a solution

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.900
mixing sodium hydroxide,
hydroxide silicate and water,

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.900
and we mix it
with the brick,

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.240
so a series of reactions
happen, connections break,

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.790
new connections happen and a binder
with cement properties is formed.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.290
It is like portland cement
but without adding portland cement.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.780
Then, we add the aggregate
to create mortar.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.730
The new cement has more strength
than some of other conglomerates today.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.930
The research results
have been published

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.460
in Construction and Building
Materials, an industry magazine.
