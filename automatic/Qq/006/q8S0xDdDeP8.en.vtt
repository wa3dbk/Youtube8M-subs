excellent<00:02:01.570> now<00:02:02.560> we're<00:02:03.040> looking<00:02:03.280> to<00:02:03.370> do<00:02:03.490> an<00:02:03.610> mp4

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
excellent now we're looking to do an mp4

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.640 
excellent now we're looking to do an mp4
like<00:02:04.360> I<00:02:04.450> just<00:02:04.660> mentioned<00:02:04.990> so<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.440> output

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
like I just mentioned so the output

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.740 
like I just mentioned so the output
container<00:02:06.310> which<00:02:06.610> is<00:02:06.729> the<00:02:06.820> output<00:02:06.970> folder<00:02:07.390> has

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
container which is the output folder has

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.020 
container which is the output folder has
to<00:02:07.990> be<00:02:08.080> an<00:02:08.170> MP<00:02:08.440> for<00:02:09.600> now<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.890> output<00:02:12.760> video

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
to be an MP for now the output video

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:19.020 
to be an MP for now the output video
codec<00:02:13.600> should<00:02:13.810> be<00:02:15.120> basically<00:02:17.340> h.264<00:02:18.340> /<00:02:18.670> ABC

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
codec should be basically h.264 / ABC

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.620 
codec should be basically h.264 / ABC
and<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:21.610> audio<00:02:22.180> should<00:02:22.570> be<00:02:22.690> AAC<00:02:23.110> i<00:02:24.510> set<00:02:25.510> my

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
and the audio should be AAC i set my

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.870 
and the audio should be AAC i set my
video<00:02:25.900> scale<00:02:26.200> size<00:02:26.410> to<00:02:26.620> 640<00:02:27.130> by<00:02:27.250> 480<00:02:27.640> that's

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
video scale size to 640 by 480 that's

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.360 
video scale size to 640 by 480 that's
really<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.209> best<00:02:28.800> aspects<00:02:29.800> should<00:02:29.890> be<00:02:30.010> 4<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.340> 3

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
really the best aspects should be 4 to 3

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.810 
really the best aspects should be 4 to 3

second 1248 this is important because

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.830 
second 1248 this is important because
the<00:02:44.230> faster<00:02:44.709> you<00:02:45.070> download<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:46.360> festa<00:02:46.720> you

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
the faster you download the festa you

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.620 
the faster you download the festa you
convert<00:02:47.820> it<00:02:48.820> could<00:02:49.150> diminish<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.600> quality

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
convert it could diminish the quality

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.170 
convert it could diminish the quality
because<00:02:50.350> it's<00:02:51.070> doing<00:02:51.400> it<00:02:51.489> faster<00:02:51.880> if<00:02:51.970> it<00:02:52.060> does

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
because it's doing it faster if it does

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.600 
because it's doing it faster if it does
a<00:02:52.209> slower<00:02:52.540> chance<00:02:53.440> it'll<00:02:53.709> be<00:02:53.890> it'll<00:02:54.280> come<00:02:54.489> out

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
a slower chance it'll be it'll come out

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.270 
a slower chance it'll be it'll come out
like<00:02:54.760> a<00:02:54.970> better<00:02:55.360> file<00:02:55.690> so<00:02:56.590> it's<00:02:56.950> somewhere

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
like a better file so it's somewhere

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.699 
like a better file so it's somewhere
like<00:02:57.430> in<00:02:57.459> between<00:02:57.670> 1248<00:02:58.630> from<00:02:59.050> experiences

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
like in between 1248 from experiences

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.220 
like in between 1248 from experiences
has<00:02:59.890> been<00:03:00.340> good<00:03:01.120> that's<00:03:01.300> worked<00:03:01.510> for<00:03:01.690> me<00:03:01.810> and

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
has been good that's worked for me and

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.600 
has been good that's worked for me and
you<00:03:02.470> go<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.650> tweak<00:03:02.920> this<00:03:03.100> and<00:03:03.280> play<00:03:03.400> around

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
you go to tweak this and play around

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.410 
you go to tweak this and play around
with<00:03:03.760> it<00:03:03.790> but<00:03:04.030> this<00:03:04.269> is<00:03:04.420> what<00:03:04.600> I<00:03:04.630> use<00:03:06.150> then<00:03:07.150> you

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
with it but this is what I use then you

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.420 
with it but this is what I use then you
have<00:03:07.709> under<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:08.830> option<00:03:09.160> should<00:03:09.250> be<00:03:09.340> high

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
have under the option should be high

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.690 
have under the option should be high
quality<00:03:09.970> 48k<00:03:10.750> audio<00:03:11.160> ok<00:03:12.160> so<00:03:12.430> let's<00:03:12.580> get

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
quality 48k audio ok so let's get

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.320 
quality 48k audio ok so let's get
started<00:03:12.850> what<00:03:13.180> we<00:03:13.269> have<00:03:13.420> to<00:03:13.540> do<00:03:13.660> now<00:03:13.870> is<00:03:15.330> we're

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
started what we have to do now is we're

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.470 
started what we have to do now is we're
going<00:03:16.480> to<00:03:16.540> have<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:17.820> import<00:03:18.820> a<00:03:18.940> file<00:03:19.180> now<00:03:19.450> what

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
going to have to import a file now what

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.060 
going to have to import a file now what
you<00:03:19.720> do<00:03:19.840> with<00:03:19.989> this<00:03:20.140> you<00:03:20.350> don't<00:03:20.440> import<00:03:20.860> you

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
you do with this you don't import you

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.949 
you do with this you don't import you
drag<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:21.580> drop<00:03:21.790> that's<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.360> way<00:03:22.450> this<00:03:22.630> works

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
drag and drop that's the way this works

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.470 
drag and drop that's the way this works
so<00:03:23.769> I'm<00:03:23.980> going<00:03:24.130> to<00:03:24.160> get<00:03:24.760> a<00:03:24.790> file<00:03:25.120> from<00:03:25.299> here

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
so I'm going to get a file from here

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.350 
so I'm going to get a file from here
let's<00:03:25.600> say<00:03:25.840> I<00:03:26.610> want<00:03:27.610> to<00:03:27.640> choose<00:03:27.850> this<00:03:28.030> one<00:03:28.209> this

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
let's say I want to choose this one this

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.350 
let's say I want to choose this one this
is<00:03:28.420> a<00:03:28.540> 440<00:03:29.380> megabyte<00:03:29.799> file<00:03:30.100> so<00:03:30.730> all<00:03:30.940> I<00:03:30.970> would<00:03:31.209> do

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
is a 440 megabyte file so all I would do

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.570 
is a 440 megabyte file so all I would do
is<00:03:31.390> I<00:03:31.690> would<00:03:31.720> take<00:03:31.989> this<00:03:32.170> and<00:03:32.410> drag<00:03:33.400> it<00:03:33.549> right

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
is I would take this and drag it right

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.930 
is I would take this and drag it right
in<00:03:34.830> there<00:03:35.830> it<00:03:35.950> is<00:03:36.069> right<00:03:36.100> here

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
in there it is right here

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.670 
in there it is right here
now<00:03:37.720> all<00:03:37.840> you<00:03:37.960> have<00:03:38.020> to<00:03:38.230> do<00:03:38.520> is<00:03:40.380> click<00:03:41.380> on<00:03:41.500> in

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
now all you have to do is click on in

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.730 
now all you have to do is click on in
code<00:03:41.920> and<00:03:42.190> it's<00:03:42.340> going<00:03:42.460> to<00:03:42.520> start<00:03:42.850> to<00:03:43.060> convert

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.350 

now<00:03:47.740> this<00:03:47.860> is<00:03:47.920> an<00:03:48.130> avi<00:03:48.430> of<00:03:48.790> four<00:03:49.060> hundred<00:03:49.270> and

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
now this is an avi of four hundred and

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.790 
now this is an avi of four hundred and
forty<00:03:49.630> megabytes<00:03:49.900> now<00:03:50.230> this<00:03:50.410> is<00:03:50.560> going<00:03:50.680> to

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
forty megabytes now this is going to

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.460 
forty megabytes now this is going to
take<00:03:50.950> a<00:03:51.010> little<00:03:51.280> bit<00:03:51.430> of<00:03:51.490> time<00:03:51.930> it<00:03:52.930> is<00:03:53.170> a<00:03:53.200> large

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
take a little bit of time it is a large

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.800 
take a little bit of time it is a large
file<00:03:53.910> its<00:03:54.910> going<00:03:54.970> to<00:03:55.120> take<00:03:55.180> several<00:03:55.540> minutes

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
file its going to take several minutes

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.770 
file its going to take several minutes
but<00:03:56.140> like<00:03:56.290> I<00:03:56.410> said<00:03:56.470> it<00:03:56.710> depends<00:03:57.340> and<00:03:57.880> like<00:03:58.660> I

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
but like I said it depends and like I

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.630 
but like I said it depends and like I
always<00:03:58.930> say<00:03:59.110> it<00:03:59.200> depends<00:03:59.500> on<00:03:59.770> your<00:03:59.980> computer

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
always say it depends on your computer

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
always say it depends on your computer
speed<00:04:01.260> now<00:04:02.260> my<00:04:02.530> computer<00:04:03.160> is<00:04:03.370> is<00:04:03.670> okay<00:04:04.420> you

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
speed now my computer is is okay you

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.050 
speed now my computer is is okay you
know<00:04:04.960> it's<00:04:05.140> not<00:04:05.290> very<00:04:05.770> fast<00:04:06.190> but<00:04:06.460> today's

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
know it's not very fast but today's

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.700 
know it's not very fast but today's
standards<00:04:07.480> it's<00:04:07.630> it's<00:04:07.870> it's<00:04:08.290> pretty<00:04:08.500> good

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:08.710 
standards it's it's it's pretty good

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.710 
standards it's it's it's pretty good
it's<00:04:08.860> it's<00:04:09.460> an<00:04:09.610> insult<00:04:09.880> dual-core<00:04:10.450> to

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
have it as you can see on the desktop

have it as you can see on the desktop
but<00:04:34.240> just<00:04:34.420> created<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:34.990> file<00:04:35.230> for<00:04:35.650> me<00:04:35.800> the

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
but just created the file for me the

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:44.119 
but just created the file for me the
converted<00:04:36.520> file

00:04:44.119 --> 00:04:44.129 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:46.159 

here's<00:04:44.699> the<00:04:44.819> file<00:04:45.149> and<00:04:45.449> let's<00:04:45.569> look<00:04:45.929> at<00:04:46.080> the

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
here's the file and let's look at the

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.790 
here's the file and let's look at the
composition<00:04:46.349> of<00:04:46.860> it<00:04:47.009> properties<00:04:47.580> and<00:04:48.679> it's<00:04:49.679> an

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
composition of it properties and it's an

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.540 
composition of it properties and it's an
mp4<00:04:51.050> the<00:04:52.050> file<00:04:52.349> that<00:04:52.439> was<00:04:52.649> originally<00:04:53.129> an<00:04:53.279> avi

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
mp4 the file that was originally an avi

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.299 
mp4 the file that was originally an avi
file<00:04:53.969> is<00:04:54.330> now<00:04:54.569> an<00:04:54.869> mp4<00:04:55.349> file<00:04:57.319> so<00:04:58.319> we<00:04:58.679> converted

00:04:59.299 --> 00:04:59.309 
file is now an mp4 file so we converted

00:04:59.309 --> 00:05:01.790 
file is now an mp4 file so we converted
it<00:04:59.459> as<00:04:59.879> you<00:05:00.149> can<00:05:00.300> see<00:05:00.539> compressed<00:05:01.349> it<00:05:01.529> as<00:05:01.619> well

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
it as you can see compressed it as well

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.290 
it as you can see compressed it as well
I<00:05:02.009> went<00:05:02.279> from<00:05:02.339> four<00:05:02.639> hundred<00:05:02.909> and<00:05:02.999> forty

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
I went from four hundred and forty

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.409 
I went from four hundred and forty
megabytes<00:05:03.569> all<00:05:03.869> the<00:05:03.959> way<00:05:04.050> down<00:05:04.229> to<00:05:04.259> 115<00:05:05.269> so<00:05:06.269> now

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
megabytes all the way down to 115 so now

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.559 
megabytes all the way down to 115 so now
all<00:05:06.449> you<00:05:06.719> have<00:05:06.749> to<00:05:06.869> do<00:05:07.879> that's<00:05:08.879> just<00:05:09.089> exit

to include it let's go ahead file to

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:46.220 
to include it let's go ahead file to
library<00:05:43.760> my<00:05:44.760> desktop<00:05:45.150> there<00:05:45.360> it<00:05:45.450> is<00:05:45.570> that's

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 
library my desktop there it is that's

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:57.860 
library my desktop there it is that's
the<00:05:46.350> file<00:05:46.560> we<00:05:46.740> just<00:05:46.770> need<00:05:47.810> let's<00:05:48.810> click<00:05:49.080> on<00:05:49.200> it

and<00:05:58.200> now<00:05:58.620> it's<00:05:58.830> in<00:05:59.310> our<00:05:59.490> library<00:06:02.450> maybe<00:06:03.450> it<00:06:03.570> is

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
and now it's in our library maybe it is

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.270 
and now it's in our library maybe it is
it's<00:06:04.260> right<00:06:04.410> there<00:06:04.650> so<00:06:04.860> all<00:06:05.010> you<00:06:05.100> would<00:06:05.250> have
