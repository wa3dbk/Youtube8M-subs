York<00:00:36.900> he<00:00:37.900> prefers<00:00:38.320> using<00:00:38.590> sugar<00:00:38.980> cubes

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
York he prefers using sugar cubes

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.190 
York he prefers using sugar cubes

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
because he says this is a sugar cube is

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.560 
because he says this is a sugar cube is
a<00:00:41.290> perfect<00:00:41.890> measurement<00:00:42.760> of<00:00:42.820> sugar<00:00:43.060> where

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
a perfect measurement of sugar where

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.820 
a perfect measurement of sugar where

spiciness to it
now<00:01:04.839> here's<00:01:05.260> another<00:01:05.530> place<00:01:05.740> where<00:01:06.100> things

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
now here's another place where things

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.469 
now here's another place where things
start<00:01:06.610> going<00:01:06.820> a<00:01:06.880> bit<00:01:07.000> different<00:01:07.330> this<00:01:07.420> is

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
start going a bit different this is

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.090 
start going a bit different this is
where<00:01:07.719> you'd<00:01:07.869> see<00:01:08.079> a<00:01:08.109> bartender<00:01:08.619> stick<00:01:08.859> an

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
where you'd see a bartender stick an

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.399 
where you'd see a bartender stick an
orange<00:01:09.759> wheel<00:01:09.939> half<00:01:10.240> an<00:01:10.390> orange<00:01:10.509> wheel<00:01:10.780> and<00:01:11.109> a

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
maraschino cherry maraschino being the

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.840 
maraschino cherry maraschino being the
artificial<00:01:14.109> maraschino<00:01:14.560> cherry<00:01:14.950> into<00:01:15.729> this

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
artificial maraschino cherry into this

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.080 
artificial maraschino cherry into this
drink<00:01:16.149> I<00:01:16.329> don't<00:01:17.289> like<00:01:17.469> doing<00:01:17.770> that<00:01:17.939> for<00:01:18.939> one

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
drink I don't like doing that for one

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.940 
drink I don't like doing that for one
thing<00:01:19.359> on<00:01:19.509> the<00:01:19.600> cherry<00:01:19.899> all<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.439> cherry<00:01:20.710> does

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
thing on the cherry all the cherry does

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.080 
thing on the cherry all the cherry does
when<00:01:21.130> you're<00:01:21.249> muddling<00:01:21.549> the<00:01:21.670> cherry<00:01:21.909> in<00:01:21.999> the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
when you're muddling the cherry in the

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.849 
when you're muddling the cherry in the
drink<00:01:22.299> is<00:01:22.420> it<00:01:22.810> leaves<00:01:22.990> a<00:01:23.140> carcass<00:01:23.619> in<00:01:23.829> the

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:23.859 
drink is it leaves a carcass in the

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:25.050 
drink is it leaves a carcass in the
bottom<00:01:24.159> of<00:01:24.249> the<00:01:24.310> drink<00:01:24.520> doesn't<00:01:24.759> add<00:01:24.850> anything

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
bottom of the drink doesn't add anything

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.849 
bottom of the drink doesn't add anything
to<00:01:25.240> it<00:01:25.359> flavor-wise<00:01:25.899> I<00:01:26.049> don't<00:01:26.499> think<00:01:26.679> at<00:01:26.829> all

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:26.859 
to it flavor-wise I don't think at all

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:29.190 
to it flavor-wise I don't think at all
because<00:01:27.609> it's<00:01:28.060> just<00:01:28.570> simple<00:01:28.990> syrup

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
because it's just simple syrup

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.359 
because it's just simple syrup
essentially<00:01:29.649> a<00:01:29.710> little<00:01:29.890> bit<00:01:29.979> of<00:01:30.039> almond

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
essentially a little bit of almond

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:31.950 
essentially a little bit of almond
flavoring<00:01:30.700> on<00:01:30.880> it<00:01:31.030> and<00:01:31.299> I<00:01:31.479> don't<00:01:31.659> think<00:01:31.840> that

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
flavoring on it and I don't think that

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.999 
flavoring on it and I don't think that
is<00:01:32.049> really<00:01:32.170> appropriate<00:01:32.499> to<00:01:32.679> the<00:01:32.799> drink

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
is really appropriate to the drink

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.859 
is really appropriate to the drink
orange<00:01:33.909> on<00:01:34.060> the<00:01:34.090> other<00:01:34.270> hand<00:01:34.420> I<00:01:34.509> think<00:01:34.539> works

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
orange on the other hand I think works

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.620 
orange on the other hand I think works
really<00:01:35.200> well<00:01:35.530> with<00:01:36.189> bourbon<00:01:36.579> and<00:01:36.789> while<00:01:37.060> the

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
really well with bourbon and while the

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.080 
really well with bourbon and while the
original<00:01:37.689> garnish<00:01:38.679> for<00:01:38.950> an<00:01:39.579> old<00:01:39.729> fashioned

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
original garnish for an old fashioned

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.179 
original garnish for an old fashioned
was<00:01:40.240> a<00:01:40.270> wedge<00:01:40.539> of<00:01:40.749> law<00:01:40.929> of<00:01:41.200> lemon<00:01:41.469> in<00:01:41.590> orange

syrup<00:04:29.420> at<00:04:29.960> the<00:04:30.080> very<00:04:30.230> beginning<00:04:30.680> as<00:04:30.830> you're

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
syrup at the very beginning as you're

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.950 
syrup at the very beginning as you're
muddling<00:04:31.310> it<00:04:31.430> until<00:04:32.180> you<00:04:32.270> had<00:04:32.390> just<00:04:32.630> as<00:04:32.810> much

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
water as you do sugar never any more

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.210 
water as you do sugar never any more
than<00:04:35.600> that<00:04:35.750> since<00:04:36.260> I<00:04:36.440> use<00:04:36.620> simple<00:04:36.860> syrup

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
than that since I use simple syrup

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.220 
than that since I use simple syrup
instead<00:04:37.460> of<00:04:37.640> sugar<00:04:37.880> the<00:04:38.450> simple<00:04:38.810> syrup<00:04:38.960> had

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
instead of sugar the simple syrup had

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.320 
instead of sugar the simple syrup had
the<00:04:39.680> pre-mixed<00:04:40.190> water<00:04:40.370> into<00:04:40.730> it<00:04:40.820> so<00:04:41.210> I<00:04:41.240> never

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
the pre-mixed water into it so I never

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.680 
the pre-mixed water into it so I never
need<00:04:41.690> to<00:04:41.780> add<00:04:41.900> any<00:04:42.170> water<00:04:42.280> whatsoever<00:04:43.280> I<00:04:43.690> now

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
need to add any water whatsoever I now

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.630 
need to add any water whatsoever I now
take<00:04:44.810> and<00:04:45.940> add<00:04:46.940> a<00:04:46.970> couple<00:04:47.270> of<00:04:47.360> straws<00:04:47.660> and<00:04:48.640> then

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
take and add a couple of straws and then

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.730 
take and add a couple of straws and then
here<00:04:49.970> is<00:04:50.060> where<00:04:50.210> I<00:04:50.270> think<00:04:50.510> the<00:04:51.169> cherry<00:04:51.440> comes

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
here is where I think the cherry comes

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.180 
here is where I think the cherry comes
in<00:04:54.280> I'll<00:04:55.280> garnish<00:04:55.700> the<00:04:56.000> drink<00:04:56.090> with<00:04:56.660> a<00:04:56.690> cherry

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
in I'll garnish the drink with a cherry

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.530 
in I'll garnish the drink with a cherry
because<00:04:58.190> I<00:04:58.220> think<00:04:58.520> it<00:04:58.580> looks<00:04:58.730> so<00:04:59.060> much<00:04:59.090> nicer

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
because I think it looks so much nicer

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.659 
because I think it looks so much nicer
