that needs some help in this way we're

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:08.890 
that needs some help in this way we're
going<00:00:07.910> to<00:00:07.970> talk<00:00:08.149> about<00:00:08.270> how<00:00:08.510> to<00:00:08.540> hold<00:00:08.719> the

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:08.900 
going to talk about how to hold the

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.650 
going to talk about how to hold the
stick<00:00:09.760> you<00:00:10.760> know<00:00:10.789> anybody<00:00:11.059> could<00:00:11.299> get<00:00:11.389> a<00:00:11.449> pair

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:11.660 
stick you know anybody could get a pair

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.390 
stick you know anybody could get a pair
of<00:00:11.690> drumsticks<00:00:12.139> and<00:00:12.379> just<00:00:12.590> grab<00:00:12.830> on<00:00:13.010> to<00:00:13.219> it<00:00:13.250> and

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
of drumsticks and just grab on to it and

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.799 
of drumsticks and just grab on to it and
start<00:00:13.580> hitting<00:00:13.820> and<00:00:14.420> you're<00:00:14.510> gonna<00:00:14.600> get<00:00:14.750> a

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
start hitting and you're gonna get a

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.750 
start hitting and you're gonna get a
sound<00:00:15.110> but<00:00:15.440> for<00:00:15.889> the<00:00:15.949> long<00:00:16.129> term<00:00:16.340> you<00:00:16.400> want<00:00:16.609> to

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
sound but for the long term you want to

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.900 
sound but for the long term you want to
build<00:00:16.880> some<00:00:17.029> good<00:00:17.210> technique<00:00:17.630> to<00:00:17.870> get<00:00:18.170> the

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 
build some good technique to get the

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.880 
build some good technique to get the
physics<00:00:19.910> of<00:00:20.060> it<00:00:20.210> working<00:00:20.360> for<00:00:20.660> you<00:00:20.720> so<00:00:21.020> the

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
physics of it working for you so the

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.620 
physics of it working for you so the
first<00:00:21.920> thing<00:00:22.190> to<00:00:22.280> know<00:00:22.460> I<00:00:22.760> think<00:00:22.940> that's

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
first thing to know I think that's

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.080 
first thing to know I think that's
helpful<00:00:23.930> to<00:00:24.170> know<00:00:24.320> is<00:00:24.530> that<00:00:24.850> every<00:00:25.850> time<00:00:25.880> you

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
helpful to know is that every time you

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.060 
helpful to know is that every time you
hit<00:00:26.210> the<00:00:26.360> drum<00:00:26.630> you<00:00:26.960> got<00:00:27.110> 5<00:00:27.320> things<00:00:27.619> going<00:00:27.920> on

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
hit the drum you got 5 things going on

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.600 
hit the drum you got 5 things going on
arm<00:00:28.610> all<00:00:29.270> the<00:00:29.330> way<00:00:29.480> from<00:00:29.630> my<00:00:29.750> shoulder<00:00:30.170> down

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
arm all the way from my shoulder down

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.020 
arm all the way from my shoulder down
wrist<00:00:31.610> in<00:00:32.260> this<00:00:33.260> match<00:00:33.530> grip<00:00:33.860> we<00:00:34.040> call<00:00:34.220> it<00:00:34.340> we

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
wrist in this match grip we call it we

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.030 
wrist in this match grip we call it we
use<00:00:35.270> this<00:00:35.390> bye-bye<00:00:35.900> motion<00:00:36.380> so<00:00:36.590> my<00:00:36.710> wrist<00:00:36.860> is

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
use this bye-bye motion so my wrist is

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.130 
use this bye-bye motion so my wrist is
working<00:00:37.310> this<00:00:37.400> way<00:00:37.610> my<00:00:38.390> fingers<00:00:38.780> are<00:00:38.870> gonna<00:00:38.930> be

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
working this way my fingers are gonna be

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.500 
working this way my fingers are gonna be
controlling<00:00:39.649> the<00:00:39.710> stick<00:00:39.980> and<00:00:40.280> then<00:00:41.180> last<00:00:41.360> you

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
controlling the stick and then last you

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.639 
controlling the stick and then last you
are<00:00:41.600> not<00:00:41.720> body<00:00:41.899> parts<00:00:42.230> gravity<00:00:42.710> as<00:00:43.040> I<00:00:43.190> go<00:00:43.310> down

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
are not body parts gravity as I go down

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.020 
are not body parts gravity as I go down
gravity<00:00:45.649> pulls<00:00:45.860> it<00:00:45.980> down<00:00:46.130> sometimes<00:00:46.730> I'm<00:00:46.850> you

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
gravity pulls it down sometimes I'm you

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.400 
gravity pulls it down sometimes I'm you
know<00:00:47.120> I<00:00:47.149> might<00:00:47.360> add<00:00:47.510> some<00:00:47.750> energy<00:00:48.079> into<00:00:48.320> that

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
know I might add some energy into that

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.900 
know I might add some energy into that
if<00:00:48.559> I<00:00:48.620> want<00:00:48.770> to<00:00:48.829> get<00:00:48.920> really<00:00:49.130> loud<00:00:49.250> but<00:00:49.550> gravity

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
if I want to get really loud but gravity

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.670 
if I want to get really loud but gravity
is<00:00:50.059> our<00:00:50.600> friend<00:00:50.690> relax<00:00:51.440> the<00:00:52.160> stick<00:00:52.370> goes<00:00:52.520> down

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
is our friend relax the stick goes down

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.650 
is our friend relax the stick goes down
additionally<00:00:54.680> bounce<00:00:55.489> if<00:00:56.030> I<00:00:56.210> hang<00:00:56.390> onto<00:00:56.510> the

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
additionally bounce if I hang onto the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.479 
additionally bounce if I hang onto the
stick<00:00:56.840> tightly<00:00:57.110> I'm<00:00:57.590> gonna<00:00:57.890> get<00:00:58.070> a<00:00:58.100> really

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
stick tightly I'm gonna get a really

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:59.830 
stick tightly I'm gonna get a really
choked<00:00:58.760> sound<00:00:59.000> and<00:00:59.180> I'm<00:00:59.239> not<00:00:59.390> gonna<00:00:59.510> get<00:00:59.690> any

choked sound and I'm not gonna get any
bounce<00:01:00.050> from<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:00.350> stick<00:01:00.590> I'm<00:01:01.070> if<00:01:01.219> I<00:01:01.309> develop<00:01:01.820> a

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
bounce from the stick I'm if I develop a

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.760 
bounce from the stick I'm if I develop a
good<00:01:02.149> stick<00:01:02.390> grip<00:01:02.600> that's<00:01:02.780> loose<00:01:03.050> when<00:01:03.620> I<00:01:03.649> hit

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
good stick grip that's loose when I hit

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.499 
good stick grip that's loose when I hit
that<00:01:03.829> drum<00:01:04.189> I'm<00:01:04.339> gonna<00:01:04.460> get<00:01:04.640> good<00:01:04.820> tone<00:01:05.089> and

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
that drum I'm gonna get good tone and

that drum I'm gonna get good tone and
I'm<00:01:06.170> gonna<00:01:06.319> get<00:01:06.619> the<00:01:07.249> bounce<00:01:07.490> that<00:01:07.639> the<00:01:07.819> stick

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
I'm gonna get the bounce that the stick

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.609 
I'm gonna get the bounce that the stick
wants<00:01:08.329> to<00:01:08.420> give<00:01:08.569> me<00:01:08.749> and<00:01:08.929> that's<00:01:09.380> sometimes

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
wants to give me and that's sometimes

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.760 
wants to give me and that's sometimes
called<00:01:09.799> rebound<00:01:10.780> but<00:01:11.780> whatever<00:01:12.319> name<00:01:12.530> it<00:01:12.649> is

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
called rebound but whatever name it is

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.169 
called rebound but whatever name it is
you<00:01:13.039> want<00:01:13.310> it<00:01:13.490> because<00:01:13.759> you<00:01:13.850> want<00:01:13.999> to<00:01:14.030> be<00:01:14.119> able

00:01:14.169 --> 00:01:14.179 
you want it because you want to be able

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:18.819 
you want it because you want to be able
to<00:01:14.299> use<00:01:14.450> it<00:01:14.770> so<00:01:15.770> how<00:01:16.159> do<00:01:16.219> we<00:01:16.429> get<00:01:16.759> that<00:01:17.740> what<00:01:18.740> we

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:18.829 
to use it so how do we get that what we

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.149 
to use it so how do we get that what we
want<00:01:18.979> to<00:01:19.069> do<00:01:19.189> is<00:01:19.369> create<00:01:19.729> a<00:01:19.789> fulcrum<00:01:20.329> in<00:01:20.479> ursus

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
want to do is create a fulcrum in ursus

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.669 
want to do is create a fulcrum in ursus
in<00:01:22.159> our<00:01:22.340> grip<00:01:22.810> and<00:01:23.810> for<00:01:24.200> those<00:01:24.289> of<00:01:24.439> you<00:01:24.560> who

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:24.679 
in our grip and for those of you who

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:26.800 
in our grip and for those of you who
slept<00:01:24.920> through<00:01:25.130> science<00:01:25.520> class<00:01:25.909> the<00:01:26.270> fulcrum

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
slept through science class the fulcrum

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.599 
slept through science class the fulcrum
is<00:01:27.049> where<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:27.529> stick<00:01:27.740> pivots<00:01:28.100> back<00:01:28.249> and<00:01:28.459> forth

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:28.609 
is where the stick pivots back and forth

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:31.870 
is where the stick pivots back and forth
like<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:29.029> middle<00:01:29.240> of<00:01:29.270> a<00:01:29.389> seesaw<00:01:29.810> and<00:01:30.200> so<00:01:31.189> first

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
like the middle of a seesaw and so first

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.889 
like the middle of a seesaw and so first
thing<00:01:31.969> we're<00:01:32.090> to<00:01:32.179> do<00:01:32.270> is<00:01:32.359> find<00:01:32.599> out<00:01:32.719> where<00:01:32.869> that

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
thing we're to do is find out where that

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.639 
thing we're to do is find out where that
is<00:01:33.020> going<00:01:33.229> to<00:01:33.289> be<00:01:33.409> on<00:01:33.529> the<00:01:33.619> stick<00:01:35.619> you<00:01:36.619> don't

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
is going to be on the stick you don't

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.080 
is going to be on the stick you don't
want<00:01:36.979> too<00:01:37.130> much<00:01:37.310> weight<00:01:37.520> out<00:01:37.729> front<00:01:38.029> because

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
want too much weight out front because

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.699 
want too much weight out front because
the<00:01:38.270> stick<00:01:38.450> will<00:01:38.599> die<00:01:38.810> down<00:01:38.869> into<00:01:39.439> the<00:01:39.529> head

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:39.709 
the stick will die down into the head

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:41.620 
the stick will die down into the head
and<00:01:40.009> if<00:01:40.159> you<00:01:40.279> have<00:01:40.520> too<00:01:41.240> much<00:01:41.329> weight<00:01:41.539> in<00:01:41.599> the

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
and if you have too much weight in the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.059 
and if you have too much weight in the
back<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:42.020> stick<00:01:42.229> doesn't<00:01:42.439> even<00:01:42.649> go<00:01:42.770> towards

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069 
back the stick doesn't even go towards

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:46.120 
back the stick doesn't even go towards
the<00:01:43.189> head<00:01:43.369> so<00:01:44.259> we<00:01:45.259> want<00:01:45.439> to<00:01:45.499> do<00:01:45.590> is<00:01:45.740> find<00:01:45.979> the

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
the head so we want to do is find the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.949 
the head so we want to do is find the
center<00:01:46.279> of<00:01:46.399> gravity<00:01:46.880> so<00:01:47.029> if<00:01:47.479> I<00:01:47.569> balance<00:01:47.899> my

00:01:47.949 --> 00:01:47.959 
center of gravity so if I balance my

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:50.889 
center of gravity so if I balance my
stick<00:01:48.819> that<00:01:49.819> sticks<00:01:50.149> bounce<00:01:50.359> my<00:01:50.569> hand<00:01:50.749> there's

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
stick that sticks bounce my hand there's

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:52.359 
stick that sticks bounce my hand there's
the<00:01:51.020> center<00:01:51.229> of<00:01:51.349> gravity<00:01:51.709> that's<00:01:52.099> not<00:01:52.219> gonna

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
the center of gravity that's not gonna

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:53.649 
the center of gravity that's not gonna
work<00:01:52.490> for<00:01:52.520> me<00:01:52.729> either<00:01:52.759> too<00:01:53.119> because<00:01:53.539> the

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
work for me either too because the

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:54.730 
work for me either too because the
sticks<00:01:53.869> just<00:01:53.990> going<00:01:54.169> to<00:01:54.229> kind<00:01:54.439> of<00:01:54.469> sit

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
sticks just going to kind of sit

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.309 
sticks just going to kind of sit
wherever<00:01:54.919> it<00:01:55.689> it<00:01:56.689> happens<00:01:57.020> to<00:01:57.109> be<00:01:57.169> at<00:01:57.259> the

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
wherever it it happens to be at the

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:58.959 
wherever it it happens to be at the
moment<00:01:57.469> it's<00:01:58.279> just<00:01:58.310> gonna<00:01:58.489> stay<00:01:58.759> there

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
moment it's just gonna stay there

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.330 
moment it's just gonna stay there
because<00:01:59.529> it's<00:02:00.529> balanced<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.039> center<00:02:01.249> of

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
because it's balanced the center of

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.459 
because it's balanced the center of
gravity<00:02:01.700> that's<00:02:01.819> what<00:02:01.969> that<00:02:02.090> means<00:02:02.270> I<00:02:02.479> want<00:02:03.349> to

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
gravity that's what that means I want to

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:05.139 
gravity that's what that means I want to
do<00:02:03.649> is<00:02:03.799> add<00:02:04.069> a<00:02:04.099> little<00:02:04.310> more<00:02:04.759> weight<00:02:04.939> to<00:02:04.969> the

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
do is add a little more weight to the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:06.849 
do is add a little more weight to the
front<00:02:05.359> of<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.509> stick<00:02:05.719> so<00:02:06.289> he<00:02:06.409> wants<00:02:06.649> to<00:02:06.739> head

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:06.859 
front of the stick so he wants to head

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:08.859 
front of the stick so he wants to head
towards<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.279> drum<00:02:07.520> but<00:02:08.239> not<00:02:08.420> too<00:02:08.569> much<00:02:08.750> to

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
towards the drum but not too much to

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.090 
towards the drum but not too much to
keep<00:02:09.020> it<00:02:09.140> at<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.289> drum<00:02:09.500> so<00:02:09.680> I'm<00:02:09.740> gonna<00:02:09.860> back<00:02:10.040> up

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
keep it at the drum so I'm gonna back up

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.240 
keep it at the drum so I'm gonna back up
about<00:02:10.520> half<00:02:10.880> and

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
about half and

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.530 
about half and
three<00:02:11.580> quarters<00:02:11.820> of<00:02:11.850> an<00:02:11.970> inch<00:02:12.000> depending<00:02:12.210> on

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
three quarters of an inch depending on

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.370 
three quarters of an inch depending on
your<00:02:12.690> stick<00:02:12.870> there's<00:02:13.050> gonna<00:02:13.140> be<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.260> little

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
your stick there's gonna be a little

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.590 
your stick there's gonna be a little
different<00:02:13.740> but<00:02:13.830> by<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.580> size<00:02:14.910> your<00:02:15.120> stick<00:02:15.390> and

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
different but by the size your stick and

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.180 
different but by the size your stick and
the<00:02:15.810> shoulder<00:02:16.200> of<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.350> stick<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.650> different

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
the shoulder of the stick the different

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.560 
the shoulder of the stick the different
weight<00:02:17.340> of<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.760> stick<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.030> tip<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:18.480> all

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
weight of the stick the tip and all

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.520 
weight of the stick the tip and all
that's<00:02:18.720> gonna<00:02:18.870> change<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.230> so<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.350> can<00:02:19.440> have

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
that's gonna change it so you can have

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.100 
that's gonna change it so you can have
to<00:02:19.590> find<00:02:19.770> it<00:02:19.860> on<00:02:19.980> your<00:02:20.130> stick<00:02:20.960> so<00:02:21.960> that's

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
to find it on your stick so that's

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.440 
to find it on your stick so that's
what's<00:02:22.320> gonna<00:02:22.380> be<00:02:22.560> on<00:02:22.680> this<00:02:22.860> stick<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.610> where

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
what's gonna be on this stick and where

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.270 
what's gonna be on this stick and where
it's<00:02:24.600> gonna<00:02:24.780> be<00:02:24.900> in<00:02:25.080> your<00:02:25.170> hand<00:02:25.650> is<00:02:25.980> actually

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
it's gonna be in your hand is actually

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.090 
it's gonna be in your hand is actually
movable<00:02:26.910> but<00:02:27.000> it<00:02:27.120> usually<00:02:27.270> moves<00:02:27.870> between<00:02:28.230> one

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
movable but it usually moves between one

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.920 
movable but it usually moves between one
of<00:02:29.220> these<00:02:29.310> two<00:02:29.490> fingers<00:02:29.730> first<00:02:30.450> two<00:02:30.570> fingers

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
of these two fingers first two fingers

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.449 
of these two fingers first two fingers
and<00:02:31.050> a<00:02:31.140> thumb<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.920> first<00:02:32.130> thing<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:32.310> want

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
and a thumb so the first thing you want

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.920 
and a thumb so the first thing you want
to<00:02:32.490> do<00:02:32.580> is<00:02:32.670> take<00:02:32.880> those<00:02:33.030> two<00:02:33.270> fingers<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.810> your

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
to do is take those two fingers and your

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.140 
to do is take those two fingers and your
thumb<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.380> pick<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:34.770> stick<00:02:35.010> up<00:02:35.220> at<00:02:35.610> that

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
thumb and pick that stick up at that

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.100 
thumb and pick that stick up at that
fulcrum<00:02:36.660> point<00:02:36.720> of<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.110> stick<00:02:38.750> what<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:39.780> want

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
fulcrum point of the stick what I want

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.690 
fulcrum point of the stick what I want
to<00:02:40.230> what<00:02:40.350> I<00:02:40.410> want<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.709> end<00:02:40.860> up<00:02:40.980> with<00:02:41.160> ISM<00:02:41.430> is<00:02:41.490> my

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
thumb aim straight down the stick and

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.199 
thumb aim straight down the stick and
the<00:02:45.720> stick<00:02:46.260> on<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.770> first<00:02:47.070> two<00:02:47.430> pads<00:02:47.730> or<00:02:48.030> in

the first knuckles of these two fingers

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.380 
the first knuckles of these two fingers
and<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:51.120> creates<00:02:51.360> my<00:02:51.510> fall<00:02:51.720> Chrome<00:02:51.959> right<00:02:53.390> it

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
and that creates my fall Chrome right it

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.540 
and that creates my fall Chrome right it
moves<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.680> we'll<00:02:55.920> get<00:02:56.040> into<00:02:56.190> that<00:02:56.280> more<00:02:56.489> in

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
moves and we'll get into that more in

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.930 
moves and we'll get into that more in
just<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:57.120> bit<00:02:57.270> it's<00:02:57.959> easy<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.550> to<00:02:59.550> see<00:02:59.700> in<00:02:59.850> this

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
just a bit it's easy to to see in this

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.340 
just a bit it's easy to to see in this
particular<00:03:00.209> angle<00:03:00.840> so<00:03:00.900> I'll<00:03:00.959> show<00:03:01.140> you<00:03:01.170> in<00:03:01.260> a

minute but there's a couple other

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.800 
minute but there's a couple other
features<00:03:02.970> we<00:03:03.060> want<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:03.300> talk<00:03:03.390> about<00:03:03.450> in<00:03:03.720> the

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
features we want to talk about in the

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.560 
features we want to talk about in the
grip<00:03:04.040> if<00:03:05.040> this<00:03:05.220> is<00:03:05.340> my<00:03:05.489> fall<00:03:05.730> chram<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:06.150> could

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
grip if this is my fall chram I could

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.560 
is what I call the stop it stops the
stick<00:03:24.060> so<00:03:24.630> if<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:25.500> falls<00:03:26.030> towards<00:03:27.030> that<00:03:27.330> stop

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570

stick so if it falls towards that stop
right<00:03:29.299> that<00:03:30.299> stop<00:03:30.600> is<00:03:30.780> right<00:03:30.870> at<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.080> corner

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
right that stop is right at the corner

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.600 
right that stop is right at the corner
of<00:03:31.410> my<00:03:31.500> hand<00:03:31.769> it<00:03:31.920> actually<00:03:32.160> will<00:03:32.280> be<00:03:32.310> kind<00:03:32.549> of

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
of my hand it actually will be kind of

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.920 
of my hand it actually will be kind of
cool<00:03:32.790> if<00:03:32.880> it<00:03:32.970> came<00:03:33.060> out<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.299> back<00:03:33.450> of<00:03:33.630> my<00:03:33.720> hand

this<00:05:43.099> is<00:05:43.249> really<00:05:43.459> good<00:05:43.610> for<00:05:43.729> single<00:05:44.029> strokes

sometimes<00:06:26.360> when<00:06:26.689> I'm<00:06:26.779> on<00:06:26.929> the<00:06:27.019> cymbal<00:06:27.319> and<00:06:27.439> I'm

00:06:27.489 --> 00:06:27.499 
sometimes when I'm on the cymbal and I'm

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:29.019 
sometimes when I'm on the cymbal and I'm
playing<00:06:27.679> really<00:06:27.979> loosely<00:06:28.249> it's<00:06:28.789> at<00:06:28.939> the

00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:29.029 
playing really loosely it's at the

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:31.149 
playing really loosely it's at the
second<00:06:29.389> finger<00:06:29.629> in<00:06:29.749> this<00:06:29.839> French<00:06:30.079> position<00:06:30.529> so

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:31.159 
second finger in this French position so

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:35.109 
second finger in this French position so
there<00:06:31.550> are<00:06:31.610> some<00:06:31.759> thoughts<00:06:31.999> from<00:06:32.709> room<00:06:33.709> four

00:06:35.109 --> 00:06:35.119 
there are some thoughts from room four

00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:37.230 
there are some thoughts from room four
you<00:06:35.389> know<00:06:35.509> you're<00:06:35.749> developing<00:06:36.110> your<00:06:36.409> own

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 
you know you're developing your own

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.209 
you know you're developing your own
techniques<00:06:38.240> in<00:06:38.479> that<00:06:38.629> but<00:06:39.069> basically<00:06:40.069> you

00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:40.219 
techniques in that but basically you

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:41.319 
techniques in that but basically you
want<00:06:40.399> the<00:06:40.490> stick<00:06:40.669> to<00:06:40.759> be<00:06:40.879> able<00:06:40.939> to<00:06:41.089> move<00:06:41.179> and

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:41.329 
want the stick to be able to move and

00:06:41.329 --> 00:06:43.299 
want the stick to be able to move and
have<00:06:41.449> these<00:06:41.599> four<00:06:41.809> features<00:06:42.199> no<00:06:42.979> matter<00:06:43.129> what

00:06:43.299 --> 00:06:43.309 
have these four features no matter what

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:43.929 
have these four features no matter what
position<00:06:43.639> you're<00:06:43.729> in

00:06:43.929 --> 00:06:43.939 
position you're in

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:46.149 
position you're in
that's<00:06:44.479> a<00:06:44.629> fulcrum<00:06:45.079> these<00:06:45.409> control<00:06:45.800> fingers

00:06:46.149 --> 00:06:46.159 
that's a fulcrum these control fingers

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:48.399 
that's a fulcrum these control fingers
this<00:06:46.369> stop<00:06:46.699> and<00:06:46.969> this<00:06:47.179> open<00:06:47.479> space<00:06:47.719> and<00:06:48.319> you

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:48.409 
this stop and this open space and you

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:50.169 
this stop and this open space and you
another<00:06:48.679> thing<00:06:48.860> to<00:06:49.069> mention<00:06:49.219> is<00:06:49.490> you<00:06:49.729> should

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:50.179 
another thing to mention is you should

00:06:50.179 --> 00:06:52.299 
another thing to mention is you should
be<00:06:50.209> able<00:06:50.300> to<00:06:50.419> see<00:06:50.569> wood<00:06:50.809> on<00:06:51.050> top<00:06:51.349> and<00:06:51.679> bottom<00:06:52.219> of

00:06:52.299 --> 00:06:52.309 
be able to see wood on top and bottom of

00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:53.980 
be able to see wood on top and bottom of
this<00:06:52.399> stick<00:06:52.699> when<00:06:52.879> you're<00:06:52.999> playing<00:06:53.209> if<00:06:53.449> you

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:53.990 
this stick when you're playing if you

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.869 
this stick when you're playing if you
got<00:06:54.169> meat<00:06:54.499> all<00:06:54.740> the<00:06:54.769> way<00:06:54.949> around<00:06:55.309> that<00:06:55.490> stick

00:06:55.869 --> 00:06:55.879 
got meat all the way around that stick

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:57.339 
got meat all the way around that stick
it's<00:06:56.119> shock<00:06:56.389> mounted<00:06:56.809> you're<00:06:56.959> not<00:06:57.050> gonna<00:06:57.169> get

00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:57.349 
it's shock mounted you're not gonna get

00:06:57.349 --> 00:06:59.949 
it's shock mounted you're not gonna get
any<00:06:57.469> of<00:06:57.529> that<00:06:57.559> bounce<00:06:57.829> out<00:06:58.069> of<00:06:58.159> that<00:06:58.309> right<00:06:59.089> so

00:06:59.949 --> 00:06:59.959 
any of that bounce out of that right so

00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:01.659 
any of that bounce out of that right so
remember<00:07:00.079> we<00:07:00.619> got<00:07:00.769> we<00:07:01.099> got<00:07:01.129> a<00:07:01.279> few<00:07:01.490> things

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:01.669 
remember we got we got a few things

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:04.959 
remember we got we got a few things
going<00:07:01.729> on<00:07:01.999> arm<00:07:02.559> wrist<00:07:03.559> this<00:07:04.219> bye-bye<00:07:04.579> emotion

00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:04.969 
going on arm wrist this bye-bye emotion

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:10.180 
going on arm wrist this bye-bye emotion
fingers<00:07:06.069> gravity<00:07:07.069> and<00:07:07.729> the<00:07:08.569> bounce

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:10.190 
fingers gravity and the bounce

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:14.050 
fingers gravity and the bounce
for<00:07:10.940> both<00:07:11.090> speed<00:07:11.390> and<00:07:11.420> tone<00:07:12.640> we<00:07:13.640> want<00:07:13.850> all

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:14.060 
for both speed and tone we want all

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.140 
for both speed and tone we want all
those<00:07:14.300> things<00:07:14.540> if<00:07:14.660> I<00:07:14.720> play<00:07:14.900> faster<00:07:15.820> my<00:07:16.820> arms

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:17.150 
those things if I play faster my arms

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.390 
those things if I play faster my arms
moving<00:07:17.570> less<00:07:18.140> but<00:07:18.470> it's<00:07:18.620> just<00:07:18.890> the<00:07:19.040> percentage

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:19.400 
moving less but it's just the percentage

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.170 
moving less but it's just the percentage
is<00:07:19.520> changing<00:07:19.970> if<00:07:20.300> I'm<00:07:20.450> playing<00:07:20.630> slower<00:07:22.180> maybe

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:23.180 
is changing if I'm playing slower maybe

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.640 
is changing if I'm playing slower maybe
a<00:07:23.210> little<00:07:23.360> less<00:07:23.510> wrist<00:07:23.780> more<00:07:24.020> arm<00:07:24.230> but<00:07:24.530> all

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:24.650 
a little less wrist more arm but all

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:25.660 
a little less wrist more arm but all
those<00:07:24.800> things<00:07:25.010> are<00:07:25.100> still<00:07:25.130> working<00:07:25.370> for<00:07:25.520> me

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:25.670 
those things are still working for me

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.280 
those things are still working for me
and<00:07:25.940> to<00:07:26.240> get<00:07:26.360> those<00:07:26.480> things<00:07:26.690> to<00:07:26.810> work<00:07:26.930> remember

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:27.290 
and to get those things to work remember

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.920 
and to get those things to work remember
fulcrum<00:07:28.210> between<00:07:29.210> the<00:07:29.330> first<00:07:29.540> two<00:07:29.690> fingers

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:29.930

want<00:07:40.790> to<00:07:40.850> see<00:07:40.940> wood<00:07:41.120> on<00:07:41.240> top<00:07:41.450> and<00:07:41.630> bottom<00:07:41.780> so<00:07:42.140> we

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:42.230 
want to see wood on top and bottom so we

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:44.170 
want to see wood on top and bottom so we
know<00:07:42.320> that<00:07:42.470> they<00:07:42.620> can<00:07:42.800> bounce<00:07:42.980> and<00:07:43.370> pivot<00:07:44.090> at

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:44.180 
know that they can bounce and pivot at

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.620 
know that they can bounce and pivot at
the<00:07:44.300> fulcrum<00:07:44.830> and<00:07:46.150> yeah<00:07:47.150> those<00:07:47.420> are<00:07:47.540> the

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:47.630 
the fulcrum and yeah those are the

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.930 
the fulcrum and yeah those are the
things<00:07:47.810> that<00:07:47.900> will<00:07:48.350> help<00:07:48.440> you<00:07:48.590> to<00:07:48.880> get<00:07:49.880> more

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:49.940 
things that will help you to get more

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.570 
things that will help you to get more
technique<00:07:50.540> the<00:07:50.660> longer<00:07:50.960> you<00:07:51.050> play<00:07:51.400> so<00:07:52.400> good

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:52.580 
technique the longer you play so good
