00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.480 

for<00:00:12.670> the<00:00:12.759> rain<00:00:12.880> barrel

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:24.980 

I<00:00:18.070> mounted<00:00:19.070> this<00:00:20.380> piece<00:00:21.380> of<00:00:21.529> plywood

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.200 

and<00:00:25.349> I<00:00:25.619> use<00:00:26.039> these<00:00:26.960> bushings<00:00:27.960> from<00:00:28.380> my<00:00:28.529> son's

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
and I use these bushings from my son's

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.160 
and I use these bushings from my son's
well

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
well

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.380 
well
throw<00:00:31.740> away<00:00:31.950> pieces<00:00:32.460> from<00:00:32.610> his<00:00:32.759> skateboarding

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
throw away pieces from his skateboarding

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.710 
throw away pieces from his skateboarding
I<00:00:33.739> wanted<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.800> have<00:00:35.040> some<00:00:35.850> distance<00:00:36.180> and

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
I wanted to have some distance and

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.900 
I wanted to have some distance and
clearance<00:00:37.140> between<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.280> bottom<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.850> and

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
clearance between the bottom of that and

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.700 
clearance between the bottom of that and
Lulu<00:00:39.150> because<00:00:39.270> this<00:00:39.840> solar<00:00:40.110> panel<00:00:40.200> gets

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
Lulu because this solar panel gets

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.760 
Lulu because this solar panel gets
really<00:00:41.280> really<00:00:41.550> hot

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.220 

so<00:00:45.340> at<00:00:45.490> least<00:00:45.640> that'll<00:00:46.600> allow<00:00:46.810> some<00:00:47.110> air

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
so at least that'll allow some air

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.840 
so at least that'll allow some air
circulation

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.900 
circulation
build<00:00:49.480> up<00:00:49.630> too<00:00:49.840> much<00:00:49.960> heat<00:00:50.550> but<00:00:51.550> this<00:00:51.700> is<00:00:51.880> a

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
build up too much heat but this is a

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.010 
build up too much heat but this is a
this<00:00:52.660> is<00:00:52.870> a<00:00:52.900> weatherproof<00:00:54.600> solar<00:00:55.600> panel<00:00:55.930> it

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
this is a weatherproof solar panel it

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.890 
this is a weatherproof solar panel it
can<00:00:56.170> stay<00:00:56.380> out<00:00:56.559> here<00:00:57.210> don't<00:00:58.210> know<00:00:58.390> if<00:00:58.510> I<00:00:58.629> want

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 
can stay out here don't know if I want

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.690 
can stay out here don't know if I want
to<00:00:58.960> leave<00:00:59.080> it<00:00:59.230> here<00:00:59.530> if<00:00:59.950> we<00:01:00.370> get<00:01:00.460> a<00:01:00.520> big

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
to leave it here if we get a big

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.500 
to leave it here if we get a big
hailstorm<00:01:01.800> which<00:01:02.800> is<00:01:02.980> why<00:01:03.160> I<00:01:03.520> mounted<00:01:04.210> it<00:01:04.330> with

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
hailstorm which is why I mounted it with

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.630 
hailstorm which is why I mounted it with
hinges<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:08.170> has<00:01:08.410> a<00:01:08.440> hinge<00:01:08.740> as<00:01:08.920> well<00:01:09.130> so<00:01:09.430> I<00:01:09.490> can

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
hinges this has a hinge as well so I can

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.600 
hinges this has a hinge as well so I can
adjust<00:01:09.910> it<00:01:10.119> right<00:01:10.150> now<00:01:10.450> I<00:01:10.479> just<00:01:10.690> have<00:01:10.990> this

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
adjust it right now I just have this

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.999 
adjust it right now I just have this
setting<00:01:12.610> I'm<00:01:13.270> thinking<00:01:13.780> of<00:01:13.960> adding<00:01:14.410> other

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
setting I'm thinking of adding other

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.950 
setting I'm thinking of adding other
settings<00:01:15.490> to<00:01:15.759> change<00:01:18.300> inclination<00:01:19.300> depending

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
settings to change inclination depending

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.210 
settings to change inclination depending
on<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:21.220> know<00:01:21.250> where<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.300> Sun<00:01:22.479> is<00:01:22.750> at<00:01:23.229> any<00:01:23.740> time

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
on you know where the Sun is at any time

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.990 
on you know where the Sun is at any time
of<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:24.369> day<00:01:24.430> or<00:01:24.610> season<00:01:25.479> year<00:01:25.869> or<00:01:25.960> whatever<00:01:27.000> or

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
of the day or season year or whatever or

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.950 
of the day or season year or whatever or
to<00:01:28.660> lay<00:01:28.869> it<00:01:28.960> down<00:01:29.020> flat<00:01:30.210> when<00:01:31.210> we<00:01:31.330> have<00:01:31.539> a

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
to lay it down flat when we have a

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.120 
to lay it down flat when we have a
really<00:01:32.380> bad<00:01:33.000> storm

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.840 

Oh<00:01:38.159> anyway

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.359 

there's<00:01:42.270> that

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
there's that

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.550 
there's that
and<00:01:44.820> then<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.060> cable<00:01:45.420> runs<00:01:45.659> over<00:01:46.289> here<00:01:46.469> to

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
and then the cable runs over here to

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.870 
and then the cable runs over here to
this

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.450 

weatherproof<00:01:49.510> or<00:01:50.020> waterproof<00:01:50.320> it's<00:01:51.190> called<00:01:51.400> a

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
weatherproof or waterproof it's called a

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.220 
weatherproof or waterproof it's called a

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
sportsman dry box pick it up at academy

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.550 
sportsman dry box pick it up at academy
for<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:58.600> arms<00:01:58.900> less<00:01:59.050> than<00:01:59.230> ten<00:01:59.410> dollars

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
for that arms less than ten dollars

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.340 
for that arms less than ten dollars
things<00:01:59.920> like<00:02:00.130> six<00:02:00.400> dollars<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:02.380> inside<00:02:02.710> that

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
things like six dollars so inside that

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.130 
things like six dollars so inside that
we<00:02:05.350> have<00:02:05.500> our<00:02:05.590> battery<00:02:05.970> it's<00:02:06.970> just<00:02:07.270> a<00:02:07.450> UPS

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
we have our battery it's just a UPS

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.859 
we have our battery it's just a UPS
battery<00:02:08.560> I<00:02:08.910> picked<00:02:09.910> up<00:02:10.030> one<00:02:10.300> electronic

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
battery I picked up one electronic

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.910 
battery I picked up one electronic
stores<00:02:11.850> 1200s<00:02:12.850> battery<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:14.500> then<00:02:14.680> there's

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
stores 1200s battery and then there's

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:24.210 
stores 1200s battery and then there's
the<00:02:15.100> pump<00:02:18.210> to<00:02:19.210> do<00:02:19.360> its<00:02:19.990> job<00:02:21.780> who<00:02:22.980> we've<00:02:23.980> got<00:02:24.130> an

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
the pump to do its job who we've got an

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.120 
the pump to do its job who we've got an
overcharge

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.230 

it's<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.400> voltage<00:02:29.970> regulator<00:02:31.970> so<00:02:32.970> it's

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
it's the voltage regulator so it's

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.020 
it's the voltage regulator so it's
saying<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:34.500> battery<00:02:34.800> is

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
saying that the the battery is

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.410 
saying that the the battery is
overcharged<00:02:36.650> so<00:02:37.650> that<00:02:37.830> happens<00:02:38.420> simply

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
overcharged so that happens simply

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.360 
overcharged so that happens simply
disconnect<00:02:41.810> better

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.780 

it<00:02:45.670> was<00:02:45.909> stopped<00:02:46.150> George

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.150 

actually<00:02:52.790> I<00:02:53.170> think<00:02:54.170> it<00:02:54.290> makes<00:02:54.440> more<00:02:54.650> sense<00:02:54.710> to

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
actually I think it makes more sense to

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.240 
actually I think it makes more sense to
leave<00:02:55.550> the<00:02:55.850> battery<00:02:56.210> attached<00:03:00.130> and<00:03:01.130> then

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
leave the battery attached and then

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.710 
leave the battery attached and then
disconnect

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:11.720 

so<00:03:05.860> panel<00:03:06.860> yes<00:03:07.520> it<00:03:08.000> makes<00:03:08.270> more<00:03:08.510> sense

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:19.200 

okay<00:03:12.240> so<00:03:12.300> that<00:03:12.569> batter<00:03:12.780> is<00:03:12.930> fully<00:03:13.140> tools<00:03:13.410> now

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.760 

there<00:03:20.210> it<00:03:20.300> is<00:03:20.360> it's<00:03:20.660> all<00:03:20.780> self-contained<00:03:21.110> it's

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
there it is it's all self-contained it's

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.080 
there it is it's all self-contained it's
highly<00:03:22.160> portable<00:03:23.950> set<00:03:24.950> this<00:03:25.100> over<00:03:25.280> here<00:03:25.819> out

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
highly portable set this over here out

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:36.060 
highly portable set this over here out
of<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.300> way<00:03:27.040> and<00:03:28.040> just<00:03:29.530> drape<00:03:30.530> this<00:03:30.770> up<00:03:31.010> here

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:43.800
