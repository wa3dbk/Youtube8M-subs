00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.230
 I took about 8 9 millimeters in 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:33.630
 diameter polymer clay 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:36.719
 I have a fimo effect number 81 and take a knife 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.500
 piece of clay and roll out 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.520
 about one and a half millimeters thick 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:47.160
 then cut out a circle using molds and 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:57.719
 knife, remove the excess neatly all 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:01:00.949

 cut the sausage into small pieces 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:08.100
 We apply to the workpiece and form 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.159
 semicircle exactly the same around the circumference 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.820
 our blanks attach the rest

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.810
 close the ends of the sausages pieces i 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:32.660
 I roll the little balls and lay them 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.660
 over the tips all around 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.310
 stack a little central 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.150
 part 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.830
 to get a small recess 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.979
 such a frame can be used 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:57.009
 for a score for this strong will 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:00.820
 Well, now we cover the board with a jump 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:03.759
 using a brush and bake and with that 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:08.640
 temperature and time are shown on 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.640
 packing your polymer clay and 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:21.580
 the final stage is varnish coating here 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.310
