mentality<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.539> kinder<00:00:52.050> gentler<00:00:52.260> version

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469

I<00:00:52.920> guess<00:00:52.949> just<00:00:53.879> because<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.539> don't<00:00:55.379> think<00:00:55.440> that

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
I guess just because I don't think that

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.200 
I guess just because I don't think that
he<00:00:55.800> was<00:00:55.920> really<00:00:56.070> aware<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.489> what<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.850> body<00:00:57.030> was

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
he was really aware of what the body was

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.490 
he was really aware of what the body was
capable<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.230> then<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:59.100> technically

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
capable of and then just technically

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.810 
capable of and then just technically
getting<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.590> affectations<00:01:02.010> down<00:01:02.489> that

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
getting the affectations down that

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.700 
getting the affectations down that
spider-man<00:01:03.300> doesn't<00:01:03.719> particularly<00:01:04.320> drinks
