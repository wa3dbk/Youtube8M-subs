00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
okay so this is a review of the well not

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.000 
okay so this is a review of the well not
a<00:00:20.789> review<00:00:21.210> it's<00:00:21.359> more<00:00:21.539> of<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.689> first<00:00:21.960> look<00:00:22.230> not

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
a review it's more of a first look not

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.849 
a review it's more of a first look not
first<00:00:23.310> look<00:00:23.519> but<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.850> look<00:00:24.060> at<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.859> NXT

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
first look but a look at the NXT

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
Mindstorms 2.0 robot by Lego this

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.530 
Mindstorms 2.0 robot by Lego this
actually<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.170> not<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.940> kid's<00:00:32.940> toy<00:00:34.040> it's<00:00:35.510> can<00:00:36.510> be

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
actually is not a kid's toy it's can be

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.380 
actually is not a kid's toy it's can be
used<00:00:36.780> for<00:00:37.050> more<00:00:37.590> advanced<00:00:37.890> like<00:00:38.219> high<00:00:39.149> school

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
used for more advanced like high school

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.780 
used for more advanced like high school
university<00:00:39.989> robotics<00:00:40.500> sort<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.829> thing<00:00:41.010> it's

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
university robotics sort of thing it's

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.720 
university robotics sort of thing it's
more<00:00:41.969> just<00:00:42.210> for<00:00:42.390> me<00:00:42.510> it's<00:00:42.629> for<00:00:42.690> fun<00:00:43.129> I<00:00:44.129> will

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
more just for me it's for fun I will

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.510 
more just for me it's for fun I will
probably<00:00:45.320> do<00:00:46.320> more<00:00:46.500> complicated<00:00:46.890> things<00:00:47.160> with

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
probably do more complicated things with

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.580 
probably do more complicated things with
it<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> future<00:00:48.110> but<00:00:49.110> basically<00:00:49.440> I'll

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
it in the future but basically I'll

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.590 
it in the future but basically I'll
start<00:00:49.829> off<00:00:49.980> by<00:00:50.129> saying<00:00:50.309> its<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:51.000> cut<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.390> comes

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
start off by saying its it cut it comes

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.910 
start off by saying its it cut it comes
it's<00:00:51.809> very<00:00:52.020> expensive<00:00:52.260> first<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.770> all<00:00:52.829> it's

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
it's very expensive first of all it's

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.180 
it's very expensive first of all it's
about<00:00:53.039> $400<00:00:53.640> but<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:55.260> comes<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.739> box<00:00:55.949> with

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
about $400 but it comes in the box with

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.860 
about $400 but it comes in the box with
instructions<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.789> make<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.000> quick<00:00:57.329> robot<00:00:57.690> it

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
instructions to make a quick robot it

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.569 
instructions to make a quick robot it
just<00:00:58.050> has<00:00:58.320> like<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.559> track<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.100> wheels<00:00:59.280> but<00:00:59.489> you

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
just has like a track in wheels but you

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.709 
just has like a track in wheels but you
can<00:00:59.699> look<00:00:59.820> up<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.059> instructions<00:01:00.480> for<00:01:00.600> this

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
can look up the instructions for this

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:01.279 
can look up the instructions for this
guy<00:01:00.870> online

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
guy online

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.740 
guy online
it<00:01:01.949> requires<00:01:02.460> all<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.850> pieces<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.570> box

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
it requires all the pieces in the box

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.880 
it requires all the pieces in the box
pretty<00:01:04.019> much<00:01:05.930> it's<00:01:06.930> called<00:01:07.110> alpha<00:01:07.500> Rex

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
pretty much it's called alpha Rex

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.810 
pretty much it's called alpha Rex
it's<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.369> humanoid<00:01:09.090> robot<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:10.010> basically<00:01:11.010> it

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
it's a humanoid robot it basically it

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.420 
it's a humanoid robot it basically it
took<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.240> spent<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.170> day<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.409> build<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.890> but<00:01:14.070> it

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
took I spent a day to build it but it

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.190 
took I spent a day to build it but it
was<00:01:14.580> sort<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.790> off<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.150> on<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.570> if<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.780> sat<00:01:16.020> down

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
was sort of off and on so if I sat down

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.300 
was sort of off and on so if I sat down
and<00:01:16.320> probably<00:01:16.590> take<00:01:16.710> me<00:01:16.830> around<00:01:17.009> three<00:01:17.280> hours

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
and probably take me around three hours

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.480 
and probably take me around three hours
to<00:01:17.729> do<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.619> I'm<00:01:19.619> not<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.950> greatest<00:01:20.369> at

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
to do and I'm not the greatest at

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.890 
to do and I'm not the greatest at
building<00:01:20.820> Lego<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:21.270> I'm<00:01:21.360> also<00:01:21.540> not<00:01:21.750> the

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
building Lego but I'm also not the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.469 
building Lego but I'm also not the
slowest<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.590> if<00:01:23.250> you're<00:01:23.460> not<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:24.000> greatest<00:01:24.360> at

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
slowest so if you're not the greatest at

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.450 
slowest so if you're not the greatest at
building<00:01:24.810> stuff<00:01:24.840> then<00:01:25.380> it's<00:01:25.950> gonna<00:01:26.100> take<00:01:26.340> you

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
building stuff then it's gonna take you

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.270 
building stuff then it's gonna take you
a<00:01:26.490> while<00:01:26.780> so<00:01:27.780> basically<00:01:28.110> here<00:01:28.470> we<00:01:28.740> have<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.890> an

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
a while so basically here we have a an

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.289 
a while so basically here we have a an
ultrasonic<00:01:30.000> sensor<00:01:30.030> which<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:32.299> basically

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
ultrasonic sensor which is the basically

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.530 
ultrasonic sensor which is the basically
the<00:01:33.479> eyes<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:34.890> eyes<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.280> alpha<00:01:35.579> Rex<00:01:35.759> this<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.420> a

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
the eyes the eyes of alpha Rex this is a

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.870 
the eyes the eyes of alpha Rex this is a
color<00:01:36.810> sensor<00:01:37.110> which<00:01:37.470> can<00:01:38.040> detect<00:01:38.490> obviously

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
color sensor which can detect obviously

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.260 
color sensor which can detect obviously
can<00:01:39.000> detect<00:01:39.299> color<00:01:40.700> these<00:01:41.700> two<00:01:41.880> back<00:01:42.000> here<00:01:42.150> are

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
can detect color these two back here are

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.969 
can detect color these two back here are
touch<00:01:42.479> sensors<00:01:42.869> which<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.229> robot<00:01:43.380> uses<00:01:43.829> to

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
touch sensors which the robot uses to

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.880 
touch sensors which the robot uses to
see<00:01:44.520> where<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.939> feet<00:01:45.149> are<00:01:45.470> you'll<00:01:46.470> see<00:01:46.680> when<00:01:46.860> I

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
see where the feet are you'll see when I

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.490 
see where the feet are you'll see when I
do<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.100> demonstration<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.909> when<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.570> when

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
do a demonstration that when it when

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.010 
do a demonstration that when it when
it's<00:01:49.619> trying<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.490> walk<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.970> will<00:01:51.119> use<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
it's trying to walk it will use the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.450 
it's trying to walk it will use the
touch<00:01:52.229> sensors<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.770> figure<00:01:53.009> out<00:01:53.130> where<00:01:53.280> the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
touch sensors to figure out where the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.130 
touch sensors to figure out where the
feet<00:01:53.700> are<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.659> actually<00:01:54.960> moves

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
feet are so that it actually moves

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.450 
feet are so that it actually moves
forward<00:01:55.500> instead<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.740> just<00:01:55.829> standing<00:01:56.250> still

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
forward instead of just standing still

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.459 
forward instead of just standing still
it<00:01:57.119> also<00:01:57.270> does<00:01:57.509> not<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.780> walk<00:01:57.930> back<00:01:58.170> where<00:01:58.380> its

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
it also does not to walk back where its

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.609 
it also does not to walk back where its
etc<00:01:59.600> so<00:02:00.600> basically<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.049> program<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.530> I've

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
etc so basically the program that I've

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.139 
etc so basically the program that I've
got<00:02:01.799> on<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.070> right<00:02:02.219> now<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.549> just<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.820> simple

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
got on it right now is just a simple

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.330 
got on it right now is just a simple
program<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.810> can<00:02:03.960> actually<00:02:04.409> spend<00:02:04.590> hours<00:02:05.130> and

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
program you can actually spend hours and

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.609 
program you can actually spend hours and
hours<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.210> hours<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.750> hours<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.170> hours<00:02:07.500> and

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
hours and hours and hours and hours and

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.290 
hours and hours and hours and hours and
hours<00:02:07.740> writing<00:02:08.160> programs<00:02:08.610> for<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:08.910> thing<00:02:09.090> it

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
hours writing programs for this thing it

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.680 
hours writing programs for this thing it
will<00:02:10.069> basically<00:02:11.069> unlimited<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.540> can

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
will basically unlimited and you can

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.430 
will basically unlimited and you can
build<00:02:12.840> so<00:02:13.170> many

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
build so many

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.360 
build so many
different<00:02:13.620> things<00:02:13.800> with<00:02:13.920> them<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.130> go<00:02:14.220> on

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
different things with them you go on

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.180 
different things with them you go on
YouTube<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.060> look<00:02:15.300> up<00:02:15.530> Lego<00:02:16.530> Mindstorms

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190

cube<00:02:19.170> solvers<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:19.710> crazy<00:02:20.130> stuff<00:02:20.460> with<00:02:20.610> this

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
cube solvers and crazy stuff with this

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.080 
cube solvers and crazy stuff with this
like<00:02:21.000> it'll<00:02:21.240> do<00:02:21.360> anything<00:02:21.600> it<00:02:22.320> recorded

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
like it'll do anything it recorded

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.340 
like it'll do anything it recorded
programs<00:02:24.090> with<00:02:24.300> a<00:02:24.330> block<00:02:24.630> sort<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:27.350> image

programs with a block sort of image

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.010 
programs with a block sort of image
based<00:02:28.640> programming<00:02:29.640> language<00:02:30.120> which<00:02:30.660> is<00:02:30.840> more

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
based programming language which is more

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.830 
based programming language which is more
for<00:02:31.380> beginners<00:02:32.190> but<00:02:32.550> it<00:02:32.640> also<00:02:32.880> required<00:02:33.630> it

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
for beginners but it also required it

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.790 
for beginners but it also required it
also<00:02:34.370> can<00:02:35.370> can<00:02:36.210> be<00:02:36.360> programmed<00:02:36.720> with<00:02:36.810> code<00:02:37.110> so

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
also can can be programmed with code so

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.860 
also can can be programmed with code so
lines<00:02:38.070> of<00:02:38.310> code<00:02:38.550> like<00:02:39.330> I<00:02:39.480> don't<00:02:39.540> know<00:02:39.690> if<00:02:39.780> you

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
lines of code like I don't know if you

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.800 
lines of code like I don't know if you
guys<00:02:39.960> understand<00:02:40.440> that<00:02:40.530> but<00:02:40.770> whatever<00:02:41.810> lines

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
guys understand that but whatever lines

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.600 
guys understand that but whatever lines
of<00:02:42.960> code<00:02:43.140> right<00:02:43.380> so<00:02:43.980> I'm<00:02:44.250> gonna<00:02:44.340> start<00:02:44.520> by

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
of code right so I'm gonna start by

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.920 
of code right so I'm gonna start by
turning<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:44.940> on<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.150> person<00:02:45.480> pressing<00:02:45.870> the

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
turning it on the person pressing the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.730 
turning it on the person pressing the
orange<00:02:46.140> button<00:02:48.110> basically<00:02:49.110> it<00:02:49.380> can<00:02:49.470> save<00:02:49.710> a

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
orange button basically it can save a

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.350 
orange button basically it can save a
whole<00:02:49.950> bunch<00:02:50.100> of<00:02:50.190> programs<00:02:50.580> on<00:02:50.730> here<00:02:50.940> I'm<00:02:51.120> just

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
whole bunch of programs on here I'm just

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.470 
whole bunch of programs on here I'm just
gonna<00:02:51.480> show<00:02:51.750> you<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.870> program<00:02:52.230> that<00:02:52.350> I've<00:02:52.440> got

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
gonna show you the program that I've got

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.890 
gonna show you the program that I've got
alpha<00:02:54.480> rx4<00:02:54.960> so<00:02:55.320> now<00:02:56.300> basically<00:02:57.300> when<00:02:57.660> I<00:02:57.690> run

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
alpha rx4 so now basically when I run

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.820 
alpha rx4 so now basically when I run
this<00:02:58.020> program<00:02:58.200> it's<00:02:58.620> gonna<00:02:58.770> walk<00:03:00.560> walk<00:03:01.560> for<00:03:01.800> a

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
this program it's gonna walk walk for a

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.280 
this program it's gonna walk walk for a
few<00:03:02.070> seconds<00:03:02.490> a<00:03:02.580> set<00:03:02.820> amount<00:03:03.060> of<00:03:03.120> time<00:03:03.290> it's

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
few seconds a set amount of time it's

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.500 
few seconds a set amount of time it's
gonna<00:03:04.470> ask<00:03:04.740> me<00:03:04.950> for<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.190> green<00:03:05.430> ball<00:03:05.670> but<00:03:06.480> I

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
gonna ask me for the green ball but I

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.760 
gonna ask me for the green ball but I
don't<00:03:06.750> have<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:06.900> green<00:03:07.140> ball<00:03:07.290> so<00:03:07.440> I'm<00:03:07.530> gonna<00:03:07.620> use

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
don't have a green ball so I'm gonna use

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.320 
don't have a green ball so I'm gonna use
this<00:03:07.950> green<00:03:08.250> frog<00:03:09.180> USB<00:03:09.930> dongle<00:03:10.110> head<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:11.330> I'm

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
this green frog USB dongle head and I'm

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.100 
this green frog USB dongle head and I'm
also<00:03:12.540> gonna<00:03:12.810> show<00:03:13.080> it<00:03:13.230> something<00:03:13.650> red<00:03:14.930> to<00:03:15.930> show

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
also gonna show it something red to show

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.690 
also gonna show it something red to show
you<00:03:16.170> what<00:03:16.380> it<00:03:16.470> does<00:03:16.500> when<00:03:16.800> I<00:03:16.830> show<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.160> red

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
you what it does when I show it red

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:26.420 
you what it does when I show it red
colors<00:03:23.750> use<00:03:24.750> this<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:25.110> show<00:03:25.260> it<00:03:25.350> red<00:03:25.560> okay<00:03:26.370> I'm

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
colors use this to show it red okay I'm

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.190 
colors use this to show it red okay I'm
gonna<00:03:26.520> run<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.850> program<00:03:29.540> so<00:03:30.540> oh<00:03:30.570> sorry<00:03:30.930> the

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
gonna run the program so oh sorry the

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.660 
gonna run the program so oh sorry the
program<00:03:31.530> doesn't<00:03:31.709> start<00:03:32.040> until<00:03:32.130> something<00:03:32.580> is

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
program doesn't start until something is

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.820 
program doesn't start until something is
less<00:03:32.880> than<00:03:33.060> 25<00:03:33.540> centimetres<00:03:34.320> away<00:03:34.410> from<00:03:34.530> its

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
less than 25 centimetres away from its

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.820 
less than 25 centimetres away from its
face<00:03:35.040> so<00:03:35.760> it's<00:03:36.180> my<00:03:36.300> move<00:03:36.480> my<00:03:36.630> hand<00:03:36.810> closer<00:03:37.020> it

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
face so it's my move my hand closer it

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.320 
face so it's my move my hand closer it
runs<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.160> program<00:03:38.280> now<00:03:38.580> it's<00:03:38.730> aligning<00:03:39.239> the

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
runs the program now it's aligning the

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:48.530 
runs the program now it's aligning the
feet<00:03:39.510> and<00:03:39.810> it's<00:03:39.930> walking<00:03:40.110> forward<00:03:47.030> so<00:03:48.030> just

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
feet and it's walking forward so just

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.420 
feet and it's walking forward so just
ask<00:03:48.690> me<00:03:48.870> for<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.080> green<00:03:49.320> green<00:03:49.800> please<00:03:50.130> it

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
ask me for the green green please it

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.790 
ask me for the green green please it
said<00:03:50.640> so<00:03:51.239> it's<00:03:51.900> actually<00:03:52.110> kind<00:03:52.500> of<00:03:52.530> slippery

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
said so it's actually kind of slippery

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.900 
said so it's actually kind of slippery
on<00:03:53.010> here<00:03:53.160> because<00:03:53.310> it<00:03:53.370> doesn't<00:03:53.489> have<00:03:53.640> any<00:03:53.670> grip

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
on here because it doesn't have any grip

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.310 
on here because it doesn't have any grip
but<00:03:54.090> I'm<00:03:54.180> gonna<00:03:54.300> show<00:03:54.480> it<00:03:54.510> red<00:03:54.810> and<00:03:54.840> watch<00:03:55.110> what

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
but I'm gonna show it red and watch what

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:04.009 
but I'm gonna show it red and watch what
it<00:03:55.380> does<00:04:01.519> so<00:04:02.519> it<00:04:02.580> just<00:04:02.730> said<00:04:02.880> red<00:04:03.150> shook<00:04:03.840> its

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
it does so it just said red shook its

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.160 
it does so it just said red shook its
head<00:04:04.080> so<00:04:04.560> no<00:04:04.920> negative<00:04:05.519> and<00:04:06.269> now<00:04:06.959> I'm<00:04:07.050> gonna

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
head so no negative and now I'm gonna

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.960 
head so no negative and now I'm gonna
show<00:04:07.260> it<00:04:07.440> the<00:04:07.620> green<00:04:07.830> and<00:04:08.340> after<00:04:08.670> I<00:04:08.700> show<00:04:08.850> what

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
show it the green and after I show what

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:17.920 
show it the green and after I show what
the<00:04:09.060> green<00:04:09.269> it's<00:04:09.450> gonna<00:04:09.570> dance<00:04:09.840> Oh

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:25.909 

it<00:04:18.930> thinks<00:04:19.229> it's<00:04:19.350> blue<00:04:19.620> hang<00:04:19.889> on<00:04:24.259> fail<00:04:25.259> Xbox

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
it thinks it's blue hang on fail Xbox

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:32.150 
it thinks it's blue hang on fail Xbox
case<00:04:30.080> it's<00:04:31.080> gonna<00:04:31.259> align<00:04:31.470> its<00:04:31.620> feet<00:04:31.830> now<00:04:32.070> it's

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
case it's gonna align its feet now it's

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:41.839 
case it's gonna align its feet now it's
gonna<00:04:32.280> dance<00:04:40.310> and<00:04:41.310> then<00:04:41.490> we'll<00:04:41.580> start<00:04:41.759> the

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:41.849 
gonna dance and then we'll start the

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:44.150 
gonna dance and then we'll start the
program<00:04:42.240> again<00:04:42.479> so<00:04:43.349> basically<00:04:43.620> I'll<00:04:43.889> show<00:04:44.039> it

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
program again so basically I'll show it

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.230 
program again so basically I'll show it
red<00:04:44.310> and<00:04:44.340> we'll<00:04:44.550> do<00:04:44.669> the<00:04:44.759> same<00:04:44.940> thing<00:04:45.150> as

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
red and we'll do the same thing as

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:53.600 
red and we'll do the same thing as
before<00:04:51.169> so<00:04:52.169> yeah<00:04:52.320> there's<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:52.919> possibilities

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
before so yeah there's the possibilities

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.520 
before so yeah there's the possibilities
are<00:04:53.729> endless<00:04:53.759> with<00:04:54.240> this<00:04:54.419> thing<00:04:54.630> and<00:04:54.840> it's

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
are endless with this thing and it's

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.960 
are endless with this thing and it's
personally<00:04:56.460> I<00:04:57.830> thought<00:04:58.830> when<00:04:59.400> I<00:04:59.430> first<00:04:59.699> got<00:04:59.820> it

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
personally I thought when I first got it

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.219 
personally I thought when I first got it
would<00:05:00.060> be<00:05:00.150> kind<00:05:00.330> of<00:05:00.360> a<00:05:00.449> kiddy<00:05:00.690> thing<00:05:00.990> but

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
would be kind of a kiddy thing but

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.129 
would be kind of a kiddy thing but
really<00:05:01.650> it's<00:05:01.979> not<00:05:02.099> it's<00:05:03.050> complicated<00:05:04.050> to

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
really it's not it's complicated to

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.770 
really it's not it's complicated to
build<00:05:04.320> it's<00:05:04.680> a<00:05:04.830> it's<00:05:05.400> an<00:05:05.520> amazing<00:05:05.910> project<00:05:06.120> to

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
build it's a it's an amazing project to

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.939 
build it's a it's an amazing project to
do<00:05:06.930> just<00:05:07.259> for<00:05:07.590> fun<00:05:07.650> or<00:05:08.130> for<00:05:08.430> school<00:05:08.729> it<00:05:09.949> teaches

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
do just for fun or for school it teaches

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:12.499 
do just for fun or for school it teaches
you<00:05:11.039> a<00:05:11.070> new<00:05:11.280> type<00:05:11.460> of<00:05:11.520> programming<00:05:12.120> language

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:12.509 
you a new type of programming language

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:15.050 
you a new type of programming language
and<00:05:12.720> it<00:05:12.840> teaches<00:05:13.349> you<00:05:13.789> surprisingly<00:05:14.789> about

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
and it teaches you surprisingly about

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.140 
and it teaches you surprisingly about
actual<00:05:15.599> robotics<00:05:16.139> and<00:05:16.320> how<00:05:16.410> things<00:05:16.710> work<00:05:17.150> and

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
actual robotics and how things work and

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.490 
actual robotics and how things work and
using<00:05:18.449> all<00:05:18.690> these<00:05:18.810> different<00:05:19.199> types<00:05:19.380> of

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
using all these different types of

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.909 
using all these different types of
sensors<00:05:20.930> all<00:05:21.930> right<00:05:22.110> I'll<00:05:22.500> probably<00:05:22.740> do

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
sensors all right I'll probably do

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.129 
sensors all right I'll probably do
program<00:05:23.430> updates<00:05:24.330> and<00:05:24.630> stuff<00:05:24.840> like<00:05:24.960> that

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
program updates and stuff like that

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:26.629 
program updates and stuff like that
because<00:05:25.229> I'm<00:05:25.409> no<00:05:25.560> genius<00:05:25.860> when<00:05:26.220> it<00:05:26.310> comes<00:05:26.460> to

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
because I'm no genius when it comes to

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:29.779 
because I'm no genius when it comes to
this<00:05:26.759> I'm<00:05:26.970> sort<00:05:27.659> of<00:05:27.720> new<00:05:27.930> I<00:05:28.650> do<00:05:29.190> know<00:05:29.460> a<00:05:29.490> few

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:29.789 
this I'm sort of new I do know a few

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:32.589 
this I'm sort of new I do know a few
basic<00:05:29.820> programming<00:05:30.479> languages<00:05:31.020> but<00:05:31.169> not

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:32.599 
basic programming languages but not

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:35.089 
basic programming languages but not
nothing<00:05:33.599> like<00:05:33.750> this<00:05:33.960> I<00:05:34.199> know<00:05:34.740> they're<00:05:34.889> a<00:05:34.919> bunch

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099 
nothing like this I know they're a bunch

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:36.740 
nothing like this I know they're a bunch

and I'm sort of a an intermediate when

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:50.149 
and I'm sort of a an intermediate when
it<00:05:48.570> comes<00:05:48.780> to<00:05:48.990> programming<00:05:49.650> right<00:05:49.919> now<00:05:50.039> I'm

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:50.159 
it comes to programming right now I'm

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:54.349 
it comes to programming right now I'm
just<00:05:50.310> a<00:05:50.400> beginner<00:05:50.520> all<00:05:51.360> right<00:05:51.509> thanks
