00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.929
 because Italian wines are so 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.910
 special 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.980
 I 'm alexandre esteves and today the theme is 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.980
 had you from italy follow me 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.739
 the staff today the theme is to see the Italians 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.079
 I'll accompany you on this trip for 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.360
 this country is one of the largest producers of 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.340
 world wines to italy is more or 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.280
 least third in area 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.830
 vineyards planted and in Europe it all 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.559
 competes with France to see who is 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.769
 the largest producer of wines in the world 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:58.110
 still flat wines from the north to the south 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:01.230
 it is not for less that it was called e 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:05.129
 by the Greeks, or land of the 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.190
 vineyards of the vineyards trained in the light 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.130
 where Italy is bordered by 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.890
 Switzerland and the Equator 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.259
 side where you have to use and italians there 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.500
 also a wine is planted 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.800
 then in those regions of Lebanese cold 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.200
 the current lieutenant 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.619
 plant grapes that make excellent wines 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.200
 in fact going down the whole italy goes 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.350
 have wine production and even the islands 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.890
 like Sicily, Sardinia or the very small 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.650
 island am would have to get almost closer 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.549
 of Italy than Italy has 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.900
 more than two thousand varieties of grapes 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.960
 native plants she also plants both 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.119
 now more recently 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.560
 but in fact Italy has always been in 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.270
 your own clothes 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.549
 if you ask for an Italian in the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.470
 What is the best food in italy? 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.180
 tell you the one about my mom's house 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.219
 if you ask which is the best wine 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.240
 from Italy he's going to say that 's the one 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.070
 region 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.890
 It is not for less, for example, too. 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.570
 policy it in January this year 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.610
 one of the people in the group commented that 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.489
 that wine looked like a bulletin in which 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.340
 he looked like a nebbiolo because he had 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.829
 some are softer soft more 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.140
 elegant and the owner of the vineyard do not 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:25.320
 liked he said will not politicize 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.910
 calculate screen mpb biola or are two 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.160
 different wines planted in two 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.840
 different regions and they value 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:36.239
 much what they do there and the three 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.190
 most famous regions for the production of 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.410
 Italian red wine is only just 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:45.370
 this the current policy she 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:48.880
 the Veneto Piedmont where you have noise 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.350
 barbaresco da tito and autoz cana claro 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.650
 that everyone knows the wines of the 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:57.310
 Tuscany that before Brunello the face of 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:00.010
 these three regions are the 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.560
 wines that has the largest area of 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.410
 wines of denomination of origin is 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.330
 guaranteed are the doc the doc 'sheik' 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.700
 there are in Italy for example this 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.010
 bottle of wine that I open here 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.650
 there is always this segment and it would be 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.750
 a g dock that's going to say it's a 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.710
 registered designation of origin and 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.250
 guaranteed 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:23.800
 this can be said that yes or that it is not 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.840
 a quality effect of the wine you go 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.390
 to see there is a plantation that is more 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.660
 restricted grape sacks you have to 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:34.300
 within a territory then it is 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.820
 so they get that seal of doc or 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:40.060
 doc designation of origin or denomination 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.160
 of controlled and guaranteed origin has 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.100
 The one I chose to take today is not 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.780
 Tuscan is not good the politeama and is not 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:52.050
 piemonte I chose montefalco 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:55.050
 sagrantino made with the grape called 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.050
 flagrant 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:02.170
 this is the wine produced in the 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:05.110
 The work is a region near Tuscany 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.459
 It's very close but it's colder. 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.910
 although it stays until a little bit 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:12.700
 more but low same region a bit 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.040
 more mountainous than the Tuscan one and went there 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.919
 for example in Perugia that I had the 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.770
 pleasure to study Italian is this vote 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:23.680
 Speak of the great island, this grape is great. 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:26.380
 a rather rough grape that had 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.100
 the tannins are quite rustic but today 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:33.970
 day with the techniques of vinification and with 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:36.550
 the care that has the same with pain 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.940
 you can do that we are powerful 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:43.570
 but they are is soft and yummy to take 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.390
 also and if you break foul you can see the 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.419
 Linen coloring copy is very intense 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.810
 It is a very intense nose wine. 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.810
 fruity 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:59.150
 already black cherry red dried herbs 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.600
 oregano 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.160
 It's funny that in Italian wines 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:07.400
 two things I always feel I always 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.350
 I feel earth sometimes wet earth is 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.870
 a sign as if there was a 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:16.840
 Brand new minerality I always feel 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.840
 also these herbs in the mouth 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:28.720
 the wine has full bodied 30 minutes 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:32.030
 strong have enough fruit in the mouth yet 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.800
 but it has some high ideas and that's what 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.350
 has the majority of Italian wines and 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.210
 this they match so well with the dishes 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.450
 for example goes very well with carla and 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:44.380
 also be it barbecue or is it 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:47.300
 kneaded or otherwise and 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:50.690
 but it is a very elegant gain that 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.910
 producer calls antonelli on my agenda 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.070
 well-known producer as well 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.020
 spoken in the world and this keep falcon 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.420
 Sagrantino surprised me 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.350
 so if you want to try something 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.140
 new 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:06.800
 go to the center or south of italy always 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:09.160
 can be a guide mark class or will be the 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.380
 south of italy up in calabria pulha 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.150
 basilicata and clara cecilia 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.040
 are regions that have increasingly 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.440
 invested in the quality of its wines 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:21.290
 the quality of their grapes and the 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:25.370
 of viticulture has the boy doing 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:27.520
 good wines with 13 also to the team goes 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.520
 to give 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.930
 ae
