that<00:00:40.220> we<00:00:40.430> use<00:00:40.670> an<00:00:41.000> Asha<00:00:41.270> in<00:00:41.660> our<00:00:42.470> now<00:00:42.739> the

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
that we use an Asha in our now the

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.580 
that we use an Asha in our now the
physiology<00:00:43.610> course<00:00:43.820> we<00:00:44.540> use<00:00:44.780> all<00:00:45.079> three

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
physiology course we use all three

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.740 
physiology course we use all three
portals<00:00:46.250> of<00:00:46.489> learning<00:00:46.970> and<00:00:47.180> what<00:00:47.480> does<00:00:47.630> that

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
portals of learning and what does that

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.960 
portals of learning and what does that
mean<00:00:47.989> it<00:00:48.380> means<00:00:48.440> we<00:00:48.890> use<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:49.220> audio<00:00:49.489> the

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
mean it means we use the audio the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.510 
mean it means we use the audio the
visual<00:00:50.450> and<00:00:50.660> the<00:00:50.750> kinesthetic<00:00:51.350> portals<00:00:52.310> of

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
visual and the kinesthetic portals of

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.750 
visual and the kinesthetic portals of
learning<00:00:53.200> audio<00:00:54.200> simply<00:00:54.710> means<00:00:54.920> you<00:00:55.160> learn<00:00:55.489> by

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
learning audio simply means you learn by

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.139 
learning audio simply means you learn by
listening<00:00:56.630> a<00:00:57.050> hearing<00:00:57.610> visual<00:00:58.610> means<00:00:58.850> you

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
listening a hearing visual means you

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.299 
listening a hearing visual means you
learn<00:00:59.360> by<00:00:59.600> seeing<00:00:59.870> and<00:01:00.230> kinesthetic<00:01:00.829> means

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
learn by seeing and kinesthetic means

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.590 
learn by seeing and kinesthetic means
you<00:01:01.700> learn<00:01:02.059> by<00:01:02.329> doing<00:01:02.780> by<00:01:03.290> touching<00:01:03.649> and<00:01:04.600> I

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
you learn by doing by touching and I

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.920 
you learn by doing by touching and I
find<00:01:06.020> that<00:01:06.280> the<00:01:07.280> audio<00:01:07.850> portal<00:01:08.420> of<00:01:08.540> learning

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
find that the audio portal of learning

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.530 
find that the audio portal of learning
in<00:01:09.110> on<00:01:09.320> itself<00:01:09.620> is<00:01:09.860> not<00:01:10.190> very<00:01:10.490> effective<00:01:10.850> audio

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
in on itself is not very effective audio

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.280 
in on itself is not very effective audio
means<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:12.290> teacher<00:01:12.560> talks<00:01:13.010> and<00:01:13.370> you<00:01:13.490> listen

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
means the teacher talks and you listen

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.990 
means the teacher talks and you listen
visual<00:01:15.290> is<00:01:15.470> also<00:01:15.920> very<00:01:16.070> important<00:01:16.790> than

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
visual is also very important than

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.840 
visual is also very important than
teaching<00:01:17.270> anatomy<00:01:18.010> so<00:01:19.010> we<00:01:19.190> have<00:01:19.369> lots<00:01:19.610> of

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
teaching anatomy so we have lots of

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.210 
teaching anatomy so we have lots of
charts<00:01:20.299> in<00:01:20.540> bone<00:01:20.780> shards<00:01:21.260> Muslim<00:01:21.680> charts<00:01:22.040> and

lots of models and other visual aids now
the<00:01:26.900> kinesthetic<00:01:27.680> world<00:01:27.920> is<00:01:28.310> especially

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
the kinesthetic world is especially

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.100 
the kinesthetic world is especially
important<00:01:29.750> for<00:01:29.960> massage<00:01:30.650> services<00:01:30.970> so<00:01:31.970> in<00:01:32.810> our

to provide us with all of our externally
visible<00:02:00.259> movements<00:02:01.070> they<00:02:01.610> do<00:02:01.909> that<00:02:02.119> by

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
visible movements they do that by

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.649 
visible movements they do that by
contracting<00:02:03.229> muscles<00:02:04.070> shortened<00:02:04.939> that<00:02:05.390> for

example this muscle or the biceps

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:10.510 
example this muscle or the biceps
brachii<00:02:07.700> when<00:02:08.629> it<00:02:08.810> contracts<00:02:09.319> it<00:02:09.709> pulls<00:02:10.250> on

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
brachii when it contracts it pulls on

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.520 
brachii when it contracts it pulls on
the<00:02:10.640> forearm<00:02:11.030> and<00:02:11.300> allows<00:02:11.930> us<00:02:11.959> to

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
the forearm and allows us to

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.710 
the forearm and allows us to
then<00:02:12.950> elbow<00:02:14.830> now<00:02:15.830> most<00:02:16.640> of<00:02:16.850> these<00:02:16.940> muscles<00:02:17.450> are

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
then elbow now most of these muscles are

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.780 
then elbow now most of these muscles are
attached<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.770> our<00:02:18.800> bus<00:02:19.459> so<00:02:20.360> we<00:02:20.690> also<00:02:20.959> study<00:02:21.620> the

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
attached to our bus so we also study the

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
bones the whole thing weighs about 30

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.830 
bones the whole thing weighs about 30
pounds<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.950> skeleton<00:02:31.580> actually<00:02:32.180> is<00:02:32.450> two

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
pounds and the skeleton actually is two

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.710 
pounds and the skeleton actually is two
skeletons<00:02:33.220> which<00:02:34.220> we<00:02:34.459> call<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:35.000> axial

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
skeletons which we call the axial

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.400 
skeletons which we call the axial
skeleton<00:02:35.989> and<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:37.130> appendicular<00:02:38.000> skeleton

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
skeleton and the appendicular skeleton

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
skeleton and the appendicular skeleton
the<00:02:39.410> axial<00:02:40.010> skeleton<00:02:40.220> consists<00:02:41.060> of<00:02:41.270> the<00:02:41.900> scope

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
the axial skeleton consists of the scope

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.120 
the axial skeleton consists of the scope
spinal<00:02:43.430> column<00:02:43.850> and<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.720> rib<00:02:44.900> cage<00:02:45.140> and<00:02:45.980> the

appendicular<00:02:46.610> skeleton<00:02:46.700> is<00:02:47.570> our<00:02:48.110> arms<00:02:48.590> and

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
appendicular skeleton is our arms and

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.390 
appendicular skeleton is our arms and
legs<00:02:49.660> now<00:02:50.660> you<00:02:50.720> will<00:02:50.989> notice<00:02:51.260> that<00:02:51.530> bones<00:02:52.070> of

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
legs now you will notice that bones of

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.660 
legs now you will notice that bones of
the<00:02:52.519> axial<00:02:53.090> skeleton<00:02:53.330> are<00:02:54.080> fairly<00:02:54.440> small<00:02:54.890> and

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
the axial skeleton are fairly small and

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.390 
the axial skeleton are fairly small and
they<00:02:56.030> are<00:02:56.239> fitted<00:02:56.739> pretty<00:02:57.739> tightly<00:02:58.100> together

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
they are fitted pretty tightly together

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.750 
they are fitted pretty tightly together
so<00:02:58.910> they<00:02:59.060> don't<00:02:59.269> move<00:02:59.690> very<00:02:59.989> much<00:03:00.760> consider

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
so they don't move very much consider

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.850 
so they don't move very much consider

learn names of bones yes you will learn
the<00:03:50.989> names<00:03:51.380> of<00:03:51.590> all<00:03:51.739> the<00:03:51.950> bones<00:03:52.239> but<00:03:53.239> we<00:03:53.420> also

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
the names of all the bones but we also

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.259 
the names of all the bones but we also
have<00:03:53.900> to<00:03:54.230> learn<00:03:54.380> the<00:03:54.829> names<00:03:55.220> of<00:03:55.549> the<00:03:55.670> bus<00:03:55.940> on

is pulling on the olecranon process and

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.680 
is pulling on the olecranon process and
allows<00:04:27.330> us<00:04:27.360> to<00:04:27.690> do<00:04:28.530> this<00:04:28.770> and<00:04:29.669> in<00:04:30.270> that<00:04:30.389> same

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
allows us to do this and in that same

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.530 
allows us to do this and in that same
manner<00:04:30.960> all<00:04:31.620> of<00:04:32.040> these<00:04:32.250> muscles<00:04:32.790> are<00:04:33.300> going<00:04:33.360> to

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
manner all of these muscles are going to

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.750 
manner all of these muscles are going to
be<00:04:33.720> attaching<00:04:34.260> somewhere<00:04:34.860> on<00:04:35.010> the<00:04:35.190> skeleton

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
be attaching somewhere on the skeleton

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.810 
be attaching somewhere on the skeleton
and<00:04:35.850> they<00:04:36.810> generally<00:04:37.500> attached<00:04:37.950> to<00:04:38.430> the<00:04:38.550> bone

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
and they generally attached to the bone

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.000 
and they generally attached to the bone
box<00:04:39.270> that<00:04:39.840> you<00:04:39.870> can<00:04:40.020> feel<00:04:40.650> all<00:04:40.889> over<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:41.610> body

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
box that you can feel all over the body

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.370 
box that you can feel all over the body
so<00:04:44.010> why<00:04:44.790> do<00:04:44.850> we<00:04:45.180> need<00:04:45.479> this<00:04:45.810> level<00:04:46.290> of

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
so why do we need this level of

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.469 
so why do we need this level of
specificity<00:04:46.680> why<00:04:47.430> do<00:04:47.580> we<00:04:47.820> need<00:04:48.030> all<00:04:48.270> these

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
specificity why do we need all these

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.500 
specificity why do we need all these
details<00:04:49.250> when<00:04:50.250> we<00:04:50.280> study<00:04:50.639> the<00:04:50.760> body<00:04:51.000> well

details when we study the body well

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.170 
details when we study the body well
quite<00:04:51.780> simply<00:04:51.840> because<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:53.220> type<00:04:53.520> of<00:04:53.550> massage

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
quite simply because the type of massage

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.740 
quite simply because the type of massage
that<00:04:54.840> we<00:04:55.050> teach<00:04:55.350> at<00:04:55.590> pacha<00:04:55.970> requires<00:04:56.970> this

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
that we teach at pacha requires this

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.379 
that we teach at pacha requires this
level<00:04:58.229> of<00:04:58.440> specificity<00:04:58.820> when<00:04:59.820> your<00:04:59.970> knowledge

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
level of specificity when your knowledge

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:03.740 
level of specificity when your knowledge
is<00:05:00.540> specific<00:05:01.110> your<00:05:01.590> work<00:05:01.950> can<00:05:02.550> be<00:05:02.760> specific

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
is specific your work can be specific

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.050 
is specific your work can be specific
and<00:05:03.900> this<00:05:04.440> allows<00:05:04.800> us<00:05:04.830> to<00:05:05.100> be<00:05:05.310> more<00:05:05.490> effective

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
and this allows us to be more effective

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.440 
and this allows us to be more effective
in<00:05:06.210> pain<00:05:06.810> relief<00:05:07.110> and<00:05:07.680> rehabilitation<00:05:08.450> for
