defense was defensive and for

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.699 
defense was defensive and for
self-defense<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.659> think<00:03:04.140> that's<00:03:04.349> a<00:03:04.500> great

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
self-defense I think that's a great

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.649 
self-defense I think that's a great
exercise<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.459> can<00:03:05.579> accomplish<00:03:05.970> a<00:03:06.150> lot<00:03:06.269> doing

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
exercise you can accomplish a lot doing

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.930 
exercise you can accomplish a lot doing
that<00:03:07.010> but<00:03:08.010> he's<00:03:08.129> pretty<00:03:08.310> much<00:03:08.430> pressure<00:03:08.700> on

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
that but he's pretty much pressure on

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.690 
that but he's pretty much pressure on
you<00:03:09.120> shoot<00:03:09.359> the<00:03:09.690> Bernard<00:03:10.590> Hopkins<00:03:10.799> because<00:03:11.549> if

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
you shoot the Bernard Hopkins because if

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.160 
you shoot the Bernard Hopkins because if
they're<00:03:11.849> gonna<00:03:12.000> be<00:03:12.209> something<00:03:12.629> eventually

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
they're gonna be something eventually

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.839 
they're gonna be something eventually
you<00:03:13.560> won't<00:03:13.709> be<00:03:13.890> able<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.069> stop<00:03:14.340> them<00:03:14.609> as<00:03:14.730> they

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
you won't be able to stop them as they

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.030 
you won't be able to stop them as they
get<00:03:14.970> older<00:03:15.329> but<00:03:15.780> I<00:03:15.810> think<00:03:16.079> for<00:03:16.290> discipline<00:03:16.859> I

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
get older but I think for discipline I

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.800 
get older but I think for discipline I
think<00:03:17.430> she's<00:03:17.549> on<00:03:17.669> the<00:03:17.760> right<00:03:17.880> path<00:03:17.940> by<00:03:18.419> taking

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
think she's on the right path by taking

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.210 
think she's on the right path by taking
us<00:03:18.930> on<00:03:19.169> to<00:03:19.680> some<00:03:19.950> to<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.430> place<00:03:20.790> karate<00:03:21.450> boxing
