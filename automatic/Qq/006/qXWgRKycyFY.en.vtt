00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.800 
and combined driving but on my test loop
I<00:03:18.010> actually<00:03:18.160> got<00:03:18.549> eighteen<00:03:18.940> point<00:03:19.239> nine<00:03:19.540> miles

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810

I actually got eighteen point nine miles
per<00:03:19.930> gallon<00:03:20.319> and<00:03:20.500> I<00:03:20.590> was<00:03:20.769> using<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.579> Eco<00:03:21.970> mode

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
per gallon and I was using the Eco mode

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.319 
per gallon and I was using the Eco mode
for<00:03:22.989> much<00:03:23.290> of<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:23.889> city<00:03:24.160> driving<00:03:24.459> and<00:03:24.639> some<00:03:25.209> of

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
for much of the city driving and some of

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.920 
for much of the city driving and some of
the<00:03:25.449> highway<00:03:25.750> driving<00:03:27.030> now<00:03:28.030> they<00:03:28.599> used<00:03:28.810> to

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
the highway driving now they used to

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.689 
the highway driving now they used to
offer<00:03:29.109> a<00:03:29.319> hybrid<00:03:29.859> version<00:03:30.040> of<00:03:30.250> this<00:03:30.430> which

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:30.699 
offer a hybrid version of this which

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:33.780 
offer a hybrid version of this which
would<00:03:30.879> rectify<00:03:31.180> that<00:03:31.629> problem<00:03:32.069> but<00:03:33.069> Infiniti

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
would rectify that problem but Infiniti

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.670 
would rectify that problem but Infiniti
has<00:03:33.819> canceled<00:03:34.419> it<00:03:34.510> due<00:03:34.690> to<00:03:34.840> lack<00:03:34.870> of<00:03:35.049> interest

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
has canceled it due to lack of interest

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.000 
has canceled it due to lack of interest
so<00:03:36.069> I<00:03:36.400> guess<00:03:37.209> luxury<00:03:37.659> SUV<00:03:38.079> buyers<00:03:38.409> really<00:03:38.739> just

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
so I guess luxury SUV buyers really just

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:46.530 
so I guess luxury SUV buyers really just
don't<00:03:39.129> care<00:03:39.280> about<00:03:39.430> fuel

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.720 

now<00:03:47.540> before<00:03:47.870> I<00:03:47.900> said<00:03:48.260> that<00:03:48.709> the<00:03:48.859> qx60

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.330 
pavement is uneven and the front end
unloads<00:05:07.599> then<00:05:08.599> the<00:05:09.050> SUV<00:05:09.560> just<00:05:09.590> kind<00:05:10.010> of<00:05:10.070> feels

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.689 
unloads then the SUV just kind of feels
unstable<00:05:11.000> it's<00:05:11.930> not<00:05:12.320> really<00:05:12.979> especially<00:05:13.550> with

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 
unstable it's not really especially with

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.159 
unstable it's not really especially with
the<00:05:13.820> optional<00:05:14.240> 20-inch<00:05:14.510> wheels<00:05:14.810> and<00:05:15.020> tires
