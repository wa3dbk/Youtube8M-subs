this<00:00:26.340> build<00:00:26.580> which<00:00:27.210> brings<00:00:27.420> me<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.840> runes

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080

but<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.890> only<00:01:14.040> thing<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.400> changes<00:01:14.760> in<00:01:14.909> this

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.270 
but the only thing that changes in this
build<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.720> build<00:01:15.930> path<00:01:16.140> maybe<00:01:16.830> i<00:01:16.950> might

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
build is the build path maybe i might

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.249 
build is the build path maybe i might
start<00:01:17.520> boots<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:18.030> mean<00:01:18.630> that's<00:01:18.720> kind<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.049> crazy

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
start boots I mean that's kind of crazy

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.719 
start boots I mean that's kind of crazy
and<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.619> probably<00:01:19.890> wouldn't<00:01:20.189> do<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.369> 10<00:01:20.549> out<00:01:20.670> of

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
and I probably wouldn't do it 10 out of

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.050 
and I probably wouldn't do it 10 out of
10<00:01:20.880> times<00:01:21.150> but<00:01:21.450> maybe<00:01:22.100> but<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.400> know<00:01:23.520> it's

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
10 times but maybe but you know it's

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.609 
10 times but maybe but you know it's
just<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.540> depends<00:01:24.930> on<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.110> build<00:01:25.290> which<00:01:25.470> I'll

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
just it depends on the build which I'll

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.490 
just it depends on the build which I'll
go<00:01:25.770> more<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:26.040> depth<00:01:26.250> with<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.939> bit<00:01:27.290> so<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
go more in depth with a in a bit so the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.760 
go more in depth with a in a bit so the
spells<00:01:28.740> here<00:01:28.979> flashing<00:01:29.909> ignite<00:01:30.290> that<00:01:31.290> the

spells here flashing ignite that the

Oriana<00:01:34.229> except<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.250> mean<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:35.700> use<00:01:35.850> barrier

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
Oriana except I mean you can use barrier

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.830 
Oriana except I mean you can use barrier
but<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.380> thing<00:01:37.500> about<00:01:37.560> barriers<00:01:38.600> you<00:01:39.600> may<00:01:39.780> be

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
but the thing about barriers you may be

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.740 
but the thing about barriers you may be
a<00:01:39.960> bit<00:01:40.229> safer<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:40.860> lane<00:01:41.130> but<00:01:41.970> do<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.509> want<00:01:42.689> to

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
the ground this video and for good

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:08.839 
the ground this video and for good
reason<00:04:05.310> as<00:04:05.430> you'll<00:04:05.609> see<00:04:05.790> later<00:04:06.530> but<00:04:07.699> the<00:04:08.699> most

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
reason as you'll see later but the most

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:10.240 
reason as you'll see later but the most
of<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.090> time<00:04:09.299> you're<00:04:09.449> laning<00:04:09.629> with<00:04:09.900> her<00:04:10.049> is

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
of the time you're laning with her is

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.500 
of the time you're laning with her is
probably<00:04:11.250> going<00:04:11.400> to<00:04:11.459> turn<00:04:11.669> into<00:04:11.849> a<00:04:11.940> farm<00:04:12.299> lane

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
probably going to turn into a farm lane

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.110 
probably going to turn into a farm lane
nine<00:04:12.750> out<00:04:12.989> of<00:04:13.019> 10<00:04:13.290> times<00:04:13.669> and<00:04:14.669> that's<00:04:14.849> not<00:04:15.060> a

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
nine out of 10 times and that's not a

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.839 
nine out of 10 times and that's not a
good<00:04:15.239> thing<00:04:15.419> to<00:04:15.629> have<00:04:15.870> happen<00:04:16.519> because<00:04:17.519> if<00:04:17.760> you

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
good thing to have happen because if you

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.039 
good thing to have happen because if you

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
can just sit there farming you can

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.409 
can just sit there farming you can
become<00:04:19.320> way<00:04:19.650> too<00:04:19.680> complacent<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:20.699> you<00:04:21.269> could

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
become way too complacent and you could

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:22.640 
become way too complacent and you could
just<00:04:21.449> try<00:04:21.690> to<00:04:21.750> get<00:04:21.900> gold<00:04:22.109> and<00:04:22.320> everything

else<00:06:48.489> is<00:06:48.849> and<00:06:49.119> so<00:06:49.989> pretty<00:06:50.319> much<00:06:50.469> this<00:06:50.769> game<00:06:51.009> i

00:06:51.329 --> 00:06:51.339 
else is and so pretty much this game i

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:53.549 
else is and so pretty much this game i
would<00:06:51.789> say<00:06:51.999> isn't<00:06:52.389> lost<00:06:52.629> at<00:06:52.959> this<00:06:53.079> point<00:06:53.349> for

would say isn't lost at this point for

00:06:53.559 --> 00:06:55.559 
would say isn't lost at this point for
them<00:06:53.759> but<00:06:54.759> it's<00:06:54.879> a<00:06:54.939> lot<00:06:55.059> harder<00:06:55.209> to<00:06:55.449> recover

00:06:55.559 --> 00:06:55.569 
them but it's a lot harder to recover

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:57.599 
them but it's a lot harder to recover
then<00:06:55.899> it<00:06:55.989> would<00:06:56.139> have<00:06:56.229> been<00:06:56.379> because<00:06:56.979> now<00:06:57.279> vain

00:06:57.599 --> 00:06:57.609 
then it would have been because now vain

00:06:57.609 --> 00:06:59.939 
then it would have been because now vain
ends<00:06:58.239> up<00:06:58.329> with<00:06:58.449> a<00:06:58.479> triple<00:06:58.839> kill<00:06:58.989> here<00:06:59.139> and<00:06:59.319> if

00:06:59.939 --> 00:06:59.949 
ends up with a triple kill here and if

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:01.529 
ends up with a triple kill here and if
it's<00:07:00.039> a<00:07:00.189> half<00:07:00.429> decent<00:07:00.699> vain<00:07:00.999> or<00:07:01.029> the<00:07:01.209> triple

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:01.539 
it's a half decent vain or the triple
