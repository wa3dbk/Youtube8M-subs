00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hi girls how are you in this video les 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.210
 I want to share three ideas of outfits 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.429
 that we could use for this dinner 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.500
 poinsettia these three ideas are things 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.210
 that I would really put myself then 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.040
 I wanted it to vary a bit 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.750
 First idea is like you have a dinner 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.520
 with your nuclear family that you're going to 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.619
 spend so relaxed in your home with 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.140
 your boyfriend with your dog, what do I know something like that 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.029
 super quiet the second idea is for 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.680
 when you already have a dinner like that with your 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.930
 bigger family that your 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.150
 uncles to dinner and that your mother-in-law and that you 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.800
 father-in-law and you do not count things and the last 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.480
 of ideas is for when you already have 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.100
 super dinner so formal that 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.910
 you want to go very well dressed and very 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.570
 Elegant 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.570
 let's go with the video 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.110
 for the first option I chose a sweater 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.360
 super comfortable of a color that was 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.860
 vibrant to see me so happier and with 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.210
 enough length to be able 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.210
 combine it with some leggings 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:00.160
 but taking care that you have this touch that 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:04.260
 it makes it different on my feet use some 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.260
 boots to keep me warm and comfortable 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.330
 and accessory just put me a 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.159
 bracelet in the tones of the rhinestones of 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.290
 sweater for the second option I chose a 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.320
 dress that at the top seems 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.210
 a blouse with sleeves on transparencies and 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.080
 at the bottom it looks like a skirt 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.080
 with a sophisticated design 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.990
 combined of some pantyhose and ones 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.990
 superclassic heels 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.200
 Y 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.220
 of accessories just use a maxi 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.220
 necklace and ready 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.840
 for the third option or a dress 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.350
 long with a sweetheart neckline and without 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.350
 suspenders 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.880
 how 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.840
 this has a detail of rhinestones in the 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.850
 neckline so I only use 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.380
 these simple earrings and a bracelet from 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.380
 same tone to complement 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.480
 and of shoes use ones also in color 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.629
 silver 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.629
