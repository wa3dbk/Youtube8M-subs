and<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:57.240> third<00:00:57.510> control<00:00:58.020> here<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.350> actually

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
and this third control here is actually

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.920 
and this third control here is actually
a<00:00:58.740> dual<00:00:58.980> control<00:00:59.550> what<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.300> does<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.510> electric

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
a dual control what it does in electric

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.230 
a dual control what it does in electric
mode<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.290> it<00:01:01.410> works<00:01:01.590> as<00:01:01.740> a<00:01:01.770> push<00:01:02.040> push<00:01:02.340> pop<00:01:02.670> to

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
give you single coil tones as well so it

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.930 
give you single coil tones as well so it
actually<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.830> occult<00:01:07.830> out<00:01:08.160> knocking<00:01:08.700> off

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940
