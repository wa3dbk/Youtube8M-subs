00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.650 
but this screw thing here is messed up
um<00:02:02.130> edges<00:02:03.130> are<00:02:03.280> like<00:02:03.430> strip<00:02:03.700> so<00:02:04.000> it<00:02:04.480> won't

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
catch on to the screwdriver so that's

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.970 
catch on to the screwdriver so that's
not<00:02:07.420> mark<00:02:07.690> so<00:02:08.290> we<00:02:08.380> had<00:02:08.500> to<00:02:08.590> find<00:02:08.740> some<00:02:08.920> other

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:08.980 
not mark so we had to find some other

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.220 
not mark so we had to find some other
work<00:02:09.250> together<00:02:09.520> which<00:02:10.420> is<00:02:10.630> very<00:02:10.869> messed<00:02:11.080> up

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
work together which is very messed up

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.740 
work together which is very messed up
and<00:02:11.470> i'll<00:02:12.340> probably<00:02:12.520> replace<00:02:12.730> strings<00:02:13.360> it<00:02:13.630> was

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
and i'll probably replace strings it was

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.810 
and i'll probably replace strings it was
bad<00:02:14.170> quality<00:02:14.620> if<00:02:14.710> it<00:02:14.830> just<00:02:15.010> broke<00:02:15.310> like<00:02:15.580> that

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
bad quality if it just broke like that

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.040 
bad quality if it just broke like that
um<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:18.040> here's<00:02:18.370> her<00:02:18.520> hair<00:02:18.810> I'm<00:02:19.810> not<00:02:19.930> really

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
um and here's her hair I'm not really

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
sure what's made of but it's pretty nice

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.670

I<00:02:22.330> mean<00:02:22.420> it's<00:02:22.600> not<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.870> nicest<00:02:23.050> hair<00:02:23.380> I<00:02:23.410> felt

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
I mean it's not the nicest hair I felt

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.160 
I mean it's not the nicest hair I felt
but<00:02:23.950> it's<00:02:24.730> nice<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.300> good<00:02:26.200> enough<00:02:26.640> um<00:02:28.170> it's
