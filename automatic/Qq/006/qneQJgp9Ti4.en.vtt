nine TRS I'm about to do false gates

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.869 
nine TRS I'm about to do false gates
because<00:00:40.530> they're<00:00:41.190> little<00:00:41.489> louder

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
because they're little louder

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.630

he's only sixty watts RMS as far as the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.900 
he's only sixty watts RMS as far as the
speakers<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.870> need<00:00:46.110> about<00:00:46.250> 75<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.460> 100

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
speakers and I need about 75 to 100

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.180 
speakers and I need about 75 to 100
six-month<00:00:48.390> hours<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.629> do<00:00:48.750> 100<00:00:49.110> watts<00:00:49.289> RMS<00:00:49.800> and

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
six-month hours to do 100 watts RMS and

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.490 
six-month hours to do 100 watts RMS and
the<00:00:50.399> six<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:50.700> has<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.000> do<00:00:51.120> 35<00:00:51.600> watts<00:00:51.840> RMS<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.410> I

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
the six in has to do 35 watts RMS so I

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.279 
the six in has to do 35 watts RMS so I
can<00:00:52.680> crank<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:53.010> amp<00:00:53.250> all<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.699> way<00:00:53.820> up<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.539> I

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
can crank this amp all the way up and I

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.930 
can crank this amp all the way up and I
have<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.680> worry<00:00:55.829> about<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.219> hand<00:00:56.489> blowing<00:00:56.760> my

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
have to worry about this hand blowing my

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.420 
have to worry about this hand blowing my
speakers<00:00:57.300> out<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.870> got<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:58.500> turned<00:00:58.770> up<00:00:58.949> half

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
speakers out I got this turned up half

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.380 
speakers out I got this turned up half
way<00:00:59.460> so<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.989> don't<00:01:01.289> really<00:01:01.500> know<00:01:01.800> what<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
way so I don't really know what the

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.969 
way so I don't really know what the
maximum<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.899> can<00:01:04.049> pump<00:01:04.290> these<00:01:04.379> speakers<00:01:04.769> at

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
maximum is I can pump these speakers at

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.690 
maximum is I can pump these speakers at
but<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:06.090> know<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:07.170> bass<00:01:07.409> amp<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:08.010> only<00:01:08.310> have<00:01:08.549> it

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
but you know the bass amp I only have it

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.940 
but you know the bass amp I only have it
turned<00:01:08.909> up<00:01:09.380> 30%<00:01:10.670> so

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
turned up 30% so

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.920 
turned up 30% so
I<00:01:12.979> will<00:01:13.640> have<00:01:13.759> the<00:01:13.909> high<00:01:14.060> output<00:01:14.090> officer<00:01:14.869> in

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
I will have the high output officer in

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.890 
I will have the high output officer in
there<00:01:15.049> just<00:01:15.200> yet<00:01:15.500> but<00:01:16.250> I<00:01:16.310> turned<00:01:16.400> it<00:01:16.729> up<00:01:16.850> 30%<00:01:17.570> so

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
there just yet but I turned it up 30% so

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.020 
there just yet but I turned it up 30% so
it<00:01:18.049> still<00:01:18.320> bunks<00:01:18.710> so<00:01:19.490> I'm<00:01:19.610> gonna<00:01:19.729> give<00:01:19.880> you<00:01:19.970> our
