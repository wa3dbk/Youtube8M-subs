00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
Dwayne's got the the numbers and the and

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.589 
Dwayne's got the the numbers and the and
the<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.710> figures<00:00:14.040> as<00:00:14.219> usual<00:00:14.730> yep<00:00:15.090> first<00:00:15.420> up

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
the the figures as usual yep first up

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.560 
the the figures as usual yep first up
you're<00:00:15.929> looking<00:00:16.019> again<00:00:16.500> at<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.769> 56<00:00:17.310> volt<00:00:17.850> tool

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
you're looking again at a 56 volt tool

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.460 
you're looking again at a 56 volt tool
yep<00:00:19.199> this<00:00:19.410> is<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.860> the<00:00:20.369> blower<00:00:20.960> it's<00:00:21.960> got<00:00:22.230> a

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
yep this is the the blower it's got a

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.439 
yep this is the the blower it's got a
low<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.520> high<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:24.480> low<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:26.240> 420<00:00:27.240> cubic

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
low and a high the low is 420 cubic

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.009 
low and a high the low is 420 cubic
meters<00:00:27.900> an<00:00:27.990> hour<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.859> high<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.150> 650<00:00:30.150> cubed

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
meters an hour the high is 650 cubed

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.810 
meters an hour the high is 650 cubed
mana<00:00:31.199> Xena<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.740> think<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.309> high<00:00:32.519> is

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
mana Xena I think that high is

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.790 
mana Xena I think that high is
industry-leading<00:00:33.389> that's<00:00:34.199> not<00:00:34.409> even<00:00:34.649> to

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
industry-leading that's not even to

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.739 
industry-leading that's not even to
mention<00:00:34.829> there<00:00:35.760> we've<00:00:35.850> got<00:00:35.999> a<00:00:36.030> turbo<00:00:36.359> on<00:00:36.659> the

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:36.749 
mention there we've got a turbo on the

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:37.219 
mention there we've got a turbo on the
top

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:37.229 
top

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:43.069 
top
turbo<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.629> 810<00:00:39.629> cubic<00:00:40.199> meters<00:00:40.949> per<00:00:41.389> hour<00:00:42.389> so

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
turbo is 810 cubic meters per hour so

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.110 
turbo is 810 cubic meters per hour so
this<00:00:43.289> have<00:00:43.889> a<00:00:43.920> look<00:00:44.190> at<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.489> size<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.999> this

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
this have a look at the size of this

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.360 
this have a look at the size of this
tube<00:00:45.510> they<00:00:46.469> don't<00:00:46.679> need<00:00:46.799> to<00:00:46.920> shrink<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.309> down

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
tube they don't need to shrink this down

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.430 
tube they don't need to shrink this down
to<00:00:47.909> get<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.120> velocity<00:00:48.329> yeah<00:00:48.870> what<00:00:49.199> do<00:00:49.319> I<00:00:49.379> is

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
to get the velocity yeah what do I is

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.649 
to get the velocity yeah what do I is
talking<00:00:49.829> about<00:00:49.889> he's<00:00:50.359> quite<00:00:51.359> a<00:00:51.389> few

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:51.659 
talking about he's quite a few

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:53.209 
talking about he's quite a few
manufacturers<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.440> like<00:00:52.619> you<00:00:52.739> have<00:00:52.889> a<00:00:52.920> pipe

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
manufacturers I like you have a pipe

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.770 
manufacturers I like you have a pipe
that's<00:00:53.429> in<00:00:53.609> each<00:00:53.729> of<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.999> I<00:00:54.030> threw<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.449> two

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
that's in each of the I threw that two

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.779 
that's in each of the I threw that two
or<00:00:54.989> three<00:00:55.170> inches<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.069> like<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.339> shrink<00:00:56.699> it

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
or three inches and I like you shrink it

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.099 
or three inches and I like you shrink it
down<00:00:56.940> at<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.089> end<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.359> they<00:00:57.389> get<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.749> velocity

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
down at the end so they get the velocity

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.840 
down at the end so they get the velocity
F<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.739> they're<00:00:58.889> looking<00:00:59.039> for<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.429> could<00:00:59.579> write

I<00:01:47.940> found<00:01:48.940> out<00:01:49.060> myself<00:01:49.210> I<00:01:49.450> keep<00:01:49.630> dipping<00:01:49.900> it's

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
I found out myself I keep dipping it's

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.890 
I found out myself I keep dipping it's
really<00:01:50.470> only<00:01:50.830> a<00:01:50.980> punch<00:01:51.310> so<00:01:51.400> how<00:01:52.030> this<00:01:52.630> thing<00:01:52.870> is

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
really only a punch so how this thing is

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.020 
really only a punch so how this thing is
really<00:01:53.200> small<00:01:53.590> like<00:01:53.860> Iseman<00:01:54.430> like<00:01:54.670> I<00:01:54.760> said<00:01:54.970> for

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
really small like Iseman like I said for

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.280 
really small like Iseman like I said for
the<00:01:55.120> start<00:01:55.390> there's<00:01:55.570> not<00:01:55.720> a<00:01:55.750> lot<00:01:55.840> of<00:01:55.870> bells<00:01:56.080> and

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
the start there's not a lot of bells and

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.200 
the start there's not a lot of bells and
whistles<00:01:56.380> on<00:01:56.710> it<00:01:56.740> but<00:01:57.340> it<00:01:57.490> just<00:01:57.520> doesn't<00:01:57.910> need

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
whistles on it but it just doesn't need

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.830 
whistles on it but it just doesn't need
to<00:01:58.360> be<00:01:58.980> one<00:01:59.980> of<00:02:00.070> the<00:02:00.130> main<00:02:00.340> differences<00:02:00.940> in

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
to be one of the main differences in

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.830 
to be one of the main differences in
this<00:02:02.080> that<00:02:02.500> I<00:02:02.800> can<00:02:03.070> see<00:02:03.310> is<00:02:03.520> it's<00:02:04.360> marketed

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
this that I can see is it's marketed

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.020 
this that I can see is it's marketed
with<00:02:04.960> a<00:02:04.990> turbine<00:02:05.500> fan<00:02:05.860> yeah<00:02:06.310> and<00:02:06.580> there's<00:02:06.790> got

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
with a turbine fan yeah and there's got

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.940 
with a turbine fan yeah and there's got
to<00:02:07.180> be<00:02:07.210> something<00:02:07.480> to<00:02:07.750> it<00:02:07.780> quite<00:02:08.590> a<00:02:08.619> lot<00:02:08.680> of<00:02:08.890> the

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
to be something to it quite a lot of the

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.440 
to be something to it quite a lot of the
blowers<00:02:09.310> that<00:02:09.400> I've<00:02:09.520> seen<00:02:09.790> it<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:10.119> I'll<00:02:10.210> pull

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
blowers that I've seen it and I'll pull

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.360 
blowers that I've seen it and I'll pull
one<00:02:10.600> apart<00:02:10.900> because<00:02:11.080> I<00:02:11.260> destroyed<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.040> inside

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
one apart because I destroyed the inside

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.660 
one apart because I destroyed the inside
of<00:02:12.520> one<00:02:12.700> once<00:02:13.140> is<00:02:14.140> when<00:02:15.010> you<00:02:15.100> actually<00:02:15.250> use<00:02:15.430> it

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
of one once is when you actually use it

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
of one once is when you actually use it
as<00:02:15.760> a<00:02:16.710> vac<00:02:17.710> yep<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.970> blades<00:02:19.300> in<00:02:19.510> it<00:02:19.540> the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
as a vac yep the blades in it the

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.510 
as a vac yep the blades in it the
impeller<00:02:20.050> blades<00:02:20.410> actually<00:02:20.830> get<00:02:21.160> hit<00:02:21.370> with

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
impeller blades actually get hit with

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.070 
impeller blades actually get hit with
rocks<00:02:21.760> hit<00:02:22.060> with<00:02:22.210> sticks<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:22.630> they<00:02:22.780> shatter

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
rocks hit with sticks and they shatter

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.020 
rocks hit with sticks and they shatter
in<00:02:23.290> no<00:02:23.440> time<00:02:23.710> this<00:02:24.250> thing's<00:02:24.520> been<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.670> blower

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
in no time this thing's been a blower

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.210 
in no time this thing's been a blower
arm<00:02:25.240> it<00:02:25.390> makes<00:02:25.540> it<00:02:25.690> a<00:02:25.750> little<00:02:25.900> bit<00:02:26.080> easier<00:02:26.380> for

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
arm it makes it a little bit easier for

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.460 
arm it makes it a little bit easier for
them<00:02:27.850> to<00:02:27.880> avoid<00:02:28.240> that<00:02:28.480> but<00:02:28.810> it's<00:02:28.930> a<00:02:28.960> turbine

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
them to avoid that but it's a turbine

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.010 
them to avoid that but it's a turbine
shape<00:02:29.860> fan<00:02:30.220> is<00:02:30.820> something<00:02:31.180> to<00:02:31.330> it<00:02:31.360> I'm<00:02:31.840> no

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
shape fan is something to it I'm no

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.260 
shape fan is something to it I'm no
engineer<00:02:32.170> I'm<00:02:32.650> no<00:02:32.800> expert<00:02:33.040> on<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:33.580> but<00:02:34.030> this

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
engineer I'm no expert on it but this

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.630 
engineer I'm no expert on it but this
thing<00:02:34.540> is<00:02:34.750> truly<00:02:35.380> anakin<00:02:35.980> trial<00:02:36.250> so<00:02:36.400> you'll

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
thing is truly anakin trial so you'll

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.730 
thing is truly anakin trial so you'll
see<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:37.030> video<00:02:37.150> it's<00:02:38.020> most<00:02:38.350> stuff<00:02:38.590> away

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
see the video it's most stuff away

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.650 
see the video it's most stuff away
really<00:02:39.190> well<00:02:39.400> yeah<00:02:39.790> it's<00:02:40.090> all<00:02:40.270> it's<00:02:40.420> meant<00:02:40.600> to

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
really well yeah it's all it's meant to

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.300 
really well yeah it's all it's meant to
do<00:02:40.810> it's<00:02:40.960> a<00:02:41.050> blower<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.560> we're<00:02:41.920> not<00:02:42.010> trying<00:02:42.250> to

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
do it's a blower and we're not trying to

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.200 
do it's a blower and we're not trying to
pump<00:02:42.520> something<00:02:42.910> up<00:02:43.030> -<00:02:43.210> is<00:02:43.450> it<00:02:43.600> no<00:02:43.990> but<00:02:44.170> this<00:02:44.380> is

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
pump something up - is it no but this is

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.080 
pump something up - is it no but this is
opportunities<00:02:46.210> might<00:02:46.540> be<00:02:46.870> short<00:02:47.410> and<00:02:48.400> quite

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
opportunities might be short and quite

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.760 
opportunities might be short and quite
traveling<00:02:49.540> just<00:02:49.630> to<00:02:49.720> hold<00:02:49.960> that<00:02:50.170> stand<00:02:50.590> and

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
traveling just to hold that stand and

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:51.930 
traveling just to hold that stand and
arms<00:02:51.070> reach<00:02:51.370> yeah

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
arms reach yeah

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.970 
arms reach yeah
and<00:02:52.120> drop<00:02:52.450> down<00:02:52.660> so<00:02:52.870> one<00:02:53.380> of<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.560> good<00:02:53.709> thing

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
and drop down so one of the good thing

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.790 
and drop down so one of the good thing
is<00:02:54.130> to<00:02:54.400> make<00:02:54.610> this<00:02:54.910> you'll<00:02:55.630> see<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.410> vents<00:02:56.680> out

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
is to make this you'll see the vents out

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.170 
is to make this you'll see the vents out
on<00:02:56.950> the<00:02:57.040> side<00:02:57.280> which<00:02:57.489> the<00:02:57.520> hell<00:02:57.760> with<00:02:57.880> a<00:02:57.970> lot

Monday's batteries you know that's not

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.300 
Monday's batteries you know that's not
an<00:04:56.420> hour<00:04:56.600> on<00:04:56.810> turbo<00:04:57.260> now<00:04:57.860> it's<00:04:58.040> how<00:04:58.190> much

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
an hour on turbo now it's how much
