00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
I feel personally this is a good move

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.140 
I feel personally this is a good move
because<00:01:27.680> we<00:01:28.680> all<00:01:28.860> know<00:01:28.890> for<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.340> fact<00:01:29.579> Lukaku

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
because we all know for a fact Lukaku

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.880 
because we all know for a fact Lukaku
wouldn't<00:01:30.479> be<00:01:30.570> playing<00:01:30.780> every<00:01:31.170> single<00:01:31.500> game<00:01:31.680> if

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
wouldn't be playing every single game if

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.370 
wouldn't be playing every single game if
he<00:01:31.979> was<00:01:32.070> at<00:01:32.189> Chelsea<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.960> feel<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.140> experience

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
he was at Chelsea I feel the experience

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.910 
he was at Chelsea I feel the experience
he's<00:01:34.920> getting<00:01:35.369> at<00:01:35.520> Everton<00:01:35.970> who's<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:37.140> big<00:01:37.619> club

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
he's getting at Everton who's a big club

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.999 
he's getting at Everton who's a big club
but<00:01:38.490> not<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.759> club<00:01:39.150> fighting<00:01:39.540> for<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.750> title<00:01:40.009> so

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
but not a club fighting for the title so

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.929 
but not a club fighting for the title so
it's<00:01:41.189> perfect<00:01:41.610> for<00:01:41.880> someone<00:01:42.689> who<00:01:42.810> develop<00:01:43.259> him

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
it's perfect for someone who develop him

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.620 
it's perfect for someone who develop him
I<00:01:45.409> feel<00:01:46.409> him<00:01:46.680> at<00:01:46.860> Everton<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.430> really<00:01:48.420> really

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
I feel him at Everton is really really

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.840 
I feel him at Everton is really really
helping<00:01:49.079> us<00:01:49.200> out<00:01:49.380> because<00:01:49.590> if<00:01:50.009> we<00:01:50.310> can<00:01:50.340> get<00:01:50.670> him

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
helping us out because if we can get him

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.530 
helping us out because if we can get him
back<00:01:51.149> in<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.600> summer<00:01:51.860> from<00:01:52.860> next<00:01:53.250> season<00:01:53.540> him

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
back in the summer from next season him

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.340 
back in the summer from next season him
and<00:01:55.579> someone<00:01:56.579> else<00:01:56.790> may<00:01:57.659> be<00:01:57.719> at<00:01:57.960> home<00:01:58.140> maybe

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
and someone else may be at home maybe

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.310 
and someone else may be at home maybe
Torrez<00:01:58.710> maybe<00:01:59.130> even<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.610> new<00:01:59.640> person<00:02:00.240> can<00:02:01.140> be

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
Torrez maybe even a new person can be

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.389 
Torrez maybe even a new person can be
our<00:02:01.560> number<00:02:02.189> one<00:02:02.399> choice<00:02:02.640> striker<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.860> I<00:02:04.860> feel

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
our number one choice striker and I feel

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.180 
our number one choice striker and I feel
Lukaku<00:02:06.000> has<00:02:06.119> so<00:02:06.390> much<00:02:06.540> potential<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.290> think<00:02:08.069> he

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
Lukaku has so much potential I think he

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.699 
Lukaku has so much potential I think he
is<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.640> next<00:02:08.910> dogma<00:02:09.270> when<00:02:09.750> people<00:02:10.080> say<00:02:10.379> odd

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
is the next dogma when people say odd

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.040 
is the next dogma when people say odd
