sometimes I really like watching the

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.390 
sometimes I really like watching the
matches<00:06:28.409> that<00:06:28.439> be<00:06:28.680> in<00:06:28.770> the<00:06:28.830> backgrounds<00:06:29.310> of

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
matches that be in the backgrounds of

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.100 
matches that be in the backgrounds of
some<00:06:29.550> people's<00:06:29.849> videos<00:06:30.150> and<00:06:30.180> have<00:06:30.990> you

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
some people's videos and have you

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.629 
some people's videos and have you
wondering<00:06:31.439> the<00:06:31.530> outcomes<00:06:31.919> and<00:06:32.159> because<00:06:32.490> these

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 
wondering the outcomes and because these

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:34.700 
wondering the outcomes and because these
matches<00:06:33.060> will<00:06:33.180> actually<00:06:33.569> never<00:06:33.810> get<00:06:34.050> posted<00:06:34.530> I

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
matches will actually never get posted I

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.409 
matches will actually never get posted I
figured<00:06:35.310> I<00:06:35.400> would<00:06:35.550> post<00:06:35.759> this<00:06:35.909> because<00:06:36.180> these

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 
figured I would post this because these

00:06:36.419 --> 00:08:00.330 
figured I would post this because these
are<00:06:36.629> my<00:06:36.780> ranked<00:06:36.960> matches<00:06:37.169> so<00:06:37.530> you<00:06:38.189> guys<00:06:38.340> enjoy

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:00.340
