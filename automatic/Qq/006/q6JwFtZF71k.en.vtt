waterproof cameras the disposable ones

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:30.300 
waterproof cameras the disposable ones
but<00:00:29.169> I've<00:00:29.319> never<00:00:29.470> had<00:00:29.710> much<00:00:29.890> luck<00:00:29.919> so

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
but I've never had much luck so

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.950 
but I've never had much luck so
originally<00:00:30.970> I<00:00:31.149> started<00:00:31.269> looking<00:00:31.869> at

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
originally I started looking at

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.990 
originally I started looking at
waterproof<00:00:32.439> cameras<00:00:32.860> but<00:00:33.489> when<00:00:33.699> I<00:00:33.730> saw<00:00:33.940> the

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
waterproof cameras but when I saw the

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.700 
waterproof cameras but when I saw the
prices<00:00:34.269> of<00:00:34.570> them<00:00:34.780> I<00:00:34.809> think<00:00:35.079> the<00:00:35.230> cheapest<00:00:35.590> one

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
prices of them I think the cheapest one

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.500 
prices of them I think the cheapest one
was<00:00:35.859> about<00:00:36.100> sixty<00:00:36.640> pounds<00:00:36.969> that<00:00:37.059> had<00:00:37.210> a<00:00:37.239> really

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
was about sixty pounds that had a really

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.840 
was about sixty pounds that had a really
bad<00:00:37.690> view<00:00:38.079> I<00:00:38.260> just<00:00:38.980> thought<00:00:39.070> for<00:00:39.129> one<00:00:39.640> day

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
bad view I just thought for one day

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.669 
bad view I just thought for one day
snorkeling<00:00:40.420> is<00:00:40.600> it's<00:00:40.929> not<00:00:41.170> going<00:00:41.379> to<00:00:41.440> be<00:00:41.500> worth

00:00:41.669 --> 00:00:41.679 
snorkeling is it's not going to be worth

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:44.669 
snorkeling is it's not going to be worth
it<00:00:41.890> so<00:00:42.670> instead<00:00:43.329> I<00:00:43.390> like<00:00:43.629> to<00:00:43.809> watch<00:00:44.500> with

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:44.679 
it so instead I like to watch with

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:46.919 
it so instead I like to watch with
camera<00:00:45.039> cases<00:00:45.429> for<00:00:45.699> my<00:00:46.089> current<00:00:46.420> camera<00:00:46.600> the

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:46.929 
camera cases for my current camera the

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:49.709 
camera cases for my current camera the
Fujifilm<00:00:47.469> but<00:00:48.219> obviously<00:00:48.820> it's<00:00:49.269> much<00:00:49.420> like<00:00:49.629> to

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719 
Fujifilm but obviously it's much like to

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:51.779 
Fujifilm but obviously it's much like to
trust<00:00:49.989> that<00:00:50.079> case<00:00:50.410> I'm<00:00:50.649> still<00:00:51.460> a<00:00:51.489> little<00:00:51.670> bit

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:51.789 
trust that case I'm still a little bit

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.419 
trust that case I'm still a little bit
worried<00:00:52.120> that<00:00:52.210> it<00:00:52.359> might<00:00:52.960> leak<00:00:53.199> or<00:00:53.530> I<00:00:53.559> might

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:54.429 
worried that it might leak or I might

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:54.599 
worried that it might leak or I might
not

00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:54.609 
not

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:56.970 
not
attach<00:00:54.999> the<00:00:55.210> case<00:00:55.420> properly<00:00:55.600> so<00:00:56.170> I've<00:00:56.769> decided

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
through here so here is the camera

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.750 
through here so here is the camera
inside<00:02:09.039> bag<00:02:09.310> and<00:02:09.640> I<00:02:09.970> have<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.869> see

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
inside bag and I have the see

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.580 
inside bag and I have the see
even<00:02:12.569> other<00:02:12.690> suppose<00:02:12.930> they<00:02:13.050> had<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.379> size

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
even other suppose they had the size

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.990 
even other suppose they had the size
that<00:02:13.830> you've<00:02:13.980> recommended<00:02:14.280> for<00:02:14.550> my<00:02:14.640> camera

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
that you've recommended for my camera

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.990 
that you've recommended for my camera
it's<00:02:15.420> it's<00:02:15.840> really<00:02:16.379> it's<00:02:16.530> quite<00:02:16.890> big<00:02:17.129> um<00:02:17.489> and

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
it's it's really it's quite big um and

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.150 
it's it's really it's quite big um and
the<00:02:18.599> camera<00:02:18.989> is<00:02:19.050> sliding<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.650> bit<00:02:19.769> but<00:02:19.950> I'm

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
the camera is sliding a bit but I'm

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.619 
the camera is sliding a bit but I'm
going<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.340> see<00:02:20.459> how<00:02:20.550> it<00:02:20.670> takes<00:02:21.000> pictures<00:02:21.150> Amy

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
going to see how it takes pictures Amy

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.479 
going to see how it takes pictures Amy
because<00:02:21.870> as<00:02:22.680> long<00:02:22.830> as<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.040> doesn't<00:02:23.190> get<00:02:23.370> any

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
because as long as it doesn't get any

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.059 
because as long as it doesn't get any
the<00:02:23.610> black<00:02:23.790> bits<00:02:24.030> in<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.300> off<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:25.800> ring<00:02:25.950> of

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
the black bits in it off the the ring of

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.860 
the black bits in it off the the ring of
the<00:02:26.190> lens<00:02:26.340> enclosure<00:02:27.120> then<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:27.569> should<00:02:27.780> be

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
the lens enclosure then it should be

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.530 
the lens enclosure then it should be
fine<00:02:28.080> so<00:02:28.640> it's<00:02:29.640> going<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.849> try<00:02:29.970> taking<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.360> quick

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
fine so it's going to try taking a quick

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.259 
fine so it's going to try taking a quick
picture<00:02:30.720> like<00:02:30.989> this<00:02:31.580> so<00:02:32.580> I<00:02:32.610> suppose<00:02:33.680> here<00:02:35.269> also

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
picture like this so I suppose here also

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.350 
picture like this so I suppose here also
on<00:02:36.510> so<00:02:37.170> we<00:02:37.440> were<00:02:37.560> difficult<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.040> change<00:02:38.269> if<00:02:39.269> I

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
on so we were difficult to change if I

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.770 
on so we were difficult to change if I
would<00:02:39.540> recommend<00:02:40.019> putting<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.680> on<00:02:40.739> auto<00:02:41.040> and

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
would recommend putting it on auto and

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.589 
would recommend putting it on auto and
and<00:02:42.780> not<00:02:43.049> not<00:02:43.379> me<00:02:43.560> not<00:02:43.830> reading<00:02:44.099> it<00:02:44.599> the

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
and not not me not reading it the

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:52.250 
and not not me not reading it the
settings<00:02:46.110> so<00:02:46.830> let's<00:02:47.010> try<00:02:48.920> there<00:02:49.920> we<00:02:50.010> go<00:02:51.079> it<00:02:52.079> has

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
settings so let's try there we go it has

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.080 
settings so let's try there we go it has
taken<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.709> picture<00:02:52.890> pretty<00:02:53.340> well<00:02:53.610> even<00:02:53.819> though

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
taken a picture pretty well even though

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.880 
taken a picture pretty well even though
it<00:02:54.360> does<00:02:54.630> look<00:02:54.780> like<00:02:54.900> it's<00:02:55.079> sliding<00:02:55.260> as<00:02:55.650> long

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
it does look like it's sliding as long

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.370 
it does look like it's sliding as long
as<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.040> kind<00:02:56.220> of<00:02:56.250> hold<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.640> camera<00:02:56.970> up<00:02:57.380> about

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
as you kind of hold the camera up about

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.710 
as you kind of hold the camera up about
here<00:02:58.829> then<00:02:59.459> it<00:02:59.610> is<00:02:59.700> going<00:02:59.849> to<00:02:59.940> fine<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.180> just

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
here then it is going to fine you just

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.900 
here then it is going to fine you just
kind<00:03:00.959> of<00:03:01.019> need<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.200> maneuver<00:03:01.829> your<00:03:02.220> your

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
kind of need to maneuver your your

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.390 
kind of need to maneuver your your
fingers<00:03:03.180> a<00:03:03.209> bit<00:03:03.269> to<00:03:03.450> get<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:03.690> work<00:03:03.840> so<00:03:04.400> let's

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
fingers a bit to get it to work so let's

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:14.400 
fingers a bit to get it to work so let's
go<00:03:05.489> get<00:03:05.610> some<00:03:05.760> water<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.269> try<00:03:06.900> this<00:03:06.959> out

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.490 

okay<00:03:14.980> so<00:03:15.120> let's<00:03:16.120> get<00:03:16.270> this<00:03:16.420> straight<00:03:16.630> off<00:03:16.900> and

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
okay so let's get this straight off and

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.850 
okay so let's get this straight off and
pump<00:03:18.340> it<00:03:18.460> up<00:03:18.550> and<00:03:18.700> see<00:03:18.780> ya<00:03:19.780> cameras<00:03:20.710> going

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
pump it up and see ya cameras going

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.410 
pump it up and see ya cameras going
right<00:03:21.070> and<00:03:21.940> it<00:03:22.180> still<00:03:22.470> works<00:03:23.470> so<00:03:24.150> I'll<00:03:25.150> put<00:03:25.330> in

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
right and it still works so I'll put in

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.150 
right and it still works so I'll put in
the<00:03:25.480> pictures<00:03:25.810> here<00:03:26.140> of<00:03:26.260> what<00:03:27.040> I<00:03:27.070> took

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
the pictures here of what I took

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.600 
the pictures here of what I took
underwater<00:03:27.670> and<00:03:28.200> overall<00:03:29.200> I<00:03:29.530> think<00:03:29.710> I<00:03:30.160> would

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
underwater and overall I think I would

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.590 
underwater and overall I think I would
give<00:03:30.790> this<00:03:30.940> this<00:03:31.420> case<00:03:32.190> probably<00:03:33.190> about<00:03:33.370> an<00:03:33.700> EO

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
give this this case probably about an EO

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.440 
give this this case probably about an EO
of<00:03:34.900> 10<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:36.640> things<00:03:36.850> I<00:03:36.970> was<00:03:37.120> a<00:03:37.180> bit<00:03:37.270> concerned

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
of 10 the things I was a bit concerned

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.980 
of 10 the things I was a bit concerned
about<00:03:37.690> obviously<00:03:38.110> it<00:03:38.230> it's<00:03:38.680> sliding<00:03:38.980> down<00:03:39.370> a

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
about obviously it it's sliding down a

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.970 
about obviously it it's sliding down a
proved<00:03:40.990> not<00:03:41.200> to<00:03:41.260> be<00:03:41.380> a<00:03:41.440> problem<00:03:41.620> at<00:03:41.860> all

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
proved not to be a problem at all

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.800 
proved not to be a problem at all
because<00:03:42.190> I<00:03:42.610> wasn't<00:03:43.030> even<00:03:43.240> really<00:03:43.360> holding<00:03:43.690> on

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
because I wasn't even really holding on

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.860 
because I wasn't even really holding on
to<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:43.990> camera<00:03:44.200> and<00:03:44.820> it's<00:03:45.820> so<00:03:46.120> you<00:03:46.540> know<00:03:46.630> even

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
to the camera and it's so you know even

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.470 
to the camera and it's so you know even
I<00:03:46.900> was<00:03:47.080> resting<00:03:47.470> on<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.710> bottom<00:03:47.860> here<00:03:48.280> it<00:03:49.060> it

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
I was resting on the bottom here it it

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.120 
I was resting on the bottom here it it
didn't<00:03:49.840> interrupt<00:03:50.110> any<00:03:50.470> of<00:03:50.530> the<00:03:50.590> photos<00:03:50.920> and

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
didn't interrupt any of the photos and

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.300 
didn't interrupt any of the photos and
it<00:03:51.250> it<00:03:51.430> was<00:03:51.670> fine<00:03:51.940> him<00:03:52.810> is<00:03:53.260> a<00:03:53.770> little<00:03:54.070> bit<00:03:54.160> big

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
it it was fine him is a little bit big

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.370 
it it was fine him is a little bit big
for<00:03:54.580> my<00:03:55.270> camera<00:03:55.660> and<00:03:55.810> even<00:03:56.020> though<00:03:56.080> this<00:03:56.170> is<00:03:56.350> a

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
for my camera and even though this is a

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.590 
for my camera and even though this is a
case<00:03:57.040> that<00:03:57.070> is<00:03:57.550> supposed<00:03:58.090> to<00:03:58.150> fit<00:03:58.330> my<00:03:58.450> car

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
case that is supposed to fit my car

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.470 
case that is supposed to fit my car
which<00:03:58.840> is<00:03:59.590> a<00:03:59.950> lot<00:04:00.280> of<00:04:00.430> a<00:04:00.490> nuisance<00:04:00.760> but<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:01.360> me

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
which is a lot of a nuisance but the me

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.690 
which is a lot of a nuisance but the me
in<00:04:01.540> fact<00:04:01.810> it<00:04:02.320> didn't<00:04:02.650> leak<00:04:02.800> that<00:04:03.100> it<00:04:03.190> seems<00:04:03.640> to

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
in fact it didn't leak that it seems to

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.430 
in fact it didn't leak that it seems to
have<00:04:03.760> taken<00:04:03.850> some<00:04:04.210> really<00:04:04.240> good<00:04:04.720> photos<00:04:05.200> so

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
have taken some really good photos so

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.440 
have taken some really good photos so
