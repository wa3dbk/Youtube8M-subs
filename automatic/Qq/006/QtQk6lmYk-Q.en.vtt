00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
don't know it really isn't the best one

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.969 
don't know it really isn't the best one
but<00:02:08.060> it's<00:02:08.330> it's<00:02:08.539> definitely<00:02:09.200> a<00:02:09.229> you<00:02:09.830> know<00:02:09.950> a

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
but it's it's definitely a you know a

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
timings everything with this but it

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.179 
timings everything with this but it
certainly<00:02:21.599> is<00:02:21.959> a<00:02:21.989> certainly<00:02:22.769> something<00:02:23.099> to

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
certainly is a certainly something to

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:25.429 
certainly is a certainly something to
