00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.970
 Hello everyone and today is another series 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.770
 our errands on the server where we will 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.439
 his all with money also before 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.660
 the beginning of the video, I would say that 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.670
 under my last video which 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.000
 released yesterday I already found 10 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.740
 dizlaik of course 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.900
 as it is still not very nice and 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.239
 I would like to ask you 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.190
 those who are well criticized in something 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.680
 criticize in the comments then for 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.960
 so I can fix 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.600
 consider errors and try to correct them 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.850
 in order to make as you can 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.440
 more interesting video I saw something in 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.610
 comments there a couple of people wrote 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.019
 just taking off the heading more with explosions but 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.180
 the thing is, I just can't find 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:59.420
 server where you can so blow up because 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.420
 they very rarely come across such servers 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.160
 where can you blow something exactly 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.580
 so I have so far releasing this kind 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.700
 neck 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.860

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.979
 home with this player he 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.840
 opened the door to the player's house one more and 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.430
 let's shower them with potions by the way i 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.649
 joined the clan that's why me now 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.960
 does not cause damage to artel square yet and we do not 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:25.479
 were able to fill up a diamond and okay but 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.479
 took the initial set start ovsky 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.580
 thanks to the person who suggested 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.190
 I respect the facts thanks to the man 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.660
 who prompted to join the clan more precisely 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.150
 recreate in order to be more convenient 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:40.350
 I shoot so stop peasant 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.170
 stand on the spot where 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.520
 and now i see some player who 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.740

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.509
 don't even know what is better for him but the club 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.940
 but let's still poke it like 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.659
 for sure because if we will 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:58.979
 giving weeks who have a big chance of being 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:01.320
 that player can be and now we 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:05.159

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.009
 now what can I do stop 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.069

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.050
 more or less 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.880
 so and now I stumbled upon two players 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.040
 which 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.590
