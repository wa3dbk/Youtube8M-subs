00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:12.190
 Yes everyone is today Ibaraki car eh- this time 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.480
 With the item of the newly added actuator 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.250
 this 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.050
 Bricks and blocks 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.500
 That's 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.500
 Like the old stone block switch on off 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:31.550
 I think that I want to do this brick now I can not pass now 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.260
 To open the cheetah 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:38.630
 Wire and year 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:42.060
 To be able to pass a little by having a switch on the floor 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:46.950
 I think that I want to Oh 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:48.090
 First we will explain the easy way 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.450
 First of all 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:56.330
 Yearly value 0 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:59.470
 I want you to connect the wire to the lock with the battery 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.470
 With this kind of feeling 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.170
 So when you finish connecting like this, this switch 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.360
 It is pressure 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.080
 Towards the pressure version 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.770
 We are connecting to do this 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.680
 Now this here 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.960
 Because the wire is passing 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.590
 To here 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:24.500
 The actuator is along this buyer's line 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.260
 I would like to connect 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:32.420
 Part to put this actuator is to 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.420
 As it is most blocks as it is 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.410
 9 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:42.090
 If you put it in this snow book or something, that snow block is 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.880
 Because it will be off 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.820
 Here and here 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:54.560
 I can see it properly but I feel like something 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:56.490
 I'd like you to be careful a bit in that area I think ly wants to do it 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.760
 Well I can not pass this 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.680
 In now 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.540
 Just like this 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.130
 For example since the wiring 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.740
 This tissue off met 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:13.210
 I will be able to pass this 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:15.600
 Switch once again with posh 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:22.920
 It is hard to go to the street 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:24.390
 If you use that kind of application to make that door Tobi or something like a hidden door 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.000
 What do 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:32.540
 It is like a like to understand your own 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.800
 There is something without a friend 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.160
 Own 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.490
 Would not it do particularly good or something important things 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.490
 I will 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.480
 Like this 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.480
 When you have it made 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:57.890
 It seems like the actuator can be used like this 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:03:01.350
 The Lord himself did not understand how to use well 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.720
 I've left it until recently 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:09.010
 Kanye also 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:13.769
 And came up with the fact that the use of the actuator and fire in combination together 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.769
 I could do something like this if I used it 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:22.040
 I think I'm glad if you can use it like this 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.209
 It is 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.209
 Thank you for your viewing
