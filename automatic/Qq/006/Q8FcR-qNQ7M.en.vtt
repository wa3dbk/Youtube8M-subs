so this is where they have the
electronic<00:00:21.320> smart<00:00:22.000> it's<00:00:23.000> gonna<00:00:23.119> be<00:00:23.270> hella<00:00:23.450> fun

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
electronic smart it's gonna be hella fun

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.440 
electronic smart it's gonna be hella fun
so

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:25.450 
so

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.910

station obviously there's a bunch of

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.910 
station obviously there's a bunch of
electronics<00:01:04.759> over<00:01:04.909> there<00:01:05.150> so<00:01:05.830> we're<00:01:06.830> gonna

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
electronics over there so we're gonna

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.070 
electronics over there so we're gonna
see<00:01:07.130> it<00:01:07.190> right<00:01:07.310> now<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:07.850> let<00:01:08.479> me<00:01:08.509> go<00:01:08.659> walk<00:01:08.899> all

see ya I hope folks is max from zero max
that's<00:01:12.950> why<00:01:13.130> I'm<00:01:13.190> here<00:01:13.520> at<00:01:14.149> the<00:01:14.420> Yongsan

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
that's why I'm here at the Yongsan

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:16.570 
that's why I'm here at the Yongsan
station<00:01:15.020> as<00:01:15.470> you<00:01:15.590> can<00:01:15.770> see<00:01:16.009> there's<00:01:16.250> a<00:01:16.310> bunch

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
station as you can see there's a bunch

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.609 
station as you can see there's a bunch
of<00:01:16.910> stuff<00:01:18.130> anyway<00:01:19.160> ready<00:01:19.970> go<00:01:20.350> we're<00:01:21.350> gonna<00:01:21.440> go

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
of stuff anyway ready go we're gonna go

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.359 
of stuff anyway ready go we're gonna go
find<00:01:21.979> a<00:01:22.990> access<00:01:23.990> point<00:01:24.229> does<00:01:24.740> dental<00:01:24.979> sell<00:01:25.190> it

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
find a access point does dental sell it

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.040 
find a access point does dental sell it
anywhere<00:01:25.759> else<00:01:25.940> and<00:01:26.119> this<00:01:26.600> place<00:01:26.840> has<00:01:27.020> the

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
anywhere else and this place has the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.160 
anywhere else and this place has the
best<00:01:27.380> prices<00:01:27.619> so<00:01:28.630> I'll<00:01:29.630> show<00:01:29.810> you<00:01:29.840> see<00:01:30.110> ya

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
best prices so I'll show you see ya

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:44.569 
best prices so I'll show you see ya
later

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.139 

the<00:01:45.090> Yongsan<00:01:45.539> station<00:01:45.719> is<00:01:46.229> connected<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.740> this

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
the Yongsan station is connected to this

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.940 
the Yongsan station is connected to this
electronic<00:01:48.149> smart<00:01:48.539> which<00:01:49.229> has<00:01:49.439> about<00:01:49.590> five

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
electronic smart which has about five

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.310 
electronic smart which has about five
levels<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.969> you<00:01:51.270> can<00:01:51.299> go<00:01:51.539> outside<00:01:51.689> if<00:01:52.109> you<00:01:52.229> go

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
levels and you can go outside if you go

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.109 
levels and you can go outside if you go
to<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.590> first<00:01:52.799> level<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.759> that's<00:01:53.939> what<00:01:54.060> I'm

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
to the first level and that's what I'm

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.410 
to the first level and that's what I'm
doing<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:55.399> this<00:01:56.399> place<00:01:56.670> has<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.880> lot<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.179> cool

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
doing so this place has a lot of cool

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.569 
doing so this place has a lot of cool
stuff<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.810> got<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:57.990> haggle<00:01:58.380> though<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:58.920> you

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
stuff you got a haggle though so you

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.760 
stuff you got a haggle though so you
never<00:01:59.729> want<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.030> get<00:02:00.149> Sun<00:02:00.539> for<00:02:00.780> full<00:02:00.960> price<00:02:01.170> so

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
never want to get Sun for full price so

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.789 
never want to get Sun for full price so
I'll<00:02:02.369> focus<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:03.000> maximum<00:02:03.329> zero<00:02:03.569> max<00:02:03.780> calm<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.770> I

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
I'll focus of maximum zero max calm so I

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.730 
I'll focus of maximum zero max calm so I
just<00:02:05.009> came<00:02:05.219> out<00:02:05.429> they<00:02:05.939> got<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.439> once<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.530> come

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
just came out they got a once you come

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.070 
just came out they got a once you come
out<00:02:07.890> there's<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.789> bunch<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.119> place<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.899> place

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
out there's a bunch of place that place

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.190 
out there's a bunch of place that place
has<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.679> bunch<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.250> IC<00:02:11.760> chips<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.209> can<00:02:12.390> get<00:02:12.540> like

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
has a bunch of IC chips you can get like

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.580 
has a bunch of IC chips you can get like
circuits<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:13.830> stuff<00:02:14.540> then<00:02:15.540> there's<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.290> bunch

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
circuits and stuff then there's a bunch

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.240 
circuits and stuff then there's a bunch
other<00:02:16.860> stuff<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:18.500> also<00:02:19.500> that's<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.980> big

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
other stuff and also that's a big

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.970 
other stuff and also that's a big
another<00:02:21.180> big<00:02:21.510> just<00:02:22.079> dedicated<00:02:22.680> to

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
another big just dedicated to

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.390 
another big just dedicated to
electronics<00:02:24.019> this<00:02:25.019> whole<00:02:25.260> town<00:02:25.769> is<00:02:25.799> pretty

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
electronics this whole town is pretty

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.750 
electronics this whole town is pretty
big<00:02:26.579> there's<00:02:26.819> even<00:02:27.060> more<00:02:27.090> buildings<00:02:27.769> I<00:02:28.769> just

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
big there's even more buildings I just

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.190 
big there's even more buildings I just
want<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:29.970> show<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.269> so<00:02:30.660> it's<00:02:31.049> y'all

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
want to show you that so it's y'all
