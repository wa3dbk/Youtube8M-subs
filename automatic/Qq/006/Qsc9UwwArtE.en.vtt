both pieces to attach them so we've kind
of<00:00:29.279> got<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.730> nice<00:00:30.240> little<00:00:30.390> two-piece<00:00:30.779> race<00:00:31.050> suit

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
of got a nice little two-piece race suit

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.350 
of got a nice little two-piece race suit
going<00:00:31.500> here<00:00:31.740> let's<00:00:32.400> first<00:00:32.669> talk<00:00:32.910> about<00:00:32.970> the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
going here let's first talk about the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.620 
going here let's first talk about the
concept<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.190> having<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.400> two-piece<00:00:35.790> versus<00:00:36.480> a

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
concept of having a two-piece versus a

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.440 
concept of having a two-piece versus a
one-piece<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.380> my<00:00:38.220> opinion<00:00:38.730> if<00:00:38.940> you're<00:00:39.300> going

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
one-piece in my opinion if you're going

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.600 
one-piece in my opinion if you're going
to<00:00:39.630> do<00:00:39.780> at<00:00:40.020> least<00:00:40.380> 50%<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.280> your<00:00:41.399> riding

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
to do at least 50% of your riding

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.170 
to do at least 50% of your riding
without<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.600> pants<00:00:43.100> then<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.610> makes<00:00:44.910> sense

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
without the pants then it it makes sense

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.450 
without the pants then it it makes sense
ok<00:00:45.750> if<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.960> believe<00:00:46.260> you're<00:00:46.440> gonna<00:00:46.500> do<00:00:46.739> more

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
ok if you believe you're gonna do more

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.000 
ok if you believe you're gonna do more
than<00:00:47.700> 50%<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.360> your<00:00:48.480> riding<00:00:48.750> with<00:00:49.469> both<00:00:49.680> pieces

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
than 50% of your riding with both pieces

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.130 
than 50% of your riding with both pieces
attached<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.820> think<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.270> one-piece<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.930> better

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
attached I think a one-piece is a better

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.900 
attached I think a one-piece is a better
option<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.800> reason<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.160> say<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.760> I

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
option and the reason I say that is I

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.200 
option and the reason I say that is I
feel<00:00:54.600> it's<00:00:54.780> more<00:00:54.960> comfortable<00:00:55.610> the<00:00:56.610> reason<00:00:57.000> in

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
feel it's more comfortable the reason in

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.880 
feel it's more comfortable the reason in
my<00:00:57.420> mind<00:00:57.450> that<00:00:57.870> it's<00:00:58.020> more<00:00:58.200> comfortable<00:00:58.680> as

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
my mind that it's more comfortable as

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.740 
my mind that it's more comfortable as
you<00:00:59.039> lose<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.579> attachment<00:01:00.149> point<00:01:00.300> remember

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
you lose the attachment point remember

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.500 
you lose the attachment point remember
where<00:01:01.230> these<00:01:01.379> attach<00:01:01.770> we<00:01:02.219> have<00:01:02.460> an<00:01:02.670> overlap<00:01:03.210> of

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
where these attach we have an overlap of

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.020 
where these attach we have an overlap of
a<00:01:03.960> solid<00:01:04.619> Jesus<00:01:05.100> pry<00:01:05.339> it's<00:01:05.520> probably<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> good

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
a solid Jesus pry it's probably a good

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.730 
a solid Jesus pry it's probably a good
four<00:01:06.300> inches<00:01:06.660> so<00:01:06.869> you've<00:01:07.050> doubled<00:01:07.590> up<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
four inches so you've doubled up the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.380 
four inches so you've doubled up the
thickness<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.460> leather<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:09.000> zippers

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
thickness of the leather the zippers

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.199 
thickness of the leather the zippers
everything<00:01:09.539> in<00:01:09.929> that<00:01:10.050> area<00:01:10.670> it<00:01:11.670> decreases<00:01:12.179> the

00:01:12.199 --> 00:01:12.209 
everything in that area it decreases the

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:14.719 
everything in that area it decreases the
comfort<00:01:12.630> just<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.869> little<00:01:13.200> bit<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.640> when<00:01:14.640> you

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
comfort just a little bit and when you

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.279 
comfort just a little bit and when you
think<00:01:14.940> about<00:01:15.030> protection<00:01:15.840> too<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.110> don't

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:16.289 
think about protection too you don't

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:17.930 
think about protection too you don't
have<00:01:16.410> this<00:01:16.679> really<00:01:16.920> big<00:01:17.130> seam<00:01:17.399> so<00:01:17.700> if<00:01:17.850> you're

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
have this really big seam so if you're

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.480 
have this really big seam so if you're
gonna<00:01:18.060> go<00:01:18.209> north<00:01:18.569> of<00:01:18.869> 50%<00:01:19.319> riding<00:01:19.950> with<00:01:20.099> both

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
gonna go north of 50% riding with both

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.520 
gonna go north of 50% riding with both
pieces<00:01:20.849> on<00:01:21.179> let's<00:01:21.630> consider<00:01:21.929> a<00:01:22.050> one-piece

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
pieces on let's consider a one-piece

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.150 
pieces on let's consider a one-piece
okay<00:01:23.240> if<00:01:24.240> you're<00:01:24.479> going<00:01:24.569> to<00:01:24.660> do<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.709> majority

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
okay if you're going to do the majority

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.880 
okay if you're going to do the majority
of<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.310> riding<00:01:26.670> -<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.780> pants<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.679> is<00:01:28.800> a

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
of the riding - the pants this is a

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.290 
of the riding - the pants this is a
great<00:01:29.160> option<00:01:29.580> for<00:01:29.610> somebody<00:01:29.849> doing<00:01:30.119> some

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
great option for somebody doing some

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.999 
great option for somebody doing some
hardcore<00:01:30.569> Canyon<00:01:31.140> riding<00:01:31.470> once<00:01:31.649> in<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.830> while

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
hardcore Canyon riding once in a while

hardcore Canyon riding once in a while
hand<00:01:32.250> or<00:01:32.399> subtract<00:01:32.819> days<00:01:33.090> now<00:01:33.750> let's<00:01:33.929> see<00:01:34.050> if

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
hand or subtract days now let's see if

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.469 
hand or subtract days now let's see if
we<00:01:34.170> can't<00:01:34.440> get<00:01:34.590> back<00:01:34.740> on<00:01:34.979> focus<00:01:35.459> here<00:01:35.670> give<00:01:36.360> you

we can't get back on focus here give you
a<00:01:36.509> 360<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:39.649> would<00:01:40.649> say<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.890> most<00:01:40.979> difficult

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
a 360 I would say the most difficult

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.900 
a 360 I would say the most difficult
thing<00:01:42.110> to<00:01:43.110> do<00:01:43.319> is<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.890> size<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.490> pants

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
thing to do is to size the pants

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.730 
thing to do is to size the pants
correctly<00:01:45.390> we<00:01:45.539> certainly<00:01:46.200> see<00:01:46.440> a<00:01:46.470> lot<00:01:46.560> of

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
correctly we certainly see a lot of

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.040 
correctly we certainly see a lot of
exchanging<00:01:47.459> going<00:01:47.759> on<00:01:47.940> with<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.869> leather

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
exchanging going on with the leather
