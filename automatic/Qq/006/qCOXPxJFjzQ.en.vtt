00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
changes and this is a very to work with

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.710 
changes and this is a very to work with
because<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:20.039> has<00:00:20.220> six<00:00:20.970> different<00:00:21.300> yarns<00:00:21.570> in

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
because it has six different yarns in

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.140 
because it has six different yarns in
one<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:22.260> can<00:00:22.410> see<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:22.619> there's<00:00:22.980> some<00:00:23.400> little

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
one you can see that there's some little

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.880 
one you can see that there's some little
fuzzy<00:00:24.539> ones<00:00:24.750> here<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.230> then<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.439> goes<00:00:25.619> down<00:00:25.650> to

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
fuzzy ones here and then it goes down to

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.519 
fuzzy ones here and then it goes down to
a<00:00:26.070> nice<00:00:26.310> little<00:00:26.640> string<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.840> get<00:00:28.349> some

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
a nice little string so you get some

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.320 
a nice little string so you get some
variations<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.580> different<00:00:29.910> textures

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
variations and different textures

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.440 
variations and different textures
throughout<00:00:30.869> your<00:00:30.990> whole<00:00:31.230> project<00:00:32.120> this<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.329> a

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
throughout your whole project this is a

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.650 
throughout your whole project this is a
worsted<00:00:33.840> weight<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.820> this<00:00:35.820> has<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.090> hundred

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
worsted weight and this has a hundred

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.090 
worsted weight and this has a hundred
and<00:00:36.719> eighty-seven<00:00:37.350> yarns<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.430> one<00:00:38.730> skein<00:00:40.100> it

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
and eighty-seven yarns in one skein it

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.790 
and eighty-seven yarns in one skein it
might<00:00:41.340> be<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> little<00:00:41.850> bit<00:00:42.000> difficult<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.989> work

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
might be a little bit difficult to work

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.830 
might be a little bit difficult to work
with<00:00:43.860> because<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.850> does<00:00:45.090> change<00:00:45.450> back<00:00:45.809> and

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
with because it does change back and

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.160 
with because it does change back and
forth<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:46.770> much<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.370> it's<00:00:48.239> probably<00:00:48.870> better

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
forth so much so it's probably better

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.590 
forth so much so it's probably better
for<00:00:49.260> accessories<00:00:50.219> or<00:00:50.430> little<00:00:51.149> pieces<00:00:51.390> that

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
for accessories or little pieces that

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.490 
for accessories or little pieces that
you<00:00:51.899> want<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.199> add<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.320> little<00:00:52.649> flair<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:54.500> I've

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
you want to add a little flair to I've

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.790 
you want to add a little flair to I've
made<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> scarf<00:00:56.820> scarfs<00:00:57.719> with<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.500> it's

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
made a scarf scarfs with this and it's

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.770 
made a scarf scarfs with this and it's
really<00:00:59.129> fun<00:00:59.340> because<00:00:59.550> it's<00:00:59.879> just<00:01:00.120> constantly

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
really fun because it's just constantly

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.709 
really fun because it's just constantly
weaving<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.620> out<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:02.070> these<00:01:02.850> textures<00:01:03.449> and

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
weaving in and out of these textures and

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.960 
weaving in and out of these textures and
certain<00:01:04.260> areas<00:01:04.500> pop<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> little<00:01:05.400> bit<00:01:05.549> more<00:01:05.610> than

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
certain areas pop a little bit more than

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.539 
certain areas pop a little bit more than
others<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.299> just<00:01:06.869> makes<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.170> very<00:01:07.380> fun<00:01:07.710> maybe

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
others and just makes it very fun maybe

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.789 
others and just makes it very fun maybe
for<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.850> beginner<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.479> might<00:01:09.750> not<00:01:09.930> be<00:01:10.140> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
for a beginner this might not be the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.620 
for a beginner this might not be the
best<00:01:10.950> yarn<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.520> work<00:01:11.729> with<00:01:11.939> because<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.450> does

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
best yarn to work with because it does

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.420 
best yarn to work with because it does
change<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.290> there's<00:01:13.500> they're<00:01:13.979> slippery

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
change and there's they're slippery

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.899 
change and there's they're slippery
areas<00:01:14.880> then<00:01:15.119> there's<00:01:15.299> sticky<00:01:15.689> areas<00:01:16.250> but<00:01:17.250> you

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
areas then there's sticky areas but you

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.080 
areas then there's sticky areas but you
know<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.090> can<00:01:18.299> again<00:01:19.020> like<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.500> say<00:01:19.850> pair<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.000> up

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
know you can again like I say pair it up

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.170 
know you can again like I say pair it up
with<00:01:21.420> one<00:01:22.200> solid<00:01:22.530> yarn<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.640> help<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:24.000> have

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
that consistency throughout and then

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.330 
that consistency throughout and then
you'll<00:01:26.250> just<00:01:26.460> have<00:01:26.520> light<00:01:27.150> texture<00:01:27.630> changes

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
you'll just have light texture changes

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.130 
you'll just have light texture changes

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.200 
to try to use up all the pieces you know
maybe<00:01:40.710> even<00:01:40.829> Gidget<00:01:41.310> gets<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.579> piece<00:01:41.790> every<00:01:42.060> now

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210
