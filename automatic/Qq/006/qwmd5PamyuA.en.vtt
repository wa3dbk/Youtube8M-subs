00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.570
 waves and juliet from my channel catches 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.220
 between letters I bring you the gra pack 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.050
 of the month of November the first book that 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.000
 I read this month was the invention of morel 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.290
 by adolfo bioy casares 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.240
 I had to read this book for the 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.760
 school and it belongs to the genre of 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.170
 fantastic realism is the same genre 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.060
 of I share also cut salt and 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.890
 many other well-known authors 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.449
 I have to say that inside everything was 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.430
 a pretty bearable book and it's because 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.350
 does not have many games what is the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.000
 timeline and space that is what 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.010
 what else do we check when reading this type 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.960
 of gender then it was very easy to read 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.489
 and very bearable although obviously clear 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.670
 it's not the genres that I like the most and 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.219
 that's why we tell him 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.620
 the book I read was the house by franz 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.719
 peretti and ted decker this book is a 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.190
 psychological thriller that my radio does not 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.809
 It has a lot of what we say because 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.550
 when he was not caught me reading for 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.320
 nothing did not leave me that suspense that should 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.449
 stop this kind of book I think 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.489
 a very clichÃ© story in which these 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.470
 protagonists will be breaks the car and 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.759
 after walking they find a house and 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.200
 it is totally abandoned that 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.119
 find another couple that happened to him 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.590
 same as them and I thought it was a 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.060
 history very used in what are the 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.619
 horror stories and all that style 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.509
 so I did not get much attention 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.800
 apart from when it was happening all 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.539
 things as you could say 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.550
 amazing from the book I do not 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:24.679
 they surprised me apart I read it very slow 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.090
 because I had many tests in between and 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:28.280
 It did not leave me wanting to continue 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.929
 reading so I gave him two out of five 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.030
 stars because I did not like it at all 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:34.130
 the next book he reads this month was 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.539
 for the video for all its sum this book 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.220
 I had to read with the reading circle 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:38.319
 the literary musketeers and I have to 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.190
 say that I had already read it 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:42.049
 previously in pdf and I had 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.880
 delighted this second time I read it 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.159
 liked it even more is a very story 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.020
 original and that deals with a very taboo subject 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.240
 which is the love between two brothers between 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.649
 encourages them already and that in fact the author 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.680
 play with your thoughts because we're going 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.300
 inside your head 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.130
 you know that that's wrong and that it does not have 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.070
 to go but the plot will taking 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.510
 here that you want that to happen and it's 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.460
 that's why it makes it so compelling and so 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.530
 bearable this book I read it very fast 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.390
 I loved it very much have many phrases 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.369
 that I loved them so that's why the 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.649
 five- star building the next 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.680
 book that this month was skyforce os 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.600
 stirling this book belongs to the saga 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.310
 end of English I have to say that it is a 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.050
 very bearable book that catches you from 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.850
 the first chapter tells the story of 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.230
 sky that is a girl we do not know 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.730
 much what happened to him in his 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.860
 childhood and we discover it with the 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.720
 corner of the book this girl moves out of 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.800
 england is color until red in 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.959
 USA 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.000
 he knows to be that he is a boy who 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.620
 opens the doors to a paranormal world and 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.600
 that's basically what all of the 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.370
 book is a very catchy plot very 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.170
 I read it in two days and I 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.360
 loved it very much but had read 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.890
 several things I love is going normal and this 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.570
 is not the best of those and efforts that 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.670
 I gave four to five stars the 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.530
 next book that I read was while the 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.330
 princesses sleep delight of which 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.100
 this book is a little in the beauty 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.840
 sleeper 'which means that I tell 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.930
 history parallel or different from what 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.319
 that we already know about the sleeping beauty 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.510
 and a very good story tells the story 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.459
 from ellis who is a girl who lives in the 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.930
 field and that one day tired of what it was 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.790
 his life decides to escape to the 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.829
 castle and that's where this begins 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.659
 story after spending a few years 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.370
 becomes queen's maid and is 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:16.400
 where it gets closer to everything that 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.620
 is the part of the kingdom's management is born 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.870
 rose that is the princess and she is made 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.519
 very close to this baby and starts to 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.409
 tell the story that many do not 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.420
 we knew about the sleeping beauty ' 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:28.849
 with a very crude history with a lot 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.799
 emotion with a lot of adventure I loved it 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.720
 because it is very original I could never 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.099
 to have imagined that a person could 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.480
 He has put to think of a story 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.310
 parallel of the sleeping beauty and the 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.049
 I really loved him very much 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.180
 different five pieces because I could not 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.889
 let it go every time I had more emotion 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.750
 surprises and I really recommend it to 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:47.000
 all the last book that this month was 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.090
 the little prince by antonio de saint 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.739
 exupÃ©ry this author is a wonder not 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.090
 have read this book is really what 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.219
 I had read but when I was little and 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.780
 I remembered nothing this means it's 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:59.299
 something very easy to read I was 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.459
 needing something faster more 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.350
 quiet and this this book I could 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.360
 give is wonderful as in a 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.250
 few words can you give a metaphor 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.950
 what is life like adults 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.250
 they treat the less important subjects according to 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.750
 them but that for a boy is very 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.580
 important in your life that is to admire the 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.050
 smaller things this book treats you 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.580
 to show about that is a great 

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:22.000
 metaphor of life and I loved it 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.980
 very much for that I gave 5 to 5 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.510
 so well this soon the books that 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.400
