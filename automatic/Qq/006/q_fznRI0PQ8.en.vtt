00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.260
 hello to all guys and well back on 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.880
 android mod 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.610
 today I will show you a rom that I discovered 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.619
 by chance turning on xda is available 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.880
 for different devices and I consider it 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.099
 really good 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.770
 his name is actually called 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.040
 nameless or without a name in any case 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.410
 nameless rom and is based on android 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.239
 4.4.4 kat kit 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.040
 let's start with the settings in addition to 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.500
 the classic ones of the pure Android are 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.269
 present several additional options to the 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.250
 nameless section we find the entries of 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:47.530
 vice control nameless center e 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.179
 crazy lab the first postpones 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.800
 an excellent application that allows us 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:52.660
 to fully check the 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.760
 our smartphone displaying the 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.510
 information by choosing the intensity 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.609
 of the vibration and the power of the LCD 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.469
 monitoring it and setting cpu and gpu in 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:04.180
 the more it makes available to us that tasker is 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:05.650
 a very useful tool since 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.900
 we can set up actions 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.659
 automatic for example at shutdown 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.479
 of the screen we can set the 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:16.260
 minimum GPU frequency and a 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.260
 given value 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.700
 flash air allows flash 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.710
 for recovery files and more we can 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.049
 scan the media files present 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.409
 on the phone edit the bild file 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.750
 prof 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.900
 and more on settings we can 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.479
 customize the nameless center app 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.920
 also this very graphically taken care of 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.630
 refers to the team blog and puts us 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.060
 also available the item 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.009
 updates to check are 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.530
 present newer versions of that 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.850
 installed and settings that also in 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.840
 this case allows us to 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.840
 customize the app 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.020
 to conclude the laboratory section 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.150
 matto allows you to enable sending 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.790
 reports in the event of a crash and 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.430
 force the many boxes by enabling that 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.500
 voice and restarting the settings as 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.690
 see the latter will be split up 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.000
 two panels, obviously, the left one 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.950
 is extremely complex and if 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.660
 you will want to use this function of 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.790
 I recommend resizing the dpi 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.739
 lowering the density 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.930
 now we put back the normal graphics e 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.120
 let's move on to the customization section 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.590
 here we find the home page entry that 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.719
 lets you switch between launchers 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.090
 to the other heads up that allows 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:25.260
 enable pop-up notifications introduced 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.870
 from google android 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.879
 the themes or the team chooser created 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.920
 from the cyanogenmod team through which 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.379
 we can customize individual parts 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.180
 of the rom as a style of background and character 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.579
 boot animation by special means 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.319
 packages that are to be downloaded separately 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.269
 for example, we insert a theme with lo 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.209
 android style we pass to see 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.859
 the next entry ie interface here 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.720
 the settings for the are present 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:50.730
 status bar and the notification menu 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.349
 quick settings panel that there 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.480
 allows you to customize the menu a 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.430
 secondary curtain and control 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.139
 animation through which we can 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.879
 choose and set all 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:01.709
 system animations 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.709
 in addition there are desktop options 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.599
 extended recent bar and ram bar that 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.549
 enable the button to close all 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.109
 the apps and the ram bar 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.450
 in the applications screen 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.370
 recent and finally an entry to include 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.930
 in the ram count also the apps 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.359
 cached 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.310
 finally on the unlock screen we can 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.319
 customize the cash lock screen 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.229
 useful settings like adding 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.879
 shortcuts the battery status 

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:30.090
 visible and around the ring 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:31.889
 and hidden custom widgets if 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.930
 so you can tell between the settings 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.639
 classic android we find then others 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.799
 options like those for the bar 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:40.260
 navigation for battery warning 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.510
 download for users etc. 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.069
 ok let's go back to the home and for how long 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.290
 concerns the default launcher are 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.209
 present the google gel and the custom 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.069
 free launcher that is none other than the 3 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.199
 classic cyanogenmod con with 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.180
 adding some settings like 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:56.340
 the global ones for the orientation of the 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.840
 screen and gestures such as the 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.580
 double touch 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.280
 let's see then the applications of 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.650
 system are present apollo or the 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.450
 cyanogenmod music player like it already 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.180
 said the gel that is the google experience 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.120
 launcher device control which is the app that 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.590
 we have seen before in the settings 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.530
 documents or a file manager for i 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.810
 dsp manager multimedia files that an app 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.570
 to control the sound both in headphones 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.580
 that neither the speaker nameless messages 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.729
 center that also in this case we have 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.110
 seen in the system settings 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:30.930
 google news and weather a 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.820
 screencast voice recorder or a 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.250
 app to record the screen is a 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.380
 torch therefore well supplied under this 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.389
 profile well let's move on to the 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.430
 camera than the classic one 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:43.680
 of the pure Android without details 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.389
 customizations but with the addition of the 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.130
 ability to save photos in a 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:50.630
 possible external sd 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.630
 let's try to take some shots 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.240
 we do not even without the flash 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.590
 and how you see the speed of setting up 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.580
 fire 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.580
 shooting and good 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.060
 let's look at the results 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.729
 obtained and are all sharp and well 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.500
 therefore defined excellent camera 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.759
 the same applies to the video part that 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.940
 he never gave me any problems 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:20.160
 ok final considerations i kept 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.350
 this rom only six days but if 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.720
 I could still keep it with pleasure 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:27.120
 how really pleased me how 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.340
 energy management on the galaxy s ii is in 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.650
 line with most asps 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.270
 so with about three hours of screen and a 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.970
 medium intense use can be achieved at 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.190
 reach 10 12 hours of use that 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.530
 as a result despite not being among the 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.270
 best is not bad in more stability e 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.949
 fluidity is excellent 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.289
 during these days there was only one 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:48.300
 spontaneous reboot and in return I don't have 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.070
 never noticed slowdowns or crashes 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.810
 also the settings for the 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.639
 customization and functions 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.889
 additional are really many and all 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:57.270
 very cared for despite it is 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:59.400
 still a nightly or a version 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.680
 not quite stable it already behaves 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.050
 more than good and in my opinion deserves of 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.550
 be proven perfect nothing else from 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.110
 add if not that the link to 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.000
