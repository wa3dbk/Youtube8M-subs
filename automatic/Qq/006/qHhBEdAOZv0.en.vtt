briefly<00:01:41.200> I<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:42.610> would<00:01:42.729> suggest<00:01:42.880> to<00:01:43.240> her<00:01:43.420> that

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690

briefly I it would suggest to her that
she<00:01:43.959> do<00:01:45.119> work<00:01:46.119> several<00:01:46.360> muscle<00:01:46.780> groups<00:01:47.049> twice

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
she do work several muscle groups twice

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.190 
she do work several muscle groups twice
a<00:01:47.500> week<00:01:47.740> and<00:01:48.000> like<00:01:49.000> to<00:01:49.479> work<00:01:49.509> legs<00:01:49.869> twice<00:01:50.170> a

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
a week and like to work legs twice a

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.919 
a week and like to work legs twice a
week<00:01:50.530> so<00:01:51.009> on<00:01:51.100> and<00:01:51.220> so<00:01:51.310> forth<00:01:51.549> and<00:01:51.940> then<00:01:52.149> in<00:01:52.450> to

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
week so on and so forth and then in to

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:55.139 
week so on and so forth and then in to
increase<00:01:53.830> the<00:01:53.950> intensity<00:01:54.069> of<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:54.759> workouts

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
increase the intensity of the workouts

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.279 
increase the intensity of the workouts
so<00:01:55.830> you<00:01:56.830> hit<00:01:57.130> it<00:01:57.220> harder<00:01:57.549> and<00:01:57.610> faster

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
so you hit it harder and faster

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.779 
so you hit it harder and faster
incorporating<00:01:59.289> super<00:01:59.649> sets<00:01:59.890> so<00:02:00.399> you<00:02:00.429> can<00:02:00.610> get

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
incorporating super sets so you can get

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:02.789 
incorporating super sets so you can get
through

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
through

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.380 
through
look<00:02:03.250> out<00:02:03.399> faster<00:02:04.140> um<00:02:05.399> working<00:02:06.399> a<00:02:06.880> muscle

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
look out faster um working a muscle

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.759 
look out faster um working a muscle
group<00:02:07.750> twice<00:02:08.739> a<00:02:08.800> week<00:02:10.019> completely<00:02:11.019> depends<00:02:11.680> on

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
group twice a week completely depends on

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.250 
group twice a week completely depends on
your<00:02:11.890> recovery<00:02:12.459> so<00:02:13.180> there's<00:02:13.480> a<00:02:13.540> balance<00:02:13.750> point

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
your recovery so there's a balance point

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
your recovery so there's a balance point
there<00:02:14.470> in<00:02:15.370> my<00:02:15.610> opinion<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.980> balance

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
there in my opinion and the balance

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.940 
there in my opinion and the balance
point<00:02:18.580> is<00:02:18.819> if<00:02:19.120> you're<00:02:19.900> able<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.319> work<00:02:20.620> legs

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
point is if you're able to work legs

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:21.839 
point is if you're able to work legs
twice<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.340> week

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
twice a week

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.839 
twice a week
are<00:02:22.060> you<00:02:22.390> working<00:02:22.599> legs<00:02:23.370> hard<00:02:24.370> enough<00:02:24.610> the

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
are you working legs hard enough the

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.350 
are you working legs hard enough the
first<00:02:25.090> time<00:02:25.739> if<00:02:26.739> it<00:02:27.040> it<00:02:27.370> should<00:02:27.640> take<00:02:27.910> you<00:02:28.120> if

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
first time if it it should take you if

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.610 
first time if it it should take you if
you're<00:02:28.569> really<00:02:28.810> wanting<00:02:28.930> to<00:02:29.140> improve<00:02:29.470> your

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
you're really wanting to improve your

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.350 
you're really wanting to improve your
legs<00:02:29.830> it<00:02:30.069> should<00:02:30.310> take<00:02:30.610> you<00:02:30.790> a<00:02:30.819> good<00:02:31.060> four<00:02:31.330> or

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
legs it should take you a good four or

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.570 
legs it should take you a good four or
five<00:02:31.540> days<00:02:31.780> to<00:02:31.810> recover<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.769> then<00:02:33.250> on<00:02:33.430> that

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
five days to recover and then on that

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.759 
five days to recover and then on that
sixth<00:02:34.030> day<00:02:34.349> technically<00:02:35.349> yeah<00:02:35.560> you're

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
sixth day technically yeah you're

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.069 
sixth day technically yeah you're
working<00:02:35.980> your<00:02:36.250> legs<00:02:36.430> again<00:02:37.180> in<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.540> same<00:02:37.750> week

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
working your legs again in the same week

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.589 
working your legs again in the same week
but<00:02:38.890> it's<00:02:39.040> gonna<00:02:39.250> stagger<00:02:39.790> throughout<00:02:40.450> the

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
but it's gonna stagger throughout the

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.240 
but it's gonna stagger throughout the
week<00:02:40.780> so<00:02:40.810> you<00:02:40.989> can't<00:02:41.349> stay<00:02:41.560> out<00:02:41.590> every<00:02:41.980> Monday

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
week so you can't stay out every Monday

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.110 
week so you can't stay out every Monday
and<00:02:42.640> Thursday<00:02:43.510> I'm<00:02:44.049> gonna<00:02:44.260> run<00:02:44.440> legs<00:02:45.120> because

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
and Thursday I'm gonna run legs because

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.699 
and Thursday I'm gonna run legs because
it<00:02:46.239> totally<00:02:46.450> depends<00:02:46.690> on<00:02:46.840> how<00:02:47.019> well<00:02:47.650> you

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
it totally depends on how well you

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.920 
it totally depends on how well you
recover<00:02:48.069> you<00:02:48.730> don't<00:02:48.970> want<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.239> hit<00:02:49.420> a<00:02:49.450> muscle

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
recover you don't want to hit a muscle

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.520 
recover you don't want to hit a muscle
group<00:02:50.170> again<00:02:51.030> unless<00:02:52.030> than<00:02:52.269> until<00:02:52.720> it's<00:02:53.230> fully

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
group again unless than until it's fully

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.520 
group again unless than until it's fully
recovered<00:02:54.130> so<00:02:54.849> there<00:02:55.690> would<00:02:55.810> be<00:02:55.840> my<00:02:56.200> advice

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
recovered so there would be my advice

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.620 
recovered so there would be my advice
there<00:02:56.860> and<00:02:57.069> there's<00:02:57.250> some<00:02:57.549> some<00:02:58.329> muscle

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
there and there's some some muscle

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.440 
there and there's some some muscle
groups<00:02:58.870> that<00:02:59.230> naturally<00:02:59.829> it<00:03:00.459> I<00:03:00.790> think<00:03:01.060> recover

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
groups that naturally it I think recover

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.440 
groups that naturally it I think recover
faster<00:03:01.959> well<00:03:02.290> some<00:03:02.920> because<00:03:03.160> of<00:03:03.280> muscle<00:03:03.640> fiber

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
faster well some because of muscle fiber

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.059 
faster well some because of muscle fiber
types<00:03:04.810> like<00:03:05.260> your<00:03:05.410> abs<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:05.739> your<00:03:05.860> calves

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
types like your abs and your calves

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:07.440 
types like your abs and your calves
they're<00:03:06.459> going<00:03:06.610> to<00:03:06.670> recover<00:03:06.880> very<00:03:07.120> quickly

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
they're going to recover very quickly

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.680 
they're going to recover very quickly
and<00:03:08.280> shoulders<00:03:09.280> can<00:03:09.459> usually<00:03:09.850> recover<00:03:10.359> pretty

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
and shoulders can usually recover pretty

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.750 
and shoulders can usually recover pretty
quickly<00:03:10.810> too<00:03:11.319> so<00:03:11.709> I'll<00:03:12.190> have<00:03:12.430> girls

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
quickly too so I'll have girls

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.400 
quickly too so I'll have girls
especially<00:03:13.090> sit<00:03:13.450> shoulders<00:03:13.810> are<00:03:13.930> such<00:03:14.019> a<00:03:14.109> big

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
especially sit shoulders are such a big

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.580 
especially sit shoulders are such a big
issue<00:03:14.620> for<00:03:14.829> finger<00:03:15.430> gals

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
issue for finger gals

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.050 
issue for finger gals
I'll<00:03:17.590> have<00:03:17.739> it<00:03:17.889> girls<00:03:18.160> work<00:03:18.400> shoulders<00:03:18.819> twice

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
I'll have it girls work shoulders twice

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.530 
I'll have it girls work shoulders twice
a<00:03:19.090> week<00:03:19.359> but<00:03:20.350> that's<00:03:20.560> not<00:03:20.920> you<00:03:21.639> know<00:03:21.760> a<00:03:22.000> free

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
twice you can work them lighter no I

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.559 
twice you can work them lighter no I
want<00:03:26.769> it<00:03:26.859> hard<00:03:27.310> it<00:03:27.609> you<00:03:27.819> know<00:03:27.910> I<00:03:27.940> want<00:03:28.329> you<00:03:28.389> two

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
to really push yourself on the gym

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.129 
to really push yourself on the gym
enough<00:03:30.760> another<00:03:31.030> thing<00:03:31.540> talking<00:03:31.810> about<00:03:31.930> here

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
enough another thing talking about here

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.979 
enough another thing talking about here
super<00:03:33.099> sets<00:03:33.370> I<00:03:33.609> would<00:03:34.030> encourage<00:03:34.480> you<00:03:34.660> to<00:03:34.720> use

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
super sets I would encourage you to use

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.830 
super sets I would encourage you to use
super<00:03:35.410> sets<00:03:35.650> occasionally<00:03:36.400> like<00:03:36.940> every<00:03:37.329> third

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
super sets occasionally like every third

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.339 
super sets occasionally like every third
or<00:03:37.870> fourth<00:03:38.170> week<00:03:38.639> to<00:03:39.900> challenge<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:40.989> muscle

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
or fourth week to challenge the muscle

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:43.770 
or fourth week to challenge the muscle
muscle<00:03:41.709> in<00:03:41.859> a<00:03:41.980> different<00:03:42.400> way<00:03:42.790> to<00:03:43.480> help

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
muscle in a different way to help

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.830 
muscle in a different way to help
stimulate

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
stimulate

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.640 
stimulate
muscle<00:03:46.590> growth<00:03:47.060> um<00:03:48.060> not<00:03:48.569> just<00:03:48.900> for<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.410> fact

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
muscle growth um not just for the fact

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.160 
muscle growth um not just for the fact
of<00:03:49.770> saving<00:03:50.250> time<00:03:50.490> in<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.880> gym<00:03:51.060> yeah<00:03:51.959> you'll

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
of saving time in the gym yeah you'll

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.470 
of saving time in the gym yeah you'll
notice<00:03:52.470> that<00:03:52.620> your<00:03:52.800> super<00:03:53.190> set<00:03:53.400> days<00:03:53.880> you're

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
notice that your super set days you're

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.870 
notice that your super set days you're
working<00:03:55.110> really<00:03:55.350> hard<00:03:55.590> and<00:03:56.160> it<00:03:56.310> does<00:03:56.550> kind<00:03:56.760> of

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
working really hard and it does kind of

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.090 
working really hard and it does kind of
cut<00:03:57.030> down<00:03:57.060> on<00:03:57.240> the<00:03:57.330> time<00:03:57.740> but<00:03:58.740> the<00:03:58.890> main<00:03:59.069> reason

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
cut down on the time but the main reason

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.150 
cut down on the time but the main reason
for<00:03:59.640> doing<00:03:59.700> this<00:03:59.819> superset<00:04:00.330> is<00:04:00.480> to<00:04:01.050> shock<00:04:01.920> that

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
for doing this superset is to shock that

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.080 
for doing this superset is to shock that
muscle<00:04:02.520> into<00:04:03.150> using<00:04:03.989> itself<00:04:04.830> differently<00:04:05.489> and

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
muscle into using itself differently and

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.300 
muscle into using itself differently and
to<00:04:06.239> ask<00:04:07.050> you<00:04:07.260> more<00:04:07.470> of<00:04:07.620> it<00:04:07.739> in<00:04:07.980> a<00:04:08.040> different

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
to ask you more of it in a different

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.220 
to ask you more of it in a different
capacity<00:04:08.400> so<00:04:09.060> that's<00:04:09.690> going<00:04:09.840> to<00:04:09.930> contribute

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
capacity so that's going to contribute

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.110 
capacity so that's going to contribute
to<00:04:11.000> muscle<00:04:12.000> gains<00:04:12.180> as<00:04:12.390> well<00:04:12.420> for<00:04:14.120> building

see how the change happens so if you can

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.239 
see how the change happens so if you can
mark<00:06:48.759> from<00:06:49.059> week<00:06:49.270> to<00:06:49.449> week<00:06:49.479> to<00:06:49.749> week<00:06:50.249> your

mark from week to week to week your
increase<00:06:51.909> in<00:06:52.180> reps<00:06:52.509> and<00:06:52.870> then<00:06:53.710> when<00:06:53.949> it<00:06:54.069> starts

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:54.789 
increase in reps and then when it starts

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:56.700 
increase in reps and then when it starts
to<00:06:54.849> drop<00:06:55.150> or<00:06:55.689> when<00:06:55.809> your<00:06:55.930> rep<00:06:56.110> start<00:06:56.349> to<00:06:56.469> raise

00:06:59.279 --> 00:06:59.289 
so much that you increase the weight if

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:00.719 
so much that you increase the weight if
you<00:06:59.409> mark<00:06:59.680> that<00:06:59.710> from<00:07:00.039> week<00:07:00.189> to<00:07:00.309> week<00:07:00.339> and<00:07:00.639> you
