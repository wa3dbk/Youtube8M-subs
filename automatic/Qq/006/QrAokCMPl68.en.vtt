fades officio what did you identify as
good<00:00:10.110> at<00:00:10.200> math<00:00:10.320> from<00:00:10.469> both<00:00:10.559> teams<00:00:10.710> I<00:00:11.099> so<00:00:11.550> pick

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
good at math from both teams I so pick

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.180 
good at math from both teams I so pick
and<00:00:11.880> ban<00:00:12.030> face<00:00:12.330> it<00:00:12.780> looked<00:00:13.200> like<00:00:13.349> rocket<00:00:13.920> were

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
and ban face it looked like rocket were

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.919 
and ban face it looked like rocket were
about<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.610> mess<00:00:14.790> up<00:00:14.969> completely<00:00:15.420> when<00:00:15.750> head

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
about to mess up completely when head

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.200 
about to mess up completely when head
lissandra<00:00:16.560> Morgana<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.430> LeBlanc<00:00:17.789> locked<00:00:18.029> in

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
lissandra Morgana and LeBlanc locked in

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.359 
lissandra Morgana and LeBlanc locked in
and<00:00:18.420> we<00:00:18.810> saw<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.050> Malachi<00:00:19.560> coming<00:00:19.920> in<00:00:20.039> from

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
and we saw the Malachi coming in from

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.370 
and we saw the Malachi coming in from
from<00:00:20.910> h2k<00:00:21.330> which<00:00:21.539> would<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:21.990> be<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.109> bit

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
from h2k which would it be a bit

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.960 
from h2k which would it be a bit
unkillable<00:00:22.740> but<00:00:23.100> then<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.310> got<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.550> tristana

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
unkillable but then it got the tristana

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.370 
unkillable but then it got the tristana
so<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.240> feel<00:00:24.420> like<00:00:24.449> they<00:00:24.630> saved<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.170> comp

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
so I feel like they saved the comp

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.620 
so I feel like they saved the comp
somewhat<00:00:25.800> but<00:00:26.580> in<00:00:26.849> terms<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.240> like<00:00:27.390> pure

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
somewhat but in terms of like pure

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.689 
somewhat but in terms of like pure
five-on-five<00:00:28.260> team<00:00:28.560> fighting<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:29.250> was<00:00:29.490> so

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
five-on-five team fighting it was so

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:30.950 
five-on-five team fighting it was so
much<00:00:29.760> easier<00:00:29.880> for<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.510> play<00:00:30.779> their

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
much easier for you to play their

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.810 
much easier for you to play their
composition<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:32.130> honestly<00:00:32.640> feel<00:00:32.759> like

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
composition and I honestly feel like

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.459 
composition and I honestly feel like
they<00:00:32.969> would<00:00:33.059> out<00:00:33.180> scale<00:00:33.420> them<00:00:33.540> anyway<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.290> once

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
they would out scale them anyway so once

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.600 
they would out scale them anyway so once
it<00:00:34.559> started<00:00:34.770> win<00:00:34.890> these<00:00:35.040> fights<00:00:35.250> in<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.489> mid

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
it started win these fights in the mid

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.180 
it started win these fights in the mid
game<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:36.000> was<00:00:36.090> basically<00:00:36.480> over<00:00:36.570> from<00:00:36.870> there

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
game it was basically over from there

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.830 
game it was basically over from there
the<00:00:38.190> whole<00:00:38.340> game<00:00:38.610> based<00:00:39.210> around<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.629> two

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
the whole game based around the two

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.180 
the whole game based around the two
dragon<00:00:40.170> fights<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.559> we<00:00:40.680> saw<00:00:40.829> we're<00:00:40.980> going<00:00:41.129> to

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
dragon fights that we saw we're going to

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.799 
dragon fights that we saw we're going to
come<00:00:41.309> later<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.760> with<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> replay<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.540> the

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
come later on that with a replay of the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.049 
come later on that with a replay of the
first<00:00:43.050> one<00:00:43.260> but<00:00:43.680> as<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.460> fishery<00:00:44.700> pointed<00:00:44.969> out

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
first one but as the fishery pointed out

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.610 
first one but as the fishery pointed out
correctly<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.899> chissano<00:00:46.230> saved<00:00:46.530> the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
correctly the chissano saved the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.200 
correctly the chissano saved the
composition<00:00:47.100> with<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.250> double<00:00:47.550> AP<00:00:47.820> against<00:00:48.149> a

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
composition with a double AP against a

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.700 
composition with a double AP against a
molecule<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.660> do<00:00:48.840> nothing<00:00:49.170> if<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.379> pick<00:00:49.530> like

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
molecule you do nothing if you pick like

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.619 
molecule you do nothing if you pick like
a<00:00:49.739> Corky<00:00:50.190> or<00:00:50.280> grapes<00:00:50.610> like<00:00:50.850> who<00:00:51.149> who<00:00:51.570> are

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
a Corky or grapes like who who are

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.660 
a Corky or grapes like who who are
designed<00:00:52.110> for<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.410> mid-game<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:53.160> do<00:00:53.309> nothing

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
designed for the mid-game you do nothing

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.830 
designed for the mid-game you do nothing
against<00:00:54.000> them<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.300> automatically<00:00:54.719> lose

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
against them and you automatically lose

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.650 
against them and you automatically lose
the<00:00:55.260> late<00:00:55.559> game<00:00:55.829> but<00:00:56.280> with<00:00:56.399> at<00:00:56.489> istana<00:00:56.850> if<00:00:57.120> with

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
the late game but with at istana if with

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.689 
the late game but with at istana if with
the<00:00:57.690> right<00:00:57.809> time<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.590> right<00:00:58.829> skill<00:00:59.309> he

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
the right time and the right skill he

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.430 
the right time and the right skill he
could<00:00:59.850> have<00:00:59.969> made<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.149> work<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.109> pics<00:01:01.289> and

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
could have made it work so the pics and

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.990 
could have made it work so the pics and
ban<00:01:01.590> warden<00:01:02.010> indicator<00:01:02.399> who's<00:01:02.640> gonna<00:01:02.820> win

ban warden indicator who's gonna win
that<00:01:03.059> game<00:01:03.300> yeah<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:03.870> did<00:01:04.129> there<00:01:05.129> it's<00:01:05.339> already

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
that game yeah I did there it's already

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.890 
that game yeah I did there it's already
been<00:01:05.729> said<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:05.909> don't<00:01:06.060> feel<00:01:06.270> like<00:01:06.420> picking

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
been said I don't feel like picking

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.679 
been said I don't feel like picking
manzoor<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:08.000> relevant<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.330> deciding

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
manzoor to relevant and the deciding

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:10.789 
manzoor to relevant and the deciding
factor<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.020> games<00:01:10.170> was<00:01:10.320> really<00:01:10.590> how<00:01:10.680> they

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
factor of the games was really how they

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.410 
factor of the games was really how they
played<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.100> out<00:01:11.189> mm-hmm<00:01:11.790> then<00:01:12.060> talk<00:01:12.270> me

already gone that should not have
happened<00:01:43.439> in<00:01:43.890> my<00:01:44.040> opinion<00:01:44.340> at<00:01:44.549> least<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.970> I

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
happened in my opinion at least and I

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.090 
happened in my opinion at least and I
feel<00:01:45.360> like<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.600> was<00:01:45.720> probably<00:01:46.049> saw<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.470> few

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
feel like it was probably saw a few

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.069 
feel like it was probably saw a few
times<00:01:47.280> from<00:01:47.430> him<00:01:47.640> yeah<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.299> early<00:01:48.689> game<00:01:48.930> in

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
times from him yeah the early game in

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.690 
times from him yeah the early game in
land<00:01:49.259> swaps<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.710> generally<00:01:50.040> scripted<00:01:50.490> there's

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
land swaps is generally scripted there's

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.399 
land swaps is generally scripted there's
the<00:01:51.329> correct<00:01:51.750> thing<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.110> then<00:01:52.200> there's<00:01:52.350> a

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
the correct thing and then there's a

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.270 
the correct thing and then there's a
bunch<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.710> things<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.009> can<00:01:53.100> do<00:01:53.159> they're

however he doesn't have an hourglass at

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.080 
however he doesn't have an hourglass at
this<00:03:07.500> point<00:03:07.709> because<00:03:07.860> he<00:03:08.069> went<00:03:08.340> for<00:03:08.670> morel

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
this point because he went for morel

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.880 
this point because he went for morel
nomicon<00:03:09.629> as<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.870> first<00:03:10.049> item<00:03:10.379> despite<00:03:10.709> being

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
nomicon as the first item despite being

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.619 
nomicon as the first item despite being
in<00:03:11.040> a<00:03:11.099> lane<00:03:11.310> swap<00:03:11.519> and<00:03:11.700> morel<00:03:11.970> nomicon<00:03:12.480> is

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
in a lane swap and morel nomicon is

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.199 
in a lane swap and morel nomicon is
basically<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:13.470> lane<00:03:13.709> item<00:03:14.190> itself<00:03:14.549> it's<00:03:15.000> better

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
basically a lane item itself it's better

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.030 
basically a lane item itself it's better
just<00:03:15.360> get<00:03:15.510> like<00:03:15.660> codex<00:03:16.110> and<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.530> your<00:03:16.799> cooler

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
just get like codex and and your cooler

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.229 
just get like codex and and your cooler
reduction<00:03:17.370> boots<00:03:17.579> and<00:03:17.790> then<00:03:17.880> go<00:03:18.000> straight<00:03:18.150> out

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
reduction boots and then go straight out

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.879 
reduction boots and then go straight out
last<00:03:18.540> if<00:03:18.660> you<00:03:18.750> want<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:19.019> fight<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:19.620> once<00:03:19.829> he

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
last if you want to fight so once he

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.379 
last if you want to fight so once he
goes<00:03:20.040> in<00:03:20.280> I<00:03:20.430> mean<00:03:20.609> you<00:03:20.760> guys<00:03:20.880> can<00:03:21.120> talk<00:03:21.239> about

goes in I mean you guys can talk about

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:22.879 
goes in I mean you guys can talk about
it<00:03:21.600> what<00:03:21.900> happens<00:03:22.170> when<00:03:22.290> he<00:03:22.410> actually<00:03:22.530> engaged

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
it what happens when he actually engaged

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:24.349 
it what happens when he actually engaged
at<00:03:23.100> this<00:03:23.250> point<00:03:23.459> yeah<00:03:23.579> I<00:03:23.609> guess<00:03:23.760> like<00:03:23.910> if<00:03:24.150> when

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359

at this point yeah I guess like if when
you<00:03:24.450> think<00:03:24.660> about<00:03:24.720> it<00:03:24.900> this<00:03:25.079> is<00:03:25.139> mostly<00:03:25.560> a

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650

would<00:03:47.910> like<00:03:48.030> to<00:03:48.150> do<00:03:48.269> and<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.660> team<00:03:48.840> was<00:03:48.989> just

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
would like to do and the team was just

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:50.569 
would like to do and the team was just
split<00:03:49.349> up<00:03:49.380> like<00:03:49.680> that's<00:03:49.950> not<00:03:50.160> how<00:03:50.250> you<00:03:50.310> team

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
split up like that's not how you team

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.159 
split up like that's not how you team
fight<00:03:50.760> with<00:03:50.910> rocket<00:03:51.180> seems<00:03:51.389> like<00:03:51.510> all<00:03:51.690> the

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169 
fight with rocket seems like all the

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:53.960 
fight with rocket seems like all the
focus<00:03:52.410> the<00:03:52.769> focus<00:03:52.799> should<00:03:53.190> be<00:03:53.250> on<00:03:53.400> Ryu<00:03:53.730> if<00:03:53.880> you

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
focus the focus should be on Ryu if you

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.670 
focus the focus should be on Ryu if you
ask<00:03:54.120> me<00:03:54.299> because<00:03:54.450> in<00:03:54.720> both<00:03:54.870> dragon<00:03:55.319> fights<00:03:55.530> in

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680
