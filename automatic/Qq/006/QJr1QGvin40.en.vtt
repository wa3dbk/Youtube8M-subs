00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.330
 at the time of putting the charge in contact 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.790
 let's see what on the board is 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.210
 light two lights are two lights 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.580
 witnesses one of the alternator and the other of 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.189
 oil pressure if any of these 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.960
 two witnesses kept on a 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.539
 Once we gave the car starter and the 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.449
 engine started this would be an indication of 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.800
 that the alternator or the oil are 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.559
 having any anomaly in the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.600
 working today let's talk about the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.059
 witness of the oil if it remains 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.100
 on once we gave him starter and 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.260
 we have a pressure gauge of 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.900
 oil the first thing we're going to see is 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.760
 how much pressure do we have at that moment if 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.940
 We have a correct pressure according to the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.470
 vehicle manufacturer's manual 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.400
 We would rule out that the problem is 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.400
 lack of pressure 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.520
 the light stays on and the pressure of 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.520
 oil 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.500
 and good but nevertheless the light continues 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.990
 on something that usually fails is the 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.390
 oil pressure group just what 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.830
 that makes this witness light go on 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.020
 of the board 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.970
 we are going to look for said bulb we are going to 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.440
 remove we will replace it with one 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.010
 new and we'll see if that way 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:32.810
 we solve the problem 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.810
 this is the oil bulb 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.680
 this part of the bulb is wet with 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.680
 oil 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.680
 the hair of the dogs 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.540
 but this should not be dirty and 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.930
 be losing oil here by the 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.550
 point so the reason why light 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.440
 it stays on it can be false 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.720
 contact for this accumulation of oil 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.610
 that it has on the tip and also that 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.080
 directly the bulb is broken what 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.729
 we are going to do is proceed to change the 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.450
 egg to see if that way we solve the 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.450
 inconvenient 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.569
 now let's test if changing the 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.670
 bulb solves the inconvenience and the 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.510
 oil light goes off once you 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.510
 the engine starts 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.780
 as we see the oil witness it 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.090
 turned off means that the problem 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.910
 I was in it 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:16.860
 we see the manometer almost static at 40 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.860
 psi so let's learn by thumb 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.540
 the pressures in place 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.900
 we have the festive light that there is 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:39.659
 turn off the oil pressure in this 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.990
 moment is 50 55 pounds per inch 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:41.990
 square
