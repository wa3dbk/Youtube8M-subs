you this one actually took about six
months<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.140> write<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.560> was<00:01:25.710> writing<00:01:26.009> pretty

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250

the<00:01:41.750> way<00:01:41.869> we<00:01:41.899> meditate<00:01:42.350> in<00:01:42.500> a<00:01:42.560> cabin<00:01:42.860> on<00:01:42.920> the

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
the way we meditate in a cabin on the

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.280 
the way we meditate in a cabin on the
lake<00:01:43.040> or<00:01:43.460> do<00:01:43.610> you<00:01:43.729> actually<00:01:44.000> just<00:01:44.570> have<00:01:45.170> to

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
lake or do you actually just have to

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.990 
lake or do you actually just have to
watch<00:01:45.439> if<00:01:45.680> they<00:01:45.770> don't<00:01:45.979> just<00:01:46.100> stop<00:01:46.460> writing<00:01:46.909> I

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
watch if they don't just stop writing I

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.490 
watch if they don't just stop writing I
actually<00:01:47.299> have<00:01:47.689> about<00:01:47.960> three<00:01:48.200> months<00:01:48.350> of

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
actually have about three months of

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.200 
actually have about three months of
total<00:01:48.920> panic<00:01:49.159> I<00:01:49.490> look<00:01:49.909> at<00:01:50.030> a<00:01:50.060> lot<00:01:50.149> of

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
total panic I look at a lot of

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.700 
total panic I look at a lot of
repertoire<00:01:50.600> for<00:01:51.350> that<00:01:51.530> particular

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
repertoire for that particular

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.010 
repertoire for that particular
instrument<00:01:52.460> and<00:01:52.610> then<00:01:53.000> I<00:01:53.030> start<00:01:53.390> with<00:01:53.570> blank

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
instrument and then I start with blank

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.929 
instrument and then I start with blank
paper<00:01:54.350> and<00:01:54.679> is<00:01:55.100> a<00:01:55.130> lot<00:01:55.340> of<00:01:55.429> false<00:01:55.610> start

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
paper and is a lot of false start

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.010 
paper and is a lot of false start
because<00:01:56.270> you're<00:01:56.390> trying<00:01:56.479> to<00:01:56.630> ferret<00:01:56.780> what<00:01:56.960> the

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
because you're trying to ferret what the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.289 
because you're trying to ferret what the
sound<00:01:57.259> wall<00:01:57.560> is<00:01:57.799> Phyllis<00:01:58.549> an<00:01:58.670> American<00:01:59.060> cherry

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
sound wall is Phyllis an American cherry

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.149 
sound wall is Phyllis an American cherry
they're<00:01:59.539> all<00:01:59.689> very<00:01:59.929> different<00:02:00.170> from<00:02:00.590> 1<00:02:00.830> to<00:02:01.009> 1

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
they're all very different from 1 to 1

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.580 
they're all very different from 1 to 1
because<00:02:01.700> each<00:02:02.119> each<00:02:02.630> one<00:02:02.929> has<00:02:03.170> it<00:02:03.439> can

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
because each each one has it can

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.219 
because each each one has it can
reflects<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.100> instrument<00:02:04.580> and<00:02:04.700> the

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
reflects the instrument and the

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.870 
reflects the instrument and the
repertoire<00:02:06.229> you<00:02:06.619> know<00:02:06.679> has<00:02:06.950> is<00:02:07.130> so<00:02:07.280> incredible

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
repertoire you know has is so incredible

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.600 
repertoire you know has is so incredible
it's<00:02:08.269> so<00:02:08.390> fast<00:02:08.660> I<00:02:09.080> had<00:02:09.769> a<00:02:09.799> really<00:02:10.039> soccer<00:02:10.340> thing

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
it's so fast I had a really soccer thing

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:11.979 
it's so fast I had a really soccer thing
about<00:02:10.759> what<00:02:10.910> am<00:02:11.000> I<00:02:11.090> going<00:02:11.239> to<00:02:11.299> contribute<00:02:11.600> to

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
about what am I going to contribute to

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.199 
about what am I going to contribute to
this<00:02:12.140> repertoire<00:02:12.920> that<00:02:12.950> isn't<00:02:13.519> doing<00:02:14.090> what

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
this repertoire that isn't doing what

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.910 
this repertoire that isn't doing what
selling<00:02:14.510> else's<00:02:14.810> them<00:02:14.989> but<00:02:15.170> just<00:02:15.650> give<00:02:15.799> us

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
selling else's them but just give us

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.550 
selling else's them but just give us
kind<00:02:16.130> of<00:02:16.220> a<00:02:16.280> fresh<00:02:16.489> perspective<00:02:16.670> so<00:02:17.360> it's<00:02:18.290> hard

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
kind of a fresh perspective so it's hard

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.870 
kind of a fresh perspective so it's hard
it's<00:02:18.709> amazing<00:02:19.069> the<00:02:19.190> hardest<00:02:19.549> part<00:02:19.790> is

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
it's amazing the hardest part is

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.729 
it's amazing the hardest part is
starting<00:02:20.390> it<00:02:20.660> literally<00:02:21.019> takes<00:02:21.260> on<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.500> mark

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
starting it literally takes on the mark

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.620 
starting it literally takes on the mark
of<00:02:22.040> working<00:02:22.640> at<00:02:22.700> a<00:02:22.730> day<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:23.000> day<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.239> finally

want to go

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.740 
want to go
so<00:03:05.340> I<00:03:05.400> had<00:03:05.520> that<00:03:05.640> Ursula<00:03:05.880> what<00:03:06.270> can<00:03:06.450> they<00:03:06.570> do

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
so I had that Ursula what can they do

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.020 
so I had that Ursula what can they do
what's<00:03:07.080> possible<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.710> it's<00:03:08.490> actually<00:03:08.880> hard

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
what's possible and it's actually hard

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.190 
what's possible and it's actually hard
enough<00:03:09.210> i<00:03:09.330> think<00:03:09.480> it<00:03:09.570> probably<00:03:09.600> pushes<00:03:10.170> a

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
enough i think it probably pushes a

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.350 
enough i think it probably pushes a
little<00:03:10.470> bit<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:11.190> outer<00:03:11.370> limit<00:03:11.790> but<00:03:11.970> it's<00:03:12.270> a

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
little bit the outer limit but it's a

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.960 
little bit the outer limit but it's a
wet<00:03:13.290> states<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.680> all<00:03:13.740> a<00:03:13.770> big<00:03:13.950> event<00:03:14.070> cook<00:03:14.700> yes

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
wet states and all a big event cook yes

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.420 
wet states and all a big event cook yes
