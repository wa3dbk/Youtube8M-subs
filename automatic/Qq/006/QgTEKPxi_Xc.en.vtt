00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
process of stabilizing them where we put

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.440 
process of stabilizing them where we put
cement<00:00:57.170> as<00:00:57.560> in<00:00:57.800> dry<00:00:58.070> powder<00:00:58.370> on<00:00:58.790> top<00:00:59.240> of<00:00:59.390> the

cement as in dry powder on top of the
base<00:00:59.630> course<00:00:59.930> that<00:01:00.200> we've<00:01:00.410> got<00:01:00.620> to<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.010> right

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
base course that we've got to the right

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.640 
base course that we've got to the right
levels<00:01:01.550> and<00:01:01.850> then<00:01:02.510> we<00:01:02.630> rotary<00:01:03.140> hoe<00:01:03.290> there<00:01:03.500> then

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
levels and then we rotary hoe there then

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.280 
levels and then we rotary hoe there then
we<00:01:04.070> drink<00:01:04.640> them<00:01:04.820> dick<00:01:05.030> water<00:01:05.330> into<00:01:05.689> the<00:01:05.780> hoe<00:01:05.960> so

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
we drink them dick water into the hoe so

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.440 
we drink them dick water into the hoe so
we're<00:01:06.619> not<00:01:06.770> wasting<00:01:07.009> any<00:01:07.369> water<00:01:07.640> and<00:01:08.030> then

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
we're not wasting any water and then

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.240 
we're not wasting any water and then
that<00:01:08.600> mixes<00:01:09.049> it<00:01:09.170> all<00:01:09.290> together<00:01:09.470> and<00:01:09.950> then<00:01:10.100> we

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
that mixes it all together and then we

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.219 
that mixes it all together and then we
put<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:10.579> rollers<00:01:10.909> on<00:01:11.060> it<00:01:11.210> compact<00:01:11.659> it<00:01:11.869> put<00:01:12.140> the

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
put the rollers on it compact it put the

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.820 
put the rollers on it compact it put the
grater<00:01:12.470> on<00:01:12.590> it<00:01:12.860> shape<00:01:13.159> it<00:01:13.340> all<00:01:13.460> up<00:01:14.350> the<00:01:15.350> team<00:01:15.650> a

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
grater on it shape it all up the team a

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.720 
grater on it shape it all up the team a
using<00:01:16.220> LPS<00:01:17.060> technology<00:01:17.780> to<00:01:18.350> measure<00:01:18.620> and<00:01:18.950> work

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
using LPS technology to measure and work

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.430 
using LPS technology to measure and work
with<00:01:20.210> great<00:01:20.600> accuracy

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
with great accuracy

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.340 
with great accuracy
so<00:01:21.860> LPS<00:01:22.370> is<00:01:22.670> basically<00:01:23.210> using<00:01:23.720> robotic<00:01:24.140> total

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
so LPS is basically using robotic total

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.860 
so LPS is basically using robotic total
stations<00:01:24.920> it<00:01:25.400> stands<00:01:25.850> for<00:01:26.030> local<00:01:26.180> Positioning

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
stations it stands for local Positioning

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.899 
stations it stands for local Positioning
Systems<00:01:27.290> we've<00:01:27.560> gone<00:01:27.770> with<00:01:27.979> that<00:01:28.010> option<00:01:28.340> for

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
Systems we've gone with that option for

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.630 
Systems we've gone with that option for
accuracy<00:01:29.510> over<00:01:29.690> GPS<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:30.620> GPS<00:01:31.130> system<00:01:31.280> gets

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
accuracy over GPS the GPS system gets

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.910 
accuracy over GPS the GPS system gets
you<00:01:31.760> within<00:01:32.060> probably<00:01:32.810> 40<00:01:33.260> mils<00:01:33.470> where<00:01:33.740> we're

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
you within probably 40 mils where we're

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.620 
you within probably 40 mils where we're
hoping<00:01:34.040> to<00:01:34.310> be<00:01:34.430> 5<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:34.850> 10<00:01:35.030> mils<00:01:35.270> with<00:01:35.510> our

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
hoping to be 5 to 10 mils with our

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.290 
hoping to be 5 to 10 mils with our
system<00:01:36.170> art<00:01:37.070> excellent<00:01:37.670> so<00:01:37.909> user-friendly

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
system art excellent so user-friendly

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.380 
system art excellent so user-friendly
easy<00:01:38.840> setup<00:01:39.380> in<00:01:39.620> the<00:01:39.710> morning<00:01:40.040> you<00:01:40.490> get<00:01:41.120> it<00:01:41.210> set

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
easy setup in the morning you get it set

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.450 
easy setup in the morning you get it set
up<00:01:41.510> in<00:01:41.659> 20<00:01:42.049> minutes<00:01:42.320> and<00:01:42.560> you're<00:01:43.159> into<00:01:43.340> your

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
up in 20 minutes and you're into your

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.700 
up in 20 minutes and you're into your
grading<00:01:43.820> and<00:01:44.060> your<00:01:44.840> get<00:01:44.960> in<00:01:45.080> within<00:01:45.350> your<00:01:45.530> five

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
grading and your get in within your five

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.469 
grading and your get in within your five
more<00:01:45.950> tolerances<00:01:46.520> yeah<00:01:46.820> it's<00:01:46.940> awesome<00:01:47.090> we

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
more tolerances yeah it's awesome we

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:48.940 
more tolerances yeah it's awesome we
need<00:01:47.510> to<00:01:47.780> make<00:01:47.930> sure<00:01:48.170> that<00:01:48.290> we<00:01:48.440> get<00:01:48.620> as<00:01:48.770> much

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
need to make sure that we get as much

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.490 
need to make sure that we get as much
compaction<00:01:49.670> into<00:01:49.940> the<00:01:50.090> pavement<00:01:50.750> layers<00:01:51.140> as

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
compaction into the pavement layers as

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.070 
compaction into the pavement layers as
physically<00:01:52.370> possible<00:01:52.820> so<00:01:53.510> the<00:01:53.600> way<00:01:53.750> we<00:01:53.930> do

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
physically possible so the way we do

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.399 
physically possible so the way we do
that<00:01:54.350> is<00:01:54.409> when<00:01:54.770> we<00:01:54.890> start<00:01:55.220> our<00:01:55.810> our<00:01:56.810> compaction

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
that is when we start our our compaction

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.070 
that is when we start our our compaction
process<00:01:57.650> we<00:01:58.159> get<00:01:58.340> out<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:58.729> Winston's<00:01:59.600> testing

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
process we get out the Winston's testing

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.649 
process we get out the Winston's testing
team<00:02:00.320> and<00:02:00.590> we<00:02:01.190> use<00:02:01.369> intense<00:02:01.729> Amida<00:02:02.119> to<00:02:02.299> perform

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
team and we use intense Amida to perform

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.289 
team and we use intense Amida to perform
what<00:02:02.840> they<00:02:02.930> call<00:02:03.170> a<00:02:03.350> plateau<00:02:03.799> test<00:02:04.159> so<00:02:05.119> what

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
what they call a plateau test so what

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.090 
what they call a plateau test so what
that<00:02:05.479> does<00:02:05.690> is<00:02:05.960> it<00:02:06.110> determines<00:02:06.260> the<00:02:06.680> amount<00:02:06.799> of

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
that does is it determines the amount of

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.910 
that does is it determines the amount of
vibe<00:02:07.430> and<00:02:07.729> static<00:02:08.090> passes<00:02:08.629> we<00:02:08.810> need<00:02:09.019> to<00:02:09.229> do<00:02:09.439> to

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
vibe and static passes we need to do to

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.010 
vibe and static passes we need to do to
achieve<00:02:10.039> our<00:02:10.610> target<00:02:11.060> compaction

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
achieve our target compaction

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.160 
achieve our target compaction
the<00:02:13.950> carefully<00:02:14.490> prepared<00:02:14.940> road<00:02:15.210> base<00:02:15.450> is<00:02:15.750> then

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
the carefully prepared road base is then

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.070 
the carefully prepared road base is then
coated<00:02:16.560> with<00:02:16.790> emulsion<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.000> gravel<00:02:18.780> chip

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
coated with emulsion and gravel chip

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.850 
coated with emulsion and gravel chip
we're<00:02:19.620> using<00:02:19.950> emulsions<00:02:20.940> which<00:02:21.240> is<00:02:21.860> bitumen

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
we're using emulsions which is bitumen

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.860 
we're using emulsions which is bitumen
base<00:02:23.160> product<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:23.790> water<00:02:24.090> it's<00:02:24.630> more

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
base product and water it's more

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.900 
base product and water it's more
environmentally<00:02:25.440> friendly<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.550> health<00:02:26.790> and

environmentally friendly and health and

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:27.890 
environmentally friendly and health and
safety<00:02:27.000> we<00:02:27.390> don't<00:02:27.570> have<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.810> high

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
safety we don't have the high

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.000 
safety we don't have the high
temperatures<00:02:28.470> that<00:02:28.560> we<00:02:28.650> do<00:02:28.800> with<00:02:28.980> a

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
temperatures that we do with a

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.520 
temperatures that we do with a
traditional<00:02:29.280> bitumen<00:02:30.110> so<00:02:31.110> it's<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.290> way<00:02:31.410> the

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
traditional bitumen so it's the way the

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.950 
traditional bitumen so it's the way the
industry<00:02:31.740> is<00:02:31.950> going<00:02:32.340> so<00:02:32.580> we're<00:02:32.730> doing<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.210> what

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
industry is going so we're doing a what

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.870 
industry is going so we're doing a what
we<00:02:34.050> call<00:02:34.080> crime<00:02:34.530> code<00:02:34.770> seal<00:02:35.040> at<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.310> moment<00:02:35.700> as

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
we call crime code seal at the moment as

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.760 
we call crime code seal at the moment as
the<00:02:36.180> first<00:02:36.420> seal<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:36.960> then<00:02:37.110> we<00:02:37.260> put<00:02:37.470> our<00:02:37.590> full

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
the first seal and then we put our full

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.520 
the first seal and then we put our full
seal<00:02:38.040> coat<00:02:38.430> on<00:02:38.700> top<00:02:38.940> of<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:40.230> then<00:02:40.410> in

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
seal coat on top of that and then in

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.050 
seal coat on top of that and then in
certain<00:02:40.800> sequence<00:02:41.220> we're<00:02:41.370> putting<00:02:41.610> our<00:02:41.790> power

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
certain sequence we're putting our power

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.770 
certain sequence we're putting our power
on<00:02:42.240> top<00:02:42.390> of<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.600> which<00:02:42.810> is<00:02:43.020> a<00:02:43.580> smooth-running

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
on top of that which is a smooth-running

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.000 
on top of that which is a smooth-running
coat<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.960> keep<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.230> noise<00:02:46.350> down

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
coat to keep the noise down

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.180 
coat to keep the noise down
all<00:02:47.580> of<00:02:47.910> this<00:02:48.060> will<00:02:48.450> mean<00:02:48.630> a<00:02:48.690> smooth<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.530> quiet
