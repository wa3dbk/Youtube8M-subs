00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:02.950
 a 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.829
 and a the story of franka marco no 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.240
 robot and I continue with the second part 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:14.769
 from the autorai we start on 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.020
 start of jacket wherever everything is because 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.760
 all toes candy can be seen 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.030
 take the f cake i let it be four and 128 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.440
 agree completely so this one has 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.120
 four-wheel drive that is a first 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.400
 brute de you can not see so I look 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.720
 not what you can see yes what this 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.760
 is actually the very first time that 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.990
 the jaguar xe to be seen in person 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.340
 So in the Netherlands you naturally have the 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.870
 car sometimes a kind of magnified 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.909
 see toy boxes along the 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.769
 a2 and a4 but here it is really there 

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:40.569
 to touch and to sit in 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:41.829
 so cool and interesting 

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:43.749
 for the Dutch market this car 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.219
 has 20% addition to this 

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:47.469
 version this is the 3-liter supercharge 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.659
 but that thing that he is the 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:51.460
 diesel hollander africa and that is 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:53.319
 with supplies available with a 20% addition 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.329
 interesting there is the more news and me 

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:57.870
 hope is not terribly whatsoever before 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.870
 first in the Netherlands 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.810
 literally the biggest news on the 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.700
 Audi's tent, this new Q7 is the second 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.920
 generation of course is a lot 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.850
 more slender still a huge one 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.890
 SUV 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.360
 and for the Netherlands it would be q7 eton 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.950
 very important but it will not come 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.080
 more on a market this year 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.730
 those cars to less than 50 grams of CO2 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.320
 per kilometer so if you go this year 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.790
 available would have been had he gives 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.290
 so a wide and that party does not go 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.440
 just by being here at least 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.440
 see 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.560
 colleague marco gorter goes to him this 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.770
 weekend drive but he is already here 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.300
 new audi rs3 when driving 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.650
 and I am very curious learns car 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.350
 because the new one 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.610
 I find s3 better than the previous one, very 3d 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.430
 fall to do with the weights 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.990
 mqb platform is much lighter and yes the 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.580
 weight balance is such that car a lot 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.170
 is less understeered than the rs3 and that 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.510
 old katie straight to that heavy blocks 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.040
 on the nose that 15 that lasted through 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.720
 but yes it is that old engine so me 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.730
 wants to know how that combination is going 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.500
 marco me I think Monday tell the 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.920
 specs are huge even when it rains 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.140
 in this case 300 and too 67p k yes 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.360
 with that they are beyond the 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.980
 mercedes a45 amg and that is natural 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.130
 no coincidence 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.670
 new price john optic 68,000 euros for 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.850
 an a3 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.850
 Yes 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.920
 at passje a funny hÃ¨ that you on the 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.600
 stand in the form of this car that 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.160
 not really it is a tribute 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.650
 in the form of this car a modern one 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.960
 interpretation of the 911 targa in honor 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.390
 of the 50th birthday of that car 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.370
 and this exclusive edition here 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.780
 is a way to push to let go 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.160
 see what is possible with it 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.650
 personalize this car 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.420
 not only is the golf club a part 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.490
 from that exclusive line and becomes that too 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.410
 modern interpretation of those fox wheels 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.450
 from the past then you have an interior with 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.650
 the pizza upholstery to the force for the 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.990
 lovers of all those elements 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.550
 that are unique you must be fast if you 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.110
 another exclusive so your normal that 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.340
 they make 15 and I let myself be 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.340
 say that six have already been sold 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.780
 and I have to say I only hear 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.489
 enthusiastic responses about that 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.020
 Dutch Targa but I don't find anything 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.890
 over to me I am such a tiger man and me 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.870
 don't know so nostalgic 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.310
 so give me this being stefan here 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.989
 not nothing this was already the car for him 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.180
 of the year ' did not suffer the 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.980
 caiman gt4 which is then not limited 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.790
 because that is also being built briefly is in 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.360
 practice goes again 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.360
 belgium is mutating 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.830
 well welcome to the also asian department of 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.930
 Pon's car dealership here on the Rhine 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.310
 the umpteenth free and you will notice that 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.140
 this car are going to be at the end of it 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.330
 life is hidden away in a corner 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.280
 and rooie marck listen to this or or 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.720
 doesn't seem like a ferryman can 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.010
 I no longer air and option to 1000 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.020
 billion special editions 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.150
 working in love at lamborghini is the 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.100
 aventador sw 750 hp 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.320
 the relatively new and up goes as one 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.120
 Just slap the car in front 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.170
 me tomorrow comes over that so afrojack 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.030
 he submits a new book 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.740
 to reveal again he can know lambo 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.700
 driver pure singing 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.700
 such a smiler 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.000
 also on the voice of investing and tasty 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.820
 candy here in amsterdam because on mcclaren 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.770
 took the 75s to the vote 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.090
 here of course we already have this car 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.170
 seen and then new york auto show 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.490
 this is the first time he has 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.570
 actually on the European mainland 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.280
 can be seen 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.560
 well the recipe may be known when the 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.830
 smallest new in steps of mclaren 3 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.170
 point 8 liter v8 with double turbo 3.2 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.750
 seconds of call 100 570 hp and one 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.280
 purchase price of 231 thousand euro, 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.260
 what I ever wonder 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.090
 why the hell would you have a 650 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.290
 s if they already have this 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.790
 yes but he does have another on you 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.740
 side I tell you the same engine with just 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.870
 slightly less power the shield 70 hp and 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.100
 it saves 70,000 euros with claire says 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.200
 to look is to portion you just have 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.330
 the 911 gts or create est 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.740
 with the 911 turbo that sells above it 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.720
 also good people sometimes have a demand for it 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.580
 just more power just as sportier and 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.710
 Tell me now caissons separate model which 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.400
 way 11 is only the same 911 so there is 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.990
 what in 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.790
 nice story with claire very good 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.260
 not only globally 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.780
 the Netherlands the name well too 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.830
 take the 675 lt which is limited 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.020
 lightweight edition 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.580
 only 9 were sold in the Netherlands 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.230
 to Dutch buyers who are with the Netherlands 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.610
 want to drive but by only 500 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.620
 made in the Netherlands gets it 4 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.180
 well long but now have that 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.440
 already clicks to 5 but had to 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.910
 might disappoint four people 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.680
 because the demand in the Netherlands 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.440
 now exceeds the mclaren range 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.790
 and what's your favorite was the red bull 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.330
 more are so go in come do it here 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.330
 I do hope so 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.100
 we are in tune with title and and 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.450
 exposed people here against this 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.740
 problem to walk 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.120
 Hello sir, have you sent me a brochure 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.130
 Citroen DS5 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.950
 no sir i have wanted to take expensive ones 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:52.140
 coffee but the lemon ds5 exists here 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.010
 is no longer in a because though 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.570
 lemon 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.250
 hardly has any news, there is one 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.860
 go big revolution it's literal 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.860
 there is reasoning between white and black 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:04.230
 because ds is launched here as moss 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.810
 brands and this car is the first 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:10.050
 exponent thereof the ds5 no longer 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:13.430
 Citroen DS5 but DS5 and the difference is there 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.430
 him of course in the new nose 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.910
 and with that our third video ends 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.960
 from the car line once again from 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.590
 the netherlands actually starts much more 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.410
 car news 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.900
 so that you will be tomorrow morning 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:31.080
 gladly until then 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.080
 cows
