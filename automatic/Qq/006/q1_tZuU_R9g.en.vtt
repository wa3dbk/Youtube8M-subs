00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 there was a time when the making of bowls was an appreciated task that 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.379
 it was transmitted from generation to generation 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:11.900
 but today the cheapest materials with which the large kitchenware is produced 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.529
 Scale have shared handmade wooden bowls in an article 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:19.660
 specialized and this craftsmanship with centuries of history is almost 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.660
 a lost art 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.310
 These exquisite bowls are made from one piece of hardwood there 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.310
 walnut art I offer 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.129
 the trunks arrive at the sawmill fresh from the forest 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.179
 so much that they are still wet is an advantage because moisture lubricates the 

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:41.870
 cutting tool 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.840
 the first step is to divide it into blocks 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.000
 the operator of the saw measures inspects the trunk 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.910
 the length of each block is determined by diameter and defects as knots or 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.910
 brands 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.190
 The operator inspects the ends and marks the cracks and other defects with 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.190
 a red pencil 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.510
 in the sierra de ender 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.360
 use different size templates for bowls and determine the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.650
 best way to cut the block 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.740
 the goal is to get the largest number of pieces the largest 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.740
 possible without using the defective areas 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.870
 Each piece is called a virgin bowl 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.940
 this block is big enough to hold three virgin bowls 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.710
 wide enough to produce a bowl of 43 centimeters 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.520
 diameter and several successively smaller ones that are inside the skull 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.620
 They place the virgin bowl in a lathe specially designed to work the 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.540
 wood from now on everything depends on the skill of the tournament operator 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.490
 while the block rotates 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.020
 mold the bowls using a series of special blades 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:13.649
 first use a curved blade to trim the outer portion 

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:18.409
 it takes a great skill to know what angle to the tool and 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:22.299
 when removing it to let out cuts of wood and avoid jams 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.389
 after two or three minutes what is called outer shell is removed 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:35.449
 the smooth wood that remains is the outside of the largest bowl 

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:43.099
 with a thinner blade, sculp wood with the right thickness and smooth 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.099
 the surface 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:56.589
 Now change a smaller curved blade and cut the woods 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:01.829
 this creates the inner side of the largest bowl and the outside of the 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.829
 next smaller 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:10.609
 repeats the process of cutting and polishing with progressively smaller blades 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.840
 bowl after bowl still at half a per minute 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.849
 this virgin bowl produces four bowls within itself 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:23.669
 the smallest measures 23 centimeters in diameter 

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:31.049
 the bowls receive steam for four hours to extract them and penetrate 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.239
 in the wood 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.640
 and so each bowl is hydrated to prevent the wood from breaking and 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.289
 Crack while air drying 

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:42.549
 When the bowl has dried about a month later, the operators equal the 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.369
 upper edge on a sanding table 

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:49.299
 then with a belt sander polish the interior surfaces and 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.299
 exterior 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:14.229
 the bowl is turned upside down on a special blade that is caught part of 

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:15.879
 the lower area 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:20.239
 that goes to the bowl a flat base on which to settle and a place to write 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.860
 the name of the company 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.190
 companies can order bowls to measure with the emblem of the company 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:30.900
 artists burn the design on wood or paint it 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.900
 or they make a combination of both 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.610
 the bowls receive a bath of non-toxic mineral oil 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.280
 This is a lot of wood and prevents dryness and breakage 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.039
 the oil also reveals the natural beauty of the texture of the wood 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.030
 and how each trunk is unique 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.520
 no two bowls are the same
