today's video I'm going to be showing
you<00:00:08.730> how<00:00:08.760> I<00:00:09.030> set<00:00:09.240> up<00:00:09.480> my<00:00:09.870> bikes<00:00:10.349> before<00:00:10.650> races

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280

you how I set up my bikes before races
I've<00:00:11.490> had<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.639> few<00:00:11.910> video<00:00:12.349> messages<00:00:13.349> from

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
I've had a few video messages from

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.189 
I've had a few video messages from
people<00:00:13.980> asking<00:00:14.219> me<00:00:14.549> what<00:00:14.820> sort<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:15.660> setups<00:00:16.109> I

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
people asking me what sort of setups I

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.750 
people asking me what sort of setups I
used<00:00:16.410> on<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.650> suspension<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.279> gear<00:00:17.460> in<00:00:17.609> on

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
used on the suspension and gear in on

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.359 
used on the suspension and gear in on
certain<00:00:18.090> bikes<00:00:18.449> for<00:00:19.380> Isis<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.189> thought

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
certain bikes for Isis and I thought

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.550 
certain bikes for Isis and I thought
it'd<00:00:20.460> be<00:00:20.520> good<00:00:20.730> just<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.029> make<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.270> video<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.960> how

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
it'd be good just to make a video of how

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.880 
it'd be good just to make a video of how
I<00:00:22.590> set<00:00:23.039> up<00:00:23.250> well<00:00:23.490> what<00:00:23.670> setup<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.330> use<00:00:24.359> and

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
I set up well what setup I use and

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.740 
I set up well what setup I use and
hopefully<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.340> may<00:00:26.490> may<00:00:26.939> work<00:00:27.150> for<00:00:27.359> you

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
hopefully it may may work for you

hopefully it may may work for you
I<00:00:27.779> mean<00:00:28.230> I'm<00:00:28.380> gonna<00:00:28.529> concentrate<00:00:28.890> on<00:00:29.310> I've

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
today I'm gonna do I'm going to use a

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.410 
today I'm gonna do I'm going to use a
the<00:00:52.980> CBR<00:00:53.309> thousand<00:00:53.850> but<00:00:53.969> we're<00:00:54.090> going<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.270> do

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
the CBR thousand but we're going to do

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.330 
the CBR thousand but we're going to do
on<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> short<00:00:54.899> track<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.379> this<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.860> setup<00:00:56.129> is

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
on a short track so this this setup is

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.580 
on a short track so this this setup is
going<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.550> be<00:00:56.670> purely<00:00:56.940> for<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.449> short<00:00:58.289> track

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
going to be purely for a short track

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.700 
going to be purely for a short track
setup<00:00:59.460> because<00:01:00.260> one<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> things<00:01:01.559> I've

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
setup because one of the things I've

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
setup because one of the things I've
noticed<00:01:01.739> for<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.219> setup

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
noticed for the setup

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.789 
noticed for the setup
obviously<00:01:03.300> when<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.019> adjust<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.559> gearing

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
obviously when you adjust the gearing

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.609 
obviously when you adjust the gearing
and<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.460> suspension<00:01:06.150> if<00:01:06.689> it's<00:01:06.900> on<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.020> track

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
and the suspension if it's on a track

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.250 
and the suspension if it's on a track
that's<00:01:07.799> got<00:01:07.979> loads<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.510> sharp<00:01:09.510> corners<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.170> it

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
that's got loads of sharp corners and it

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.630 
that's got loads of sharp corners and it
hasn't<00:01:10.409> got<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.650> lot<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.799> strikes<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.340> want<00:01:11.520> it

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
hasn't got a lot of strikes you want it

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.760 
hasn't got a lot of strikes you want it
to<00:01:12.030> have<00:01:12.119> purely<00:01:12.600> acceleration<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.500> it's<00:01:13.680> a

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
to have purely acceleration and it's a

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.830 
to have purely acceleration and it's a
handle<00:01:14.189> quite<00:01:14.369> well<00:01:14.580> round<00:01:15.119> tight<00:01:15.390> corners

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
handle quite well round tight corners

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.899 
handle quite well round tight corners
and<00:01:15.990> then<00:01:16.439> for<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.890> longer<00:01:17.189> tracks<00:01:17.460> obviously

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
and then for the longer tracks obviously

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.460 
and then for the longer tracks obviously
the<00:01:18.509> South<00:01:18.720> has<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.080> be<00:01:19.170> slightly<00:01:19.350> different

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
the South has to be slightly different

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.050 
the South has to be slightly different
obviously<00:01:19.860> because<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.250> want<00:01:20.430> more<00:01:20.580> top<00:01:20.820> end

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
obviously because you want more top end

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.200 
obviously because you want more top end
so<00:01:21.509> today's<00:01:22.500> video<00:01:22.650> I'm<00:01:22.950> gonna<00:01:23.040> show<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.310> the

this setup right let's check the race

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.410 
this setup right let's check the race
options<00:01:50.310> quick<00:01:50.520> please<00:01:50.700> make<00:01:51.090> sure<00:01:51.240> it's<00:01:51.390> on

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
options quick please make sure it's on

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.670 
options quick please make sure it's on
the<00:01:51.509> hardest<00:01:51.780> local<00:01:51.990> yep<00:01:52.200> it's<00:01:52.439> on<00:01:52.560> the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
the hardest local yep it's on the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.050 
the hardest local yep it's on the
hardest<00:01:52.979> level<00:01:53.100> realistic<00:01:53.790> that's<00:01:53.939> how<00:01:54.000> we

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
hardest level realistic that's how we

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.240 
hardest level realistic that's how we
like<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.240> pro<00:01:54.810> physics<00:01:55.259> yeah<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.799> love<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.189> on

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
like it pro physics yeah I love it on

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.639 
like it pro physics yeah I love it on
the<00:01:56.340> price<00:01:56.520> physics<00:01:57.299> right<00:01:58.079> let's<00:01:58.320> get<00:01:58.500> into

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
the price physics right let's get into

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.020 
the price physics right let's get into
this<00:01:58.770> setup<00:01:59.070> right<00:01:59.369> we'll<00:01:59.670> start<00:01:59.880> with<00:01:59.969> the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
this setup right we'll start with the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.399 
this setup right we'll start with the
gears<00:02:00.240> first<00:02:00.950> right<00:02:02.810> right<00:02:03.810> we<00:02:03.990> start<00:02:04.229> off<00:02:04.290> for

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
gears first right right we start off for

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.370 
gears first right right we start off for
the<00:02:04.500> final<00:02:04.680> ratio<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.280> always<00:02:05.700> lower<00:02:05.909> that

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
the final ratio I always lower that

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.710 
the final ratio I always lower that
first<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:07.619> we'll<00:02:07.770> bring<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:07.950> down<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.280> two

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
first so we'll bring that down to two

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.630 
first so we'll bring that down to two
first<00:02:09.720> gear

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
first gear

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.490 
first gear
I<00:02:10.729> bring<00:02:11.450> that<00:02:11.569> down<00:02:11.630> because<00:02:12.050> we<00:02:12.140> want<00:02:12.200> a<00:02:12.319> bit

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
I bring that down because we want a bit

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.610 
I bring that down because we want a bit
more<00:02:12.710> punching<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:13.460> bit<00:02:13.610> more<00:02:13.760> acceleration

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
more punching a bit more acceleration

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.949 
more punching a bit more acceleration
second<00:02:15.620> gear<00:02:15.740> third<00:02:15.950> gear<00:02:16.130> leave<00:02:16.880> and<00:02:17.240> fourth

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
second gear third gear leave and fourth

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.640 
second gear third gear leave and fourth
gear<00:02:18.200> I<00:02:18.440> leave<00:02:18.650> at<00:02:18.800> three<00:02:19.450> but<00:02:20.450> then<00:02:20.600> I<00:02:20.840> make

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
gear I leave at three but then I make

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.030 
gear I leave at three but then I make
fifth<00:02:21.980> gear<00:02:22.250> and<00:02:22.580> sit<00:02:23.510> gear<00:02:23.750> a<00:02:23.780> bit<00:02:23.930> longer<00:02:24.140> so

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
fifth gear and sit gear a bit longer so

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.610 
fifth gear and sit gear a bit longer so
that's<00:02:25.300> that's<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:26.600> setup<00:02:26.990> I<00:02:27.140> have<00:02:27.260> on<00:02:27.530> the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
that's that's the setup I have on the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.520 
that's that's the setup I have on the
gears<00:02:27.890> that<00:02:28.370> is<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:28.760> best<00:02:29.030> I<00:02:29.330> think<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:30.320> best

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
gears that is the best I think the best

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.980 
gears that is the best I think the best
setup<00:02:30.770> for<00:02:31.580> this<00:02:31.730> track<00:02:32.120> it's<00:02:32.630> not<00:02:32.780> going<00:02:32.930> to

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
setup for this track it's not going to

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.500 
setup for this track it's not going to
work<00:02:33.110> on<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.380> longer<00:02:33.650> tracks<00:02:33.890> this<00:02:34.040> is<00:02:34.190> purely

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
work on the longer tracks this is purely

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.770 
work on the longer tracks this is purely
for<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.630> maximum<00:02:36.080> acceleration<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:37.360> a<00:02:38.360> half

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
for the maximum acceleration and a half

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.780 
for the maximum acceleration and a half
decent<00:02:38.989> top-end<00:02:39.410> as<00:02:39.590> well<00:02:39.800> on<00:02:40.010> a<00:02:40.069> short<00:02:40.550> track

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
decent top-end as well on a short track

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.520 
decent top-end as well on a short track
so<00:02:41.000> that's<00:02:41.180> what<00:02:41.390> what<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:41.930> use<00:02:42.170> on<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.350> gear

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
so that's what what I use on the gear

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.290 
so that's what what I use on the gear
setup<00:02:42.800> right<00:02:43.130> let's<00:02:43.310> do<00:02:43.459> suspension<00:02:44.120> like

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
setup right let's do suspension like

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.410 
setup right let's do suspension like
this<00:02:44.480> confirm<00:02:45.350> most<00:02:45.620> changes<00:02:46.420> suspension

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
this confirm most changes suspension

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.920 
this confirm most changes suspension
right<00:02:47.980> well<00:02:48.980> that's<00:02:49.070> not<00:02:49.370> I<00:02:49.670> don't<00:02:50.420> change<00:02:50.720> it

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
right well that's not I don't change it

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.630 
right well that's not I don't change it
actually<00:02:51.200> I<00:02:51.230> don't<00:02:51.440> change<00:02:51.680> it<00:02:51.860> too<00:02:52.040> much<00:02:52.070> so

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
actually I don't change it too much so

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.940 
actually I don't change it too much so
basically<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.900> front<00:02:54.110> end<00:02:54.380> we<00:02:54.560> want<00:02:54.709> to<00:02:54.769> bring

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
basically the front end we want to bring

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.710 
basically the front end we want to bring
down<00:02:55.060> to<00:02:56.060> two<00:02:56.920> but<00:02:57.920> we<00:02:58.040> leave<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.510> rear<00:02:59.510> on

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
down to two but we leave the rear on

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.530 
down to two but we leave the rear on
three<00:03:00.080> because<00:03:00.380> often<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:00.980> was<00:03:01.070> about<00:03:01.190> right

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
three because often I was about right

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.660 
three because often I was about right
stiffness<00:03:02.540> I<00:03:02.780> want<00:03:03.080> to<00:03:03.140> bring<00:03:03.320> that<00:03:03.440> up<00:03:03.500> at<00:03:04.370> the

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
stiffness I want to bring that up at the

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.150 
stiffness I want to bring that up at the
front<00:03:04.910> and<00:03:05.120> back<00:03:05.360> so<00:03:06.230> we<00:03:06.350> want<00:03:06.530> it<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:06.709> bit<00:03:06.739> more

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
front and back so we want it a bit more

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.470 
front and back so we want it a bit more
precise<00:03:08.709> compressing<00:03:09.709> damping<00:03:10.220> I<00:03:10.489> bring<00:03:11.360> up

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
precise compressing damping I bring up

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.310 
precise compressing damping I bring up
yep<00:03:11.900> bring<00:03:12.380> that<00:03:12.590> up<00:03:12.709> again<00:03:13.060> but<00:03:14.060> that<00:03:14.390> makes<00:03:15.170> a

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
yep bring that up again but that makes a

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.920 
yep bring that up again but that makes a
hell<00:03:15.470> of<00:03:15.500> a<00:03:15.650> difference<00:03:16.070> if<00:03:16.310> you've<00:03:16.870> if<00:03:17.870> you've

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
hell of a difference if you've if you've

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.479 
hell of a difference if you've if you've
been<00:03:18.260> recruit<00:03:18.530> that<00:03:18.620> ones<00:03:18.860> before<00:03:19.010> it<00:03:19.190> makes<00:03:19.400> a

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
been recruit that ones before it makes a

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.120 
been recruit that ones before it makes a
hell<00:03:19.579> of<00:03:19.640> a<00:03:19.760> difference<00:03:19.910> if<00:03:20.360> it<00:03:21.350> does<00:03:21.560> go<00:03:22.100> into

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
hell of a difference if it does go into

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.180 
hell of a difference if it does go into
the<00:03:22.459> corners<00:03:22.790> a<00:03:22.910> lot<00:03:23.120> easier<00:03:23.630> and<00:03:24.190> rebound

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
the corners a lot easier and rebound

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.300 
the corners a lot easier and rebound
damping<00:03:25.670> I<00:03:26.390> think<00:03:27.200> get<00:03:27.410> on<00:03:27.590> this<00:03:27.739> setup<00:03:28.160> I

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
damping I think get on this setup I

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.460 
damping I think get on this setup I
leave<00:03:28.549> that<00:03:28.730> I<00:03:28.790> believe<00:03:29.450> that<00:03:29.630> as<00:03:29.750> it<00:03:29.900> is<00:03:29.930> that

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
leave that I believe that as it is that

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.259 
leave that I believe that as it is that
see<00:03:30.709> there's<00:03:30.920> not<00:03:31.070> that<00:03:31.250> many<00:03:31.430> changes<00:03:32.000> on<00:03:32.150> the

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
see there's not that many changes on the

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.210 
see there's not that many changes on the
short<00:03:32.510> track<00:03:32.690> I<00:03:33.019> think<00:03:33.170> I<00:03:33.530> do<00:03:33.709> tend<00:03:33.950> to<00:03:34.010> change

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
short track I think I do tend to change

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.650 
short track I think I do tend to change
it<00:03:34.489> a<00:03:34.549> lot<00:03:34.670> more<00:03:34.850> on<00:03:34.970> that<00:03:35.060> on<00:03:35.239> the<00:03:35.390> longer

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
it a lot more on that on the longer

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.199 
it a lot more on that on the longer
tracks<00:03:35.900> but<00:03:36.530> but<00:03:37.100> this<00:03:37.250> one<00:03:37.489> that<00:03:37.790> that's<00:03:38.060> all

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
tracks but but this one that that's all

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.960 
tracks but but this one that that's all
the<00:03:38.299> setup<00:03:38.570> I<00:03:38.930> change<00:03:39.350> really<00:03:39.590> so<00:03:40.130> hopefully

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
the setup I change really so hopefully

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.640 
the setup I change really so hopefully
you'll<00:03:41.120> give<00:03:41.269> this<00:03:41.390> a<00:03:41.450> try<00:03:41.720> and<00:03:42.079> it<00:03:42.380> will<00:03:42.500> work

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
you'll give this a try and it will work

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.710 
you'll give this a try and it will work
for<00:03:42.829> you<00:03:42.920> right<00:03:43.220> this<00:03:43.400> let's<00:03:44.150> confirm<00:03:44.450> most

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
for you right this let's confirm most

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.880 
for you right this let's confirm most

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
changes right right that's going to the

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.220 
changes right right that's going to the
rice<00:03:49.040> and<00:03:49.370> see<00:03:50.239> it<00:03:50.329> and<00:03:50.480> let<00:03:50.660> me<00:03:50.720> show<00:03:51.019> you<00:03:51.079> how

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
this out works on this bike it's really

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.310 
this out works on this bike it's really
push<00:03:55.700> it<00:03:55.850> to<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.000> max<00:03:56.120> and<00:03:56.510> show<00:03:56.810> you<00:03:56.870> how<00:03:57.079> well

push it to the max and show you how well
it<00:03:57.440> goes

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
it goes

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.589 
it goes
we<00:03:59.099> really<00:03:59.459> push<00:03:59.700> it<00:03:59.849> as<00:04:00.000> much<00:04:00.209> as<00:04:00.360> I<00:04:00.450> can

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.619 

and<00:04:04.079> get<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.290> best<00:04:04.439> out<00:04:04.620> this<00:04:04.799> bike<00:04:05.010> right

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
and get the best out this bike right

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.410 
and get the best out this bike right
really<00:04:07.340> go<00:04:08.340> fast<00:04:08.549> in<00:04:08.790> his<00:04:08.849> first<00:04:09.090> couple<00:04:09.390> of

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
really go fast in his first couple of

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.510 
really go fast in his first couple of
corners

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.229 

and<00:04:12.640> was<00:04:12.820> really<00:04:13.090> well<00:04:13.240> around<00:04:13.330> these<00:04:13.630> babies

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.080 

right<00:04:17.780> you<00:04:17.870> can<00:04:17.959> get<00:04:18.109> really<00:04:18.530> really<00:04:19.130> tight<00:04:19.940> in

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
right you can get really really tight in

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.999 
right you can get really really tight in
sis<00:04:20.269> corner<00:04:20.600> and<00:04:20.720> just<00:04:20.780> put<00:04:21.139> the<00:04:21.229> power<00:04:21.470> on<00:04:21.560> it

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:22.009 
sis corner and just put the power on it

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.779 
sis corner and just put the power on it
don't<00:04:22.729> weigh<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.449> back<00:04:23.630> end<00:04:23.900> holds<00:04:24.789> and

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
don't weigh the the back end holds and

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:26.860 
don't weigh the the back end holds and
we've<00:04:26.000> got<00:04:26.150> the<00:04:26.210> advantage<00:04:26.300> on<00:04:26.780> the

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
we've got the advantage on the

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.740 
we've got the advantage on the
acceleration<00:04:27.319> out<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:27.740> other<00:04:27.860> bytes<00:04:28.130> as<00:04:28.310> well

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
acceleration out the other bytes as well

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.450 
acceleration out the other bytes as well
with<00:04:29.750> the<00:04:29.840> gearing<00:04:30.050> change<00:04:30.410> as<00:04:30.560> well<00:04:30.770> so<00:04:31.370> we

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
with the gearing change as well so we

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.140 
with the gearing change as well so we
should<00:04:31.669> catch<00:04:31.849> these<00:04:32.030> up<00:04:32.210> quite<00:04:32.479> quickly<00:04:34.150> on

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
should catch these up quite quickly on

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:42.339 
should catch these up quite quickly on
this<00:04:35.330> section

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:42.349 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:44.079 

what<00:04:42.830> should<00:04:43.129> you<00:04:43.159> have<00:04:43.399> to<00:04:43.520> type<00:04:43.729> things<00:04:43.879> on

00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:44.089 
what should you have to type things on

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:49.740 
what should you have to type things on
this<00:04:44.210> corner<00:04:44.599> here

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.330 

just<00:04:50.750> keep<00:04:51.110> cracking<00:04:51.410> that<00:04:51.650> power<00:04:51.920> on<00:04:52.070> as<00:04:52.190> soon

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
just keep cracking that power on as soon

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:59.440 
just keep cracking that power on as soon
as<00:04:52.400> you<00:04:52.580> get<00:04:53.740> get<00:04:54.740> down<00:04:54.770> live

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.680 

get<00:05:00.050> that<00:05:00.140> power<00:05:00.380> nerely<00:05:01.390> accelerates<00:05:02.390> so

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
get that power nerely accelerates so

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.750 
get that power nerely accelerates so
well<00:05:02.930> and<00:05:03.470> you<00:05:03.740> and<00:05:04.160> you<00:05:04.250> seem<00:05:04.460> to<00:05:04.550> have<00:05:04.670> the

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
well and you and you seem to have the

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.990 
well and you and you seem to have the
grip<00:05:05.000> on<00:05:05.150> this<00:05:05.300> out<00:05:06.490> right<00:05:07.490> we<00:05:07.700> should<00:05:07.850> be<00:05:07.880> able

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
grip on this out right we should be able

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.400 
grip on this out right we should be able
to<00:05:08.090> set<00:05:08.300> these<00:05:08.390> corners<00:05:08.750> a<00:05:08.780> bit<00:05:08.960> quicker<00:05:09.200> now

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
to set these corners a bit quicker now

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:22.469 
to set these corners a bit quicker now
now<00:05:10.190> we've<00:05:10.280> got<00:05:10.400> no<00:05:10.490> one<00:05:10.580> in<00:05:10.700> front<00:05:10.850> of<00:05:10.940> us

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.310 

get<00:05:23.110> really<00:05:23.439> live

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.640 

crack<00:05:27.320> manpower<00:05:27.740> and<00:05:27.919> again

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.409 

I<00:05:30.710> believe<00:05:31.400> we<00:05:31.460> can<00:05:31.490> start<00:05:31.850> gapping<00:05:32.270> the

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:32.419 
I believe we can start gapping the

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:39.659 
I believe we can start gapping the
others<00:05:32.720> behind<00:05:32.990> this

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.950 

pull<00:05:40.150> power<00:05:40.419> through<00:05:40.870> this<00:05:40.960> section

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.659 

yeah<00:05:44.530> we're<00:05:44.770> leaking<00:05:44.919> them<00:05:45.130> a<00:05:45.220> lot<00:05:45.340> behind

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
yeah we're leaking them a lot behind

00:05:45.669 --> 00:06:10.230 
yeah we're leaking them a lot behind
which<00:05:46.060> is<00:05:46.210> good

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:17.290 

so<00:06:10.780> far<00:06:11.020> so<00:06:11.259> good

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.839 

keep<00:06:17.930> that<00:06:18.080> power<00:06:18.409> down<00:06:18.650> it<00:06:19.159> turns<00:06:19.550> quite

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:19.849 
keep that power down it turns quite

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:21.990 
keep that power down it turns quite
quite<00:06:20.389> well<00:06:20.419> for<00:06:20.900> one<00:06:21.050> side<00:06:21.319> to<00:06:21.470> the<00:06:21.530> other

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
quite well for one side to the other

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.080 
quite well for one side to the other
even<00:06:23.000> under<00:06:23.449> full<00:06:23.629> power<00:06:23.659> right<00:06:24.699> get<00:06:25.699> down<00:06:25.849> low

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
even under full power right get down low

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:31.899 
even under full power right get down low
again<00:06:28.599> soon<00:06:29.599> as<00:06:29.720> you<00:06:29.840> get<00:06:30.020> it<00:06:30.830> turning<00:06:31.280> in<00:06:31.400> just

00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:31.909 
again soon as you get it turning in just

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:38.110 
again soon as you get it turning in just
slap<00:06:32.240> that<00:06:32.389> cow<00:06:32.599> on<00:06:32.780> the<00:06:32.810> game

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.120 

and<00:06:38.600> this<00:06:38.810> is<00:06:38.930> on<00:06:39.080> the<00:06:39.199> hardest<00:06:39.560> level<00:06:39.770> at<00:06:40.040> the

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130 
and this is on the hardest level at the

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.510 
and this is on the hardest level at the
moment<00:06:41.139> and<00:06:42.139> we're<00:06:42.290> absolutely<00:06:42.410> no<00:06:43.070> light<00:06:43.370> in

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 
moment and we're absolutely no light in

00:06:43.520 --> 00:07:13.520 
moment and we're absolutely no light in
the<00:06:43.580> field

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:13.530 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:17.630 

head<00:07:14.130> down<00:07:14.370> and<00:07:14.640> there<00:07:14.940> you<00:07:15.030> go<00:07:15.320> victory<00:07:16.640> and

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:17.640 
head down and there you go victory and

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.060 
head down and there you go victory and
that's<00:07:17.910> how<00:07:18.120> you<00:07:18.180> do<00:07:18.450> it<00:07:18.600> with<00:07:19.110> that<00:07:19.260> setup<00:07:19.590> I

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:20.070 
that's how you do it with that setup I

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:21.950 
that's how you do it with that setup I
mean<00:07:20.790> you<00:07:20.880> could<00:07:21.000> probably<00:07:21.150> do<00:07:21.360> a<00:07:21.390> bit<00:07:21.570> quicker

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:21.960 
mean you could probably do a bit quicker

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.090 
mean you could probably do a bit quicker
I<00:07:21.990> mean<00:07:22.230> some<00:07:22.380> of<00:07:22.410> the<00:07:22.530> corners<00:07:22.800> I<00:07:22.920> didn't

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:23.100 
I mean some of the corners I didn't

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.340 
I mean some of the corners I didn't
break<00:07:23.280> early<00:07:23.610> enough<00:07:23.820> on<00:07:24.060> but<00:07:24.630> that<00:07:25.050> is<00:07:25.200> the

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:25.350 
break early enough on but that is the

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.560 
break early enough on but that is the
best<00:07:25.590> setup<00:07:25.920> for<00:07:26.310> that<00:07:26.340> bike<00:07:26.700> on<00:07:27.000> that<00:07:27.270> track

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:27.570 
best setup for that bike on that track

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:31.730 
best setup for that bike on that track
