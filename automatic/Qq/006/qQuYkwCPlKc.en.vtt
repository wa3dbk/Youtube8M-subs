we come around do up the rear velcro
strap<00:01:06.060> first<00:01:07.009> and<00:01:08.009> I<00:01:08.100> can<00:01:08.130> see<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.580> there's

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
strap first and I can see that there's

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.540 
strap first and I can see that there's
contact<00:01:09.180> all<00:01:09.660> the<00:01:09.720> way<00:01:10.020> around<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:11.130> back<00:01:11.280> here

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
contact all the way around the back here

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.650 
contact all the way around the back here
but<00:01:11.700> there's<00:01:11.850> also<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.060> little<00:01:12.119> bit<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.479> gap

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.660 
but there's also a little bit of a gap

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.840 
but there's also a little bit of a gap
so<00:01:12.960> it's<00:01:13.200> nice<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.380> flexible<00:01:13.800> that's<00:01:14.670> going

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
so it's nice and flexible that's going

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.180 
so it's nice and flexible that's going
to<00:01:14.910> really<00:01:15.060> flex<00:01:15.300> with<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.539> horses<00:01:15.840> movement

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
to really flex with the horses movement

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.330 
to really flex with the horses movement
and<00:01:17.190> I'm<00:01:17.310> going<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.520> take<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.850> front<00:01:18.030> velcro

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
and I'm going to take the front velcro

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.760 
and I'm going to take the front velcro
put<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.430> through<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.760> hook<00:01:21.470> keep<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.590> nice<00:01:22.740> and

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
put it through the hook keep it nice and

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.520 
put it through the hook keep it nice and
tight<00:01:23.330> and<00:01:24.330> all<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.750> way<00:01:24.840> across<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.290> front

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
tight and all the way across the front

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.920 
tight and all the way across the front
so<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:25.860> makes<00:01:26.430> contact<00:01:26.850> with<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.689> velcro

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
so this makes contact with the velcro

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.539 
so this makes contact with the velcro
all<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.409> way<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.740> end<00:01:28.830> of<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.950> strap<00:01:29.220> and

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
all the way to the end of the strap and

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.530 
all the way to the end of the strap and
then<00:01:30.390> last<00:01:30.960> stage<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.619> pull<00:01:31.830> the<00:01:31.979> keeper

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
then last stage is to pull the keeper

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.070 
then last stage is to pull the keeper
across<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.750> front<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.439> velcro<00:01:35.450> so<00:01:36.450> just

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
across the front of the velcro so just

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.510 
across the front of the velcro so just
to<00:01:37.170> double-check<00:01:37.470> I'm<00:01:37.830> making<00:01:38.100> sure<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
to double-check I'm making sure that the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.940 
to double-check I'm making sure that the
rear<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.570> boot<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.110> behind<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.650> front

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
rear of the boot is behind the front

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.760 
rear of the boot is behind the front
flaps<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.729> boot<00:01:41.909> there's<00:01:42.780> contact<00:01:43.259> all
