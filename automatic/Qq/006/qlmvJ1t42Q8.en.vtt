when you squeeze it but the moisture

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.789 
when you squeeze it but the moisture
allows<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.840> worms<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.290> breathe<00:01:04.559> through

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799

their<00:01:04.890> skin<00:01:05.720> it's<00:01:06.720> not<00:01:06.990> complicated

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
their skin it's not complicated

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.179 
their skin it's not complicated
it's<00:01:08.580> very<00:01:08.909> useful<00:01:09.390> it's<00:01:09.960> easy<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.470> do<00:01:10.619> there's

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
it's very useful it's easy to do there's

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.719 
it's very useful it's easy to do there's
to<00:01:11.520> these<00:01:11.760> Rubbermaid<00:01:12.330> bins<00:01:12.360> in<00:01:12.840> here<00:01:13.729> there's

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
to these Rubbermaid bins in here there's

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.520 
to these Rubbermaid bins in here there's
only<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:15.060> couple<00:01:15.420> steps<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.930> performing<00:01:16.409> this

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
only a couple steps to performing this

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.520 
only a couple steps to performing this
the<00:01:17.189> first<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.729> actually<00:01:18.509> drilling<00:01:19.259> some

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
the first is actually drilling some

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.800 
the first is actually drilling some
holes<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.220> bottom<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.939> Orban<00:01:21.600> to

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
holes in the bottom of the Orban to

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.700 
holes in the bottom of the Orban to
allow<00:01:22.110> proper<00:01:23.659> drainage<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.960> water<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.590> other

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
allow proper drainage of water and other

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.789 
allow proper drainage of water and other
liquids<00:01:26.009> as<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.060> food<00:01:27.299> breaks<00:01:27.600> down<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:28.740> it

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
liquids as the food breaks down so it

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.649 
liquids as the food breaks down so it
doesn't<00:01:29.159> create<00:01:29.340> an<00:01:29.520> anaerobic<00:01:29.970> condition

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
doesn't create an anaerobic condition

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.660 
doesn't create an anaerobic condition
which<00:01:30.840> then<00:01:31.320> will<00:01:31.500> kill<00:01:31.740> your<00:01:31.860> worms

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
which then will kill your worms

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.730 
which then will kill your worms
and<00:01:32.940> then<00:01:33.330> the<00:01:33.480> second<00:01:33.870> is<00:01:33.960> putting<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.380> hole<00:01:34.590> in

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
and then the second is putting a hole in

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.170 
and then the second is putting a hole in
the<00:01:34.830> top<00:01:35.070> or<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.820> sides<00:01:37.520> and<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.790> third<00:01:39.030> is

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
the top or the sides and the third is

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.780 
the top or the sides and the third is
filling<00:01:39.510> it<00:01:39.600> up<00:01:39.690> so<00:01:40.620> let's<00:01:41.010> get<00:01:41.160> started

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
filling it up so let's get started

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.390 
filling it up so let's get started
I'll<00:01:41.880> show<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.510> exactly<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.800> materials<00:01:44.310> I

have<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.729> dremel<00:02:06.119> tool<00:02:06.300> here<00:02:06.740> fitted<00:02:07.740> with<00:02:08.100> a

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
have a dremel tool here fitted with a

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.930 
have a dremel tool here fitted with a
cutter<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:10.229> little<00:02:11.040> piece<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.280> screen<00:02:11.760> and

cutter it a little piece of screen and

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.870 
cutter it a little piece of screen and
then<00:02:12.750> my<00:02:13.580> handheld<00:02:14.580> drill<00:02:15.060> with<00:02:15.510> a<00:02:15.540> 1/8<00:02:16.290> inch

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
then my handheld drill with a 1/8 inch

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.320 
then my handheld drill with a 1/8 inch
drill<00:02:17.880> bit<00:02:17.940> in<00:02:18.270> it<00:02:19.400> well<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.550> first<00:02:20.790> step<00:02:21.030> is

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
drill bit in it well the first step is

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.860 
drill bit in it well the first step is
you<00:02:21.390> want<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:22.140> drill<00:02:22.380> some<00:02:22.590> holes<00:02:22.650> in<00:02:23.250> your<00:02:23.870> bin

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
you want to drill some holes in your bin

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.470 
you want to drill some holes in your bin
I<00:02:25.140> usually<00:02:26.040> try<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.370> go<00:02:26.489> in<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.730> lower<00:02:26.940> areas

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
I usually try and go in the lower areas

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.690 
I usually try and go in the lower areas
where<00:02:27.780> there's<00:02:27.989> recess<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:28.830> if<00:02:28.890> there<00:02:29.070> are<00:02:29.370> is

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
where there's recess so if there are is

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.210 
where there's recess so if there are is
there<00:02:30.510> is<00:02:30.690> any<00:02:30.959> liquid<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.530> pulls<00:02:31.770> up<00:02:32.010> you

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
there is any liquid that pulls up you

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.840 
there is any liquid that pulls up you
can<00:02:32.400> easily<00:02:32.730> drain<00:02:33.239> out<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.170> put<00:02:35.040> maybe

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
can easily drain out and I put maybe

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.870 
can easily drain out and I put maybe
three<00:02:36.300> holes<00:02:36.630> on<00:02:36.870> each<00:02:37.320> end<00:02:37.680> here<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.250> then<00:02:38.310> on

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
three holes on each end here and then on

00:02:38.880 --> 00:03:04.100 
three holes on each end here and then on
opposite<00:02:39.390> ends<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:39.780> then<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:39.900> couple<00:03:03.110> all

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
opposite ends and then a couple all

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.850 
opposite ends and then a couple all
right<00:03:04.230> I'll<00:03:04.500> do<00:03:04.709> it

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
right I'll do it

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.229 
right I'll do it
just<00:03:05.519> clean<00:03:05.970> them<00:03:06.060> out<00:03:06.239> a<00:03:06.269> little<00:03:06.480> bit<00:03:08.239> okay

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
just clean them out a little bit okay

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.289 
just clean them out a little bit okay
now<00:03:10.019> comes<00:03:10.830> next<00:03:11.160> step<00:03:11.459> which<00:03:11.670> is<00:03:11.700> preparing

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
now comes next step which is preparing

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.320 
now comes next step which is preparing
the<00:03:12.570> lid<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:13.049> the<00:03:13.080> bin<00:03:13.410> and<00:03:13.850> in<00:03:14.850> this<00:03:15.060> case

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
the lid of the bin and in this case

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.280 
the lid of the bin and in this case
we're<00:03:15.660> inside<00:03:16.049> my<00:03:16.230> workshop<00:03:16.769> and<00:03:17.540> I<00:03:18.540> have<00:03:19.110> the

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
we're inside my workshop and I have the

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.280 
we're inside my workshop and I have the
lid<00:03:19.500> here<00:03:19.890> as<00:03:20.040> you<00:03:20.580> can<00:03:20.790> see<00:03:21.000> I've<00:03:21.480> cut<00:03:21.810> out<00:03:22.049> a

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
lid here as you can see I've cut out a

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.710 
lid here as you can see I've cut out a
little<00:03:22.709> square<00:03:22.950> area<00:03:23.370> I<00:03:23.580> like<00:03:24.269> to<00:03:24.390> put<00:03:24.570> it<00:03:24.660> in

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
little square area I like to put it in

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.650 
little square area I like to put it in
the<00:03:24.810> center<00:03:25.110> of<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.350> bin<00:03:25.530> that<00:03:26.519> way<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:27.480> can

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
the center of the bin that way you can

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.479 
the center of the bin that way you can
stack<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.290> bins<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:28.769> it<00:03:28.890> doesn't<00:03:29.220> interfere

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
stack the bins and it doesn't interfere

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.190 
stack the bins and it doesn't interfere
too<00:03:29.910> much<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.780> functionality<00:03:31.530> of<00:03:31.620> them<00:03:33.200> this

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
too much the functionality of them this

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.050 
too much the functionality of them this
is<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.829> marking<00:03:35.340> that<00:03:35.519> I'm<00:03:35.640> going<00:03:35.820> to<00:03:35.910> follow

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
is the marking that I'm going to follow

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.470 
is the marking that I'm going to follow
with<00:03:36.360> the<00:03:36.450> dremel<00:03:36.840> tool<00:03:37.079> and<00:03:37.380> cut<00:03:38.340> along<00:03:39.060> lines

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
with the dremel tool and cut along lines

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.110 
with the dremel tool and cut along lines
I<00:03:39.900> won't<00:03:40.230> record<00:03:40.620> that<00:03:40.860> because<00:03:41.280> I<00:03:41.640> don't<00:03:41.970> want

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
I won't record that because I don't want

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.970 
I won't record that because I don't want
to<00:03:42.209> chop<00:03:42.510> my<00:03:42.690> finger<00:03:43.020> off<00:03:43.200> on<00:03:43.440> film<00:03:43.770> or

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
to chop my finger off on film or

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.729 
to chop my finger off on film or
anything<00:03:44.190> but

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
anything but

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.680 
anything but
you<00:03:46.739> can<00:03:46.920> do<00:03:47.040> it<00:03:47.160> this<00:03:47.310> way<00:03:47.370> if<00:03:47.819> you<00:03:48.120> prefer<00:03:48.480> not

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
you can do it this way if you prefer not

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.470 
you can do it this way if you prefer not
to<00:03:48.720> have<00:03:49.050> the<00:03:49.260> screen<00:03:49.580> you<00:03:50.580> can<00:03:50.790> drill<00:03:51.180> holes

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
to have the screen you can drill holes

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.240 
to have the screen you can drill holes
in<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.959> edge<00:03:52.200> of<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:53.489> side<00:03:53.790> of<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.180> bin

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
in the edge of the side of the bin

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.670 
in the edge of the side of the bin
sample<00:03:56.250> is<00:03:56.550> right<00:03:56.819> here<00:03:57.209> it<00:03:57.810> provides<00:03:58.379> air

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
sample is right here it provides air

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.160 
sample is right here it provides air
holes<00:03:58.920> form<00:03:59.310> so<00:03:59.730> oxygen<00:04:00.300> can<00:04:00.599> get<00:04:00.750> into<00:04:01.050> your

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
holes form so oxygen can get into your

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.830 
holes form so oxygen can get into your
worms<00:04:01.379> and<00:04:01.880> it's<00:04:02.880> a<00:04:03.120> little<00:04:03.330> less<00:04:03.510> complicated

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
worms and it's a little less complicated

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.360 
worms and it's a little less complicated
I<00:04:04.500> prefer<00:04:05.250> this<00:04:06.230> manner<00:04:07.230> because<00:04:07.800> you<00:04:07.980> can<00:04:08.160> use

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
I prefer this manner because you can use

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.490 
I prefer this manner because you can use
light<00:04:09.090> to<00:04:09.959> control<00:04:10.380> your<00:04:10.560> worms<00:04:10.769> worms<00:04:11.280> have

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
light to control your worms worms have

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.780 
light to control your worms worms have
photoreceptive<00:04:13.500> cells<00:04:13.530> on<00:04:14.099> them<00:04:14.250> they<00:04:14.549> don't

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
photoreceptive cells on them they don't

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.629 
photoreceptive cells on them they don't
have<00:04:14.940> eyes<00:04:15.180> but<00:04:15.480> they<00:04:15.599> can't<00:04:15.840> stand<00:04:16.109> light<00:04:16.639> so

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
have eyes but they can't stand light so

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.379 
have eyes but they can't stand light so
you<00:04:17.850> can<00:04:18.030> use<00:04:18.209> those<00:04:18.570> guys<00:04:18.840> too<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:20.130> light

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
you can use those guys too the light

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.330 
you can use those guys too the light
that<00:04:21.389> comes<00:04:21.630> through<00:04:21.810> this<00:04:22.139> area<00:04:22.560> to<00:04:23.130> keep

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
that comes through this area to keep

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.430 
that comes through this area to keep
them<00:04:23.580> in<00:04:23.700> the<00:04:23.820> bin<00:04:24.030> where<00:04:24.300> you<00:04:24.479> want<00:04:24.720> them<00:04:24.900> so

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
them in the bin where you want them so

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.950 
them in the bin where you want them so

old broken screen you can also use cloth

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.650 
old broken screen you can also use cloth
if<00:04:53.910> you'd<00:04:54.060> like<00:04:55.010> and<00:04:56.010> it<00:04:56.460> overlaps<00:04:57.180> a<00:04:57.419> little

okay<00:05:17.710> we're<00:05:18.100> outside<00:05:18.580> again<00:05:18.910> and<00:05:19.230> as<00:05:20.230> you<00:05:20.440> can

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
okay we're outside again and as you can

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.129 
okay we're outside again and as you can
see<00:05:20.620> here's<00:05:21.130> the<00:05:21.310> lid<00:05:21.520> the<00:05:22.210> screen<00:05:22.540> is<00:05:22.720> fixed

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
see here's the lid the screen is fixed

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:25.310 
see here's the lid the screen is fixed
in

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
in

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.650 
in
so<00:05:26.320> last<00:05:27.100> step<00:05:27.340> is<00:05:28.030> to<00:05:28.360> put<00:05:28.540> everything

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
so last step is to put everything

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.350 
so last step is to put everything
together<00:05:29.110> so<00:05:30.100> we<00:05:30.280> take<00:05:30.460> the<00:05:30.670> bin<00:05:30.850> that<00:05:30.880> has<00:05:31.180> all

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
together so we take the bin that has all

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.070 
together so we take the bin that has all
the<00:05:31.510> holes<00:05:31.690> in<00:05:31.960> it<00:05:32.190> and<00:05:33.240> place<00:05:34.240> it<00:05:34.480> inside<00:05:34.660> this

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
the holes in it and place it inside this

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.860 
the holes in it and place it inside this
bin<00:05:35.350> but<00:05:35.740> before<00:05:36.130> doing<00:05:36.250> so<00:05:36.640> I<00:05:37.000> usually<00:05:37.540> add

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
bin but before doing so I usually add

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.910 
bin but before doing so I usually add
some<00:05:38.170> spacers<00:05:38.710> e<00:05:38.980> two<00:05:39.790> by<00:05:39.970> fours<00:05:40.920> pebbles

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:41.920 
some spacers e two by fours pebbles

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.740 
some spacers e two by fours pebbles
rocks<00:05:42.310> something<00:05:42.940> like<00:05:43.060> that<00:05:43.270> to<00:05:43.420> give<00:05:43.570> it<00:05:43.690> a

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
rocks something like that to give it a

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.670 
rocks something like that to give it a
little<00:05:43.870> space<00:05:44.430> set<00:05:45.430> that<00:05:45.610> in<00:05:45.730> the<00:05:45.820> bottom<00:05:46.030> and

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
little space set that in the bottom and

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.250 
little space set that in the bottom and
then<00:05:47.680> you<00:05:47.710> place<00:05:48.010> the<00:05:48.220> other<00:05:48.400> guy<00:05:48.610> in<00:05:48.880> and<00:05:49.780> then

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260 
then you place the other guy in and then

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.660 
then you place the other guy in and then
you'll<00:05:50.440> notice<00:05:50.650> that<00:05:50.980> there's<00:05:51.190> more<00:05:51.490> of<00:05:51.580> a

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:51.670 
you'll notice that there's more of a

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.550 
you'll notice that there's more of a
space<00:05:51.970> here<00:05:52.300> and<00:05:52.420> that<00:05:52.570> allows<00:05:52.780> some<00:05:53.080> oxygen

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
space here and that allows some oxygen

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.010 
space here and that allows some oxygen
to<00:05:53.650> get<00:05:53.890> in<00:05:54.040> this<00:05:54.250> way<00:05:54.520> and<00:05:55.030> also<00:05:55.510> see<00:05:55.900> your

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
to get in this way and also see your

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.050 
to get in this way and also see your
bins<00:05:56.230> don't<00:05:56.530> bind<00:05:56.920> together<00:05:57.190> and<00:05:57.580> make<00:05:57.820> it<00:05:58.000> a

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
bins don't bind together and make it a

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.590 
bins don't bind together and make it a
pain<00:05:58.300> to<00:05:58.510> pull<00:05:58.720> them<00:05:58.870> apart<00:06:00.240> and<00:06:01.240> then<00:06:01.300> of

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
pain to pull them apart and then of

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.390 
pain to pull them apart and then of
course<00:06:01.630> place<00:06:02.200> the<00:06:02.350> top<00:06:04.860> once<00:06:05.860> that's<00:06:06.130> done

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
course place the top once that's done

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.160 
course place the top once that's done
well<00:06:06.670> you're<00:06:07.330> going<00:06:07.480> to<00:06:07.540> want<00:06:07.720> to<00:06:07.810> fill<00:06:08.050> your

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570 
bin up so that you can actually get your

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.940 
bin up so that you can actually get your
worm<00:06:10.810> filling<00:06:11.730> and<00:06:12.730> that's<00:06:12.910> what<00:06:13.210> this<00:06:13.330> guy
