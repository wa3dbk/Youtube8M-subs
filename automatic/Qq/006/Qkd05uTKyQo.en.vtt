00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 Talk to me, all right. Look, I set out to 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.340
 make a joke here I see that 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.099
 there are many people who have difficulty 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.130
 use the car bluetooth system 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.160
 but he has in the car and he does not use it because he does not 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.670
 knows and not for that look to know how 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.720
 finally my proposal is every car 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.119
 that I enter 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.420
 I'll do it, I'll go to bluetooth 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.160
 or connect my phone and I will use the 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.040
 first video obviously my car 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.200
 day-to-day use case 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:38.239
 theoretically I know more obviously than 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.399
 I've already moved the media with this and you do not have a 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.760
 ease in using this system the 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.410
 other cars I will not be training 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.430
 stirring before discovering I'll find out 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.440
 with you 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.230
 So the idea is to discover 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.550
 you that is easy to understand it's just you was 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.010
 there you play 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.250
 go there and then try to look at my cell phone 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.859
 here I'll put the camera is turned 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.570
 right on the device, I hope you 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.659

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.130

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.250
 I'm recording alone 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.500

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.909

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.240
 Do not warn me, you will not even 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.600
 Yes, I'll go back to the menu ok. 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.250

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.490

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.340
 I have a browser that is neo map 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.280

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:31.230
 testing before even the praiseworthy 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:35.520
 after the head we talk 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:39.570
 ends up in order to continue the conversation 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.940
 so, welcome, we just got married 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:46.230
 the phone on youtube of the car that was 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:50.670
 to show that it works here because 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:53.130
 not want to see kaka and of which chile 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:56.820
 For the seventh time then it's okay, okay? 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:05:01.560
 body and felt kiss 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:03.420
 hello it's easy, it's simple odorless there I go 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.430
 download here what has entered bluetooth 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.900
 He starts reading everything he has on his cell phone. 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.910
 You have to be careful, do not you? 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.040
 It has something that you can not let go 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.450
 everybody in the car hears you have to 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.850
 click and take 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.640
 so let's assume I do not want the 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:21.180
 person listen to what I 'm talking about when 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:23.310
 is in I call on my cell I 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.740
 I call on the phone and I'll turn it off. 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.500
 You come in without speakerphone, he left one 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.080
 Also on the device can you order 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.670
 so that it gets out of the bluetooth of the car 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.730
 he goes back to his cell phone 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:37.800
 I hope you understood that. 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.230
 the first car and I said several 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.620
 others and I'll show you all 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.620
