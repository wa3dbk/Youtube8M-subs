up less than the other strings like I've
pretty<00:01:11.670> much<00:01:11.760> got<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.210> ideal<00:01:12.450> position

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
pretty much got it in the ideal position

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.929 
pretty much got it in the ideal position
for<00:01:12.869> myself<00:01:13.350> but<00:01:15.470> like<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.830> had<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> certain<00:01:17.759> way

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
for myself but like I had a certain way

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.890 
for myself but like I had a certain way
earlier<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:19.070> the<00:01:20.070> high<00:01:20.610> E<00:01:20.640> string<00:01:20.900> wasn't

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
earlier and the high E string wasn't

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.270 
earlier and the high E string wasn't
getting<00:01:22.080> picked<00:01:22.290> up<00:01:22.380> as<00:01:22.470> well<00:01:22.619> as<00:01:22.710> say<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.920> D

let's<00:01:25.470> look<00:01:25.590> out<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.890> case<00:01:26.010> right<00:01:26.190> now

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
let's look out of the case right now

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.200 
let's look out of the case right now
really<00:01:28.830> no<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.460> don't<00:01:29.700> know<00:01:29.790> if<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:29.970> can<00:01:30.060> hear

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
really no I don't know if you can hear

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.510 
really no I don't know if you can hear
with<00:01:30.299> my<00:01:30.390> laptop<00:01:30.780> but<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.950> sound<00:01:32.190> is<00:01:32.250> pretty

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
with my laptop but the sound is pretty

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.580 
with my laptop but the sound is pretty
good<00:01:32.640> pretty<00:01:32.909> different<00:01:33.299> now

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
good pretty different now

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.620 
good pretty different now
that<00:01:35.040> goes<00:01:35.250> for<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.790> outer<00:01:35.940> streams<00:01:36.299> well<00:01:36.479> see

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
that goes for the outer streams well see

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.539 
that goes for the outer streams well see
the<00:01:36.750> inner<00:01:36.869> strings<00:01:37.170> are<00:01:37.350> almost<00:01:37.799> always<00:01:38.009> loud

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
the inner strings are almost always loud

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.310 
the inner strings are almost always loud
and<00:01:38.790> perfect<00:01:39.150> but<00:01:39.420> depending<00:01:40.200> on<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
and perfect but depending on the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.450 
and perfect but depending on the
placement<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.800> pickup<00:01:41.040> like<00:01:41.190> I<00:01:41.280> said

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
placement of the pickup like I said

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.639 
placement of the pickup like I said
earlier<00:01:41.759> um<00:01:42.300> you<00:01:43.110> might<00:01:43.259> be<00:01:43.380> getting<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> little

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
earlier um you might be getting a little

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.469 
earlier um you might be getting a little
bit<00:01:43.830> less<00:01:44.040> volume<00:01:44.250> on<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.610> high<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.360> low<00:01:45.450> e

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
bit less volume on the high and low e

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.889 
bit less volume on the high and low e
strings<00:01:45.960> either<00:01:46.920> way<00:01:47.149> I've<00:01:48.149> got<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.780> in<00:01:48.840> my

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
strings either way I've got it in my

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.680 
strings either way I've got it in my
perfect<00:01:49.110> spot<00:01:49.440> so<00:01:50.270> it's<00:01:51.270> not<00:01:51.330> really<00:01:51.540> an<00:01:51.630> issue

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
perfect spot so it's not really an issue

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.530 
perfect spot so it's not really an issue
for<00:01:51.840> me<00:01:52.340> but<00:01:53.340> people<00:01:53.970> might<00:01:54.090> be<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.299> little<00:01:54.390> bit

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
for me but people might be a little bit
