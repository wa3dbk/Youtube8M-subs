00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.370
 hello everyone I find 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.320
 today for a new recipe 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.540
 so I do not know at all when is this 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.150
 that this recipe will be broadcast 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.610
 since there I just made my 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.869
 tortilla recipe and so I'm going to 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.039
 to make a new serious so I got 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.839
 said I was going to film Route 7 like 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.880
 that if it does not tell you I would not share 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:23.199
 so that's it if you see the video it's 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.640
 necessarily that broadcast them but I do not 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.829
 do not know when so today we're going 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.859
 to do vegan evra as to get used to 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:31.029
 the seven times the base will be different on 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.800
 the ingredients will be different of which 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.870
 we see together right away 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.699
 will need guacamole so I will 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.090
 put on the video the link to the man 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:41.769
 to the video of the guacamole recipe 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.480
 you will need corn so I 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:45.250
 grilled them quickly in the pan 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.410
 it was a corn that was still on its 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.910
 spike you will need leaves of 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.500
 salad me it's sucrose leaves 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.480
 and you will need red pepper 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.399
 you can take peppers from 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.949
 your choice of course then you will have 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:00.670
 of course tortillas so I put you 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:02.350
 there the link of the recipe video of 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.360
 tortillas on the video and then that's 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.600
 party so we start right away 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:13.920
 as usual you take your your 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:17.470
 sauce you put it in the middle here 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.399
 then you will take two small 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.200
 salad leaves 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:21.670
 so how do I take the smaller ones 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.200
 possible because mag at ease everything 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.310
 small so we liked it like that and 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.719
 and then if you go take a small 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.250
 little pad at best you put a 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:35.469
 little bit of corn and it's not too much 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.329
 to charge do not like me I'm 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:39.520
 greedy it will kill me you put a 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:42.340
 little peppers and the abbot listen 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.659
 we go for folding so again 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.170
 times you see my galette is everything 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.210
 small 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.500
 so I will not be able to do a very 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.840
 nice folding but you got yourself 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.549
 necessarily what you need a great 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.950
 stove and all so normally one to 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:57.399
 essence is folded first the bottom 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.030
 like that but hey we'll try but 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:04.569
 then you foolishly fell back 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.920
 both sides like that and there you 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.709
 have your report I think I'm 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.890
 I'm not too bad out here and there you 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.200
 can enjoy so a twin risk is 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.730
 exceeded I had to admit in 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.230
 master of guacamole if you want like 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.940
 that above to put a little 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.920
 sopalin and then then you can 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.750
 take her to work in a box or 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.370
 so eat it right away like that 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.989
 is going to be my case besides so I hope 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.690
 that this little video has you more than 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.370
 it gave you ideas if you are at 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.450
 short of ideas to make arms and 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.980
 then I find you the week 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.980
 next for a new cat recipe
