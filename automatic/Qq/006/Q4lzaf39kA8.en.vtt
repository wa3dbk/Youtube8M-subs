00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.799
 understand above 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.259
 police officers said speaking too 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:09.470

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.740
 I serve think violated I wanted the protocol 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.740
 make up 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.860
 This told 88 You can think a little 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.770
 maybe it changed it 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.080
 and I don't need to persuade you to know 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.330
 like who's there somewhere said i just don't 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.160
 I can remember specifically tell someone what 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.660
 now it 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.870
 this is something the teachers themselves 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.890
 well thoroughly 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.400

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.920
 stopped to speak like it is impossible but not 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.320
 the protocol did not want to make anything 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.770
 hike for myself, I conclude that 88 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:31.520
 like you can still ride okay 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.890
