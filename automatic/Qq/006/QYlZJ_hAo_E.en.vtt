one<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.189> try<00:00:32.600> let's<00:00:33.600> take<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:34.020> off<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.530> compare

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
one a try let's take it off and compare

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.830 
one a try let's take it off and compare
it<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.280> internal<00:00:36.210> mic<00:00:36.570> on<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.870> mark<00:00:37.230> -<00:00:38.840> so

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
it to the internal mic on the mark - so

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.650 
it to the internal mic on the mark - so
now<00:00:40.050> I'm<00:00:40.710> using<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.280> internal<00:00:41.760> microphone<00:00:41.910> on

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
now I'm using the internal microphone on

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.260 
now I'm using the internal microphone on
the<00:00:42.840> rx100<00:00:43.379> mark<00:00:43.739> -<00:00:43.950> I'm<00:00:44.430> talking<00:00:44.879> in<00:00:44.969> roughly

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
the rx100 mark - I'm talking in roughly

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.940 
the rx100 mark - I'm talking in roughly
the<00:00:45.390> same<00:00:45.629> volume<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.200> indoor<00:00:46.649> voices

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
the same volume this is indoor voices

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.770 
the same volume this is indoor voices
and<00:00:47.250> not<00:00:47.340> yelling<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.000> raising<00:00:48.329> my<00:00:48.420> voice<00:00:48.450> at

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
and not yelling and raising my voice at

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.190 
and not yelling and raising my voice at

all

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.459 
all
just<00:00:49.680> using<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.100> direct<00:00:50.520> indoor<00:00:51.469> internal

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
just using the direct indoor internal

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.950 
just using the direct indoor internal
rather<00:00:52.770> microphone<00:00:53.430> on<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.699> mark<00:00:53.940> -<00:00:54.149> just<00:00:54.870> to

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
rather microphone on the mark - just to

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.979 
rather microphone on the mark - just to
kind<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.140> get<00:00:55.260> an<00:00:55.350> idea<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.680> comparison<00:00:56.899> so<00:00:57.899> you

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
kind of get an idea of comparison so you

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.430 
kind of get an idea of comparison so you
know<00:00:58.379> any<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.680> how<00:00:58.829> much<00:00:59.129> this<00:00:59.430> mic<00:00:59.760> is<00:01:00.379> so<00:01:01.379> I

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
know any of how much this mic is so I

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.349 
know any of how much this mic is so I
got<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.620> fantastic<00:01:02.370> deal<00:01:02.489> on<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.000> really

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
got a fantastic deal on it I really

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.490 
got a fantastic deal on it I really
wasn't<00:01:03.510> even<00:01:03.629> sure<00:01:03.809> if<00:01:03.960> he<00:01:04.110> was<00:01:04.170> gonna<00:01:04.290> be<00:01:04.470> a

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
wasn't even sure if he was gonna be a

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.560 
wasn't even sure if he was gonna be a
big<00:01:04.710> upgrade<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.400> here's<00:01:06.090> hoping<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.420> I

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
big upgrade so here's hoping that I

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.820 
big upgrade so here's hoping that I
actually<00:01:06.840> noticed<00:01:07.140> some<00:01:07.350> really<00:01:07.680> good

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
actually noticed some really good

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.679 
actually noticed some really good
difference<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.520> big<00:01:08.700> difference<00:01:09.090> I've<00:01:09.420> heard

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
difference in big difference I've heard

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.080 
difference in big difference I've heard
the<00:01:09.840> mic<00:01:10.049> on<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.680> mark<00:01:10.890> -<00:01:11.070> internally<00:01:11.850> it's<00:01:12.000> a

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
the mic on the mark - internally it's a

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.200 
the mic on the mark - internally it's a
really<00:01:12.479> good<00:01:12.570> mic<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.900> begin<00:01:13.170> with<00:01:14.119> let's<00:01:15.119> move

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
really good mic to begin with let's move

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.660 
really good mic to begin with let's move
on<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.960> slightly<00:01:16.680> larger<00:01:17.040> camera<00:01:17.549> I'm

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
on to a slightly larger camera I'm

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.240 
on to a slightly larger camera I'm
plugging<00:01:17.909> my<00:01:18.150> alpha<00:01:18.479> 77<00:01:19.170> down<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.009> tripod

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
plugging my alpha 77 down to the tripod

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.420 
plugging my alpha 77 down to the tripod
and<00:01:20.790> I'll<00:01:21.210> throw<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:22.020> quick<00:01:22.380> test<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.130> -

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
and I'll throw in a quick test on that -

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.460 
and I'll throw in a quick test on that -
just<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.150> get<00:01:24.240> an<00:01:24.330> idea<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.630> how<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:25.020> compares

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
just to get an idea of how that compares

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.069 
just to get an idea of how that compares
so<00:01:26.460> I'll<00:01:26.580> include<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:26.939> right<00:01:27.270> after<00:01:27.390> this

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.919 

so<00:01:31.649> for<00:01:31.890> comparison's<00:01:32.549> sakes<00:01:32.820> this<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.630> the

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929 
so for comparison's sakes this is the

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:37.279 
so for comparison's sakes this is the
internal<00:01:34.439> microphone<00:01:34.619> on<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.189> Alfa<00:01:35.729> 77<00:01:36.509> my<00:01:36.810> V

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
personal favorite camera so just to get

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.209 
personal favorite camera so just to get
an<00:01:44.460> idea<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.819> audio<00:01:45.119> quality<00:01:45.329> -<00:01:46.069> I'm<00:01:47.069> not

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:47.219 
an idea of the audio quality - I'm not

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:48.319 
an idea of the audio quality - I'm not
really<00:01:47.399> doing<00:01:47.549> too<00:01:47.640> much<00:01:47.759> on<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.119> video

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
really doing too much on the video

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.630 
really doing too much on the video
quality<00:01:48.539> part<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.170> kind<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.619> expect<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.069> 77<00:01:50.579> to

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
quality part I kind of expect the 77 to

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.340 
quality part I kind of expect the 77 to
be<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.789> bit<00:01:51.000> better<00:01:51.179> than<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.450> rx100<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.200> does

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
be a bit better than the rx100 it does

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.559 
be a bit better than the rx100 it does
have<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.560> way<00:01:52.770> better<00:01:53.009> sensor<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:54.119> everything

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.569 
have a way better sensor and everything

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:57.109 
have a way better sensor and everything
so<00:01:55.079> we're<00:01:56.009> not<00:01:56.100> really<00:01:56.310> comparing<00:01:56.700> visual

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
so we're not really comparing visual

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.580 
so we're not really comparing visual
quality<00:01:57.509> I'm<00:01:57.659> more<00:01:57.929> here<00:01:58.110> about<00:01:58.319> the<00:01:58.409> mic

quality so you get an idea of just how
the<00:02:00.869> rx100<00:02:01.500> mic<00:02:01.829> compares<00:02:02.640> along<00:02:03.179> with<00:02:03.390> that

00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:03.599 
the rx100 mic compares along with that

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:06.469 
the rx100 mic compares along with that
