00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:21.439 
of gold one side by side our card is

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:27.369 
of gold one side by side our card is
ready<00:03:22.040> and<00:03:22.959> there<00:03:23.959> is<00:03:24.170> our<00:03:24.500> code<00:03:26.019> fourth<00:03:27.019> code

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:27.379 
ready and there is our code fourth code

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:29.470 
ready and there is our code fourth code
one<00:03:27.739> more<00:03:27.950> code<00:03:28.159> to<00:03:28.370> go<00:03:28.700> from<00:03:28.939> the<00:03:29.030> fight<00:03:29.239> back

one more code to go from the fight back

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.089 
one more code to go from the fight back
after<00:03:30.470> this<00:03:30.680> one

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099

after this one
now<00:03:32.879> let's<00:03:33.150> see<00:03:33.480> what<00:03:33.780> figures<00:03:34.200> we<00:03:34.980> get<00:03:35.310> inside

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
now let's see what figures we get inside

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.709 
now let's see what figures we get inside
we<00:03:36.480> have<00:03:36.659> gobby<00:03:37.019> the<00:03:37.319> normal<00:03:38.599> addition<00:03:39.599> of

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:39.719 
we have gobby the normal addition of

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.449 
we have gobby the normal addition of
gamma<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.109> we<00:03:40.230> have<00:03:40.319> the<00:03:40.439> gold<00:03:40.680> and<00:03:40.829> the<00:03:41.129> normal

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
gamma so we have the gold and the normal

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.300 
gamma so we have the gold and the normal
one<00:03:41.579> and<00:03:41.790> we<00:03:42.629> also<00:03:42.840> have<00:03:43.319> odd<00:03:43.530> really<00:03:43.950> did<00:03:44.069> upon

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
one and we also have odd really did upon

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.869 
one and we also have odd really did upon
this<00:03:44.489> one<00:03:44.730> it<00:03:45.269> is<00:03:45.329> pointy<00:03:45.840> stone<00:03:46.049> I<00:03:46.109> love<00:03:46.560> this

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
I can and there is the code that is code

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.089 
I can and there is the code that is code
number<00:04:10.109> five<00:04:10.349> to<00:04:10.500> five

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099
