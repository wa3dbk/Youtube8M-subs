00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
genre so basically because on dudes

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.279 
genre so basically because on dudes
they're<00:00:21.090> quite<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.330> lot<00:00:21.510> now<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.689> decided<00:00:22.109> that

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
they're quite a lot now I decided that

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.689 
they're quite a lot now I decided that
every<00:00:22.650> task<00:00:22.830> will<00:00:23.010> be<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.100> do<00:00:23.310> I'm<00:00:23.519> going<00:00:23.640> to

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
every task will be to do I'm going to

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.429 
every task will be to do I'm going to
like<00:00:23.820> record<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.240> bit<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.810> tell<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.260> how<00:00:25.410> I

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
like record a bit of and tell you how I

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.880 
like record a bit of and tell you how I
do<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:26.150> not<00:00:27.150> probably<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.019> best<00:00:28.289> way<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.619> doing

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
do it not probably the best way of doing

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.999 
do it not probably the best way of doing
it<00:00:29.130> but<00:00:29.340> probably<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.119> quickest<00:00:31.009> sometimes

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
it but probably the quickest sometimes

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.580 
it but probably the quickest sometimes
the<00:00:32.279> best<00:00:32.610> XP<00:00:33.059> but<00:00:33.750> usually<00:00:34.290> it's<00:00:34.410> just

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
the best XP but usually it's just

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.440 
the best XP but usually it's just
because<00:00:34.860> I'm<00:00:35.010> lazy<00:00:35.399> in<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.730> car<00:00:35.940> involved<00:00:36.059> to

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
because I'm lazy in a car involved to

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.360 
because I'm lazy in a car involved to
you<00:00:36.570> know<00:00:36.690> pray<00:00:37.440> or<00:00:37.559> flash<00:00:37.770> them<00:00:38.040> or<00:00:38.190> whatever

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
you know pray or flash them or whatever

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.910 
you know pray or flash them or whatever
so<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.629> how<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.780> do<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.260> blue<00:00:40.469> dragons

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
so this is how I do the blue dragons

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.100 
so this is how I do the blue dragons
task<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.309> just<00:00:41.489> kill<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.820> baby<00:00:42.300> blue<00:00:42.629> dragons

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
task I just kill the baby blue dragons

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.869 
task I just kill the baby blue dragons
and<00:00:43.290> they're<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> lot<00:00:44.010> easier<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.399> kill<00:00:44.610> they're

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
and they're a lot easier to kill they're

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.060 
and they're a lot easier to kill they're
not<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.270> much<00:00:45.329> less<00:00:45.899> Slayer<00:00:46.469> XP<00:00:46.739> per<00:00:47.039> kill

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
not that much less Slayer XP per kill

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.150 
not that much less Slayer XP per kill
and<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:48.390> gets<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.899> task<00:00:49.350> done<00:00:49.620> over<00:00:49.890> and

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
and it gets the task done over and

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.720 
and it gets the task done over and
quickly<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:51.680> basically<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.219> setup<00:00:53.489> I

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
quickly so basically this is the setup I

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.490 
quickly so basically this is the setup I
use<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.480> use<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.690> black<00:00:54.989> mask<00:00:55.199> because<00:00:55.410> you

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
use and I use a black mask because you

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.040 
use and I use a black mask because you
get<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.770> increased<00:00:56.250> damage<00:00:56.489> by<00:00:56.789> 15%<00:00:57.360> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
get the increased damage by 15% the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.920 
get the increased damage by 15% the
increased<00:00:58.350> attack<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.890> strength<00:00:59.219> which<00:00:59.520> is

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
increased attack and strength which is

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.569 
increased attack and strength which is
pretty<00:01:00.930> damn<00:01:01.109> good<00:01:01.320> because<00:01:01.590> it's<00:01:01.770> like<00:01:01.920> it's

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
pretty damn good because it's like it's

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.520 
pretty damn good because it's like it's
like<00:01:02.730> constantly<00:01:03.210> having<00:01:03.809> on<00:01:04.049> ultimate

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
like constantly having on ultimate

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.620 
like constantly having on ultimate
strength<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.070> ultimate<00:01:05.630> incredible

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
strength and ultimate incredible

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.490 
strength and ultimate incredible
reflexes<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.880> that's<00:01:08.880> like<00:01:09.210> it's<00:01:09.810> like<00:01:10.049> using

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
reflexes so that's like it's like using

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.109 
reflexes so that's like it's like using
prayer<00:01:10.950> when<00:01:11.159> you're<00:01:11.310> not<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.760> then<00:01:11.880> if<00:01:12.030> you

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
prayer when you're not and then if you

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.210 
prayer when you're not and then if you
just<00:01:12.299> add<00:01:12.450> them<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:12.840> you've<00:01:13.200> got<00:01:13.320> 30%<00:01:13.710> you've

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
just add them on you've got 30% you've

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.270 
just add them on you've got 30% you've
got<00:01:14.400> piety<00:01:15.000> plus<00:01:15.210> 5%<00:01:15.659> there<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.350> you're<00:01:17.189> not

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
got piety plus 5% there so you're not

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.399 
got piety plus 5% there so you're not
really<00:01:17.490> missed<00:01:17.790> out<00:01:17.909> anything<00:01:18.180> if<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.570> don't

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
really missed out anything if you don't

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.190 
really missed out anything if you don't
have<00:01:19.560> piety<00:01:19.890> but<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.070> have<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.220> black<00:01:20.400> mask<00:01:20.610> so

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
have piety but you have to black mask so

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.460

any fire shield but I like to risk it

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.710 
any fire shield but I like to risk it
and<00:01:40.310> yeah<00:01:41.310> it's<00:01:41.729> got<00:01:41.909> better<00:01:42.119> fences<00:01:42.570> than

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720

mean there's nothing more do you need to

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.280 
mean there's nothing more do you need to
learn<00:04:49.820> about<00:04:49.970> these<00:04:50.180> apart<00:04:50.570> from<00:04:50.720> I<00:04:50.840> suggest

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
learn about these apart from I suggest

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.800 
learn about these apart from I suggest
you<00:04:51.800> know<00:04:51.950> 40<00:04:52.730> attack<00:04:53.000> for<00:04:53.240> you<00:04:53.300> strength<00:04:53.570> for

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
you know 40 attack for you strength for

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.070 
you know 40 attack for you strength for
defense<00:04:54.220> probably<00:04:55.220> by<00:04:56.000> maybe<00:04:56.450> a<00:04:56.570> little<00:04:56.900> bit

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
defense probably by maybe a little bit

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.690 
defense probably by maybe a little bit
less<00:04:57.230> than<00:04:57.410> that<00:04:57.590> maybe<00:04:57.890> a<00:04:58.040> little<00:04:58.160> more<00:04:58.460> I

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
less than that maybe a little more I

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.970 
less than that maybe a little more I
don't<00:04:59.150> know<00:04:59.270> it's<00:04:59.600> like<00:04:59.810> there's<00:05:00.440> no<00:05:00.620> real

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
don't know it's like there's no real

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.420 
don't know it's like there's no real
requirements<00:05:01.580> for<00:05:01.640> these<00:05:01.760> that's<00:05:02.600> all<00:05:02.870> I<00:05:03.140> mean

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
requirements for these that's all I mean

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.070 
requirements for these that's all I mean
just<00:05:04.430> be<00:05:04.640> able<00:05:04.730> to<00:05:05.000> survive<00:05:05.330> here<00:05:05.690> higher

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
just be able to survive here higher

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.960 
just be able to survive here higher
defense<00:05:06.620> the<00:05:06.950> longer<00:05:07.220> you<00:05:07.280> can<00:05:07.430> survive<00:05:07.730> the

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
defense the longer you can survive the

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.970 
defense the longer you can survive the
less<00:05:08.120> food<00:05:08.330> you're<00:05:08.480> gonna<00:05:08.600> use<00:05:08.840> and<00:05:09.170> you'll<00:05:09.860> be

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
less food you're gonna use and you'll be

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.960 
less food you're gonna use and you'll be
fine<00:05:10.160> so<00:05:10.490> I<00:05:10.820> guess<00:05:11.300> I'll<00:05:11.480> see<00:05:11.600> you<00:05:11.630> later<00:05:11.780> guys
