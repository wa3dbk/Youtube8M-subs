be<00:01:47.510> the<00:01:48.020> sole<00:01:48.230> color<00:01:48.560> variations<00:01:49.190> of<00:01:49.420> the

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
be the sole color variations of the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.120 
be the sole color variations of the
great<00:01:50.600> patterns<00:01:51.050> under<00:01:51.290> the<00:01:51.410> hot<00:01:51.560> like<00:01:51.860> you're

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
great patterns under the hot like you're

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.150 
great patterns under the hot like you're
it's<00:01:52.250> really<00:01:52.760> nice<00:01:52.910> and<00:01:52.970> yeah<00:01:53.780> so<00:01:54.740> put<00:01:54.920> a<00:01:54.950> left

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
it's really nice and yeah so put a left

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.469 
it's really nice and yeah so put a left
and<00:01:55.310> finish<00:01:55.580> on<00:01:55.729> this<00:01:55.880> would<00:01:56.090> really<00:01:56.330> bring

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
and finish on this would really bring

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.660 
and finish on this would really bring
out<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.750> colors<00:01:57.110> so<00:01:57.920> this<00:01:58.100> back<00:01:58.280> wall<00:01:58.460> here

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
out the colors so this back wall here

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.790 
out the colors so this back wall here
this<00:01:59.000> is<00:01:59.120> a<00:01:59.210> double<00:01:59.420> D<00:01:59.690> the<00:01:59.960> bottom<00:02:00.410> half<00:02:00.620> will

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
this is a double D the bottom half will

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.980 
this is a double D the bottom half will
be<00:02:00.950> double<00:02:01.310> deep<00:02:01.460> rich<00:02:02.240> replace<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:02.750> bottom

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
be double deep rich replace the bottom

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.900 
be double deep rich replace the bottom
of<00:02:03.080> the<00:02:03.170> opening<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:04.160> place<00:02:04.340> another<00:02:04.550> bottle

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
of the opening the place another bottle

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:05.950 
of the opening the place another bottle
push<00:02:05.060> it<00:02:05.180> to<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.300> back<00:02:05.360> end<00:02:05.660> of<00:02:05.810> course

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
push it to the back end of course

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.350 
push it to the back end of course
another<00:02:06.170> ball<00:02:06.410> will<00:02:06.590> go<00:02:06.710> in<00:02:06.890> and<00:02:07.820> the<00:02:07.910> top<00:02:08.119> half

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
another ball will go in and the top half

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.140 
another ball will go in and the top half
of<00:02:08.450> this<00:02:08.570> right<00:02:08.840> well<00:02:09.560> maybe<00:02:09.770> 13<00:02:10.340> inches<00:02:10.670> or

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
of this right well maybe 13 inches or

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.340 
of this right well maybe 13 inches or
single<00:02:11.480> deep<00:02:11.630> so<00:02:11.780> they'll<00:02:11.900> have<00:02:12.080> all<00:02:12.110> this

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
single deep so they'll have all this

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.980 
single deep so they'll have all this
counter<00:02:12.620> space<00:02:13.270> so<00:02:14.270> basically<00:02:14.660> this<00:02:14.810> will

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
counter space so basically this will

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.830 
counter space so basically this will
wrap<00:02:15.110> around<00:02:15.140> a<00:02:15.470> curve<00:02:15.650> for<00:02:15.980> come<00:02:16.459> down<00:02:16.670> to<00:02:17.300> two

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
wrap around a curve for come down to two

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.810 
wrap around a curve for come down to two
sidewalls<00:02:18.320> be<00:02:18.980> really<00:02:19.220> nice<00:02:19.400> to<00:02:19.430> see<00:02:19.700> the

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
sidewalls be really nice to see the

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.449 
sidewalls be really nice to see the
