Four I am so excited we have come so far
number<00:04:38.630> four<00:04:39.070> reason<00:04:40.180> this<00:04:41.180> might<00:04:41.360> seem<00:04:41.510> like

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
number four reason this might seem like

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.659 
number four reason this might seem like
an<00:04:41.750> odd<00:04:41.870> choice<00:04:41.900> but<00:04:42.350> let<00:04:42.740> me<00:04:42.830> explain<00:04:42.919> back<00:04:43.520> in

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
an odd choice but let me explain back in

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.280 
an odd choice but let me explain back in
Diamond<00:04:44.120> and<00:04:44.240> Pearl<00:04:44.300> I<00:04:44.630> decided<00:04:44.930> to<00:04:45.050> try<00:04:45.260> my

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
Diamond and Pearl I decided to try my

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.439 
Diamond and Pearl I decided to try my
hand<00:04:45.590> at<00:04:45.740> effort<00:04:46.190> value<00:04:46.520> training<00:04:46.910> if<00:04:47.030> you

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
hand at effort value training if you

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:49.540 
hand at effort value training if you
don't<00:04:47.660> know<00:04:47.780> what<00:04:47.900> that<00:04:48.080> is<00:04:48.320> you<00:04:48.979> might<00:04:49.370> be

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
don't know what that is you might be

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.530 
don't know what that is you might be
better<00:04:49.699> off<00:04:49.820> basically<00:04:50.389> it's<00:04:50.510> just

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
better off basically it's just

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.850 
better off basically it's just
controlling<00:04:50.930> the<00:04:51.020> status<00:04:51.290> of<00:04:51.380> your<00:04:51.440> Pokemon

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
controlling the status of your Pokemon

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.800 
controlling the status of your Pokemon
and<00:04:52.040> today<00:04:52.490> I<00:04:52.520> can<00:04:52.910> Eevee<00:04:53.180> try<00:04:53.389> something<00:04:53.690> in

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
and today I can Eevee try something in

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.020 
and today I can Eevee try something in
like<00:04:53.960> five<00:04:54.350> minutes<00:04:54.380> with<00:04:54.979> Poker<00:04:55.430> Ross<00:04:55.760> and

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
like five minutes with Poker Ross and

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.210 
like five minutes with Poker Ross and
power<00:04:56.180> items<00:04:56.660> of<00:04:56.780> horde<00:04:57.050> battles<00:04:57.530> but<00:04:57.710> back

power items of horde battles but back

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.400 
power items of horde battles but back
then<00:04:58.520> it<00:04:58.760> was<00:04:59.120> not<00:04:59.389> so<00:04:59.630> easy<00:04:59.660> for<00:05:00.229> me<00:05:00.350> I

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
then it was not so easy for me I

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.080

fifty geodude's one at a time you know

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.810 
fifty geodude's one at a time you know
the<00:05:10.430> defense<00:05:10.729> points<00:05:11.120> but<00:05:11.419> I<00:05:11.720> still<00:05:12.500> have<00:05:13.130> that

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
the defense points but I still have that

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.050 
the defense points but I still have that
wheezing<00:05:14.479> today<00:05:15.200> and<00:05:15.500> it<00:05:15.800> is<00:05:15.950> a<00:05:16.039> brick<00:05:16.430> wall

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
wheezing today and it is a brick wall

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.480 
wheezing today and it is a brick wall
and<00:05:17.450> for<00:05:17.660> all<00:05:17.840> that<00:05:18.260> effort<00:05:18.770> it<00:05:19.070> gets<00:05:19.310> the

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
and for all that effort it gets the

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.150 
and for all that effort it gets the
number<00:05:19.729> four<00:05:19.940> slot<00:05:20.240> number<00:05:20.450> three<00:05:20.870> they<00:05:21.830> pour

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
number four slot number three they pour

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.250 
number four slot number three they pour
yawn<00:05:22.400> like<00:05:22.789> I<00:05:22.880> said<00:05:23.090> I<00:05:23.120> rarely<00:05:23.449> pick<00:05:23.810> squirtle

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
yawn like I said I rarely pick squirtle

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.960 
yawn like I said I rarely pick squirtle
so<00:05:24.380> I<00:05:24.440> was<00:05:24.680> always<00:05:24.919> in<00:05:25.190> need<00:05:25.340> of<00:05:25.370> a<00:05:25.520> water<00:05:25.669> type

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
so I was always in need of a water type

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.300 
so I was always in need of a water type
Pokemon<00:05:26.000> and<00:05:26.630> more<00:05:27.020> often<00:05:27.380> than<00:05:27.560> not<00:05:27.590> that<00:05:27.950> was

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
Pokemon and more often than not that was

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.730 
Pokemon and more often than not that was
Vaporeon<00:05:28.940> and<00:05:29.150> here's<00:05:29.630> the<00:05:29.810> reason<00:05:30.110> why<00:05:30.139> you

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
Vaporeon and here's the reason why you

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.500 
Vaporeon and here's the reason why you
could<00:05:30.889> walk<00:05:30.919> into<00:05:31.220> celadon<00:05:31.639> City<00:05:31.880> pick<00:05:32.360> up

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
could walk into celadon City pick up

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.779 
could walk into celadon City pick up
your<00:05:32.660> Eevee<00:05:32.960> immediately<00:05:33.860> to<00:05:33.979> evolve<00:05:34.250> it<00:05:34.430> then

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:34.789 
your Eevee immediately to evolve it then

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:36.190 
your Eevee immediately to evolve it then
give<00:05:34.970> it<00:05:35.000> the<00:05:35.090> bubble<00:05:35.300> beam<00:05:35.539> misty<00:05:35.900> gave<00:05:36.050> you

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
give it the bubble beam misty gave you

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.810 
give it the bubble beam misty gave you
then<00:05:36.380> go<00:05:36.470> to<00:05:36.560> the<00:05:36.650> top<00:05:36.800> of<00:05:36.830> celadon<00:05:37.370> get<00:05:37.610> ice

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
then go to the top of celadon get ice

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.570 
then go to the top of celadon get ice
beam<00:05:38.120> and<00:05:38.300> boom<00:05:38.720> crazy<00:05:39.470> strong<00:05:39.860> water<00:05:40.160> type<00:05:40.400> of

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
beam and boom crazy strong water type of

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.740 
beam and boom crazy strong water type of
right<00:05:40.700> out<00:05:40.849> of<00:05:40.880> the<00:05:41.030> gate<00:05:41.150> plus<00:05:41.450> it<00:05:41.630> has

massive HP and access to acid armor so

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.420 
massive HP and access to acid armor so
it<00:05:44.419> is<00:05:44.570> like<00:05:44.740> impossible<00:05:45.740> to<00:05:45.800> take<00:05:45.979> down
