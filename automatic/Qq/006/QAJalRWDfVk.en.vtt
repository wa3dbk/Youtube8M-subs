 artisans become pieces that bring 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:21.900

 then the pieces of wood pass to

 15 years of experience in tasks of 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.570
 work 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.110
 piggy back to the beginning at the beginning 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.110
 it costs quite

 sierra asier a battered line in the 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.030
 piece up in minutes is already 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.430
 formed the way a lot the process to 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.010
 making rolls is the same as a piece 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.990

 this biggest piece is to make a 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.160
 spin very delicately go 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.080
 thinning the tip and giving it the shape 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.260
 then they are dedicated to making the little ones 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.260
 details 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.750
 more than all of us, we focus on what is 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.310
 the games more let's say to respect what

 people that are worked on 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.330
 working and playing these games 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.060
 craft 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.370
 The last step is to refine the pieces with 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.650
 the saw and pass them to paint where 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.470
 they let out creativity so that each 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.620

 they could observe and it is already easy 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.860
 but as what you see practice what 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.260
 that is teaching one to have fields 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.180
