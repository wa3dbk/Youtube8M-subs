00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 the next team on our list with 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.640
 many of you connect with game 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.269
 with present yes not always that 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.889
 legendary rosta of alexei et cetera das 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.019
 actually does not exist anymore 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.519
 just diamond cox and adwords of it 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.830
 still there but otherwise really three 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.270
 new players you stop with before 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.439
 gamepad gaming or even with moscow 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.119
 five not really at all 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.850
 combines nevertheless they have 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.439
 last season not too good 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.150
 performance delivered for now but 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.130
 the intel extreme masters extreme 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.449
 can convince just such a type 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.189
 like new to which I will come one soon 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.719
 really strong performance delivered 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.520
 on the paddock we have broken chart 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.410
 broken charter party at the ninjas and 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.180
 pajamas and very much likes to play 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.309
 the bumpy chemnitz on the paddock like 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.440
 for example , or so , too 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.030
 Nigeria stands him very tanks he can 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.950
 Although from play but he is synonymous more 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.539
 on this damage part on the top 10 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.820
 he has extreme especially at the intel 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.710
 Extremely convincing masters in santos 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.570
 can and has really been there as one 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.520
 very strong top pictures proved 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.780
 For a long time we have the legendary diamond 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.000
 most likely, each of you rock 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.190
 the concept is the folk was long time 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.080
 as the most innovative gianna in all 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.909
 europe and so to speak at that time 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.340
 couch fishing invented 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.780
 he used to be especially for his 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.159
 dearest known before him 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.140
 Korean scene this in 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.280
 Mechanics really broke out though as well 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.909
 now players still a pretty good one 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.710
 could 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.420
 he was even for a while 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.340
 tamed because of constant performance 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.320
 but then has risen again and 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.150
 has come back and is now too 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.070
 definitely one of the strongest opponents in 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.170
 All of Europe in the middle we have in 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.960
 akkuyu are very very big footsteps 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.619
 kicked the task alexis too 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.420
 replace 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.009
 that does not have that good in the beginning 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.479
 works and you just noticed 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.009
 that there is a difference between alex 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.810
 and energy was available 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.890
 but now it has gotten better and better 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.909
 is definitely a lot now 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.079
 more consistent with longer 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.149
 Above all, he has a very big one 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.430
 champion and game pretty much like fish 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.770
 the problem is that with countries 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.079
 really well equipped in Europe 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.790
 are with skeleton and just share 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.829
 really so incredibly good are that 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.630
 energy sword does not seem to 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.100
 the more stable the energy 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.049
 countries and also he could at intel 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.369
 extreme masters pretty convincing how 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.750
 already mentioned is the adeg I have from 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.810
 gerd gaming now peu pino has only in 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.170
 promotion teams 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.640
 manager really completely replaced and he 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.200
 could still really right until now 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.250
 strong performance just show how 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.099
 already mentioned in the intel extreme 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.290
 Masters was one of the best adi 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.120
 Careys or was actually the best 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.610
 audi i just came to grace is coming yes 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.019
 even as top players as David plain 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.400
 his mechanics are really on the 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.069
 the highest level and his playing style 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.239
 it could be enormously aggressive sometimes 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.790
 even say a bit too aggressive 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.900
 So there was another player with it 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.280
 coty maybe a bit 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.290
 aggressively entered 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.030
 nonetheless he is a player of 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.709
 really the snowball lane on the 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.690
 hotline can exploit very hard and 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.280
 besides, sometimes with 34 kills 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.590
 can go and submit that gamestop 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.790
 cloud last but not least we have edward 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.620
 as we already mentioned together 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.599
 with diamond dogs the last of the 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.670
 originally existing moscow five 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.010
 band and is also very very long 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.840
 first known in the sports scene 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.090
 sometimes send unconventional mail 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.500
 such as recognizing or naming, however 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.690
 even his trash is feared 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.430
 he did not have the genscher 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.080
 the very best energy as it seemed 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.090
 However, pina is really very much there 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.130
 well clear and more likely than one of the 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.989
 best snowboarder in whole is too 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.430
 designed more for this space place 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.840
 not like the air for example 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.519
 you look back at the last game 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.510
 then like to have with the rasta changes 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.340
 definitely some good ones 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.170
 made decisions and just the 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.790
 New will definitely be an upgrade too 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.829
 Longer his bike lately 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.569
 just really diminished 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.970
 questionable is whether they are strong 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.560
 i can keep up lineups of eu lcs 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.090
 However, they think that there is a relative 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.859
 good chance have only the 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.870
 Investigators could face some problems 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:39.049
 this enormous dominant with the wii for 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.980
 to follow evil et cetera 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.480
 in principle, as already mentioned 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.650
 Definitely all options and 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.690
 I think so a middle position 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.690
 between three and six is ​​realistic
