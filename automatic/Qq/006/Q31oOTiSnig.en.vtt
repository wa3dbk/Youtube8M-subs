00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.830 
sure what differentiates some like the
ones<00:02:41.700> we<00:02:41.820> saw<00:02:41.970> before<00:02:42.180> compared<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.750> these

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
ones we saw before compared to these

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.080 
ones we saw before compared to these
ones<00:02:43.110> now<00:02:43.350> but<00:02:44.220> obviously<00:02:44.340> there<00:02:44.790> is<00:02:44.880> some

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
ones now but obviously there is some

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.400 
ones now but obviously there is some
difference<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.600> here<00:02:45.720> is<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.050> tiny<00:02:46.260> little

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
difference and here is the tiny little

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.300 
difference and here is the tiny little
thing<00:02:46.710> I<00:02:47.430> like<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.940> call<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.180> moped<00:02:48.600> car

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
thing I like to call it the moped car

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.770 
thing I like to call it the moped car
civilian<00:02:50.310> vehicle<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:50.910> they're<00:02:51.150> all<00:02:51.510> right

civilian vehicle and they're all right
they're<00:02:52.020> actually<00:02:52.350> faster<00:02:52.890> than<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.160> think

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
they're actually faster than you think

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.340 
they're actually faster than you think

for that so now we're going to fly off
and<00:03:43.680> this<00:03:44.100> was<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.600> default<00:03:45.600> well<00:03:46.050> this<00:03:46.140> is

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
and this was the default well this is

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.170 
and this was the default well this is
the<00:03:46.350> only<00:03:46.500> flying<00:03:46.890> vehicle<00:03:47.250> I<00:03:47.310> believe<00:03:47.550> in<00:03:47.820> the

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
the only flying vehicle I believe in the

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.260 
the only flying vehicle I believe in the
past<00:03:48.390> five<00:03:48.600> car<00:03:48.810> games<00:03:49.080> and<00:03:49.610> it<00:03:50.610> was<00:03:50.790> no<00:03:51.000> right

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
past five car games and it was no right

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.660 
past five car games and it was no right
flying<00:03:51.570> vehicle<00:03:51.930> as<00:03:52.500> soon<00:03:52.710> as<00:03:52.830> you<00:03:52.920> had<00:03:53.160> to<00:03:53.310> the

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
flying vehicle as soon as you had to the

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.340 
flying vehicle as soon as you had to the
best<00:03:53.880> thing<00:03:54.030> about<00:03:54.120> it<00:03:54.300> was<00:03:54.480> you<00:03:54.690> had<00:03:55.050> to<00:03:55.080> go

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
best thing about it was you had to go

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.650 
best thing about it was you had to go
off<00:03:55.380> somewhere<00:03:55.680> high<00:03:55.890> and<00:03:56.480> well<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.540> high

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
off somewhere high and well the high

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.120 
off somewhere high and well the high
altitude<00:03:58.170> and<00:03:58.380> when<00:03:58.500> you<00:03:58.590> got<00:03:58.710> off<00:03:58.800> it<00:03:59.010> was

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
altitude and when you got off it was

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.560 
altitude and when you got off it was
non-stop<00:03:59.490> down<00:03:59.910> that's<00:04:00.210> what<00:04:00.330> I<00:04:00.390> like<00:04:00.480> about

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
non-stop down that's what I like about

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.630 
non-stop down that's what I like about
helicopter<00:04:01.080> you<00:04:01.140> can<00:04:01.260> go<00:04:01.350> anywhere<00:04:01.740> anytime

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
obviously this little height limit with

while<00:04:26.780> my<00:04:26.900> windows<00:04:27.200> open<00:04:27.350> so<00:04:28.250> as<00:04:28.520> you<00:04:28.640> can<00:04:28.730> see

we're<00:04:29.390> actually<00:04:29.480> moving<00:04:29.690> onto<00:04:29.930> the<00:04:30.080> heavy

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
we're actually moving onto the heavy

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.380 
we're actually moving onto the heavy
vehicles<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:31.340> heavy<00:04:31.490> boats<00:04:31.730> I<00:04:31.880> believe<00:04:32.210> those

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
vehicles the heavy boats I believe those

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.580 
vehicles the heavy boats I believe those
are<00:04:32.540> the<00:04:32.600> heavy<00:04:32.720> boat<00:04:32.930> of<00:04:33.080> the<00:04:33.140> heavy<00:04:33.320> machine

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
are the heavy boat of the heavy machine

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.110 
are the heavy boat of the heavy machine
guns<00:04:33.770> on<00:04:33.920> and<00:04:34.100> these<00:04:34.520> are<00:04:34.730> more<00:04:34.850> like<00:04:35.000> the

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
guns on and these are more like the

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.940 
guns on and these are more like the
attack<00:04:35.420> boats<00:04:35.660> still<00:04:36.170> both<00:04:36.320> deadly<00:04:36.710> but<00:04:36.860> these

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
attack boats still both deadly but these

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.500 
attack boats still both deadly but these
are<00:04:37.040> the<00:04:37.100> ones<00:04:37.220> of<00:04:37.310> the<00:04:37.400> faster<00:04:37.760> ones<00:04:37.940> and<00:04:38.150> the

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
are the ones of the faster ones and the

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.750 
are the ones of the faster ones and the
bigger<00:04:38.690> ones<00:04:38.900> who<00:04:39.020> got<00:04:39.140> more<00:04:39.290> armor<00:04:39.650> so<00:04:39.860> it

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
bigger ones who got more armor so it

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.900 
bigger ones who got more armor so it
depends<00:04:41.210> what<00:04:41.540> type<00:04:41.750> playstyle<00:04:42.260> you<00:04:42.380> like

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
depends what type playstyle you like

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.310 
depends what type playstyle you like
personally<00:04:43.910> I<00:04:43.940> would<00:04:44.150> go<00:04:44.300> for<00:04:44.750> the<00:04:44.840> big<00:04:45.050> ones

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
personally I would go for the big ones

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.140 
personally I would go for the big ones
but<00:04:46.130> that's<00:04:46.280> just<00:04:46.520> me<00:04:46.760> and<00:04:46.970> I'm<00:04:47.030> actually

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
but that's just me and I'm actually

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.210 
but that's just me and I'm actually
gonna<00:04:47.360> try<00:04:47.570> out<00:04:47.630> this<00:04:47.780> little<00:04:48.080> small<00:04:48.350> villager

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
gonna try out this little small villager

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.100 
gonna try out this little small villager
fishing<00:04:49.730> boat<00:04:49.940> I'm<00:04:50.120> never<00:04:50.780> actually<00:04:50.870> driven

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
fishing boat I'm never actually driven

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.210 
fishing boat I'm never actually driven
one<00:04:51.320> of<00:04:51.350> these<00:04:51.410> before<00:04:51.500> I've<00:04:51.830> see<00:04:51.980> them<00:04:52.130> all

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
one of these before I've see them all

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.610 
one of these before I've see them all
over<00:04:52.400> the<00:04:52.490> campaign<00:04:52.850> I'm<00:04:53.000> like<00:04:53.180> hmm<00:04:53.990> I<00:04:54.140> might

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
over the campaign I'm like hmm I might

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.260 
over the campaign I'm like hmm I might
getting<00:04:54.890> that<00:04:55.040> but<00:04:55.220> I<00:04:55.250> never<00:04:55.460> actually<00:04:55.610> do<00:04:56.090> get

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
getting that but I never actually do get

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.330 
getting that but I never actually do get
around<00:04:56.540> to<00:04:56.690> getting<00:04:56.870> in<00:04:57.110> them<00:04:57.290> and<00:04:57.530> believe<00:04:58.160> me

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
around to getting in them and believe me

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.310 
around to getting in them and believe me
this<00:04:58.520> is<00:04:58.670> a<00:04:58.700> lot<00:04:58.790> faster<00:04:59.300> than<00:04:59.570> I<00:04:59.840> thought

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
this is a lot faster than I thought

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.600 
this is a lot faster than I thought
would<00:05:00.470> be<00:05:00.500> and<00:05:00.770> I<00:05:00.800> do<00:05:00.860> think<00:05:01.280> this<00:05:01.340> is<00:05:01.400> a<00:05:01.490> new

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
would be and I do think this is a new

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.670 
would be and I do think this is a new
feed<00:05:01.820> choke<00:05:02.060> don't<00:05:02.390> quote<00:05:03.110> me<00:05:03.260> on<00:05:03.320> this<00:05:03.410> but<00:05:03.530> I

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
feed choke don't quote me on this but I

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.780 
feed choke don't quote me on this but I
do<00:05:03.800> think<00:05:03.980> this<00:05:04.100> is<00:05:04.160> actually<00:05:04.460> a<00:05:04.490> new<00:05:04.580> feature

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
do think this is actually a new feature

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.780 
do think this is actually a new feature
that<00:05:04.970> you<00:05:05.150> can<00:05:05.240> fire<00:05:05.540> while<00:05:06.140> driving<00:05:06.640> if<00:05:07.640> it

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
that you can fire while driving if it

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.280 
that you can fire while driving if it
isn't<00:05:08.030> a<00:05:08.090> new<00:05:08.120> feature<00:05:08.450> then<00:05:08.660> please<00:05:08.840> tell<00:05:09.080> me

isn't a new feature then please tell me

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:10.930 
isn't a new feature then please tell me
but<00:05:09.410> I<00:05:09.470> don't<00:05:09.590> think<00:05:09.830> it<00:05:09.920> was<00:05:10.040> in<00:05:10.220> fuck<00:05:10.460> or<00:05:10.640> 2<00:05:10.790> or

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
but I don't think it was in fuck or 2 or

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.820 
but I don't think it was in fuck or 2 or
3<00:05:11.210> I<00:05:11.240> believe<00:05:11.360> I<00:05:11.900> think<00:05:11.960> it<00:05:12.320> might<00:05:12.470> be<00:05:12.500> a<00:05:12.620> far

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830
