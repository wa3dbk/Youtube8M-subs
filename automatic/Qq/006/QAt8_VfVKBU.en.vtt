00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.060
 such I Natalya Nekrasova co-author 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.430
 save the site and I'll fill you now 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.100
 tie the openwork paint 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.880
 the most important thing in any sample as i have 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:24.660
 don't get tired of talking about distribution 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.070
 1 rows 1 row distributed over the report 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.930
 correct you all the product will go without 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.970
 problems without errors you will not need 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.710
 pay every time 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.050
 look at the report you're already being guided 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.080
 on the first row on the exposed needle 1 row 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.540
 be able to knit 2 3 10 to the end 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:45.699
 products do not look at the report itself 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:47.399
 Mainly the first row so three needles with one 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.649
 sides and three on the other 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.670
 edge they do not touch them for 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:01:03.540
 all knitting will work further three 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:09.160
 needles we take out to change clothes from two games to 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:11.320
 middle loop 2 these needles from which 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:16.420
 removed the loop leave behind non-working 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:18.580
 position 3 loops following leave 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.210
 for now we will be with him 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.710
 to understand 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:28.840
 I also change clothes after three needles 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:31.439
 middle and insert in the back idle 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:36.000
 position 30 missed 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:38.970
 the next three change into middle 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.340
 the next three are dressing for the middle 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:49.210
 interesting pattern and three needles remain 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:53.049
 the report we have six needles so now 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.659
 each middle needle from the remaining 3 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.710
 3 set the front inoperative position 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.710
 these work 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.979
 rear idle needle position which 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.079
 we transplanted the loops from which we 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.410
 transplanted into the middle front idle 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:12.280
 needle position averages out of three 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.510
 remaining 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.820
 ahead so check the tongues 6 rows on 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.190
 in fact, not every car will hold 6 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.140
 knit as much as you knit 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.840
 car if it is 6 nakidov 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.609
 will take the real needle in front 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.609
 wonderful i knit 6 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:50.340
 256 these needles into work these needles into 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.460
 work all the needles you became forward 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:58.790
 working position tying two rows 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.790
 on all needles 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:15.210
 the car left 2 now I have three 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:17.250
 Edge these three needles worked with 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.750
 I removed them from the loop 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.540
 following the same thing only on 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.160
 following in three needles and doing something with these 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.240
 needles I shoot steel in the back idle 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.730
 the position of the game that I have here 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.310
 so here were with their loops removed 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:39.840
 put forward three needles skip 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:43.350
 and doing the same operation on the neighboring ones 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.810
 we swap needles three needles work 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.390
 one time three needles work another time after all 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.930
 I just swapped it all 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:57.420
 drawing so remember to become front 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:04:02.220
 working position go cams gone 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:04.950
 here it is forward and 3 edge which I 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.200
 Do not touch these needles behind these 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:17.840
 ticks in the front position these 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:17.840
 needles work six rows 23 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.980
 56 here is such an interesting picture we have with 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:35.290
 it turns out we put everything all everything all 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:37.480
 Needles work 2 row see already 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.650
 a drawing is already visible 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.690
 such beauty will be 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.270
 and in this way we continue 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.640
 knit further rule of these patterns 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:49.000
 The main thing is that the more nakidov 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:51.700
 knitted so the drawing will be more interesting 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.350
 if your car knits a little take or 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:57.120
 would they be fine strings 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:59.710
 close because you do little nakidov 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.610
 less embossed drawing it turns out it is not 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.610
 so interesting 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.500
 got such a wonderful very 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.170
 embossed interesting pattern 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.810
 You see fit very simply but it looks 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:17.060
 as always not usually not very clear 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.730
 simple performed very effective on 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.520
 kind of knit can be bones hats all 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.830
 anything any openwork stuff from thin 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.990
 the thread will be just lace from over 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.350
 tight will be carpenters such incomprehensible 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:32.480
 quite patterns very interesting 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.780
 looks unusual here these weave 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.700
 who leave different sides of such 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.320
 effect we achieve puts in front 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.860
 non-working position and rear non-working 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:46.240
 position removing gould everything as always 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.240
 simple and interesting
