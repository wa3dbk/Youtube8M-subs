with the installation of the new the

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:09.780 
with the installation of the new the
switchback<00:00:07.970> LED<00:00:08.809> bulbs<00:00:09.139> that<00:00:09.200> I<00:00:09.290> got<00:00:09.559> in

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:09.790 
switchback LED bulbs that I got in

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.570 
switchback LED bulbs that I got in
here's<00:00:10.790> a<00:00:10.879> low<00:00:11.000> resistor<00:00:11.889> he<00:00:12.889> made<00:00:13.190> a<00:00:14.349> mounting

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:15.580 
here's a low resistor he made a mounting

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.320 
here's a low resistor he made a mounting
bracket<00:00:16.580> for<00:00:16.880> it

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
bracket for it

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.779

out of a pen patient piece of aluminum

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.330 
out of a pen patient piece of aluminum
to<00:00:20.090> help<00:00:20.900> with<00:00:21.019> the<00:00:21.109> dissipation<00:00:21.740> of<00:00:21.920> the<00:00:22.010> heat

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
to help with the dissipation of the heat

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.730 
to help with the dissipation of the heat
coming<00:00:22.519> from<00:00:22.670> this<00:00:22.939> we<00:00:23.750> also<00:00:23.779> see<00:00:24.349> also

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
coming from this we also see also

coming from this we also see also
extended<00:00:25.340> these<00:00:25.460> for<00:00:25.730> me<00:00:26.529> we<00:00:27.529> gotta<00:00:27.710> finish

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
extended these for me we gotta finish

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.639 
extended these for me we gotta finish
hooked<00:00:28.250> up<00:00:31.509> ground<00:00:32.509> and<00:00:32.899> then<00:00:32.989> the<00:00:33.140> other<00:00:33.350> one

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
hooked up ground and then the other one

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.780 
hooked up ground and then the other one
goes<00:00:33.950> to<00:00:33.980> the<00:00:34.129> turn<00:00:34.399> signal<00:00:34.790> voltage

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
goes to the turn signal voltage

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.069 
goes to the turn signal voltage
there's<00:00:37.790> the<00:00:37.969> LED<00:00:38.360> I<00:00:38.629> got<00:00:38.899> it<00:00:38.989> from

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.710 

can<00:02:00.259> I<00:02:00.320> check<00:02:00.530> it<00:02:00.680> off<00:02:00.770> here<00:02:00.979> in<00:02:01.009> a<00:02:01.100> sec<00:02:01.310> I<00:02:01.720> do

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
can I check it off here in a sec I do

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.770 
can I check it off here in a sec I do
the<00:02:03.140> other<00:02:03.290> one<00:02:03.470> I<00:02:03.500> had<00:02:03.680> was<00:02:03.860> um<00:02:07.750> you<00:02:08.750> probably

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
the other one I had was um you probably

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.559 
the other one I had was um you probably
can't<00:02:09.140> see<00:02:09.349> okay<00:02:10.069> there<00:02:10.250> we<00:02:10.340> go<00:02:10.369> three<00:02:10.940> LEDs<00:02:11.420> on

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
can't see okay there we go three LEDs on

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.720 
can't see okay there we go three LEDs on
each<00:02:11.690> side

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.320 

once<00:02:16.730> a<00:02:16.910> puts<00:02:17.150> out<00:02:17.270> a<00:02:17.300> 150<00:02:18.050> lumens<00:02:18.200> so<00:02:19.330> it's

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
once a puts out a 150 lumens so it's

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.870 
once a puts out a 150 lumens so it's
going<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.480> be<00:02:20.780> quite<00:02:21.230> bright<00:02:21.530> at<00:02:21.769> night<00:02:22.040> I

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.370 

forget<00:02:25.880> how<00:02:25.940> much<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.239> other<00:02:26.330> one<00:02:26.540> puts<00:02:26.780> out<00:02:26.989> I

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
forget how much the other one puts out I

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.420 
forget how much the other one puts out I
have<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.830> look<00:02:27.980> down<00:02:28.190> up<00:02:28.660> but<00:02:30.220> that's<00:02:31.220> pretty

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
have to look down up but that's pretty

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.180 
have to look down up but that's pretty
much<00:02:31.640> it<00:02:31.940> for<00:02:32.590> LEDs<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.739> only<00:02:33.920> thing<00:02:34.069> I<00:02:34.130> don't

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
much it for LEDs the only thing I don't

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.940 
much it for LEDs the only thing I don't
have<00:02:34.400> LED<00:02:34.970> on<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.239> car<00:02:35.540> is<00:02:35.840> basically<00:02:36.650> the

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
have LED on the car is basically the

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.509 
have LED on the car is basically the
side<00:02:37.280> light<00:02:37.730> in<00:02:38.569> the<00:02:38.720> back<00:02:38.989> and<00:02:39.560> that's

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
side light in the back and that's

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.250 
side light in the back and that's
because<00:02:40.850> it<00:02:41.000> would<00:02:41.090> be<00:02:41.209> a<00:02:41.239> pain<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.750> hook<00:02:41.989> up<00:02:42.140> a

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
because it would be a pain to hook up a

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.500 
because it would be a pain to hook up a
load<00:02:42.410> resistor<00:02:42.890> to<00:02:43.100> it<00:02:43.310> so<00:02:43.760> I'm<00:02:44.150> not<00:02:44.209> going<00:02:44.420> to

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
load resistor to it so I'm not going to

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.470 
load resistor to it so I'm not going to
worry<00:02:44.660> about<00:02:44.720> that<00:02:45.080> one<00:02:48.880> but<00:02:49.880> yeah<00:02:50.090> this<00:02:50.299> one

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
worry about that one but yeah this one

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.380 
worry about that one but yeah this one
fits<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:51.380> other<00:02:51.610> switchback<00:02:52.610> LED<00:02:53.060> I<00:02:53.090> had

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
fits the other switchback LED I had

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.750 
fits the other switchback LED I had
actually<00:02:54.260> it<00:02:54.860> didn't<00:02:55.190> um

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
actually it didn't um

let<00:05:41.470> me<00:05:41.560> go<00:05:41.710> ahead<00:05:41.800> and<00:05:41.950> cut<00:05:42.160> that<00:05:42.370> off

00:05:45.239 --> 00:05:45.249 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:49.969 

actually<00:05:46.119> I'm<00:05:46.209> going<00:05:46.479> to<00:05:46.539> show<00:05:46.659> you<00:05:46.689> the<00:05:48.749> rare

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
actually I'm going to show you the rare

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:53.579 
actually I'm going to show you the rare
those<00:05:50.979> are<00:05:51.159> also<00:05:51.309> the<00:05:51.969> rears<00:05:52.179> are<00:05:52.589> projection

00:05:53.579 --> 00:05:53.589 
those are also the rears are projection

00:05:53.589 --> 00:06:12.890 
those are also the rears are projection
LEDs

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:34.050 

all<00:06:13.350> right<00:06:13.470> so<00:06:13.770> both<00:06:13.949> of<00:06:13.979> these<00:06:14.220> are<00:06:14.400> clear

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.240 

and<00:06:34.570> that's<00:06:34.810> without<00:06:34.960> parking<00:06:35.530> light<00:06:35.680> on<00:06:35.890> or

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.250 
and that's without parking light on or

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:41.420 
and that's without parking light on or
the<00:06:36.430> parking<00:06:38.340> parking<00:06:39.340> lights<00:06:39.550> or<00:06:39.910> the

the parking parking lights or the
headlights<00:06:46.080> parking<00:06:47.080> lights<00:06:47.290> on

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:50.370 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.219 

I<00:06:50.490> think<00:06:50.970> I<00:06:51.030> went<00:06:51.150> over<00:06:51.449> killing<00:06:51.660> these<00:06:51.900> corner

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:52.229 
I think I went over killing these corner

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:54.440 
I think I went over killing these corner
lights
