 here we open our skin and 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:59.840
 we see that there is our Barus bass ok 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:01.960
 now we'll just have to drag the file here 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.960
 inside 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.830
 here he asks us if we want to add 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:08.870
 final mind but ok 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.540
 and here he asks us if we want to add of 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:15.400
 we really do not even here 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:21.769
 we can put a name like virus skin 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:23.569
 infernal ok and tells us that the junta but 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.519
 which has now arrived but is not 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:29.000
 installed to install them a lot 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:34.740
 simple we have to tick here and 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.390
 click on install file dawn 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.920
 and below we will see the bar 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:43.170
 installation ok the skin is stellata 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.660
 now we could even close this 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.750
 their standard patterns because the skin 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.260
 now installed on which well we are in 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.630
 customer 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.710
 let's make a custom match for 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.710
 try it from the back 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.220
 we take viruses 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.659
 these classes v can be used either in 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.239
 samples bought that in free ones 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:12.090
 so it is not important that the sample does 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:15.299
 it is bought but that if used in the 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.739
 sense that you can also see gods 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:20.579
 your friends 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.889
 now we already see the certain preview 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.310
 skins have it, other skins don't 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.110
 they 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.880
 they simply have the preview 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:34.009
 normal of any champion this is 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.009
 just due to the creator 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.440
 and here we are with our beautiful one 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.440
 scheme 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:46.800
 with all these schoelers changed 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.380
 this always depends on the programmer 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:57.060
 if he has decided to change everything as well 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:59.970
 on the main skin is as you can 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:02.310
 see everything works and the kids to many 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.370
 one thing if you wanted to install one 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.680
 skin that you simply want to tick 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.680
 the skin and click on how you are 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.060
 I recommend it is always very important 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.600
 to install the skins are 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:18.740
 address more because otherwise he will bring you 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.740
 the customer and then you can very well 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.740
 deleted 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:30.060
 well guys i hope you have a video 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:33.920
 nice enough to help 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:38.520
 have free skins without spending p 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:41.070
 totally legal free therefore everything 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:45.840
 network when it makes you no reason at least 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:47.700
 for now it is the only disadvantages are that 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.730
 sometimes he could leave you the 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.920
 customer if the skin is hurt and 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:55.250
 we say that we think a lawyer and 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.710
 so you have to do prostate attention 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:01.830
 but lawyers only in the sense that maybe 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:05.820
 they are all very bad to see 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:09.150
 just install it and view the new ones 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:13.080
 so guys I recommend you commented 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:17.400
 and share and see each other for a 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:21.300
