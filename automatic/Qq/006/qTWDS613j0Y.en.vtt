revealed<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.820> even<00:00:51.210> back<00:00:51.390> then<00:00:51.719> pandas<00:00:52.649> for

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920

in<00:00:57.090> their<00:00:57.390> Anatomy<00:00:57.930> suggest<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.680> they

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
in their Anatomy suggest that they

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.860 
in their Anatomy suggest that they
couldn't<00:00:59.280> eat<00:00:59.489> as<00:00:59.699> much<00:00:59.940> bamboo<00:01:00.510> as<00:01:00.719> the

couldn't eat as much bamboo as the
modern<00:01:01.260> panda<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.640> what<00:01:03.390> push<00:01:03.719> them<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.140> go

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350
