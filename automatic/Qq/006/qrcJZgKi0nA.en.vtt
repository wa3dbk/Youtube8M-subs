00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.030 
I'm voicing over this video is that the

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.700 
I'm voicing over this video is that the

of his energy system development work

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.680 
of his energy system development work
were<00:00:49.399> extremely<00:00:49.940> limited<00:00:50.329> and<00:00:50.450> what<00:00:50.570> we're

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
were extremely limited and what we're

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.540 
were extremely limited and what we're
able<00:00:50.780> to<00:00:51.020> do<00:00:51.170> and<00:00:51.440> we're<00:00:51.920> only<00:00:52.100> actually<00:00:52.399> able

adaptations<00:00:55.010> and<00:00:55.300> that's<00:00:56.300> what<00:00:56.449> we're<00:00:56.570> doing

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
adaptations and that's what we're doing

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:58.060 
adaptations and that's what we're doing
in<00:00:56.809> this<00:00:56.960> session<00:00:57.170> in<00:00:57.379> the<00:00:57.469> video<00:00:57.680> and<00:00:57.949> I'm

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
in this session in the video and I'm

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.340

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
you follow me you'll know that I'm a big

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.479 
you follow me you'll know that I'm a big
fan<00:01:01.940> of<00:01:02.440> training<00:01:03.440> the<00:01:03.590> aerobic<00:01:04.070> system<00:01:04.369> as

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
fan of training the aerobic system as

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.660 
fan of training the aerobic system as
much<00:01:04.640> as<00:01:04.820> possible<00:01:05.000> in<00:01:05.509> rugby<00:01:05.810> union<00:01:06.170> and<00:01:06.670> one

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
much as possible in rugby union and one

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.730 
much as possible in rugby union and one
method<00:01:08.030> in<00:01:08.150> which<00:01:08.299> we<00:01:08.600> do<00:01:08.750> that<00:01:08.900> is<00:01:09.110> cardiac

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
method in which we do that is cardiac

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.289 
method in which we do that is cardiac
output<00:01:10.189> work<00:01:10.369> and<00:01:10.580> that's<00:01:10.760> what<00:01:10.909> one<00:01:11.150> is

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
output work and that's what one is

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.899 
output work and that's what one is
performing<00:01:11.810> right<00:01:11.960> now<00:01:12.320> and<00:01:13.310> we<00:01:13.520> know<00:01:13.670> that

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
performing right now and we know that

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.760 
performing right now and we know that
the<00:01:14.180> aerobic<00:01:14.630> system<00:01:14.990> is<00:01:15.140> limited<00:01:15.560> by<00:01:15.740> the

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
the aerobic system is limited by the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.550 
the aerobic system is limited by the
ability<00:01:16.040> of<00:01:16.430> the<00:01:16.549> body<00:01:16.670> to<00:01:16.820> supply<00:01:17.659> oxygenated

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
ability of the body to supply oxygenated

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.830 
ability of the body to supply oxygenated
blood<00:01:18.799> to<00:01:19.100> active<00:01:19.460> tissues<00:01:19.790> and<00:01:19.970> also<00:01:20.720> the

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
blood to active tissues and also the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.710 
blood to active tissues and also the
ability<00:01:21.200> of<00:01:21.350> those<00:01:21.500> tissues<00:01:21.740> to<00:01:22.479> utilize<00:01:23.479> that

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
ability of those tissues to utilize that

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.719 
ability of those tissues to utilize that
oxygen<00:01:24.170> and<00:01:24.320> in<00:01:24.890> this<00:01:24.979> circuit<00:01:25.369> here<00:01:25.549> we're

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
oxygen and in this circuit here we're

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.310 
oxygen and in this circuit here we're
trying<00:01:25.820> to<00:01:25.970> target<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.540> supply<00:01:26.930> side<00:01:27.170> of<00:01:27.229> the

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
trying to target the supply side of the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.280 
trying to target the supply side of the
equation<00:01:27.560> by<00:01:28.520> increasing<00:01:29.330> cardiac<00:01:29.720> output

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
equation by increasing cardiac output

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.469 
equation by increasing cardiac output
and<00:01:30.470> that<00:01:30.500> is<00:01:30.830> the<00:01:31.009> amount<00:01:31.310> of<00:01:31.430> blood<00:01:31.850> that

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
and that is the amount of blood that

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.810 
and that is the amount of blood that
gets<00:01:32.659> ejected<00:01:32.930> from<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:33.680> heart<00:01:33.890> per<00:01:34.490> beat

gets ejected from the heart per beat

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.340 
gets ejected from the heart per beat
because<00:01:35.119> obviously<00:01:35.420> we<00:01:35.810> can't<00:01:36.020> actually

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
because obviously we can't actually

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.520 
because obviously we can't actually
increase<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:37.750> maximum<00:01:38.750> heart<00:01:38.990> rate<00:01:39.049> it's

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
increase the the maximum heart rate it's

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.830

now<00:01:42.590> to<00:01:42.650> increase<00:01:43.009> stroke<00:01:43.369> volume<00:01:43.520> we<00:01:43.850> have<00:01:43.880> a

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
now to increase stroke volume we have a

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.569 
now to increase stroke volume we have a
couple<00:01:44.299> of<00:01:44.390> options<00:01:44.540> available<00:01:44.979> one<00:01:45.979> is<00:01:46.189> to

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
couple of options available one is to

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.310 
couple of options available one is to
increase<00:01:47.149> the<00:01:47.450> thickness<00:01:47.899> of<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.140> heart

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
increase the thickness of the heart

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.380 
increase the thickness of the heart
walls<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:48.829> essentially<00:01:49.340> squeeze<00:01:49.939> out<00:01:50.119> more

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
blood with each beat of the heart that's

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.069 
blood with each beat of the heart that's
not<00:01:52.939> what<00:01:53.119> we're<00:01:53.240> going<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.390> do<00:01:53.540> today<00:01:53.689> we're

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
not what we're going to do today we're

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.480 
not what we're going to do today we're
going<00:01:54.200> to<00:01:54.290> do<00:01:54.409> the<00:01:54.500> second<00:01:54.860> one<00:01:54.979> which<00:01:55.250> is<00:01:55.399> to

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
going to do the second one which is to

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.219 
going to do the second one which is to
increase<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:56.180> size<00:01:56.450> of<00:01:56.689> the<00:01:56.810> chambers

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
increase the size of the chambers

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.850 
increase the size of the chambers
containing<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.040> blood<00:01:58.250> within<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.149> heart

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
containing the blood within the heart

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.200 
containing the blood within the heart
because<00:02:00.860> if<00:02:00.979> we<00:02:01.100> can<00:02:01.250> increase<00:02:01.579> chamber<00:02:02.060> size

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
because if we can increase chamber size

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.270 
because if we can increase chamber size
and<00:02:02.540> maintain<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.170> same<00:02:03.380> ejection<00:02:03.829> fraction

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280

our<00:02:04.759> cardiac<00:02:05.270> output<00:02:05.630> is<00:02:05.719> going<00:02:05.780> to<00:02:05.869> go<00:02:05.960> up<00:02:06.140> and

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
our cardiac output is going to go up and

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.020 
our cardiac output is going to go up and
we're<00:02:06.469> going<00:02:06.590> to<00:02:06.619> transport<00:02:07.100> more<00:02:07.219> oxygenated

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
we're going to transport more oxygenated

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.539 
we're going to transport more oxygenated
blood<00:02:08.239> with<00:02:08.540> each<00:02:08.630> beat<00:02:08.840> of<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:08.989> heart<00:02:09.489> so<00:02:10.489> to

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549 
blood with each beat of the heart so to

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.550 
blood with each beat of the heart so to
get<00:02:10.729> this<00:02:10.850> adaptation<00:02:11.510> we<00:02:11.780> need<00:02:11.959> to<00:02:12.110> stretch

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
get this adaptation we need to stretch

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.250 
get this adaptation we need to stretch
the<00:02:12.860> heart<00:02:13.099> again<00:02:13.879> and<00:02:14.060> again<00:02:14.510> and<00:02:14.720> again<00:02:14.989> in

so<00:02:17.299> that<00:02:17.480> over<00:02:17.750> time<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:18.530> five<00:02:18.799> muscle<00:02:19.189> fibers

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
so that over time the five muscle fibers

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.759 
so that over time the five muscle fibers

size<00:02:21.950> increases<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:23.209> we<00:02:23.450> do<00:02:23.659> this<00:02:23.840> via

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
size increases and we do this via

research that this ranges from roughly

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.780 
research that this ranges from roughly
110<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:33.230> 150<00:02:33.920> beats<00:02:34.129> per<00:02:34.370> minute

the<00:03:16.370> zone<00:03:16.609> that<00:03:16.790> you<00:03:16.909> want<00:03:17.120> remember<00:03:17.780> we're

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
the zone that you want remember we're

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.050 
the zone that you want remember we're
not<00:03:18.230> training<00:03:18.739> for<00:03:18.859> a<00:03:18.919> peripheral<00:03:19.400> adaptation

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
not training for a peripheral adaptation

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.039 
not training for a peripheral adaptation
here<00:03:20.209> so<00:03:20.359> we<00:03:20.480> don't<00:03:20.599> need<00:03:20.750> to<00:03:20.810> necessarily

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
here so we don't need to necessarily

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.409 
here so we don't need to necessarily
create<00:03:21.799> fatigue<00:03:22.159> within<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:22.579> muscle<00:03:22.879> we're

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:23.419 
create fatigue within the muscle we're

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:25.030 
create fatigue within the muscle we're
training<00:03:23.659> for<00:03:23.750> a<00:03:23.900> central<00:03:24.290> adaptation<00:03:24.889> and

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
training for a central adaptation and

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.469 
training for a central adaptation and
it's<00:03:25.220> the<00:03:25.340> heart<00:03:25.579> rate<00:03:25.729> that<00:03:25.879> matters<00:03:26.150> not<00:03:26.419> the

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:26.479 
it's the heart rate that matters not the

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:28.599 
it's the heart rate that matters not the
fatigue<00:03:26.930> that<00:03:26.959> we're<00:03:27.290> creating<00:03:27.609> obviously

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
fatigue that we're creating obviously

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.369 
fatigue that we're creating obviously
this<00:03:28.729> is<00:03:28.909> a<00:03:28.940> great<00:03:29.180> session<00:03:29.419> if<00:03:29.629> your<00:03:29.810> lower

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379 
this is a great session if your lower

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.349 
this is a great session if your lower
body<00:03:30.530> injured<00:03:30.979> you<00:03:31.129> can't<00:03:31.340> perform<00:03:31.519> low<00:03:32.120> body

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
body injured you can't perform low body

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:35.289 
body injured you can't perform low body
work<00:03:32.599> but<00:03:33.500> if<00:03:33.620> you're<00:03:33.799> a<00:03:33.889> heavier<00:03:34.609> guy<00:03:34.849> or<00:03:35.180> you

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
work but if you're a heavier guy or you

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:36.460 
work but if you're a heavier guy or you
just<00:03:35.419> don't<00:03:35.599> like<00:03:35.780> running<00:03:36.049> you<00:03:36.319> can

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
just don't like running you can

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.960 
just don't like running you can
incorporate<00:03:36.739> lower<00:03:37.189> body<00:03:37.400> drills<00:03:37.669> into<00:03:37.879> this

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
incorporate lower body drills into this

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.179 
incorporate lower body drills into this
as<00:03:38.150> well<00:03:38.359> and<00:03:38.540> create<00:03:39.349> a<00:03:39.409> whole<00:03:39.620> body<00:03:39.829> session

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:40.189 
as well and create a whole body session

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:42.909 
as well and create a whole body session
still<00:03:40.519> targeting<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.060> same<00:03:41.239> adaptation<00:03:42.079> this

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:42.919 
still targeting the same adaptation this

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:44.469 
still targeting the same adaptation this
is<00:03:43.040> actually<00:03:43.340> a<00:03:43.400> session<00:03:43.729> that<00:03:43.849> we<00:03:43.970> do<00:03:44.150> on<00:03:44.449> our

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:44.479 
is actually a session that we do on our

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:46.990 
is actually a session that we do on our
Mondays<00:03:45.470> post-test<00:03:46.189> matches<00:03:46.519> with<00:03:46.639> the<00:03:46.699> penis

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
Mondays post-test matches with the penis

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.610 
Mondays post-test matches with the penis
because<00:03:47.269> it's<00:03:47.419> low<00:03:47.599> intensity<00:03:47.989> and<00:03:48.290> it<00:03:48.379> allows

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
because it's low intensity and it allows

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.319 
because it's low intensity and it allows
us<00:03:48.650> to<00:03:48.919> just<00:03:49.129> accelerate<00:03:49.609> recovery<00:03:49.729> a<00:03:50.060> little

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
us to just accelerate recovery a little

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.140 
us to just accelerate recovery a little
bit<00:03:50.540> more<00:03:51.220> so<00:03:52.220> I<00:03:52.250> give<00:03:52.430> this<00:03:52.579> session<00:03:52.790> a<00:03:52.939> try

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
bit more so I give this session a try

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.300 
bit more so I give this session a try
and<00:03:53.379> give<00:03:54.379> me<00:03:54.470> a<00:03:54.500> feedback<00:03:54.859> let<00:03:55.069> me<00:03:55.129> know<00:03:55.220> what

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
and give me a feedback let me know what

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.249 
and give me a feedback let me know what
you<00:03:55.400> think<00:03:55.579> of<00:03:55.639> it<00:03:55.759> and<00:03:55.939> I'll<00:03:56.750> put<00:03:56.900> some<00:03:56.989> more

you think of it and I'll put some more

00:03:57.259 --> 00:04:00.519
