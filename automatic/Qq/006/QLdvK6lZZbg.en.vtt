123 so in half an hour I'm going to come
back<00:01:51.299> check<00:01:52.299> the<00:01:52.420> temperatures<00:01:52.960> and<00:01:53.259> see<00:01:53.590> if

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:53.859 
back check the temperatures and see if

00:01:53.859 --> 00:02:01.410 
back check the temperatures and see if
there's<00:01:54.579> any<00:01:54.819> FPS<00:01:55.240> leg<00:01:55.840> or<00:01:56.140> not<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:01.030> I'm<00:02:01.149> sure

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
there's any FPS leg or not and I'm sure

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.279 
there's any FPS leg or not and I'm sure
there<00:02:01.630> will<00:02:01.659> be<00:02:01.840> a<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.850> time<00:02:04.090> is<00:02:04.329> 132<00:02:05.140> and<00:02:05.640> look

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
there will be a the time is 132 and look

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:13.369 
there will be a the time is 132 and look
started<00:02:08.289> already<00:02:09.269> so<00:02:10.269> less<00:02:10.929> than<00:02:11.370> 15<00:02:12.370> minutes

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
started already so less than 15 minutes

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.940 
started already so less than 15 minutes
play<00:02:14.379> and<00:02:14.769> it's<00:02:15.160> pretty<00:02:15.730> much<00:02:15.879> doing<00:02:16.239> it<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.860> as

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
play and it's pretty much doing it so as

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.740 
play and it's pretty much doing it so as
you'll<00:02:18.130> see<00:02:18.370> in<00:02:18.459> a<00:02:18.549> couple<00:02:18.880> of<00:02:18.970> seconds<00:02:19.660> it

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
you'll see in a couple of seconds it

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:33.559 
you'll see in a couple of seconds it
will<00:02:19.870> go<00:02:20.049> away<00:02:20.200> back<00:02:20.470> up<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:20.739> 60

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.239 

there<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:34.379> go<00:02:35.120> back<00:02:36.120> up<00:02:36.299> to<00:02:36.420> 60<00:02:36.920> let's<00:02:37.920> check

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:38.249 
there you go back up to 60 let's check

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:41.000 
there you go back up to 60 let's check
what<00:02:38.549> kind<00:02:38.849> of<00:02:38.939> temperature<00:02:39.620> is<00:02:40.620> currently

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
what kind of temperature is currently

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.610 
what kind of temperature is currently
running<00:02:41.280> out<00:02:41.489> ok<00:02:42.329> so<00:02:42.389> the<00:02:43.109> motherboard

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
running out ok so the motherboard

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.119 
running out ok so the motherboard
temperature<00:02:44.219> has<00:02:44.519> reached<00:02:44.819> 84<00:02:45.719> degrees<00:02:46.129> the

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
temperature has reached 84 degrees the

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.300 
temperature has reached 84 degrees the
cause<00:02:47.579> the<00:02:48.030> maximum<00:02:48.510> 85<00:02:49.109> and<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:50.099> graphics

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
cause the maximum 85 and the graphics

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.750 
cause the maximum 85 and the graphics
card<00:02:50.790> 92<00:02:51.480> so<00:02:51.930> it's<00:02:52.680> mainly<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.099> graphics<00:02:53.519> card

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
card 92 so it's mainly the graphics card

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.069 
card 92 so it's mainly the graphics card
overheating<00:02:54.269> on<00:02:54.359> this<00:02:56.629> ok<00:02:57.629> so<00:02:57.689> we're<00:02:57.900> going<00:02:57.989> to

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
overheating on this ok so we're going to

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.080 
overheating on this ok so we're going to
go<00:02:58.109> back<00:02:58.349> into<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.620> game<00:02:59.689> and<00:03:00.689> as<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:00.959> can<00:03:01.139> see

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
go back into the game and as you can see

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.030 
go back into the game and as you can see
everything<00:03:03.090> is<00:03:03.359> running<00:03:03.659> smooth<00:03:04.109> and<00:03:04.530> 60

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
everything is running smooth and 60

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.059 
everything is running smooth and 60
frames<00:03:05.310> per<00:03:05.430> second<00:03:06.260> and<00:03:07.260> I'm<00:03:07.439> sure<00:03:07.739> in

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
frames per second and I'm sure in

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.500 
frames per second and I'm sure in
another<00:03:08.310> 10<00:03:08.579> minutes<00:03:08.819> it's<00:03:09.120> going<00:03:09.299> to<00:03:09.389> do

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
another 10 minutes it's going to do

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:16.819 
another 10 minutes it's going to do
exactly<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.409> same<00:03:10.439> thing<00:03:14.689> ok<00:03:15.689> as<00:03:16.199> you<00:03:16.409> can<00:03:16.530> see

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
exactly the same thing ok as you can see

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.929 
exactly the same thing ok as you can see
it's<00:03:17.790> done<00:03:18.209> it<00:03:18.359> again<00:03:19.430> so<00:03:20.430> I'm<00:03:20.549> just<00:03:20.699> going<00:03:20.849> to

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:20.939 
it's done it again so I'm just going to

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:23.509 
it's done it again so I'm just going to
leave<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.389> cam<00:03:22.199> recording<00:03:22.799> so<00:03:23.099> you<00:03:23.189> can<00:03:23.310> see

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
leave the cam recording so you can see

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:29.409 
leave the cam recording so you can see
it<00:03:23.609> going<00:03:23.849> back<00:03:24.060> up<00:03:24.239> to<00:03:24.769> 60<00:03:25.769> frames<00:03:26.040> per<00:03:26.219> second

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.419 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:33.550 

so<00:03:30.419> this<00:03:30.750> is<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.169> third<00:03:31.379> test<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:32.790> third<00:03:33.090> game

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
so this is the third test the third game

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.170 
so this is the third test the third game
shown<00:03:34.560> that<00:03:34.739> every<00:03:35.010> game<00:03:35.189> I<00:03:35.219> play<00:03:35.669> on<00:03:35.969> this

same problems and I noticed at the

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.689 
same problems and I noticed at the
moment<00:05:31.409> it<00:05:31.499> must<00:05:31.590> be<00:05:31.710> so<00:05:32.039> hot<00:05:32.279> because<00:05:32.550> it's

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 
moment it must be so hot because it's

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.360 
moment it must be so hot because it's
doing<00:05:33.090> it<00:05:33.210> pretty<00:05:33.479> much<00:05:33.719> every<00:05:34.379> other<00:05:34.590> two

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
doing it pretty much every other two

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.759 
doing it pretty much every other two
minutes
