00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
the graphics and I think the music is a

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.780 
the graphics and I think the music is a
little<00:01:10.410> bit<00:01:10.560> better<00:01:10.800> in<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.160> Sega<00:01:11.430> Mega<00:01:11.729> Drive

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
version other than that I think the

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.690 
version other than that I think the
games<00:01:13.590> are<00:01:13.800> pretty<00:01:13.950> much<00:01:14.040> exactly<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.490> same

games are pretty much exactly the same
there's<00:01:14.880> no<00:01:14.970> real<00:01:15.270> advantage<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.840> playing<00:01:16.200> one

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380
