00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:12.280
 I want to talk to you about this product 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:15.580
 comes in this box 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.900
 it's called black + walter and rinse facial 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.310
 of itself mut or mud of the Dead Sea 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.830
 revitalizing black face mask 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.080
 facial care for combination skin with 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.500
 vitamins and minerals 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.210
 there is another of this kind very similar 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.590
 but it's the green color that is cucumber 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.590
 which is for all skin types 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:41.470
 this belongs to him in that the 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:45.300
 natural balance is the brand 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:49.030
 I bought it in a format of 139 bolivars 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.500
 says the Dead Sea mud keeps 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.720
 the clean skin of pimples 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.180
 muddy black spots and eliminate purity 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.770
 removes excess fat on the face and 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.250
 for its high content of minerals 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.710
 natural exfoliates the nourishes and revitalizes 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.150
 the facial skin leaving it soft and 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.860
 relaxed 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.840
 the combination of mud with the new 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.240
 Black mask formula is ideal 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.150
 for clear skin remove impurities and 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.780
 the excess of fat is ideal for skins 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.830
 fats 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.830
 I already tried it 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.140
 as you can see is a black mask 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.010
 I'm going to apply it in this part of the 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.830
 face so they see the lie for 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.860
 apply here to see why I already 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.640
 I made the mask this week and I did not 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.230
 I think it's good 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.450
 reapply 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.549
 so often 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.170
 says to apply the mask on the 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:51.899
 skin in a uniform way let it 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.899
 act for 15 minutes once dry 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.750
 lift from bottom to top last 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.360
 some of the rest with plenty of water is like this 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.700
 type peeling or when the 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.430
 ranks stays pretty stuck in your 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.070
 skin and at that moment he tells me all my 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.410
 process of choosing the exfoliating cleanser 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.990
 my face apply the mask 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.510
 and when he removed it, all the 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.780
 little black dots and nuggets that he had like this 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.569
 a flower skin attached to the mask 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.340
 it hurts I have the facial hair and I 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.069
 It hurt a bit to remove it because it 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:30.359
 really dry 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:33.030
 he puts pieces of truth or really is 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:35.609
 Adheres to the face and when you remove it 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.499
 You feel how you are extracting everything 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:40.469
 something which I love I use a 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:42.239
 of soap that is cucumber but always 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:45.260
 that I removed it in this part never 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.450
 it ends in the fold of my mouth 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.750
 and there was always a month left and that's where 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.060
 I'm more interested in having all this start 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.709
 and I did not do it with these and lies' 15 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.880
 minute mask put on and when the 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:02.250
 remove left all 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.890
 I wanted to show you how 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.420
 for you to see live but I 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.120
 It seems a little disgusting 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.159
 so I preferred not to 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.690
 well back and hope to dry 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.690
 for you to see how it is removed 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.140
 because I've already returned, 15 minutes have passed 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.769
 this 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:26.330
 look how it's supposed to be dry 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:29.360
 the feeling that is on the skin is that 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:33.620
 like the mask is being collected 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:36.170
 and it's tempering you like tempering 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.780
 the skin I imagine is the effect for 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.260
 adhere well something that you have inside 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.260
 the pores 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.550
 well says from below 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.550
 upwards 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.520
 single 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.780
 it's like the little bands that should be 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.780
 x but much cheaper 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.200
 and look, they have to rinse with the water 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.730
 warm for what 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.730
 remove the remains 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.030
 I have tested this product several times in 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.430
 myself and the truth I'm pretty 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.380
 satisfied with the first one because if 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.660
 fulfills the function of eliminating 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.600
 prints on the skin with the milestone yes 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.280
 he eliminates them as far as property is concerned 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.500
 clarifies before the truth has not clarified 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.440
 none machito so far and in 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.830
 how much to eliminate fat the excess 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.500
 of fat I feel that it does not do it 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:35.090
 eliminate excess fat however to 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:37.979
 despite being a shelf does not contribute more 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.470
 fat to my skin I would buy it again in 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:43.380
 a thousand times if it has 120 grams and is a 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:46.440
 Remaining post of good size for 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.150
 its price costs 139 bolivars as I said 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:53.529
 at the beginning I got it in format 2 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:55.149
 from here in Venezuela and I recommend them 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:57.039
 remember that this one is for skins 

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:58.869
 Dead Sea fats and there is another 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.129
 for all skin types that's from 

00:04:58.869 --> 00:05:02.169
 cucumber 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:04.569
 and you choose the one that best suits you 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.279
 I hope you liked this review and 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:07.719
 that serves them something and any 

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:10.110
 question I left it in the comments 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:10.110
