schedule will be a video up a day and um
I'm<00:00:22.410> actually<00:00:22.529> going<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.830> try<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.010> get<00:00:23.160> like<00:00:23.369> a

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
I'm actually going to try to get like a

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.660 
I'm actually going to try to get like a
little<00:00:23.789> um<00:00:24.920> probably<00:00:25.920> more<00:00:26.220> serious<00:00:26.640> going

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
little um probably more serious going

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.310 
little um probably more serious going
I'm<00:00:27.029> going<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.210> do<00:00:27.269> my<00:00:27.300> leak<00:00:27.599> series<00:00:27.990> which<00:00:28.170> is

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
I'm going to do my leak series which is

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.779 
I'm going to do my leak series which is
going<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.529> be<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.980> road<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.310> masters<00:00:29.609> but

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
going to be the the road and masters but

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:30.919 
going to be the the road and masters but
it<00:00:29.910> probably<00:00:30.179> won't<00:00:30.330> be<00:00:30.449> called<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:30.810> because

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
it probably won't be called that because

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.020 
it probably won't be called that because
I'm<00:00:31.140> already<00:00:31.260> masters<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.430> can't<00:00:32.730> really<00:00:32.820> do

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
I'm already masters so I can't really do

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.000 
I'm already masters so I can't really do
the<00:00:33.149> road<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.450> masters<00:00:33.780> anymore<00:00:34.110> um<00:00:34.320> I

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
the road to masters anymore um I

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.350 
the road to masters anymore um I
probably<00:00:35.280> like<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.670> road<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.940> first<00:00:36.120> place

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
probably like the road to first place

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.000 
probably like the road to first place
though<00:00:36.630> because<00:00:36.899> I'm<00:00:37.110> like<00:00:37.290> I'm<00:00:37.440> like<00:00:37.469> seven

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
nuclear series is I would have to get a

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.220 
nuclear series is I would have to get a
nuclear<00:00:59.180> I'm<00:01:00.180> not<00:01:00.329> sure<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.840> guys<00:01:00.989> would

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
seen somebody do before I came to my

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.469 
seen somebody do before I came to my
head<00:01:32.430> just<00:01:32.640> like<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.939> other<00:01:33.060> day<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.450> I

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
head just like the other day and I

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.359 
head just like the other day and I
thought<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:33.930> would<00:01:33.990> have<00:01:34.079> been<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.369> pretty

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
thought that it would have been a pretty

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.249 
thought that it would have been a pretty
good<00:01:35.610> idea<00:01:35.729> or<00:01:35.970> something<00:01:36.600> pretty<00:01:36.810> cool<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.110> do

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
good idea or something pretty cool to do

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.319 
good idea or something pretty cool to do

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
and you still die like look at that I

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.920 
and you still die like look at that I
probably<00:02:50.370> died<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:50.819> my<00:02:51.030> swarm<00:02:51.329> didn't<00:02:51.569> save<00:02:51.750> me

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
probably died of my swarm didn't save me

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.559 
probably died of my swarm didn't save me
so<00:02:52.530> that's<00:02:52.829> just<00:02:53.069> like<00:02:53.250> that<00:02:53.879> just<00:02:53.909> shows<00:02:54.329> like

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
so that's just like that just shows like

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:55.729 
so that's just like that just shows like
the<00:02:54.689> luck<00:02:54.900> what<00:02:55.169> are<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.319> doing<00:02:55.500> buddy<00:02:55.590> you

many<00:03:15.150> ways<00:03:15.329> yeah<00:03:15.480> I'm<00:03:15.659> actually<00:03:15.989> really

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
many ways yeah I'm actually really

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.610 
many ways yeah I'm actually really
forward<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.709> trying<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.129> do<00:03:17.280> that<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.989> the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
forward to trying to do that the the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.250 
forward to trying to do that the the
leak<00:03:19.829> series<00:03:20.250> that<00:03:21.239> new<00:03:21.359> nuclear<00:03:21.780> series<00:03:22.109> i'm

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
leak series that new nuclear series i'm

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.490 
leak series that new nuclear series i'm
hoping<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:22.919> it's<00:03:23.489> something<00:03:23.909> that<00:03:24.209> um<00:03:24.599> it's

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
hoping that it's something that um it's

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.409 
hoping that it's something that um it's
definitely<00:03:25.919> unique<00:03:26.069> I<00:03:26.430> mean<00:03:26.760> I<00:03:26.790> haven't<00:03:27.150> seen

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419 
definitely unique I mean I haven't seen

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:30.289 
definitely unique I mean I haven't seen
anybody<00:03:27.629> do<00:03:27.930> something<00:03:27.989> like<00:03:28.260> that<00:03:28.530> um<00:03:29.299> but

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
anybody do something like that um but

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.119 
anybody do something like that um but
it's<00:03:30.989> it's<00:03:31.290> definitely<00:03:31.650> unique<00:03:31.739> and

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
it's it's definitely unique and

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.849 
it's it's definitely unique and
hopefully<00:03:32.699> I<00:03:33.180> can<00:03:33.780> actually<00:03:34.349> get<00:03:34.560> it<00:03:34.680> done

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
hopefully I can actually get it done

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.610 
hopefully I can actually get it done
I'll<00:03:35.549> try<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:35.879> I'll<00:03:36.690> try<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:36.930> I'll<00:03:37.169> try<00:03:37.349> to<00:03:37.409> work

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
on it i'll see how it goes and if not

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.520 
on it i'll see how it goes and if not
all<00:03:40.530> if<00:03:41.750> and<00:03:42.750> if<00:03:42.900> it<00:03:42.959> doesn't<00:03:43.199> turn<00:03:43.290> into<00:03:43.409> a

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
it doesn't look fake like where I got

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:06.140 
it doesn't look fake like where I got
the<00:04:02.939> where<00:04:03.599> I<00:04:03.629> got<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.430> nuclear<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:05.699> then<00:04:05.879> I

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
the where I got the nuclear and then I

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.000 
the where I got the nuclear and then I
just<00:04:06.569> turned<00:04:06.989> on<00:04:07.139> the<00:04:07.319> thing<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:07.590> just<00:04:07.829> put

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
just turned on the thing and just put

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.069 
just turned on the thing and just put
the<00:04:08.099> music<00:04:08.189> on<00:04:08.489> or<00:04:08.639> something<00:04:08.790> like<00:04:08.909> that<00:04:09.079> so

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
the music on or something like that so

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:11.179 
the music on or something like that so
it<00:04:10.319> i'll<00:04:10.470> probably<00:04:10.650> have<00:04:10.799> to<00:04:10.859> do<00:04:10.979> it<00:04:11.040> with<00:04:11.129> the

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:11.189 
it i'll probably have to do it with the

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:13.189 
it i'll probably have to do it with the
face<00:04:11.340> cam<00:04:11.549> which<00:04:11.849> is<00:04:11.970> fine<00:04:12.120> um<00:04:12.329> so<00:04:13.019> you<00:04:13.079> guys
