00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.879
 Hello Sergey, what are the two questions 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.680
 the first and most simple is short 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.030
 regarding oil change in automatic 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.070
 gearbox 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.929
 tell about you in which way better 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.690
 change that is a hardware way 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.100
 by replacing the old 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.920
 oil on a new or 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.560
 partial discharge to the elevator you need to drive 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.539
 one hundred kilometers and again also part 53 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.880
 this way several times you will 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.460
 do it yourself at home in citizens tagged 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.260
 where no no no this is not your dealer 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.100
 The dealer says that in the box of oils 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.050
 nature is changing lies but so no less 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.450
 the battle even before the space is then written 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.640
 but a tricky bitter experience on you 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.410
 in the car exactly after 100 thousand 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.530
 mileage format ordered to live long 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.160
 so at the peak you decided to change to but 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.649
 mobile more yes yes by 50 to 60 already accurate 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.640
 it is necessary to change here the option such as 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.710
 all boxes are different 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.910
 drain one hundred percent of the oil there 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.399
 succeed therefore you are doomed to 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.830
 prolonged flushing question how much 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.560
 worth it time you can drain 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.170
 to ride to drain to ride to drain to ride 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.570
 then chances are that you are 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.680
 susekam you hold together everything 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.630
 sediments and all that tripe 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.369
 there crumbled a 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:26.549
 physics in the corners on you have the opportunity 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.640
 long time to do it but with you 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.860
 automatic left longer than necessary 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.899
 engage the application of the pallet is fashionable 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.119
 read Tamuz in the forums here 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.250
 unscrewed the kirtan pan there still 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.159
 washed out the filter as well as removes either 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.500
 changes would be washed and the addon is cleaned 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.860
 which finds the map and fly deposits 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.979
 that is, you mean the sump pan 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.799
 Well , this box from mida that is, you 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:58.849
 actually going to combine 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:02:03.119
 oil change with mechanical cleaning yes 

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:04.770
 both optionally trembling in the hands 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.689
 more than what you have in the public domain 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.360
 will there be any gold glasses ever 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.410
 Do not harm them at the same time to blow than carefully 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.290
 all the better 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.599
 news traffic jam in Moscow defeated 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.860
 finally only 6 points all 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:22.849
 ok rings cost 65 10 9 9 and 6 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.849
 alexandra hello
