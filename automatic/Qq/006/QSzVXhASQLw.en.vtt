00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.430
 Hi, guys and girls, I'm the one 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:08.090
 believe and today I come to bring you the new 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:11.360
 trick of the xp lobby is worth this time is of 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.400
 new with the bots the previous one as already 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.259
 I knew if it was playing between the 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.020
 hundred friends of those you went down to the 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:20.270
 proportion and others 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.850
 and good is easy to do 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.180
 it's pretty simple it was going to be a video 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:29.660
 short therefore and good to explain 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.440
 well to begin you enter to play in 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.220
 line is worth 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.870
 and you need a friend that does have 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.110
 to be put into games 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.110
 custom 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.340
 and do not touch anything to leave it such 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:50.360
 which does not matter and it is important for 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:53.120
 be it or that you get the first one that he 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.880
 here is worth so and where I am and that 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.910
 give him to leave game and leave marked 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.790
 yes because you are going to 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.890
 have to join fast and nothing but you 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.340
 unis he has to go out 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.360
 if it takes a bit I see 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.880
 more than the normal time to leave 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.770
 knowing here to multiplayer and 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.360
 you will also take a chance 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.030
 then you will have to repeat it again 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.250
 but hey it's very short and it does not happen either 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.180
 nothing but good to try to get it out 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.180
 at first 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.880
 that he stays here worth where he does and 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.670
 then nothing more than something that 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.909
 I heard you enter the game 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.090
 that he leaves and you simply 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.780
 what you have to do is 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.210
 here in public game you give him a 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.759
 triangle and select is the friend that 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.159
 you want united to the then you give to 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.460
 square to join him and then you 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.560
 you give all the time to the X equis 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.740
 then to see if I get the first 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.130
 because this one hand but good 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.189
 then you have square x all the 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.159
 and then nothing else but you join the 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:09.790
 friend of yours has to go out and see if 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.790
 improves the first 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.940
 It's worth this time it has not come out as you see 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:19.190
 more out out 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.110
 then also the one who comes back in 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.430
 the custom pills that you 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.760
 give again to leave the 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.760
 departure 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.830
 and you repeat the process is 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:36.150
 square to join osael x shortly 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.490
 ok here I have already left to your 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.010
 friend will have taken it out or rather it 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.150
 will have gone back and you guys 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.520
 you will be in personalized games 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.100
 OK 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.160
 well you only need one player 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.330
 more to do it as you see down there 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.190
 but the only thing that is interested in a 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.710
 public game 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.680
 and then the seven roucco is going to 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:01.850
 ask five players then I think 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.890
 that if you go to zombies and then come back 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.380
 a player asks again if you do not go out 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.570
 of the game and by you see enter and then 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.550
 only asked you a player is worth here 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.900
 configure the game is valid with the map 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.200
 what do you expect for example in lockdown 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.420
 the game mode that you want 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.459
 edit the split rule I'm going to make a 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.459
 test is valid so you can see what counts 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:31.170
 let's put it to 5 points for example to 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.170
 10 points we adjust the bots 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.450
 It's good that what you have seen there is 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.400
 if it's too late, it's worth putting a 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.930
 game then you have to try 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.220
 set up a little faster than what 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.040
 I have done it but good as it was 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.659
 explaining either 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.870
 but hey just once you have 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.870
 configured 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.800
 that people or invitÃ¡is in friends are 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.550
 they join you and the game starts 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.490
 then the game is going to start and all 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.850
 the points you make are going to tell you 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:06.710
 it seems to me that the bloodthirsty and the 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.450
 low I also think that with shotgun 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.940
 for example they are the ones to kill with a 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.380
 shot those do not count 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.170
 I'm not sure it's worth it because that still 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.390
 I have not done it I know it works but it does not 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.610
 I have not done it and did not try bloodthirsty 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.830
 not shotgun but good for what I have 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:24.440
 said that does not work that is exactly 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.820
 same as in the previous ones but good 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.550
 as you can see the trick is easy 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.360
 it is simply that I repeat to you in case 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.590
 has been a little 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.600
 in the doubts 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.440
 that your friend is placed here is worth 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:41.590
 I saw the circle to go out and I said 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.810
 marked and nothing more than an ice 7 is 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.980
 it has to go 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.840
 you 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.770
 with selecting the public item 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:54.110
 liza triangle you join him is worth giving 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.260
 square and once larissa 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.610
 square has seen him the time x is worth and 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.980
 then he what he has to do 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.340
 it's going away then you do it again 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.340
 if you believe 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.319
 Okay, here he searched for my title 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.720
 equipment because it has not gone well 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:13.000
 then vice versa and back to 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.759
 do but good the trick is this is 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.840
 quite pretty simple with what to take 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:20.080
 in mind the one that has come to me 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:23.439
 first set it up fast invite the 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.090
 people and start the game is worth the people 

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:27.780
 can be joined while in the game 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.870
 It is online 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:33.330
 and nothing this is all has been I believe 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.800
 pretty short pretty easy to get 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.210
 in the comments if there is anything 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:41.460
 that you do not understand and if you have any doubt 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.770
 it works in both xbox and in play vale 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.810
 in xbox is not that difficult because the 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.510
 your partner or friend does not have to 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.190
 get out so fast in play and that's what 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.740
 bad that you have to get out very fast and 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.230
 to me in fact the first few times 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.139
 I thought it did not work in play because 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.610
 I did not get out fast enough 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.919
 but that's why the advice that 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:05.010
 your friend is already marked I do not know 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:06.430
 if one more I know that you join then 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.380
 out 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.540
 and none of this has been all in one video 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.940
 short as I say they put less 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:15.520
 comments you like to like it if you 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:18.990
 like and nothing see you in the next 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.990
 video is worth until later
