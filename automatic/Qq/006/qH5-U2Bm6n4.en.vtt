 types as always to see 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.859

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.300

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.260
 although if the chile if they lowered band 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.290
 Then excuse me if I stayed 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.030

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.789
 I put there is so they are very well 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.440

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.699
 so be welcome from another 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.890
 Starting more to continue as I had 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.510
 mentioned at the beginning but how do I 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.869
 I was concentrating on the departure of 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.869
 moment 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.680
 how good 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.050
 if the soul kills him nothing else nothing wrong 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.590
 then it's beautiful recovering my 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:23.390
 different pros from what I really do not 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.960
 consider a come software for nothing 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.869
 today that was good 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.400
 I do not consider it to come so I just 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.260
 I say and I say it about mom gives about the 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.090
 obviously instincts pros 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.560
 nobody is killing him in this guy 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.560
 I live since it 's all 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.740
 ayayay run course 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.680
 ayayay return the head I'm sorry 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.729
 friend ok in nothing wrong this map is the one 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.369
 I like it more 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.800
 well I think if I make a top 3 of 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.400
 the most frightening software maps 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:05.970
 ok no but eye a yuyu and super pro super 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:08.820
 pro are returning the pros instincts 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.170
 his mother seriously fucking weasel me 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.480
 is returning it but I feel the 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.110
 veins 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.530
 in short this was saying look 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.530
 I got a guy 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.820
 today that looked weird 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.560
 to see I already suppose that it must be 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.330
 here the last time so I do not think 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.400
 I know that there is nothing here 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.870
 I was saying no, I do not remember that 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.880
 I was telling you but obviously you 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.470
 I was saying I was doing it 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.430
 something 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.530
 and they killed him this way is the east is one 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.380
 of the maps that I like the most about gears 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.790
 of war 3 so it would be a top of a top 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.720
 of maps I think that this one 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.400
 would be in first place 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.710
 since it is very small and like 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:58.000
 You can make this chingon the shotguns 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.950
 I like him more for him for this guy 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.980
 of duels for others in which then 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.490
 they come to arm here or sometimes 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.840
 true 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:12.040
 u and no no no no runs runs because I 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.040
 I was static I do not know 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.010
 the 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.569
 and there I should have killed him 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.000
 been good that would have been flying 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:31.780
 to pieces to the monkey but not 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.740
 to see they are all on this side 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.420
 already reaching the champion and the cropped 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.160
 although in fact I'm already starting to 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.170
 cut out of his hands we're going to kill the 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.540
 boat is good since I think it was a kill 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.300
 so I do not better go bojan or 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:50.550
 I better go because then they would go they will go on 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.550
 vain the end uy 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.850

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.150
 already 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.150

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:27.550

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.130
 that the pros instincts are back 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.970
 in me I feel the veins being like 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:38.070
 runs the prowess in me in my veins and 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.070

 today that should be like a kind 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:54.950

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.790
 I want to talk I mean 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:06.830
