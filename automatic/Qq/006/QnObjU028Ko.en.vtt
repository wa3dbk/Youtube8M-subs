then the opposite else what you should

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.469 
then the opposite else what you should
do<00:01:32.380> instead<00:01:32.590> of<00:01:32.860> it<00:01:33.100> you<00:01:33.820> can<00:01:33.910> always<00:01:34.000> end<00:01:34.360> the

now<00:03:02.870> we<00:03:02.930> have<00:03:03.110> to<00:03:03.290> if<00:03:03.440> statements<00:03:03.980> we<00:03:04.550> can

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
now we have to if statements we can

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.000 
now we have to if statements we can

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
figure out which of the code is failing

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.880 
figure out which of the code is failing

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.449

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
greater than 8 it says fail so now

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.620 
greater than 8 it says fail so now
there's<00:03:22.459> other<00:03:22.760> ways<00:03:22.910> of<00:03:23.060> doing<00:03:23.270> if<00:03:23.390> an<00:03:23.510> else

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
there's other ways of doing if an else

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.810 
there's other ways of doing if an else
statements<00:03:24.110> you<00:03:24.650> can<00:03:24.860> nest<00:03:25.250> if<00:03:25.430> in<00:03:25.670> else

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
statements you can nest if in else

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.130 
statements you can nest if in else
statements<00:03:26.330> within<00:03:26.570> an<00:03:26.959> if<00:03:27.950> statement<00:03:28.549> and

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
statements within an if statement and

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.720 
statements within an if statement and
but<00:03:30.140> since<00:03:30.350> this<00:03:30.470> this<00:03:30.980> is<00:03:31.130> just<00:03:31.280> the<00:03:31.340> basics

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
but since this this is just the basics

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.729 
but since this this is just the basics
of<00:03:31.820> if<00:03:32.000> and<00:03:32.150> else<00:03:32.269> will<00:03:32.690> go<00:03:32.870> into<00:03:33.019> the<00:03:33.380> nested

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
of if and else will go into the nested

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.090 
of if and else will go into the nested
stuff<00:03:34.190> later<00:03:34.820> and<00:03:35.120> that's<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:36.019> that's<00:03:36.890> how

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
stuff later and that's the that's how

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.800 
stuff later and that's the that's how
you<00:03:37.160> write<00:03:37.610> in<00:03:37.790> if<00:03:37.940> an<00:03:38.120> else<00:03:38.269> statement<00:03:38.330> and

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
you write in if an else statement and

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.590 
you write in if an else statement and
