00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:49.619 
want to do and I think that we have a
tendency<00:04:46.900> to<00:04:47.080> be<00:04:47.199> lazy<00:04:47.560> and<00:04:47.949> not<00:04:48.090> care<00:04:49.090> we<00:04:49.360> we

00:04:49.619 --> 00:04:49.629 
tendency to be lazy and not care we we

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:52.409 
tendency to be lazy and not care we we
like<00:04:49.780> to<00:04:49.990> eat<00:04:50.349> the<00:04:51.189> fruits<00:04:51.580> of<00:04:51.849> their<00:04:52.030> labor

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
like to eat the fruits of their labor

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.230 
like to eat the fruits of their labor
and<00:04:52.840> to<00:04:53.770> enjoy<00:04:53.949> ourselves<00:04:54.370> instead<00:04:55.000> of

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
and to enjoy ourselves instead of

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.179 
and to enjoy ourselves instead of
learning<00:04:55.449> more<00:04:55.840> instead<00:04:56.710> of<00:04:56.770> teaching

learning more instead of teaching

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:59.249 
learning more instead of teaching
ourselves<00:04:57.520> things<00:04:58.090> instead<00:04:58.990> of<00:04:59.050> engaging

00:04:59.249 --> 00:04:59.259 
ourselves things instead of engaging

ourselves<00:05:00.069> with<00:05:00.219> other<00:05:00.370> people<00:05:00.729> and<00:05:00.849> I<00:05:00.939> think

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:00.969 
ourselves with other people and I think

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:04.379 
ourselves with other people and I think
that<00:05:01.500> knowledge<00:05:02.500> learning<00:05:03.460> something<00:05:03.879> in
