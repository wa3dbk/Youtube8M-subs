you

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
you

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.709 
you
what<00:00:11.700> does<00:00:11.820> it<00:00:11.970> mean<00:00:12.240> that<00:00:12.410> the<00:00:13.410> most<00:00:13.620> abundant

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 
what does it mean that the most abundant

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.440 
what does it mean that the most abundant
organism<00:00:15.719> on<00:00:15.960> earth<00:00:16.020> by<00:00:16.380> far<00:00:16.910> are<00:00:17.910> viruses

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.450 
organism on earth by far are viruses

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.480 
organism on earth by far are viruses
this<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.439> why<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.560> call<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.950> book<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.160> planet<00:00:20.400> of

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
this is why I call the book a planet of

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.859 
this is why I call the book a planet of
viruses<00:00:20.910> if<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.689> want<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.960> add<00:00:22.140> up<00:00:23.869> organisms

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
viruses if you want to add up organisms

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.609 
viruses if you want to add up organisms
and<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.380> consider<00:00:25.710> viruses<00:00:26.130> organisms<00:00:27.619> viruses

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
and I consider viruses organisms viruses

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.109 
and I consider viruses organisms viruses
are<00:00:28.740> way<00:00:28.890> at<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.130> top<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.430> the<00:00:29.490> list<00:00:29.670> what<00:00:30.029> does

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
are way at the top of the list what does

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.450 
are way at the top of the list what does
that<00:00:30.150> mean<00:00:30.630> well<00:00:31.050> one<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:31.980> things<00:00:32.040> it

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
that mean well one of the things it

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.049 
that mean well one of the things it
means<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.970> that<00:00:33.230> viruses<00:00:34.230> are<00:00:35.059> planetary

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
means is that viruses are planetary

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.500 
means is that viruses are planetary
forces<00:00:37.250> so<00:00:38.870> here's<00:00:39.870> another<00:00:40.110> example<00:00:40.350> of

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
forces so here's another example of

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.640 
forces so here's another example of
viral<00:00:42.510> time<00:00:44.659> viruses<00:00:45.659> are<00:00:45.809> continually

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
viral time viruses are continually

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.020 
viral time viruses are continually
infecting<00:00:48.379> microbes<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.620> ocean<00:00:50.030> there's

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
infecting microbes in the ocean there's

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.149 
infecting microbes in the ocean there's
a<00:00:51.120> there's<00:00:51.540> a<00:00:51.629> vast<00:00:52.140> number<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.620> infections

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159 
a there's a vast number of infections

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.520 
a there's a vast number of infections
that<00:00:53.220> are<00:00:53.309> happening<00:00:53.879> every<00:00:54.210> second<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.019> in

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
that are happening every second and in

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.640 
that are happening every second and in
many<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.830> the<00:00:55.890> key<00:00:56.040> of<00:00:56.159> those<00:00:56.280> cases<00:00:56.729> they<00:00:56.970> are

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
many of the key of those cases they are

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.930 
many of the key of those cases they are
making<00:00:58.650> lots<00:00:58.799> of<00:00:58.920> copies<00:00:59.100> inside<00:00:59.580> those

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
into the ocean

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.460 
into the ocean
viruses<00:01:09.479> kill<00:01:10.190> half<00:01:11.190> of<00:01:11.640> all<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.360> bacteria<00:01:12.900> in

viruses kill half of all the bacteria in
the<00:01:13.560> ocean<00:01:14.359> every<00:01:15.359> day<00:01:17.000> now<00:01:18.000> what<00:01:18.390> happens<00:01:18.750> to

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
the ocean every day now what happens to

the ocean every day now what happens to
that<00:01:18.990> carbon<00:01:19.320> scientists<00:01:20.159> don't<00:01:20.250> really<00:01:20.369> know

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:20.609 
that carbon scientists don't really know

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:22.639 
that carbon scientists don't really know
because<00:01:20.909> they've<00:01:21.299> just<00:01:21.329> you<00:01:22.049> know<00:01:22.170> figured

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
because they've just you know figured

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:24.889 
because they've just you know figured
this<00:01:22.799> math<00:01:23.070> out<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> last<00:01:23.850> few<00:01:24.359> years<00:01:24.659> and

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
this math out in the last few years and

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.919 
this math out in the last few years and
they're<00:01:25.079> saying<00:01:25.350> wait<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.130> minute<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.939> is

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:27.929 
they're saying wait a minute this is

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:28.730 
they're saying wait a minute this is
incredible

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
incredible

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.219 
incredible
this<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.179> colossal<00:01:30.179> amount<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.509> carbon<00:01:30.899> now

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
this is a colossal amount of carbon now

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.770 
this is a colossal amount of carbon now
some<00:01:31.469> of<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.679> is<00:01:31.799> probably<00:01:32.189> sinking<00:01:33.149> down<00:01:33.359> to

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
some of it is probably sinking down to

some of it is probably sinking down to
the<00:01:33.869> ocean<00:01:34.469> floor<00:01:34.649> some<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.850> might

the ocean floor some of it might

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.389 
the ocean floor some of it might
actually<00:01:36.270> be<00:01:36.649> fertilizing<00:01:37.649> the<00:01:38.159> growth<00:01:38.369> of

of different things one of the things
may<00:01:46.890> be<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.189> climate<00:01:47.960> because<00:01:48.960> by<00:01:49.859> screwing<00:01:50.789> up

the carbon cycle as it were they're

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.389 
the carbon cycle as it were they're
affecting<00:01:54.240> how<00:01:54.450> much<00:01:54.659> carbon<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.950> the

can't<00:02:07.469> say<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:08.310> know<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.940> wasn't<00:02:09.210> for<00:02:09.420> viruses

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
can't say you know it wasn't for viruses

can't say you know it wasn't for viruses
the<00:02:10.020> earth<00:02:10.140> would<00:02:10.350> be<00:02:10.500> some<00:02:11.130> 1<00:02:11.220> degrees<00:02:11.490> warmer

the earth would be some 1 degrees warmer

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.920 
the earth would be some 1 degrees warmer
or<00:02:11.940> colder<00:02:12.210> because<00:02:12.870> there<00:02:13.290> are<00:02:13.440> many<00:02:13.950> complex

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
effects of these viruses we just don't

effects of these viruses we just don't
know<00:02:17.550> yet<00:02:17.580> but<00:02:17.970> we<00:02:18.030> know<00:02:18.120> it's<00:02:18.690> got<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:18.989> be<00:02:19.080> big

now<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:22.170> other<00:02:22.409> weird<00:02:22.739> thing<00:02:23.010> about<00:02:23.040> viruses

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
now the other weird thing about viruses

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.860 
now the other weird thing about viruses
in<00:02:23.879> the<00:02:23.970> ocean<00:02:24.299> and

something<00:02:25.290> I'll<00:02:25.440> get<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.769> in<00:02:26.190> more<00:02:26.489> detail<00:02:26.849> in

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
something I'll get to in more detail in

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.479 
something I'll get to in more detail in
a<00:02:27.030> second<00:02:27.420> is<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.409> not<00:02:28.620> all<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:29.010> viruses<00:02:29.310> are

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
a second is that not all the viruses are

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.800 
a second is that not all the viruses are
killing<00:02:30.590> their<00:02:31.590> hosts<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.250> lot<00:02:32.670> of<00:02:32.790> viruses<00:02:33.120> I'm

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
killing their hosts a lot of viruses I'm

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.039 
killing their hosts a lot of viruses I'm
actually<00:02:34.580> regularly<00:02:35.580> insert<00:02:36.269> their<00:02:36.569> their

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
actually regularly insert their their

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.070 
actually regularly insert their their
genes<00:02:37.409> into<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.310> microbial<00:02:38.940> host<00:02:39.239> and<00:02:39.720> that's

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
genes into a microbial host and that's

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.770 
genes into a microbial host and that's
it<00:02:40.459> they<00:02:41.459> just<00:02:41.489> hang<00:02:41.819> out<00:02:41.970> now<00:02:42.269> they<00:02:42.390> can<00:02:42.540> still

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
it they just hang out now they can still

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.420 
it they just hang out now they can still
every<00:02:43.019> now<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.260> then<00:02:43.319> make<00:02:43.590> new<00:02:43.799> viruses<00:02:44.250> and

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
every now and then make new viruses and

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.600 
every now and then make new viruses and
pop<00:02:45.000> out<00:02:45.180> if<00:02:45.360> they<00:02:45.480> need<00:02:45.659> to<00:02:45.920> but<00:02:46.920> pretty<00:02:47.430> much

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
pop out if they need to but pretty much

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.800 
pop out if they need to but pretty much
they're<00:02:47.849> along<00:02:48.120> for<00:02:48.329> the<00:02:48.390> ride

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
they're along for the ride

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.050 
they're along for the ride
and<00:02:51.170> when<00:02:52.170> these<00:02:52.620> viruses<00:02:53.190> go<00:02:53.489> from<00:02:53.700> hosts<00:02:53.909> of

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
and when these viruses go from hosts of

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.170 
and when these viruses go from hosts of
folks<00:02:54.269> they<00:02:54.659> can<00:02:54.840> sometimes<00:02:55.049> pick<00:02:55.500> up<00:02:56.180> host

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
folks they can sometimes pick up host

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.809 
folks they can sometimes pick up host
genes<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:58.650> carry<00:02:58.950> them<00:02:59.099> along<00:02:59.190> with<00:02:59.370> them<00:02:59.640> and

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
genes and carry them along with them and

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.759 
genes and carry them along with them and
then<00:03:00.299> after<00:03:00.599> a<00:03:00.629> while<00:03:00.690> they<00:03:00.810> can<00:03:01.079> create<00:03:01.560> kind

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
then after a while they can create kind

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.520 
then after a while they can create kind
of<00:03:01.859> a<00:03:01.980> whole<00:03:02.359> kind<00:03:03.359> of<00:03:03.480> shopping<00:03:03.870> cart<00:03:04.230> full<00:03:04.470> of

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
of a whole kind of shopping cart full of

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.020 
of a whole kind of shopping cart full of
genes<00:03:04.829> which<00:03:05.040> is<00:03:05.129> where<00:03:05.220> they<00:03:05.280> can<00:03:05.400> bring<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.760> a

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
genes which is where they can bring to a

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.199 
genes which is where they can bring to a
new<00:03:06.120> host<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:07.129> they're<00:03:08.129> actually<00:03:08.579> some

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
new host and they're actually some

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.630 
new host and they're actually some
viruses<00:03:09.750> floating<00:03:10.200> around<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.500> ocean<00:03:10.859> that

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
viruses floating around the ocean that

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.699 
viruses floating around the ocean that
carry<00:03:11.970> a<00:03:12.060> whole<00:03:12.420> bunch<00:03:12.659> of<00:03:12.780> genes<00:03:13.049> for

carry a whole bunch of genes for

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.580 
carry a whole bunch of genes for
photosynthesis<00:03:15.230> now<00:03:16.230> they<00:03:16.349> can't

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
photosynthesis now they can't

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.949

photosynthesize on their own what they

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.349 
photosynthesize on their own what they
do<00:03:19.109> is<00:03:19.500> they<00:03:19.769> go<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.220> they<00:03:20.310> find<00:03:20.640> a<00:03:22.010> bacterium

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
do is they go and they find a bacterium

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.240 
do is they go and they find a bacterium
they<00:03:24.359> infect<00:03:24.840> it<00:03:25.019> they<00:03:25.290> insert<00:03:25.709> their<00:03:25.920> genes

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
they infect it they insert their genes

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.720 
they infect it they insert their genes
