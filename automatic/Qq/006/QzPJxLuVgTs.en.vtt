here

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.670 
here
actually<00:01:35.610> had<00:01:36.030> rusted<00:01:36.479> away<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.530> course

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
actually had rusted away and of course

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.440 
actually had rusted away and of course
the<00:01:37.860> ideal<00:01:38.159> thing<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.729> get<00:01:38.820> another<00:01:39.090> spring

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
the ideal thing is to get another spring

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.109 
the ideal thing is to get another spring
nut<00:01:39.840> but<00:01:40.200> with<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.159> time<00:01:41.400> constraints<00:01:42.000> here

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
nut but with the time constraints here

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.060 
nut but with the time constraints here
what<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.420> did<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.020> if<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.439> can<00:01:43.590> look<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:44.040> just

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
what I did is I if you can look I just

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.190 
what I did is I if you can look I just
took<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.610> washer<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.270> I'll<00:01:45.390> just<00:01:45.600> stuff<00:01:45.869> under

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
took a washer and I'll just stuff under

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.810 
took a washer and I'll just stuff under
there<00:01:46.350> just<00:01:46.649> kind<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.890> wedge<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.430> thing<00:01:47.670> to

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
there just kind of wedge this thing to

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.300 
there just kind of wedge this thing to
kind<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.060> hold<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.570> place<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.200> then<00:01:50.040> you

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
kind of hold it in place and then you

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.560 
kind of hold it in place and then you
know<00:01:50.430> make<00:01:50.579> sure<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.909> boat<00:01:51.060> will<00:01:51.240> actually

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
know make sure the boat will actually

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.389 
know make sure the boat will actually
screw<00:01:51.810> down<00:01:51.990> in<00:01:52.229> there<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:52.619> hopefully<00:01:53.130> we'll

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
screw down in there so hopefully we'll

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.920 
screw down in there so hopefully we'll
get<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.520> bed<00:01:53.729> up<00:01:53.970> here<00:01:54.030> it's<00:01:54.360> not<00:01:54.509> gonna<00:01:54.659> sit

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
get to bed up here it's not gonna sit

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.870 
get to bed up here it's not gonna sit
there<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.170> move<00:01:55.799> this<00:01:56.009> off<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.579> if<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.729> does

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
there and move this off and if it does

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.010 
there and move this off and if it does
then<00:01:57.149> we<00:01:57.329> won't<00:01:57.479> be<00:01:57.600> able<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.780> get<00:01:57.899> this

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
then we won't be able to get this

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.510 
then we won't be able to get this
Boulder<00:01:58.439> same<00:01:59.130> way

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520

mention about this here tail light
wiring<00:04:59.970> harness<00:05:00.540> assembly<00:05:00.690> I<00:05:01.230> did<00:05:01.560> mention<00:05:01.830> it

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
wiring harness assembly I did mention it

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.390 
wiring harness assembly I did mention it
right<00:05:02.310> up<00:05:02.400> in<00:05:02.550> front<00:05:02.580> in<00:05:03.000> the<00:05:03.150> video<00:05:03.950> the<00:05:04.950> parts

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
right up in front in the video the parts

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.820 
right up in front in the video the parts
that<00:05:05.790> you<00:05:06.150> don't<00:05:06.180> you<00:05:06.480> it's<00:05:06.780> not<00:05:06.990> unnecessary

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
that you don't you it's not unnecessary

that you don't you it's not unnecessary
to<00:05:08.010> see<00:05:08.190> that<00:05:08.400> so<00:05:08.580> I<00:05:08.610> just<00:05:08.700> took<00:05:09.030> that<00:05:09.210> part<00:05:09.419> out

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
to see that so I just took that part out

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.409 
to see that so I just took that part out
however<00:05:10.650> I<00:05:10.740> did<00:05:11.010> if<00:05:11.220> you<00:05:11.250> go<00:05:11.430> back<00:05:11.640> to<00:05:11.880> removing

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
however I did if you go back to removing

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
removing the bed as I found out later

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.830 
removing the bed as I found out later
now<00:05:24.090> I<00:05:24.150> do

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
notes I went back into the removing the

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.330 
notes I went back into the removing the

that whole procedure of removing that

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.540 
that whole procedure of removing that
harness<00:05:33.840> then<00:05:34.020> it's<00:05:34.169> not<00:05:34.320> necessary<00:05:35.040> the<00:05:35.280> only

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
harness then it's not necessary the only

harness then it's not necessary the only
thing<00:05:35.729> you<00:05:35.880> have<00:05:36.060> to<00:05:36.210> do<00:05:36.389> is<00:05:36.720> remove<00:05:37.229> the

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
connector for the you know the taillight

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.629 
connector for the you know the taillight
wiring<00:05:41.100> harness<00:05:41.580> assembly<00:05:42.110> so<00:05:43.460> this<00:05:44.460> was

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
wiring harness assembly so this was

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:46.370 
wiring harness assembly so this was
actually<00:05:44.820> a<00:05:45.060> pretty<00:05:45.240> easy<00:05:45.540> project<00:05:45.870> you<00:05:46.229> know

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
actually a pretty easy project you know

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.620 
actually a pretty easy project you know
actually<00:05:47.160> when<00:05:47.280> you<00:05:47.340> get<00:05:47.430> down<00:05:47.610> to<00:05:47.850> this<00:05:48.360> bed

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
actually when you get down to this bed

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.939 
actually when you get down to this bed
it's<00:05:48.960> only<00:05:49.110> six<00:05:49.560> bolts<00:05:50.030> three<00:05:51.030> for<00:05:51.360> the<00:05:51.479> filler

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:51.949 
it's only six bolts three for the filler

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:54.260 
it's only six bolts three for the filler
six<00:05:52.949> for<00:05:53.160> the<00:05:53.250> bay<00:05:53.400> it<00:05:53.610> and<00:05:53.790> then<00:05:53.970> of<00:05:54.060> course

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
six for the bay it and then of course

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.760 
six for the bay it and then of course
the<00:05:54.449> harness<00:05:54.720> connector<00:05:55.169> and<00:05:55.290> this<00:05:55.350> baby

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
the harness connector and this baby

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.810 
the harness connector and this baby
comes<00:05:56.100> right<00:05:56.280> off<00:05:56.310> pretty<00:05:56.940> simple<00:05:58.700> it<00:05:59.700> was<00:05:59.790> a

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
comes right off pretty simple it was a

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.600 
comes right off pretty simple it was a
pretty<00:05:59.970> fun<00:06:00.060> project<00:06:00.720> I<00:06:00.840> enjoyed<00:06:01.229> it

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
pretty fun project I enjoyed it

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.980 
pretty fun project I enjoyed it
hopefully<00:06:02.610> you<00:06:03.030> you<00:06:03.360> picked<00:06:03.600> up<00:06:03.750> some<00:06:03.780> things

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
hopefully you you picked up some things

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.020 
hopefully you you picked up some things
there<00:06:04.530> maybe<00:06:05.310> make<00:06:05.550> it<00:06:05.580> easier<00:06:06.000> for

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
there maybe make it easier for

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.850 
there maybe make it easier for
troubleshooting<00:06:06.600> your<00:06:07.050> vehicles<00:06:07.680> or

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860

something<00:06:08.280> similar<00:06:08.610> may<00:06:09.419> be<00:06:09.479> similar<00:06:09.840> wiring

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.410 
something similar may be similar wiring

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.580 
something similar may be similar wiring

going<00:06:27.060> to<00:06:27.120> conclude<00:06:27.419> this<00:06:27.570> here<00:06:28.110> video<00:06:28.889> series

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
going to conclude this here video series

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.469 
going to conclude this here video series
this<00:06:29.970> is<00:06:30.120> the<00:06:30.240> end<00:06:30.419> of<00:06:30.600> it<00:06:30.810> so<00:06:32.000> we<00:06:33.000> just<00:06:33.030> have<00:06:33.360> to

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479 
this is the end of it so we just have to

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:34.909 
this is the end of it so we just have to
wait<00:06:33.630> for<00:06:33.840> the<00:06:33.930> next<00:06:34.200> thing<00:06:34.350> to<00:06:34.410> break<00:06:34.650> down

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919 
wait for the next thing to break down

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:36.680 
wait for the next thing to break down
and<00:06:35.250> if<00:06:35.400> something<00:06:35.760> comes<00:06:35.970> down<00:06:36.180> breaks<00:06:36.479> down

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.690 
and if something comes down breaks down

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.469 
and if something comes down breaks down
then<00:06:37.050> we'll<00:06:37.889> start<00:06:38.160> looking<00:06:38.340> at<00:06:38.639> it<00:06:38.789> I<00:06:38.940> think

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 
then we'll start looking at it I think

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:42.830 
then we'll start looking at it I think
we<00:06:39.570> have<00:06:39.720> a<00:06:39.750> guy<00:06:39.900> with<00:06:39.960> two<00:06:40.200> thousand<00:06:40.800> one<00:06:41.840> two

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 
we have a guy with two thousand one two

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.270 
we have a guy with two thousand one two
thousand<00:06:43.289> one<00:06:44.270> both<00:06:45.270> swaggin<00:06:45.780> Jenna<00:06:46.410> so<00:06:47.160> we

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 
thousand one both swaggin Jenna so we
