00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
imagine when you're bending the vibrato

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.469 
imagine when you're bending the vibrato
you've<00:01:02.480> been<00:01:02.690> anybody<00:01:03.019> the<00:01:03.170> string<00:01:03.469> and<00:01:04.479> this

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
you've been anybody the string and this

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.609 
you've been anybody the string and this
is<00:01:05.600> the<00:01:05.720> new<00:01:05.899> line<00:01:06.200> of<00:01:06.229> it<00:01:07.009> being<00:01:07.190> in<00:01:07.399> tune<00:01:07.640> yeah

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
is the new line of it being in tune yeah

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.650 
is the new line of it being in tune yeah
instead<00:01:09.619> of<00:01:09.649> coming<00:01:09.950> down<00:01:10.130> and<00:01:10.850> then<00:01:11.240> back<00:01:11.270> up

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
instead of coming down and then back up

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.630 
instead of coming down and then back up
to<00:01:11.780> that<00:01:11.929> same<00:01:12.140> point<00:01:12.350> and<00:01:12.679> then<00:01:12.860> down<00:01:13.100> coming

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
to that same point and then down coming

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.480 
to that same point and then down coming
back<00:01:13.789> up<00:01:13.970> that<00:01:14.210> same<00:01:14.840> coin<00:01:15.140> try<00:01:16.039> to<00:01:16.100> swirl

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
back up that same coin try to swirl

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.850 
back up that same coin try to swirl
around<00:01:16.520> it<00:01:17.149> so<00:01:17.659> if<00:01:17.810> this<00:01:17.990> is<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.170> line<00:01:18.470> of<00:01:18.740> it

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
around it so if this is the line of it

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.699 
around it so if this is the line of it
being<00:01:19.009> into<00:01:19.340> you<00:01:19.490> bend<00:01:19.670> up<00:01:19.850> to<00:01:19.970> here<00:01:20.679> apply<00:01:21.679> the

00:01:21.699 --> 00:01:21.709 
being into you bend up to here apply the

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:24.430 
being into you bend up to here apply the
vibrato<00:01:22.099> this<00:01:22.369> way<00:01:23.020> okay<00:01:24.020> that<00:01:24.229> makes<00:01:24.349> sense

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
vibrato this way okay that makes sense

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.900 
vibrato this way okay that makes sense
you<00:01:24.830> understand<00:01:25.310> decide<00:01:25.550> with<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:25.759> money

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
you understand decide with the money

in<00:01:37.819> both<00:01:38.060> directions<00:01:38.360> mm-hmm<00:01:41.380> this<00:01:42.380> let's

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
in both directions mm-hmm this let's

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.529 
in both directions mm-hmm this let's
start<00:01:43.039> with<00:01:43.099> half<00:01:43.310> steps<00:01:43.640> those<00:01:44.149> are<00:01:44.270> easier

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
start with half steps those are easier

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.630 
start with half steps those are easier
Ben's<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:44.899> control

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:02:02.520 

I<00:01:58.590> think<00:01:59.590> I<00:02:00.570> when<00:02:01.570> I<00:02:01.600> bent<00:02:01.900> and<00:02:02.110> doobie<00:02:02.320> brother

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
I think I when I bent and doobie brother

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.780 
I think I when I bent and doobie brother
brother<00:02:02.860> I<00:02:03.040> good<00:02:03.420> omen<00:02:04.420> down<00:02:05.170> dumb<00:02:05.530> yeah<00:02:05.920> under

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
brother I good omen down dumb yeah under

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.639 
brother I good omen down dumb yeah under
than<00:02:06.940> that<00:02:07.119> then<00:02:07.300> talking<00:02:07.780> notes<00:02:08.080> right<00:02:08.380> and<00:02:08.560> I

think that's why you prefer this sounds

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.310 
think that's why you prefer this sounds
only<00:02:33.190> down<00:02:33.400> more<00:02:34.360> don't<00:02:34.570> I<00:02:34.750> know<00:02:37.200> it<00:02:38.200> sounds

only down more don't I know it sounds

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.390 
only down more don't I know it sounds
only<00:02:38.650> down<00:02:40.440> take<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.560> bar<00:02:41.739> and<00:02:41.920> take<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.250> bar

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
only down take the bar and take the bar

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.000 
only down take the bar and take the bar
and<00:02:42.489> put<00:02:42.610> it<00:02:42.670> over<00:02:42.730> here<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:44.530> do<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:44.830> same

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
and put it over here and do the same

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:54.979 
and put it over here and do the same
thing<00:02:48.900> well

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.670 

so<00:02:55.989> what's<00:02:56.110> happening<00:02:56.319> now<00:02:56.379> is<00:02:56.470> you're

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
so what's happening now is you're

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.160 
so what's happening now is you're
bending<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:57.819> brothers<00:02:58.209> on<00:02:58.330> that<00:02:58.480> side<00:02:58.720> the

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
bending the brothers on that side the

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.110 
bending the brothers on that side the
bridge<00:02:59.379> only<00:02:59.860> goes<00:03:00.040> up<00:03:00.069> at<00:03:00.459> in<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:00.640> back<00:03:00.849> to

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
bridge only goes up at in the back to

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.420 
bridge only goes up at in the back to
that<00:03:01.269> same<00:03:01.420> when<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.349> borrower's<00:03:02.920> over<00:03:03.129> here

that same when the borrower's over here
it's<00:03:04.680> coming<00:03:05.680> down<00:03:06.000> no<00:03:07.410> you<00:03:08.410> can<00:03:08.560> do<00:03:08.680> it<00:03:08.709> both

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
it's coming down no you can do it both

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.570 
it's coming down no you can do it both
directions<00:03:09.370> if<00:03:10.300> you<00:03:10.540> if<00:03:11.290> you<00:03:11.500> have<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.400> bar

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
directions if you if you have the bar

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.710 
directions if you if you have the bar
here<00:03:13.060> and<00:03:13.269> as<00:03:13.629> you<00:03:13.690> push<00:03:14.019> down<00:03:14.049> if<00:03:14.440> you<00:03:14.560> pull<00:03:14.860> up

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
here and as you push down if you pull up

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.030 
here and as you push down if you pull up
so<00:03:16.720> sort<00:03:16.900> of<00:03:16.959> releasing<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.440> bar<00:03:17.709> to<00:03:17.890> its

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
so sort of releasing the bar to its

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.000 
so sort of releasing the bar to its
natural<00:03:18.190> state<00:03:18.459> if<00:03:18.819> you<00:03:18.940> pull<00:03:19.330> it<00:03:19.510> yep<00:03:20.440> yawn

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
natural state if you pull it yep yawn

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.229 
natural state if you pull it yep yawn
this<00:03:21.220> going<00:03:21.489> both<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.819> right<00:03:21.940> then<00:03:22.060> it<00:03:22.150> would

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
this going both the right then it would

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:28.620 
this going both the right then it would
be<00:03:22.330> going<00:03:22.540> down<00:03:22.930> and<00:03:23.290> up<00:03:23.700> okay<00:03:27.360> but<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:28.480> right

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
be going down and up okay but the right

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.930 
be going down and up okay but the right
it's<00:03:28.840> really<00:03:29.200> wide<00:03:29.470> was<00:03:29.950> swirling<00:03:30.340> around<00:03:30.640> the

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
it's really wide was swirling around the

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.330 
it's really wide was swirling around the
notes<00:03:31.180> different<00:03:31.630> type<00:03:31.780> of<00:03:31.810> expression<00:03:32.340> that

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
notes different type of expression that

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.190 
notes different type of expression that
only<00:03:33.549> going<00:03:33.940> in<00:03:34.060> one<00:03:34.239> direction<00:03:34.269> i<00:03:34.840> think<00:03:35.079> if

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
only going in one direction i think if

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.449 
only going in one direction i think if
you<00:03:35.319> if<00:03:35.590> you<00:03:36.160> had<00:03:36.459> that<00:03:36.849> to<00:03:37.780> add<00:03:37.959> to<00:03:38.470> the

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
you if you had that to add to the

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.309 
you if you had that to add to the
vibrato<00:03:40.060> things<00:03:40.510> that<00:03:40.690> you're<00:03:40.810> doing<00:03:40.840> already

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
vibrato things that you're doing already

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:42.990 
vibrato things that you're doing already
we<00:03:41.620> just<00:03:41.829> had<00:03:41.950> another<00:03:42.190> dimension<00:03:42.549> of<00:03:42.790> things

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
we just had another dimension of things

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.650 
we just had another dimension of things
that<00:03:43.209> could<00:03:43.360> add<00:03:43.540> in<00:03:43.720> there<00:03:43.900> you<00:03:44.709> know<00:03:44.829> that's

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
that could add in there you know that's

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:55.230 
that could add in there you know that's
going<00:03:46.660> to<00:03:46.870> be<00:03:47.049> really<00:03:47.200> cool<00:03:47.500> for<00:03:47.560> you

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.300
