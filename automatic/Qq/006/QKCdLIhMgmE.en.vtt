00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
another couple of variations you can do

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.840 
another couple of variations you can do
if<00:00:41.440> you<00:00:41.710> want<00:00:41.829> to<00:00:41.890> get<00:00:41.980> fancy<00:00:42.129> and<00:00:42.489> it<00:00:42.610> really

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
if you want to get fancy and it really

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.279 
if you want to get fancy and it really

missing<00:00:44.590> it's<00:00:44.739> in<00:00:44.829> barley<00:00:45.070> player<00:00:45.280> and<00:00:45.460> it's

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
missing it's in barley player and it's

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.220 
missing it's in barley player and it's
just<00:00:45.730> you<00:00:45.820> in<00:00:45.940> a<00:00:46.000> conga<00:00:46.239> player<00:00:46.450> then<00:00:46.960> you<00:00:47.110> can

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
start to do some of these these patterns

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.040 
start to do some of these these patterns
because<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.940> you<00:00:52.239> know<00:00:52.329> you're<00:00:52.480> not<00:00:52.539> stepping

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
first pattern we're going to look at and

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.650 
first pattern we're going to look at and
there's<00:00:57.640> a<00:00:57.670> PDF<00:00:57.820> attached<00:00:58.210> to<00:00:58.300> this<00:00:58.390> so<00:00:58.510> make

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
there's a PDF attached to this so make

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
what I mean the right hand sort of does

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.880 
what I mean the right hand sort of does
all<00:01:25.540> the<00:01:25.630> main<00:01:25.840> accents<00:01:26.439> and<00:01:26.530> all<00:01:26.650> that

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
all the main accents and all that

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.560 
all the main accents and all that
creates<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:27.400> main<00:01:27.549> pattern<00:01:27.759> left<00:01:28.360> hand

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
creates the main pattern left hand

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.179 
creates the main pattern left hand
literally<00:01:28.869> just<00:01:29.140> feels<00:01:29.590> and<00:01:29.890> sounded<00:01:30.100> out

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
literally just feels and sounded out

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.520 
literally just feels and sounded out
okay<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:31.689> this<00:01:31.810> is<00:01:31.960> what<00:01:32.110> this<00:01:32.200> would<00:01:32.380> sound

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
okay so this is what this would sound

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:33.929 
okay so this is what this would sound
like<00:01:32.619> this<00:01:32.799> is<00:01:32.890> a<00:01:32.920> full<00:01:33.220> cast<00:01:33.400> kind<00:01:33.610> of<00:01:33.670> pattern

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
like this is a full cast kind of pattern

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:49.670 
like this is a full cast kind of pattern
both<00:01:34.900> hands<00:01:35.110> here<00:01:35.409> we<00:01:35.470> go<00:01:35.590> one<00:01:35.829> two

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.969 

okay<00:01:50.680> so<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:52.570> is<00:01:52.600> very<00:01:52.960> very<00:01:53.229> cool<00:01:53.530> on<00:01:53.830> its

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
okay so that is very very cool on its

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.530 
okay so that is very very cool on its
own<00:01:54.159> and<00:01:54.460> you<00:01:54.490> can<00:01:54.550> do<00:01:54.790> that<00:01:54.970> with<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.390> bass

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
own and you can do that with the bass

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.430 
own and you can do that with the bass
drum<00:01:55.570> part<00:01:55.930> as<00:01:56.020> well

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
drum part as well

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.050 
drum part as well
the<00:01:56.710> only<00:01:56.830> issue<00:01:57.100> there<00:01:57.490> is<00:01:57.640> that<00:01:57.729> you're<00:01:57.880> now

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
the only issue there is that you're now

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.790 
the only issue there is that you're now

basically<00:03:36.820> it's<00:03:37.030> two<00:03:37.989> on<00:03:38.829> the<00:03:39.160> rim<00:03:39.340> and<00:03:39.549> then

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
basically it's two on the rim and then

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.490 
basically it's two on the rim and then
four<00:03:40.390> on<00:03:41.140> the<00:03:41.410> drum<00:03:41.620> so<00:03:41.950> one<00:03:42.160> two<00:03:42.640> three<00:03:43.120> four

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500
