really wanting a big sound some of the

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.990 
really wanting a big sound some of the
times<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.500> think<00:00:28.980> I've<00:00:29.250> been<00:00:29.460> coming<00:00:29.760> here

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
times so I think I've been coming here

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.229 
times so I think I've been coming here
now<00:00:30.289> 12<00:00:31.289> years<00:00:32.000> probably<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.620> it's<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:35.239> think

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
now 12 years probably and it's I think

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.119 
now 12 years probably and it's I think
for<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.660> type<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:36.930> music<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.649> we're<00:00:37.860> doing

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
for the type of music that we're doing

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.299 
for the type of music that we're doing
it's<00:00:38.850> it's<00:00:39.180> larger<00:00:39.719> than<00:00:39.870> life<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.980> we

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
it's it's larger than life so we

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.420 
it's it's larger than life so we
naturally<00:00:41.489> thought<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.239> coming<00:00:42.510> here<00:00:42.840> and

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
naturally thought of coming here and

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.799 
naturally thought of coming here and
recording<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:44.610> we've<00:00:45.149> been<00:00:45.300> dealing<00:00:45.450> lots

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
recording it so we've been dealing lots

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.540 
recording it so we've been dealing lots
of<00:00:45.960> sessions<00:00:46.110> we're<00:00:46.379> doing<00:00:46.559> Orchestra<00:00:47.129> well

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
of sessions we're doing Orchestra well

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.560 
of sessions we're doing Orchestra well
today<00:00:47.940> we're<00:00:48.120> doing<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.329> big<00:00:48.539> band<00:00:48.980> and<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.910> think

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
today we're doing a big band and I think

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.630 
today we're doing a big band and I think
also<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.989> get<00:00:52.260> quite<00:00:52.530> excited<00:00:52.949> when<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.460> come

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
also you get quite excited when you come

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.670 
also you get quite excited when you come
here<00:00:53.850> also

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
here also

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:07.910 
here also
there's<00:00:55.680> always<00:00:55.860> another<00:00:56.219> reason

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.380 

I<00:01:09.200> mean<00:01:10.200> why<00:01:10.650> do<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.890> think<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.640> many<00:01:11.790> schools

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
I mean why do you think so many schools

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.320 
I mean why do you think so many schools
are<00:01:12.930> actually<00:01:13.470> recorded<00:01:14.190> in<00:01:14.370> London<00:01:14.970> itself

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
are actually recorded in London itself

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.210 
are actually recorded in London itself
because<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:16.080> mean<00:01:16.229> most<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.920> these<00:01:17.010> are

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
because I mean most of these are

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.149 
because I mean most of these are
American<00:01:17.670> maybe<00:01:17.960> you'd<00:01:18.960> imagine<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:19.950> they

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
American maybe you'd imagine that they

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.990 
American maybe you'd imagine that they
would<00:01:20.310> be<00:01:21.290> recorded<00:01:22.290> out<00:01:22.470> there<00:01:22.710> but<00:01:23.010> by<00:01:23.790> and

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
would be recorded out there but by and

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.300 
would be recorded out there but by and
large<00:01:24.060> London<00:01:25.050> is<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.259> place<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.860> come

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
large London is the place to come

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.920 
large London is the place to come
yes<00:01:26.660> that<00:01:27.660> well<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.500> think<00:01:28.740> it's<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.190> same<00:01:29.930> the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
yes that well I think it's the same the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.920 
yes that well I think it's the same the
reason<00:01:31.409> for<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:31.860> it's<00:01:32.190> the<00:01:32.550> standard<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
reason for it is it's the standard the

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.200 
reason for it is it's the standard the
musicians<00:01:34.560> are<00:01:34.830> unbelievable<00:01:35.640> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.219 
facilities are unbelievable
there's<00:01:38.369> nowhere<00:01:38.550> in<00:01:38.759> Los<00:01:38.970> Angeles<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.570> has

to sit down and play this piece of music

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.889 
to sit down and play this piece of music
that<00:01:59.190> they've<00:01:59.399> never<00:01:59.640> seen<00:01:59.940> before<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.840> a

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
that they've never seen before in a

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.600 
that they've never seen before in a
couple<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.259> tapes<00:02:01.470> and<00:02:01.740> make<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.009> sound<00:02:02.310> like

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
couple of tapes and make it sound like

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.850 
couple of tapes and make it sound like
they've<00:02:02.940> been<00:02:02.970> practicing<00:02:03.300> it<00:02:03.720> for<00:02:03.899> half<00:02:04.679> a

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
they've been practicing it for half a

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.419 
they've been practicing it for half a
year<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:06.060> really<00:02:06.720> is<00:02:06.929> the<00:02:07.350> quality<00:02:07.830> it's

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
year so it really is the quality it's

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.710 
year so it really is the quality it's
the<00:02:08.670> best<00:02:08.880> in<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.179> world

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
the best in the world

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.990 
the best in the world
so<00:02:10.350> when<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.560> comes<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.860> composing<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.519> movie<00:02:11.880> at

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
so when it comes to composing a movie at

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.140 
so when it comes to composing a movie at
what<00:02:12.180> point<00:02:12.480> do<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.750> get<00:02:13.079> involved<00:02:14.150> sometimes

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
what point do you get involved sometimes

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.720 
what point do you get involved sometimes
I<00:02:15.959> get<00:02:16.260> brought<00:02:16.500> in<00:02:16.739> two<00:02:16.950> weeks<00:02:17.190> before<00:02:17.610> it's

I get brought in two weeks before it's

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.850 
I get brought in two weeks before it's
finished<00:02:17.940> because<00:02:18.870> they've<00:02:19.140> forgotten<00:02:19.440> about

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
finished because they've forgotten about

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.640 
finished because they've forgotten about
the<00:02:20.070> music<00:02:20.549> and<00:02:21.329> then<00:02:21.780> sometimes<00:02:22.380> you<00:02:22.560> get

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
the music and then sometimes you get

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.890 
the music and then sometimes you get
brought<00:02:22.890> in<00:02:23.100> right<00:02:23.340> at<00:02:23.549> the<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.810> beginning<00:02:24.810> of

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
brought in right at the the beginning of

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.990 
brought in right at the the beginning of
it<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.260> difficult<00:02:25.590> thing<00:02:25.739> with<00:02:26.130> animation<00:02:26.880> is

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
it the difficult thing with animation is

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.400 
it the difficult thing with animation is
that<00:02:27.209> they<00:02:28.100> bear<00:02:29.100> on<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.310> for<00:02:29.610> years<00:02:30.000> for<00:02:30.989> years

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
that they bear on it for years for years

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.699 
that they bear on it for years for years
sometimes<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.970> I<00:02:33.269> think<00:02:33.660> on<00:02:34.049> Penguin's<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.590> was

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
sometimes so I think on Penguin's I was

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.130 
sometimes so I think on Penguin's I was
brought<00:02:34.860> in<00:02:35.040> about<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.459> year<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.630> half<00:02:36.900> ago

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
brought in about a year and a half ago

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.199 
brought in about a year and a half ago
so<00:02:37.590> one<00:02:38.250> of<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.489> scenes<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:38.880> we've<00:02:39.090> been

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
so one of the scenes that we've been

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.720 
so one of the scenes that we've been
recording<00:02:39.540> today<00:02:40.019> I<00:02:40.290> think<00:02:40.890> I<00:02:40.950> first<00:02:41.190> wrote<00:02:41.519> it

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
recording today I think I first wrote it

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.940 
recording today I think I first wrote it
the<00:02:42.180> first<00:02:42.450> time<00:02:42.720> about<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.350> year<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.769> half

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
the first time about a year and a half

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.979 
the first time about a year and a half
ago<00:02:44.100> and<00:02:44.370> then<00:02:44.730> I<00:02:44.760> wrote<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.209> about<00:02:45.239> 30<00:02:45.630> times

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
ago and then I wrote it about 30 times

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.680 
ago and then I wrote it about 30 times
more<00:02:46.170> since<00:02:46.650> then<00:02:46.860> so<00:02:47.220> they<00:02:47.579> presumably<00:02:47.970> you

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
more since then so they presumably you

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.410 
more since then so they presumably you
go<00:02:48.840> through<00:02:49.079> the<00:02:49.200> script<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:50.310> then<00:02:50.940> you<00:02:51.090> start

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
go through the script and then you start

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.470 
go through the script and then you start
scoring<00:02:51.870> or<00:02:52.019> do<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.230> get<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.560> see<00:02:53.269> you<00:02:54.269> get

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
scoring or do you get to see you get

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.600 
scoring or do you get to see you get
bits<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:54.959> it<00:02:55.140> it's<00:02:55.440> what<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:55.980> difficult<00:02:56.400> thing

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
bits of it it's what the difficult thing

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.220 
bits of it it's what the difficult thing
is<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:56.880> that<00:02:56.940> it's<00:02:57.120> not<00:02:57.299> like<00:02:57.480> a<00:02:57.510> feature<00:02:57.930> film

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
is is that it's not like a feature film

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.949 
is is that it's not like a feature film
with<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.500> feature<00:02:58.709> film<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.640> film<00:02:59.940> it<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.299> it's

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
with a feature film you film it and it's

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:01.430 
with a feature film you film it and it's
done

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
done

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.220 
done
but<00:03:02.100> with<00:03:02.250> animation<00:03:02.970> it's<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.239> long<00:03:03.540> process

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
but with animation it's a long process

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.140 
but with animation it's a long process
because<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:05.010> can<00:03:05.160> change<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.579> character<00:03:06.060> if

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
because you can change the character if

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.810 
because you can change the character if
you<00:03:06.269> wish<00:03:06.480> last<00:03:07.170> minute<00:03:08.690> no<00:03:09.690> no<00:03:10.220> no<00:03:11.220> no<00:03:11.519> no<00:03:11.640> no

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
you wish last minute no no no no no no

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.699 
you wish last minute no no no no no no
because<00:03:11.970> it<00:03:12.209> makes<00:03:12.390> it<00:03:12.540> more<00:03:12.690> fun<00:03:12.959> I<00:03:12.989> think<00:03:13.230> I

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
because it makes it more fun I think I

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.449 
because it makes it more fun I think I
think<00:03:14.220> it's<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.459> I<00:03:14.489> think<00:03:14.760> it's<00:03:15.600> it's<00:03:15.920> we<00:03:16.920> were

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
think it's the I think it's it's we were

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.460 
think it's the I think it's it's we were
used<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:17.940> this<00:03:18.180> happening<00:03:18.690> now<00:03:18.900> with

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
used to this happening now with

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.680 
used to this happening now with
where<00:03:20.040> things<00:03:20.370> change<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.970> cut<00:03:21.180> can<00:03:21.420> change

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
where things change the cut can change

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.600 
where things change the cut can change
and<00:03:22.020> that<00:03:22.470> scene<00:03:22.800> that<00:03:22.830> was<00:03:23.130> originally

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
and that scene that was originally

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.910 
and that scene that was originally
theirs<00:03:23.880> now<00:03:24.300> in<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.630> total<00:03:25.020> different<00:03:25.350> place<00:03:25.560> so

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
theirs now in a total different place so

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.550 
theirs now in a total different place so
you<00:03:26.370> get<00:03:26.850> used<00:03:27.090> to<00:03:27.210> it<00:03:27.330> and<00:03:27.810> it<00:03:27.960> and<00:03:28.080> I<00:03:28.140> think<00:03:28.260> it

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
you get used to it and it and I think it

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.580 
you get used to it and it and I think it
makes<00:03:29.010> that<00:03:29.360> improves<00:03:30.360> the<00:03:30.660> music<00:03:31.080> having<00:03:31.320> it

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
makes that improves the music having it

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.960 
makes that improves the music having it
different<00:03:32.630> changes<00:03:33.630> occurring<00:03:34.110> -<00:03:34.400> yeah<00:03:35.400> it

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
different changes occurring - yeah it

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.520 
different changes occurring - yeah it
makes<00:03:36.780> you<00:03:36.960> not<00:03:37.560> sleep<00:03:37.890> as<00:03:38.100> much<00:03:38.340> which<00:03:38.610> is<00:03:38.640> fun

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
makes you not sleep as much which is fun

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.110 
makes you not sleep as much which is fun
we<00:03:40.530> managed<00:03:40.800> to<00:03:40.860> actually<00:03:41.100> get<00:03:41.430> to<00:03:41.610> see<00:03:41.790> a

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
we managed to actually get to see a

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.840 
we managed to actually get to see a
little<00:03:42.480> bit<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:43.620> score<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.130> Venice<00:03:44.460> canal

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
little bit the score the Venice canal

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.770 
little bit the score the Venice canal
yeah<00:03:45.660> really<00:03:46.200> good<00:03:46.440> fun<00:03:46.680> for<00:03:46.920> us<00:03:46.950> I<00:03:47.600> mean<00:03:48.600> do

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
yeah really good fun for us I mean do

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
you ever have a moment when you just sit

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.560 
you ever have a moment when you just sit
back<00:03:50.700> and<00:03:50.880> think<00:03:50.970> wow<00:03:52.010> no<00:03:53.150> no<00:03:54.150> there's<00:03:54.390> no<00:03:54.540> time

back and think wow no no there's no time
there's<00:03:55.440> no<00:03:55.530> time<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:56.250> think<00:03:56.460> before<00:03:56.790> I<00:03:56.970> got<00:03:57.180> on

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
there's no time I think before I got on

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.420 
there's no time I think before I got on
the<00:03:57.450> plane<00:03:57.480> I<00:03:57.720> hadn't<00:03:58.200> left<00:03:58.710> the<00:03:58.890> studio<00:03:59.160> in

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
the plane I hadn't left the studio in

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.210 
the plane I hadn't left the studio in
full<00:03:59.670> days<00:03:59.940> so<00:04:00.690> so<00:04:01.260> maybe<00:04:01.590> when<00:04:01.800> I<00:04:01.830> was<00:04:01.980> on<00:04:02.100> the

full days so so maybe when I was on the

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.420 
full days so so maybe when I was on the
plane<00:04:02.430> I<00:04:02.640> went<00:04:02.820> wow<00:04:03.740> but<00:04:04.740> no<00:04:04.860> it's<00:04:05.100> a<00:04:05.190> great

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
plane I went wow but no it's a great

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.430 
plane I went wow but no it's a great
it's<00:04:05.670> a<00:04:05.790> wonderful<00:04:06.210> privilege<00:04:06.390> to<00:04:07.260> do

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.530 
what would you say your favorite part of
the<00:04:26.340> process<00:04:26.790> I<00:04:27.660> think<00:04:28.350> the<00:04:28.410> best<00:04:28.620> part<00:04:28.980> is

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
the process I think the best part is

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.660 
the process I think the best part is
changing<00:04:30.540> things<00:04:30.830> when<00:04:31.830> you<00:04:31.980> create<00:04:32.340> a<00:04:32.370> scene

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
changing things when you create a scene

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.280 
changing things when you create a scene
in<00:04:32.820> your<00:04:33.000> head<00:04:33.240> you're<00:04:33.480> looking<00:04:33.780> at<00:04:33.930> it<00:04:34.110> and

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
you go this is this is how I would look

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.330 
you go this is this is how I would look
at<00:04:37.200> the<00:04:37.320> scene<00:04:37.590> and<00:04:37.800> then<00:04:39.110> why<00:04:40.110> why<00:04:40.710> film

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
at the scene and then why why film

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.400 
at the scene and then why why film
composers<00:04:42.060> I<00:04:42.240> think<00:04:42.480> are<00:04:42.630> film<00:04:42.840> composers

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.310

correct but the great thing about doing

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.290 
correct but the great thing about doing
something<00:04:52.980> like<00:04:53.100> this<00:04:53.400> is<00:04:53.640> that<00:04:53.790> you<00:04:53.880> write<00:04:54.090> it

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
something like this is that you write it

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.740 
something like this is that you write it
then<00:04:54.810> then<00:04:55.560> as<00:04:55.770> a<00:04:55.800> team<00:04:56.160> you'll<00:04:56.550> have<00:04:57.270> ideas
