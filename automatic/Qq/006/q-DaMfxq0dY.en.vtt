basically one of the dynamics in knifing

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.480 
basically one of the dynamics in knifing
is<00:01:28.880> has<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.150> really<00:01:30.330> do<00:01:30.600> with<00:01:31.100> what<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.280> see

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
is has to really do with what you see

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.480

with the other players scene and what's

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.860 
with the other players scene and what's
really<00:01:35.670> happening<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.330> real<00:01:36.510> life<00:01:38.720> one<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.750> the

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
really happening in real life one of the

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.930 
really happening in real life one of the
nuances<00:01:40.500> that's<00:01:40.740> kind<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.100> neat<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.460> you'll<00:01:41.909> be

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
nuances that's kind of neat is you'll be

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.580 
nuances that's kind of neat is you'll be
in<00:01:42.150> an<00:01:42.270> animation<00:01:42.659> where<00:01:42.990> you're<00:01:43.229> getting

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
in an animation where you're getting

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.230 
in an animation where you're getting
shanked<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.250> all<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.729> sudden<00:01:44.760> you<00:01:45.060> get<00:01:45.180> a

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
shanked and all of a sudden you get a

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.240 
shanked and all of a sudden you get a
knife<00:01:45.479> kill<00:01:45.750> back<00:01:46.020> on<00:01:46.320> him<00:01:46.560> or<00:01:46.800> you'll<00:01:46.950> get<00:01:47.100> an

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
knife kill back on him or you'll get an

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.040 
knife kill back on him or you'll get an
actual<00:01:47.790> gun<00:01:48.150> shot<00:01:48.420> on<00:01:48.570> him<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:48.960> you'll

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
actual gun shot on him and you'll

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.930 
actual gun shot on him and you'll
actually<00:01:49.280> kill<00:01:50.280> your<00:01:50.400> way<00:01:50.550> out<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.850> an

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
actually kill your way out of an

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.820 
actually kill your way out of an
animation<00:01:51.479> like<00:01:51.750> shot<00:01:52.050> straight<00:01:52.530> out<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.710> the

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
animation like shot straight out of the

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.800 
animation like shot straight out of the
animation<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.400> over<00:01:53.520> those<00:01:53.700> I'm<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.510> that's

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
animation that over those I'm and that's

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.410 
animation that over those I'm and that's
just<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:56.370> me<00:01:56.520> that's<00:01:56.700> just<00:01:56.880> basically

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
just that to me that's just basically

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.850 
just that to me that's just basically
the<00:01:57.659> server's<00:01:58.020> working<00:01:58.409> out<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.680> math

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
the server's working out the math

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.460 
the server's working out the math
afterwards<00:01:59.520> so<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.630> get<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:00.930> an<00:02:01.049> animation

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
afterwards so you get in an animation

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.670 
afterwards so you get in an animation
and<00:02:01.770> unite<00:02:02.130> yourself<00:02:02.520> out<00:02:02.729> in<00:02:03.360> fact<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:04.590> know

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
and unite yourself out in fact you know

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.110 
and unite yourself out in fact you know
you<00:02:04.740> are<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:04.979> one<00:02:05.070> really<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.610> shot<00:02:05.880> him

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
you are the one really that shot him

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.029 
you are the one really that shot him
first<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.690> I<00:02:06.930> think<00:02:07.260> that's<00:02:07.440> what's<00:02:07.650> going<00:02:07.830> on

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
first so I think that's what's going on

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.309 
first so I think that's what's going on
with<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.599> next<00:02:09.599> we're<00:02:09.720> gonna<00:02:09.780> be<00:02:09.959> exploring
