00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
advantages of an electric car is of

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.049 
advantages of an electric car is of
course<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:52.980> incredibly<00:00:53.520> cheap<00:00:53.820> to

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
course that it is incredibly cheap to

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.479 
course that it is incredibly cheap to
run<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.530> this<00:00:55.530> particular<00:00:55.770> case<00:00:56.100> we're

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
run in this particular case we're

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.889 
run in this particular case we're
talking<00:00:56.520> about<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.969> running<00:00:57.210> cost<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.660> three

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
talking about a running cost of three

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.020 
talking about a running cost of three
euros<00:00:58.350> per<00:00:58.590> hundred<00:00:58.920> kilometres<00:00:59.460> which

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
euros per hundred kilometres which

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.760 
euros per hundred kilometres which
equates<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.480> only<00:01:00.690> one<00:01:00.989> third<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.590> cost

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
equates to only one third of the cost

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.090 
equates to only one third of the cost
compared<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.399> diesel<00:01:03.379> another<00:01:04.379> advantage<00:01:04.949> is

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
compared to diesel another advantage is

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.039 
compared to diesel another advantage is
that<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.700> car<00:01:05.939> can<00:01:06.150> be<00:01:06.270> charged<00:01:06.659> from<00:01:06.990> a

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
that this car can be charged from a

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.160 
that this car can be charged from a
completely<00:01:07.590> normal<00:01:07.740> power<00:01:08.130> outlet<00:01:08.640> in<00:01:09.170> just

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
completely normal power outlet in just

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.289 
completely normal power outlet in just
eight<00:01:10.350> hours<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:11.100> car<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.520> fully<00:01:11.820> charged

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
eight hours the car is fully charged

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.630 
eight hours the car is fully charged
again<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.869> if<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.650> car<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:13.950> charged<00:01:14.400> with

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
again and if the car is charged with

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.030 
again and if the car is charged with
electricity<00:01:14.880> from<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.630> renewable<00:01:16.049> source<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
electricity from a renewable source the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.910 
electricity from a renewable source the
environmental<00:01:17.790> gains<00:01:17.970> are<00:01:18.360> considerable<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
environmental gains are considerable the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.649 
environmental gains are considerable the
biggest<00:01:20.130> advantage<00:01:20.820> with<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.000> car<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.509> of

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
biggest advantage with this car is of

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.260 
biggest advantage with this car is of
course<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:22.110> it's<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.500> zero<00:01:22.770> emitting<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:24.119> it's

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
course that it's a zero emitting so it's

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.749 
course that it's a zero emitting so it's
not<00:01:24.420> emitting<00:01:24.960> either<00:01:25.259> carbon<00:01:25.979> dioxide<00:01:26.490> or

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
not emitting either carbon dioxide or

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.120 
not emitting either carbon dioxide or
other<00:01:27.090> components<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.170> city<00:01:28.380> traffic<00:01:28.680> and

other components in the city traffic and

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.319 
other components in the city traffic and
that<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.670> course<00:01:29.820> for<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.090> environment

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
that is of course for the environment

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.830 
that is of course for the environment
the<00:01:30.750> fantastic<00:01:31.320> advantage<00:01:32.180> volvo<00:01:33.180> cars<00:01:33.479> chose

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
the fantastic advantage volvo cars chose

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.569 
the fantastic advantage volvo cars chose
to<00:01:34.020> use<00:01:34.170> an<00:01:34.350> existing<00:01:34.619> model<00:01:35.130> when<00:01:35.460> this

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
to use an existing model when this

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.539 
to use an existing model when this
electric<00:01:36.090> car<00:01:36.299> was<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.659> be<00:01:36.810> developed<00:01:37.549> partly

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
electric car was to be developed partly

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.149 
electric car was to be developed partly
because<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.970> volvo<00:01:39.299> c30<00:01:39.750> functions<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:40.920> well

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
because the volvo c30 functions so well

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.460 
because the volvo c30 functions so well
in<00:01:41.340> big<00:01:41.549> city<00:01:41.790> traffic<00:01:42.090> where<00:01:42.810> electric<00:01:43.259> car

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.920 
very happy to be driving around town in
a<00:03:48.459> car<00:03:48.670> that<00:03:48.700> looked<00:03:49.060> like<00:03:49.180> that<00:03:49.510> with<00:03:49.780> the

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
a car that looked like that with the

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.230 
a car that looked like that with the
convenience<00:03:50.650> features<00:03:51.130> that<00:03:51.250> it's<00:03:51.430> got<00:03:51.640> so<00:03:52.209> I

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
convenience features that it's got so I

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.620 
convenience features that it's got so I
think<00:03:52.420> it<00:03:52.750> could<00:03:52.870> work<00:03:53.050> quite<00:03:53.410> well<00:03:53.459> as<00:03:54.630> early

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
think it could work quite well as early

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.660 
think it could work quite well as early
as<00:03:55.810> next<00:03:55.990> year<00:03:56.200> volvo<00:03:56.800> cars<00:03:57.070> hopes<00:03:57.370> to<00:03:57.520> have<00:03:57.610> a

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.330 
as next year volvo cars hopes to have a
test<00:03:57.970> fleet<00:03:58.209> of<00:03:58.390> electric<00:03:58.810> cars<00:03:59.080> in<00:03:59.380> order<00:04:00.220> to

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
test fleet of electric cars in order to

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.670 
test fleet of electric cars in order to
be<00:04:00.490> able<00:04:00.610> to<00:04:00.850> actively<00:04:01.240> study<00:04:01.630> how<00:04:02.080> these<00:04:02.350> cars

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
be able to actively study how these cars

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.040 
be able to actively study how these cars
are<00:04:02.920> used<00:04:03.250> and<00:04:04.090> here<00:04:04.240> we<00:04:04.270> will<00:04:04.510> investigate

various impacts in terms of battery life
