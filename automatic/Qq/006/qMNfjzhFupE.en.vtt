back<00:02:01.770> which<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:02.880> know<00:02:03.000> they<00:02:03.119> say<00:02:03.270> it's<00:02:03.360> a

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
back which I know they say it's a

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.389 
back which I know they say it's a
dynamic<00:02:03.600> but<00:02:04.020> it's<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.229> funny<00:02:04.409> one<00:02:04.619> suppose<00:02:05.159> I

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
dynamic but it's a funny one suppose I

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.770 
dynamic but it's a funny one suppose I
mean<00:02:05.549> you've<00:02:05.790> probably<00:02:06.149> got<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.360> lot<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.509> mates

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
mean you've probably got a lot of mates

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.330 
mean you've probably got a lot of mates
on<00:02:07.079> their<00:02:07.530> side<00:02:07.770> because<00:02:07.799> you've<00:02:08.129> played

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
on their side because you've played

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.339 
on their side because you've played
junior<00:02:08.550> cricket<00:02:08.849> with<00:02:09.149> them<00:02:09.390> or<00:02:09.629> at<00:02:10.080> some

junior cricket with them or at some
zonal<00:02:10.709> level<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.760> doesn't<00:02:12.180> affect<00:02:12.480> their

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
zonal level so doesn't affect their

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.370 
zonal level so doesn't affect their

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.080 
is different and on the field it's just
completely<00:02:28.350> different<00:02:28.800> we<00:02:29.760> are<00:02:29.880> professional

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
completely different we are professional

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.420 
completely different we are professional

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
than we play like professionals so it

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.740 
than we play like professionals so it
doesn't<00:02:32.610> matter<00:02:32.760> whether<00:02:33.150> he's<00:02:33.360> your<00:02:33.540> friend

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
doesn't matter whether he's your friend

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.290 
doesn't matter whether he's your friend
or<00:02:33.990> family<00:02:34.590> when<00:02:35.520> you're<00:02:35.640> on<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.820> field<00:02:36.060> it's

or family when you're on the field it's
completely<00:02:36.750> different<00:02:38.480> so<00:02:39.480> how<00:02:39.930> do<00:02:39.990> you<00:02:40.200> see

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
completely different so how do you see

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.120 
completely different so how do you see
yesterday<00:02:41.310> Joe<00:02:41.760> is<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.030> end<00:02:42.240> we<00:02:42.630> didn't<00:02:42.870> quite

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
yesterday Joe is the end we didn't quite

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.460 
yesterday Joe is the end we didn't quite
because<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.160> result<00:02:44.460> wasn't<00:02:44.670> favorable<00:02:45.470> what

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
because the result wasn't favorable what

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:53.570 
because the result wasn't favorable what
do<00:02:46.620> you<00:02:46.710> think<00:02:47.070> went<00:02:47.430> wrong<00:02:49.880> see<00:02:52.220> you<00:02:53.220> can't

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
do you think went wrong see you can't

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.170 
do you think went wrong see you can't
say<00:02:53.760> much<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:55.310> just<00:02:56.310> didn't<00:02:56.610> go<00:02:56.730> over<00:02:56.910> and

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
say much and just didn't go over and

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.760 
say much and just didn't go over and
don't<00:02:57.780> want<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:57.990> talk<00:02:58.110> too<00:02:58.290> much<00:02:58.320> about<00:02:58.470> what

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
don't want to talk too much about what

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.950 
don't want to talk too much about what
happened<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.520> last<00:02:59.550> game<00:02:59.940> I<00:03:00.210> think<00:03:00.240> we<00:03:00.780> should

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
happened the last game I think we should

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.340 
happened the last game I think we should
just<00:03:00.990> forget<00:03:01.380> it<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.650> move<00:03:01.680> on<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.390> we'll<00:03:03.390> win

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
just forget it and move on and we'll win

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.780 
just forget it and move on and we'll win
the<00:03:04.500> next<00:03:04.620> game<00:03:04.770> and<00:03:05.010> hopefully<00:03:05.190> with<00:03:05.550> them<00:03:05.670> in

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
the next game and hopefully with them in

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.730 
the next game and hopefully with them in
the<00:03:05.880> final<00:03:06.210> that<00:03:06.630> will<00:03:06.750> be<00:03:06.810> a<00:03:06.840> good<00:03:06.990> revenge<00:03:07.350> so

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
the final that will be a good revenge so

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.850 
the final that will be a good revenge so
what<00:03:07.860> lessons<00:03:08.040> from<00:03:08.610> this<00:03:08.790> game<00:03:09.090> I<00:03:09.710> think<00:03:10.710> see

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
what lessons from this game I think see

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.160 
what lessons from this game I think see
we<00:03:11.610> need<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:11.910> improve<00:03:12.180> our<00:03:12.360> depth<00:03:12.600> polling<00:03:12.990> and

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
we need to improve our depth polling and

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.240 
we need to improve our depth polling and
then<00:03:13.920> as<00:03:14.100> well<00:03:14.280> even<00:03:14.760> we<00:03:15.000> need<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:16.040> bat<00:03:17.040> well

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
then as well even we need to bat well

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.870 
then as well even we need to bat well
but<00:03:17.490> see<00:03:17.790> rot<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:19.410> rest<00:03:19.590> doing<00:03:19.890> great<00:03:20.580> job

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
man what ya could maybe pull it off next

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.260 
man what ya could maybe pull it off next
time<00:03:30.290> was<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.470> wicked<00:03:31.680> harder<00:03:32.370> to<00:03:32.490> Baton<00:03:32.940> when

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
time was the wicked harder to Baton when

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.450 
time was the wicked harder to Baton when
the<00:03:33.390> China<00:03:33.600> team<00:03:33.810> batted<00:03:34.380> or<00:03:34.620> was<00:03:35.070> it<00:03:35.160> easier

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460 
the China team batted or was it easier

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.780 
the China team batted or was it easier
to<00:03:35.610> Baton<00:03:35.910> when<00:03:36.090> they<00:03:36.240> batted<00:03:37.010> no<00:03:38.010> I<00:03:38.040> think<00:03:38.400> the

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
to Baton when they batted no I think the

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.010 
to Baton when they batted no I think the
wicket<00:03:39.090> was<00:03:39.330> good<00:03:39.570> played<00:03:40.320> true<00:03:40.730> is<00:03:41.730> not<00:03:42.020> not

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
wicket was good played true is not not

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.920 
wicket was good played true is not not
too<00:03:43.230> many<00:03:43.610> problems<00:03:44.610> in<00:03:44.850> the<00:03:44.970> wicked<00:03:45.270> wasn't

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
too many problems in the wicked wasn't

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.010 
too many problems in the wicked wasn't
turning<00:03:46.340> great<00:03:47.340> deal<00:03:47.580> just<00:03:48.390> fine<00:03:48.570> it<00:03:48.690> was<00:03:48.810> nice

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
turning great deal just fine it was nice

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.820 
turning great deal just fine it was nice

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:56.319 
help the bowlers do well and then they

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:58.200 
help the bowlers do well and then they

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
where we get the wickets if not for a

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.909 
where we get the wickets if not for a
batting<00:05:00.970> then<00:05:01.150> I<00:05:01.330> roll<00:05:01.870> on<00:05:02.110> the<00:05:02.560> field<00:05:02.770> is

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
batting then I roll on the field is

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:06.120 
batting then I roll on the field is
fulfilling<00:05:03.599> so<00:05:04.599> when<00:05:04.750> stopping<00:05:05.080> that<00:05:05.410> did<00:05:06.039> you

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.580 
fulfilling so when stopping that did you
think<00:05:06.460> I<00:05:06.639> should<00:05:06.960> kind<00:05:07.960> of<00:05:08.050> just<00:05:08.199> put<00:05:08.349> my<00:05:08.440> whole

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
think I should kind of just put my whole

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.200 
think I should kind of just put my whole

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
body behind it or did you just take out

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.770 
body behind it or did you just take out
a<00:05:10.240> hand<00:05:10.509> and<00:05:10.660> stop<00:05:10.960> those<00:05:11.139> balls<00:05:12.479> see<00:05:13.479> if<00:05:13.599> it's

i<00:05:26.800> think<00:05:27.130> i<00:05:27.340> think<00:05:27.400> now<00:05:27.849> as<00:05:28.419> in<00:05:29.409> whatever<00:05:30.159> had

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
i think i think now as in whatever had

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.510 
i think i think now as in whatever had
to<00:05:30.699> happen<00:05:30.849> has<00:05:31.240> happened<00:05:32.110> and<00:05:32.560> I<00:05:32.800> can<00:05:33.400> only

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
to happen has happened and I can only

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.790 
to happen has happened and I can only
see<00:05:33.909> us<00:05:34.090> doing<00:05:34.750> well<00:05:35.020> from<00:05:35.199> here<00:05:35.349> because<00:05:35.650> we

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
see us doing well from here because we

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.370 
see us doing well from here because we
did<00:05:35.979> extremely<00:05:36.400> well<00:05:36.580> the<00:05:37.000> last<00:05:37.150> game<00:05:37.449> but<00:05:38.199> it

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
did extremely well the last game but it

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.610 
did extremely well the last game but it
was<00:05:38.530> just<00:05:38.639> the<00:05:39.639> 45<00:05:40.000> overs<00:05:40.240> and<00:05:40.449> so<00:05:41.050> it<00:05:41.229> happens

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
was just the 45 overs and so it happens

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.680 
was just the 45 overs and so it happens
to<00:05:41.740> every<00:05:41.949> team<00:05:42.130> and<00:05:42.310> see<00:05:42.789> the<00:05:43.000> champions<00:05:43.330> had

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
to every team and see the champions had

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.899 
to every team and see the champions had
always<00:05:43.900> comes<00:05:44.289> back<00:05:44.560> from<00:05:45.159> whatever<00:05:45.370> happens

00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:45.909 
always comes back from whatever happens

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:51.029 
always comes back from whatever happens
and<00:05:46.509> I<00:05:46.719> think<00:05:46.990> we<00:05:47.349> have<00:05:47.669> the<00:05:49.349> stuff<00:05:50.349> in<00:05:50.500> us<00:05:50.650> to

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 
and I think we have the stuff in us to

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:53.790 
and I think we have the stuff in us to
do<00:05:51.159> it<00:05:51.310> because<00:05:51.849> I<00:05:52.360> think<00:05:52.740> there's<00:05:53.740> a

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
do it because I think there's a

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.580 
do it because I think there's a
completely<00:05:54.310> different<00:05:55.259> attitude<00:05:56.259> and

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
completely different attitude and

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.930 
completely different attitude and
completely<00:05:57.490> different<00:05:59.490> gelling<00:06:00.490> in<00:06:00.610> the<00:06:00.729> side

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
completely different gelling in the side

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.480 
completely different gelling in the side
because<00:06:01.270> it's<00:06:01.449> just<00:06:01.539> not<00:06:01.780> normal<00:06:02.560> as<00:06:03.039> and

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
because it's just not normal as and

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.909 
because it's just not normal as and
that's<00:06:03.669> what<00:06:03.789> I<00:06:03.820> have<00:06:04.000> heard<00:06:04.180> and<00:06:04.449> but<00:06:05.349> our
