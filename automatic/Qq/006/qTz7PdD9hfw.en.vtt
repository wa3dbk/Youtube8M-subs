00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.870
 hello people and welcome to 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.639
 this video of me i know at the moment 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.710
 comes very many videos the light 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.930
 but just because of that very much 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.760
 especially about ios india 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.340
 focus machine is and i have now 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.440
 also often counted how to get a 7 beta on 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.280
 compatible devices like iphone 4 ipad 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.380
 mini gets 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.560
 but of course there are many more 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.230
 user just the ipod touch the fourth 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.059
 generation use business the ipod 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.760
 touch the fourth generation and that is 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.110
 unfortunately God is not compatible with 1 7 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.040
 I would like to show it to me, too 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.930
 we'll get the same 10 with austria 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.970
 which looks very similar to the whole thing 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.980
 only thing we need to say is 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.250
 of course, a jailbreak in the case 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.630
 also the cydia store and then that's it 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.610
 actually what we next 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.720
 need it winterboard know the 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.910
 most of you have the most 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.530
 the rest should be installed 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.660
 just install it for a short time 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.370
 is the only thing that maybe free 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.759
 a small drawback for some is 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.890
 your device you have to boot once 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:10.299
 yes, that simply means a device 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.570
 will be switched off again 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.770
 for all the one offender derrick we have 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.080
 that can be a bit of a boon 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.120
 be complicated because they have that 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.130
 he does about the pc but for others 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.380
 people who have another left over 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.640
 and since it is five or six with it 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.119
 I do not have compatible yet 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.000
 told 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.110
 that should not be a problem for that 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.090
 Do you have to go on the project? 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.440
 next we need a prerequisite 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.340
 the goal in winterbach 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.960
 activate 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.520
 do not worry i'll show you how the whole 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.280
 works and then because of that 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.140
 me too my iphone 5 4 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.630
 Do you still want a little bit like that ? 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.439
 like jan the whole a bit short 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.960
 Of course you can compare 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.240
 but the same experiment it 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.439
 As I said it is only a design that is 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.790
 she does not have the same features in 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.720
 the attitudes and so when he the 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:59.080
 photos r stay here moment the photos it 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.479
 stay here respect respect but also the 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.869
 news app same videos music 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.860
 Everything stays the same especially apps inside 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.799
 but as you have seen 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.200
 it really looks like 17 like this 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:13.720
 from the icons and everything you need here 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.970
 the very first 17 team that is free 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.400
 that's what the whole thing should look like at the top of the icon 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.840
 That is very important from the middle of May 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.819
 rico is one thing 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.069
 yes, there are others 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:28.090
 that's what's in the bottom of it today 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.890
 Everything is possible here in the second 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.620
 you see, it is also something like 3 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.019
 1, however, we do not have these here 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.610
 So this lettering should be that 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.700
 Do not necessarily take that you need 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.580
 here with this icon around with these 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.110
 shows all that is her turn also so 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.000
 Unfortunately, keyboards and everything will 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.769
 Everything just changes the environment 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.290
 where I change is installed 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:55.380
 and then just open winterboard in 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.150
 of course you have to winterboard 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.160
 team pick here and life 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.560
 simply select and so it does not mean 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.140
 only one but as I said from 17 too 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.459
 all in july all with one 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.410
 hook then confirm again 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.730
 winterboard then bring on the reese 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.870
 is not with me now because I am 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.519
 nothing changed 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.540
 after he landed in the lockscreen 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.430
 Something is a little bit with me somehow 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.870
 Strange looks I hope that you 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.650
 do not just write in please 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.110
 the comments 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.910
 if that was me it is like that in case she is 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.110
 have installed this system that is 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.250
 has a square and black 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.049
 background picture around me not synonymous 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.120
 can change that is the case 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.440
 here with me at least on this team 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.389
 I can sometimes retry 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.069
 to uninstall then install 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.480
 but I did this before bringing 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.049
 again and it really has nothing 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.609
 brought 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.410
 but we can see if we do the whole thing 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:40.780
 compare now we have the 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.940
 Flashes are the same icons everywhere 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.700
 we have the same icons as well 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.359
 a background image that is moving true 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.560
 we have to see the icons in the 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:53.769
 background we have both 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.810
 no spotlight search because multitasking 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.910
 looks though on ipod touch 4 through 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.590
 the team is not so that depends too 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.959
 bit but we can see here 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.060
 it's so full screen that's it here too 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.280
 you have seen so small, too 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.690
 many of you also full screen but only 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.919
 down here and you can see that down 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.500
 away while just up here 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:13.299
 but pulled away is the same eleven 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.359
 they can compare this 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:18.579
 Of course we also have one here 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.380
 few features on the original as 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.459
 Tibetans what me here by others 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.919
 moreover, tricks can also be done for example 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.120
 live blog then moves here too 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.710
 blogs as well as in asia 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.599
 unfortunately we do not have that but we 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.289
 really can see the icons are 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:33.700
 all in our 17 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.479
 equal to what is also the folder 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.599
 to change 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:40.539
 These are the original folders that are 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:43.479
 the yes this as the folder I say 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:45.400
 now look 47 synonymous and similar 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:47.380
 if you look at it at first glance 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.990
 Can you really say to the friends 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.880
 you have 17 and you even believe it 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.500
 what with me even so much more 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.900
 many even asked how did i have 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.789
 easy on the ipod touch 4g 7 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.380
 installed yes that was it 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:00.669
 even from this video you can yes 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.349
 like I said a bit myself 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.510
 can experiment around it 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:06.430
 Watch for yourself 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.710
 different things the settings 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.860
 app looks almost the same as 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:14.740
 at 17 I noticed when she got 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.229
 on both the original 17 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.300
 Here we have the same ones 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:22.900
 icons which unfortunately we do not have here 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.150
 our s75 league this spz in here 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.479
 below now shows times at the farmer's day 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.500
 to adjust 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:30.610
 say but others have, as I said 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.349
 also not changed for example the 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.580
 weather app has stayed the same but me 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:34.690
 my ranging also completely who 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.490
 you can not wait there 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.409
 winterboard we have as a team with like 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.419
 were moving said background with the 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:42.159
 same icons with transparent 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.050
 background in the notification center without 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:45.849
 spotlight search transparent 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.919
 background in the docks the same 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:50.169
 Almost the same settings apps 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:53.919
 few futures and even with me now 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:55.810
 but not as an almost identical lock 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:57.280
 screen shows the same here 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.039
 font and everything I am 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.830
 really very positively surprised 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:04.300
 yes so there was the otmar report from me 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.099
 really awarded a plus point 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.840
 well that's what you get from this one 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:09.310
 video as I said it is out of hand if 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.669
 they are still lying around a device somewhere 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:14.200
 have not yet updated to 17 gm 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:15.219
 was or not and not at all 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.080
 is compatible with this 

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:18.820
 So of course you could do it all up 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.349
 the iphone 5 do even if it is with 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.029
 a 7 compatible is some of you 

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:24.460
 do not feel like it or do that 

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:25.630
 just do not install a 7 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.490
 Maybe they do not want that either 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.450
 So just click here 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.430
 You can say that again 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:33.550
 delete simple winter board going and 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.840
 there just the whole of the hook again 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.430
 then remove this hook again 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.949
 bring along and then you have the whole thing 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:42.130
 again as well as one ex us5 depending on 

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:43.479
 which ios time back on it well the 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.490
 what the way of this video then 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:47.090
 adopted 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.090
 first time
