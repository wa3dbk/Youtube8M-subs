00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.960 
mark on each side and two on the bottom
and<00:01:05.300> we'll<00:01:05.960> set<00:01:06.170> that<00:01:06.200> aside

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
and we'll set that aside

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.780

plate especially when you're painting
broad<00:01:20.509> areas<00:01:21.079> you<00:01:21.920> can<00:01:22.070> add<00:01:22.400> a<00:01:22.729> little<00:01:23.180> bit<00:01:23.299> of

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
broad areas you can add a little bit of

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.850 
broad areas you can add a little bit of
water<00:01:24.290> to<00:01:25.000> make<00:01:26.000> the<00:01:26.210> paint<00:01:26.509> flow<00:01:26.900> a<00:01:27.200> bit<00:01:27.650> more

water to make the paint flow a bit more

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.859 
water to make the paint flow a bit more
freely<00:01:30.820> it's<00:01:31.820> important<00:01:32.299> to<00:01:32.390> remember<00:01:32.659> that

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
freely it's important to remember that

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.230 
freely it's important to remember that

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
what you paint on the plate will print

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:45.640

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
now I'm going to take a modeling tool

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.980 
now I'm going to take a modeling tool
and<00:01:48.620> I'm<00:01:49.620> going<00:01:49.830> to<00:01:49.890> pull<00:01:50.190> back<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:51.390> paint<00:01:51.720> in

some areas this will print as white on
my<00:01:57.330> first<00:01:58.320> print<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:59.070> will<00:01:59.760> reveal<00:02:00.030> colors

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
my first print and will reveal colors

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.800 
my first print and will reveal colors

them<00:04:24.580> very<00:04:24.850> well<00:04:25.560> so<00:04:26.560> it's<00:04:26.680> really<00:04:26.740> best<00:04:27.130> to

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
them very well so it's really best to

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.260 
them very well so it's really best to
save<00:04:27.640> them<00:04:27.910> for<00:04:28.180> the<00:04:28.210> last<00:04:29.820> we'll<00:04:30.820> do<00:04:30.970> a<00:04:31.000> very

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
save them for the last we'll do a very

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:37.170 
save them for the last we'll do a very

quick tree trunk and a few branches at

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.840 
quick tree trunk and a few branches at
the<00:04:37.210> top<00:04:37.710> you<00:04:38.710> notice<00:04:38.980> that<00:04:39.070> I'm<00:04:39.190> working<00:04:39.370> very

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
the top you notice that I'm working very

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.080 
the top you notice that I'm working very
quickly<00:04:40.320> because<00:04:41.320> acrylic<00:04:41.830> paint<00:04:42.160> does<00:04:42.610> dry

very<00:04:43.480> quickly<00:04:46.020> that<00:04:47.020> helps<00:04:47.350> keep<00:04:47.590> it

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
very quickly that helps keep it

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.590 
very quickly that helps keep it
