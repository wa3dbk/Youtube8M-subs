00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.249
 at the same time as his horticous work not to embark

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.500
 three meters 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.920

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.940
 easy to understand 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.990
 the fixed chord explained m 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.520
 but the cicada is home 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.449
 Ukraine in the hot seat for its fifth final this series and this does not 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:05.500
 not the risk 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.400
 alexandre would have felt 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.400
 in the white bird bucket 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.330
 if this market 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.330
 among others 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.100
 there is no recipe 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.100
 the theme is not uncommon abramson another springer offer

 finally in the photovoltaic sector can refrain from thinking about the fact 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.050
 that she was out of luck 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.890
 so strong this season 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.920
 for the problem 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.380

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.590
 located in the city 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.030

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.520
 policy 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.800
