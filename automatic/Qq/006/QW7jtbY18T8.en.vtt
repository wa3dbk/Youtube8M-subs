00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.160
 hello to all cm and refuse them and 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.080
 yes it's me 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.230
 and today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.929
 new video a video 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.720
 humble for a tip I think that 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:27.069
 it's rather a trick is how 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.569
 have the quad for free so I 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:32.050
 wanted to make this video because 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:33.880
 that less than two brothers likes the 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.620
 believe and I wanted to buy him I 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.530
 used sub times for 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.320
 buy it and never have I ever managed to 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.240
 him to have him ever he appeared in 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.710
 my garage jean-paul i will you 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.590
 show how to see it in your 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.870
 social and personal housing and all 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.650
 doubts and has in addition to tuna room 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.950
 free 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.870
 so all that could do this lease there 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.760
 must already tidy up an andros 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.680
 etienne 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.080
 but for 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.690
 Here in snow on the current track 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.840
 world on the track 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.790
 I go to the right of the map 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.630
 not quite on the right it's on 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.070
 the middle right we'll say on it's 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.070
 a kind of small racecourse 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.259
 you go on who you will see 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.299
 that there is always frames so 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.930
 I will go as soon as possible, I think 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.620
 that I will make you a 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:29.260
 l uci thaksin eric besson mom who is going 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.690
 to be that I think of time muslims 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:36.520
 that as far as I go to 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:38.980
 oh I'm coming over there so we get 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.420
 find one finds oneself immediately to 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.420
 at the racecourse 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.840
 so here I come to the racecourse going 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.270
 see that a quad in front of me so 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.290
 it depends on the times of the outbreaks at the same time 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.970
 sometimes there are two but 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.800
 now I will redo you a little 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.390
 to shit the time I'm coming 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.390
 at home and we end up 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.280
 there I come home is to return 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.020
 normally not your house and you 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.780
 will see that normally he will 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.490
 reappear as a normal car 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.840
 so you see there jorane charrier in 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.120
 my garage sometimes it makes us 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.070
 some punchs bay me that happened to me 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.780
 you see there more loquacious who floats a 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.740
 sometimes there are decor bugs 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.200
 all this so the glitch I'm doing a 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.630
 trick is going to end here i'm going to tell you 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.800
 in all honesty I found them 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:52.620
 in fact thanks to my little brother we're going 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.330
 to say I wanted to buy him I the 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.320
 was buying licked game from father maybe 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.090
 one hundred thousand euros 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.700
 wanting to buy 100 thousand dollars 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.530
 during at 15000 which costs 15 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.650
 I'm going to show you in the 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.570
 phone especially they cost 15 minutes 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.150
 I like a lot of time at the 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.040
 find and see her and then there I 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.080
 found this bug is actually what happened 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.350
 past is that I wanted to make a 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:19.740
 first time he does it before the patch 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:21.660
 1.5 that have just been done yesterday I 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:27.120
 believe it's that he has he appeared the 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:29.040
 patch 1.07 not a point 0.7 and ben in 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.720
 did when we came back with the quad that 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.640
 you put in a secret room where 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.950
 you can take me out we could 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.750
 simply move inside but we 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.520
 did not see the others outside the 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.630
 spokes could not go back on the quad 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.790
 we could not take up arms 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.740
 could really do anything I think 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.810
 that we could not have gone out if there was 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.360
 someone coming back and mangara since 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.210
 he saw you when there is someone who 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.100
 go in and you go out we see he 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.080
 is a room there two doors 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.900
 garage there is there big that you 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.260
 see before me there is there are 2 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.660
 behind so in fact just he 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.090
 was enough to go in and we landed on 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.530
 was landing right behind that door 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.560
 but we could not move 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.330
 so here's this trick ends here I 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.650
 will show you quickly in the 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:18.330
 notebook he wednesday in the notebook 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.489
 that it is well worth 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.549
 fifteen thousand dollars if it did not 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.549
 exchange 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:29.120
 you see an issue is back it's worth 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.410
 $ 8000 so it's not much for 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.730
 beginners and who 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.470
 would like to have a cross debate that's 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.270
 you have the trick to have it 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.640
 free 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:40.730
 and then we end up for one 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:43.130
 next video i'm not singing you the 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.450
 usual song for the light ones 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.800
 comments you know what you 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.800
 remains to do with
