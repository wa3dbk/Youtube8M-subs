should say I have quite dry skin so my

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.109 
should say I have quite dry skin so my
skin<00:01:22.830> would<00:01:22.950> be<00:01:23.009> likes<00:01:23.280> like<00:01:23.580> all<00:01:23.820> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
skin would be likes like all the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.899 
skin would be likes like all the
moisture<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.890> small<00:01:26.340> amount<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.670> this

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
moisture so a small amount of this

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.749 
moisture so a small amount of this
probably<00:01:27.689> around<00:01:27.930> dime<00:01:28.740> sized<00:01:29.040> amount<00:01:29.159> for<00:01:29.640> my
