album that they came out with them and I

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.280 
album that they came out with them and I
think<00:00:41.910> we<00:00:42.000> liked<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.329> fit<00:00:42.480> was<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.899> took<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.260> a

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
think we liked it fit was it took you a

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.470 
think we liked it fit was it took you a
while<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.950> did<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.340> really<00:00:44.820> did<00:00:44.969> not<00:00:45.000> like<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.300> at

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
while it did I really did not like it at

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.450 
while it did I really did not like it at
first<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.870> ended<00:00:46.140> up<00:00:46.200> actually<00:00:46.469> liking<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.340> lot

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
first I ended up actually liking a lot

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.869 
first I ended up actually liking a lot
yeah<00:00:47.969> these<00:00:48.570> but<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.620> know<00:00:49.739> it's<00:00:50.640> kind<00:00:50.789> of

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
yeah these but you know it's kind of

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.250

hard<00:00:51.090> music<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.480> get<00:00:51.600> into<00:00:51.840> if<00:00:51.989> you've<00:00:52.110> never

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
to come off a little jarring at times

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.649 
to come off a little jarring at times
definitely<00:01:11.340> that's<00:01:11.970> something<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.240> Tom<00:01:12.510> and

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659

definitely that's something that Tom and
I<00:01:12.720> though<00:01:12.990> we<00:01:13.170> get<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> big<00:01:13.500> kick<00:01:13.680> out<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.890> when

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
I though we get a big kick out of when

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.920 
I though we get a big kick out of when
we<00:01:14.220> when<00:01:14.430> we<00:01:14.460> can<00:01:14.670> describe<00:01:15.000> music<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.570> jarring

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
we when we can describe music is jarring

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.859 
we when we can describe music is jarring
yeah<00:01:16.470> as<00:01:17.130> our<00:01:17.729> friend<00:01:18.030> ian<00:01:18.270> has<00:01:18.450> found<00:01:18.689> out

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
yeah as our friend ian has found out

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.240 
yeah as our friend ian has found out
lately<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.500> that's<00:01:19.680> something<00:01:19.830> that's<00:01:20.009> good

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
lately so that's something that's good

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.039 
lately so that's something that's good
because<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.549> means<00:01:20.700> it's<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.659> means<00:01:21.840> that

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
because that means it's that means that

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.719 
because that means it's that means that
the<00:01:22.259> artist<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.799> actually<00:01:23.189> doing<00:01:23.369> things

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
the artist is actually doing things

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.940 
the artist is actually doing things
unique<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.659> are<00:01:24.810> pulling<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.680> make

unique that are pulling you in and make
I<00:01:26.100> give<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.400> think<00:01:26.729> yes<00:01:27.270> exactly<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.229> that's

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:20.449 
kind of all my favorite or the very

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:22.300 
kind of all my favorite or the very
early<00:04:20.930> tracks<00:04:21.259> of<00:04:21.470> the<00:04:21.530> album<00:04:21.560> yet<00:04:22.040> and<00:04:22.250> I

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
early tracks of the album yet and I

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.830 
early tracks of the album yet and I
enjoyed<00:04:22.699> the<00:04:22.880> back<00:04:23.090> half<00:04:23.300> but<00:04:23.479> just<00:04:23.660> not<00:04:23.780> as

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
enjoyed the back half but just not as

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.420 
enjoyed the back half but just not as
much<00:04:24.110> yeah<00:04:24.410> this<00:04:24.560> album<00:04:24.830> is<00:04:24.889> it's<00:04:25.100> slightly

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
much yeah this album is it's slightly

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.969 
much yeah this album is it's slightly
amorphous<00:04:26.270> and<00:04:26.509> I<00:04:26.630> mean<00:04:26.870> for<00:04:27.500> first<00:04:27.800> off

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
amorphous and I mean for first off

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:29.950 
amorphous and I mean for first off
because<00:04:28.310> everything<00:04:28.759> is<00:04:28.850> so<00:04:28.880> crazy<00:04:29.509> it's<00:04:29.840> all

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
because everything is so crazy it's all

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.320 
because everything is so crazy it's all
about<00:04:30.110> that<00:04:30.320> really<00:04:30.560> stark<00:04:31.009> contrast<00:04:31.729> that<00:04:31.910> as

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
about that really stark contrast that as

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.600 
about that really stark contrast that as
you<00:04:32.509> said<00:04:32.720> it<00:04:32.810> just<00:04:32.990> kind<00:04:33.169> of<00:04:33.199> jars<00:04:33.530> you<00:04:33.800> but

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
you said it just kind of jars you but

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.490 
you said it just kind of jars you but
but<00:04:34.820> really<00:04:35.150> even<00:04:35.539> beyond<00:04:35.870> that<00:04:35.960> if<00:04:36.229> you<00:04:36.320> just

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
but really even beyond that if you just

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.159 
but really even beyond that if you just
look<00:04:36.710> at<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:36.949> styles<00:04:37.490> of<00:04:37.639> songwriting<00:04:38.270> I<00:04:38.570> feel

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
look at the styles of songwriting I feel

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.379 
look at the styles of songwriting I feel
like<00:04:39.320> the<00:04:39.949> the<00:04:40.220> order<00:04:40.639> of<00:04:40.789> it<00:04:40.970> the<00:04:41.150> whole

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
like the the order of it the whole

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.570 
like the the order of it the whole
concept<00:04:41.690> and<00:04:42.199> cohesion<00:04:42.680> behind<00:04:43.160> the<00:04:43.250> album

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
concept and cohesion behind the album

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.430 
concept and cohesion behind the album
doesn't<00:04:43.789> make<00:04:44.060> a<00:04:44.090> whole<00:04:44.240> lot<00:04:44.449> of<00:04:44.630> sense<00:04:44.900> which

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
doesn't make a whole lot of sense which

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.870 
doesn't make a whole lot of sense which
isn't<00:04:45.770> exactly<00:04:45.860> what<00:04:46.370> they<00:04:46.460> were<00:04:46.520> going<00:04:46.789> for

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
isn't exactly what they were going for

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.249 
isn't exactly what they were going for
but<00:04:47.090> I<00:04:47.240> think<00:04:47.300> it<00:04:47.539> would<00:04:47.630> have<00:04:47.660> helped<00:04:47.960> me<00:04:48.139> and

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:48.259 
but I think it would have helped me and

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:49.360 
but I think it would have helped me and
I<00:04:48.350> actually<00:04:48.500> think<00:04:48.740> it's<00:04:48.949> something<00:04:49.130> that

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
I actually think it's something that

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.370 
I actually think it's something that
their<00:04:49.520> previous<00:04:49.970> album<00:04:50.389> had<00:04:50.840> a<00:04:50.870> little<00:04:51.139> bit

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
their previous album had a little bit

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.830 
their previous album had a little bit
better<00:04:51.800> absolutely<00:04:52.520> so<00:04:53.060> so<00:04:53.090> yeah<00:04:53.449> that's<00:04:53.600> kind

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
better absolutely so so yeah that's kind

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.240 
better absolutely so so yeah that's kind
of<00:04:53.870> what<00:04:53.930> it<00:04:54.080> came<00:04:54.199> down<00:04:54.260> to<00:04:54.440> for<00:04:54.800> me<00:04:54.949> out<00:04:55.070> as

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
of what it came down to for me out as

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.909 
of what it came down to for me out as
well<00:04:55.490> is<00:04:55.789> that<00:04:56.180> you<00:04:56.570> know<00:04:56.690> this<00:04:57.199> is<00:04:57.410> a<00:04:57.560> good

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
well is that you know this is a good

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.279 
well is that you know this is a good
album<00:04:58.130> but<00:04:58.639> I<00:04:58.669> feel<00:04:58.910> like<00:04:58.970> it's<00:04:59.449> very<00:04:59.720> average

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.289 
album but I feel like it's very average

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:02.590 
album but I feel like it's very average
in<00:05:00.440> the<00:05:00.530> songwriting<00:05:01.100> I<00:05:01.760> mean<00:05:02.389> they're

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
in the songwriting I mean they're

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.689 
in the songwriting I mean they're
definitely<00:05:02.900> as<00:05:03.289> you<00:05:03.440> said<00:05:03.740> doing<00:05:04.340> some<00:05:04.520> things

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:04.699 
definitely as you said doing some things

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:06.580 
definitely as you said doing some things
to<00:05:04.850> push<00:05:05.060> their<00:05:05.240> sound<00:05:05.449> forward<00:05:05.870> and<00:05:06.470> they

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
to push their sound forward and they

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.040 
to push their sound forward and they
have<00:05:06.889> a<00:05:06.919> very<00:05:07.280> unique<00:05:07.699> sound<00:05:08.150> in<00:05:08.419> general<00:05:08.930> I

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
have a very unique sound in general I

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.689 
have a very unique sound in general I
think<00:05:09.080> but<00:05:09.770> I<00:05:09.800> just<00:05:10.039> think<00:05:10.099> that<00:05:10.280> the<00:05:10.430> way<00:05:10.550> they

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:10.699 
think but I just think that the way they

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:12.580 
think but I just think that the way they
compose<00:05:11.120> and<00:05:11.479> wrote<00:05:11.750> the<00:05:11.780> songs<00:05:12.229> on<00:05:12.470> this

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
compose and wrote the songs on this

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.860 
compose and wrote the songs on this
album<00:05:12.650> doesn't<00:05:13.520> really<00:05:13.820> blow<00:05:14.060> me<00:05:14.270> away<00:05:14.389> but

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
album doesn't really blow me away but

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.360 
album doesn't really blow me away but
it's<00:05:15.050> still<00:05:15.199> good<00:05:15.410> yeah<00:05:15.650> it<00:05:15.800> kind<00:05:16.190> of<00:05:16.220> comes

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
it's still good yeah it kind of comes

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.909 
it's still good yeah it kind of comes
down<00:05:16.490> to<00:05:16.699> me<00:05:16.820> too<00:05:17.030> that<00:05:17.570> it's<00:05:18.320> really<00:05:18.530> not<00:05:18.710> now

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
down to me too that it's really not now

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.189 
down to me too that it's really not now
it's<00:05:19.490> more<00:05:19.880> of<00:05:19.910> a<00:05:20.060> compliation<00:05:20.539> definitely

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 
it's more of a compliation definitely

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.930 
it's more of a compliation definitely
definitely<00:05:21.470> projectors<00:05:22.250> tracks<00:05:22.580> Dirty

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940

very well and still feel like a cohesive
album<00:05:30.169> if<00:05:30.590> two<00:05:31.430> things<00:05:31.669> happen<00:05:32.030> one<00:05:32.270> high

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720

us<00:05:46.190> much<00:05:46.370> I'm<00:05:46.909> betting<00:05:47.539> um<00:05:47.690> and<00:05:48.470> that<00:05:48.560> just

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
us much I'm betting um and that just

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.260 
us much I'm betting um and that just
kind<00:05:49.010> of<00:05:49.039> keeps<00:05:49.220> it<00:05:49.370> from<00:05:49.490> being<00:05:49.550> a<00:05:49.820> cohesive

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
kind of keeps it from being a cohesive

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.120 
kind of keeps it from being a cohesive
listening<00:05:50.780> experience<00:05:51.169> but<00:05:51.289> but<00:05:51.590> don't<00:05:51.770> don't

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830 
production was good i thought that i

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.589 
production was good i thought that i
thought<00:06:01.130> the<00:06:01.310> male<00:06:01.699> vocalist<00:06:02.180> actually<00:06:02.449> did<00:06:02.570> a

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:02.599 
thought the male vocalist actually did a

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:04.810 
thought the male vocalist actually did a
much<00:06:02.810> better<00:06:02.840> job<00:06:03.139> on<00:06:03.470> this<00:06:03.590> album<00:06:03.800> um<00:06:04.430> but<00:06:04.760> I

much better job on this album um but I

much better job on this album um but I
was<00:06:05.150> kind<00:06:05.539> of<00:06:05.599> it's<00:06:05.750> kind<00:06:05.870> of<00:06:05.960> a<00:06:06.050> double-edged

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:06.409 
was kind of it's kind of a double-edged

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:07.930 
was kind of it's kind of a double-edged
thing<00:06:06.650> because<00:06:06.889> he<00:06:07.039> played<00:06:07.250> a<00:06:07.280> larger<00:06:07.789> role

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
thing because he played a larger role

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.909 
thing because he played a larger role
and<00:06:08.330> I<00:06:08.419> really<00:06:08.690> love<00:06:08.870> the<00:06:09.080> female<00:06:09.380> vocals<00:06:09.800> on
