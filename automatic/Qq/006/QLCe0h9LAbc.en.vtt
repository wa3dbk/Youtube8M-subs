00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.770
 people which once again stood on 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.359
 today i have another ball 12 june 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.519
 Crib money for you were us 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.200
 here today for the hype in my case 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.490
 it is the peace and helped in yours 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.740
 In this case, the traffic server can work for you 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.929
 Of course, that's how things change 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.720
 Whole is of course an op 8 helped with 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.890
 the prefix as I said the pri fix 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.630
 just make me something 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.060
 increased weapon damage had the damage 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.410
 is about 5 million with me 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.779
 671,000, however, are always with 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.460
 the rocket launcher not really 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.079
 meaningful because the rocket launcher 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.329
 a very special and very very 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.680
 has unique weapons effect anyway 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.790
 I go through the most important and 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.510
 also say something for lunch 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.370
 So the accuracy is 84 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.000
 relatively normal celebration raid 0 5 is just 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.200
 slightly lower battery speed 6.2 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.500
 relatively high but normal from lana 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.250
 magazine size 8 thus relatively large and 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.680
 yes here in the red text it depends 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.390
 here is full of bees and yes that 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.649
 refers to the firearms effect 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.010
 I'll tell you in detail 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.060
 explain 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.310
 another special feature of the weapon 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.689
 this is always the weapon with the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.860
 shop element will get as he 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.320
 never weapon to the other element 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.320
 always get the shock shock 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.090
 but I am a you will which was responsible for 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.470
 always with the corrosive element 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.659
 and never with another element exactly 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.850
 so I'm just one 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.650
 a little tired 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.720
 So here you are as always said 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.380
 with the corrosive element and get 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.119
 not with any other one, so yes 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.650
 I always wanted big events 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.689
 actually say so we are looking now 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.579
 first the firearms effect on and 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.939
 Although this works so here is one 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.009
 Rocket fired stands around here and 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.259
 this chain shoots now seven seconds 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.500
 long you see that here is the rocket 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.259
 shoot two arrows for seven seconds 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.659
 for 7 seconds per second, two seconds 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.680
 arrows what is highlights and missiles 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.390
 but they look a bit like 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.320
 many who are there so my gob is 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.469
 not easy to explain 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.720
 So altogether comes here on 14 rockets 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:11.430
 be fired and in addition there is 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.500
 even this part of what goes up in the air 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.830
 and that makes then additionally also 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:21.629
 times hurt so every rocket makes up approximately one 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:23.010
 million damage so 100 950,000 he 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.250
 almost a million so then you come 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.739
 14 missiles damage 14 million 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.709
 and then the explosion of the 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.720
 rocket which fires the missiles 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.550
 sometimes 25 million damage 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.110
 come back to about 16 5 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.879
 millions harm suggesting a 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.830
 unkempt dummy but already relative 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.420
 Neat is they are meandering 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.410
 Just take the dummy and look at us 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:51.510
 then look like the chance then look there 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:53.459
 Does it make 35 million 14 per species? 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.200
 So theoretically meet here 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.730
 Of course not every time and then too 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.730
 another 33 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.550
 So as I said but he does not remember 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.550
 that was lying 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.560
 so again 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.450
 So now 14 times per rocket 35 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.230
 million and then at the end of the rocket 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.670
 which still explodes again makes 87 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.620
 million then we can total up 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:27.310
 a harm when snoozing dummy from 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.040
 about right momentary right 14th 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.080
 what about 58 million harms 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.610
 but it is really neat when he is money 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.530
 is just the rocket launcher effect 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.690
 really unique and really cool 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.400
 you can do it all for the 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.959
 the rising chop emergency to use as well 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.030
 really strong and correct op 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.880
 is and yes that's why the weapon is 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.709
 pretty cool and definitely 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.940
 defends itself zuzulegen all and now 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.340
 Of course, I still tell you how you like that 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.640
 weapon gets like that and you have to 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.260
 for that in the edit nexus badlands around there 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:02.269
 to drive saturn the whole thing is one 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.860
 design you must defeat if you 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.510
 through the storyline is so if you 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.709
 the post has not been seen 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.160
 or have not yet defeated 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.360
 then just do not continue , I say 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.660
 just not far enough and have to 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.190
 just do not continue to play sorry 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.539
 In general I have to say that I am already 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.989
 that it took me a long time to 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.989
 to get a hand 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.440
 15 - 15 30 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.690
 It's really fast, you really have to 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.479
 The opponent is also running relatively far 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.220
 easy hungary ca with classes again 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.720
 Siren you have to stop a bit 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.680
 spotting play because he much 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.840
 harm does I would recommend 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:42.600
 just a bit of areal here at the back 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.600
 to stay and just the bi and 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.810
 that kept and the sun wore to use 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.730
 then it's going pretty well so you can 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.320
 the tempo nell glitsch pretty much 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.740
 more aggressive, that works 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.780
 very good is also very fast 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.340
 yes I somehow had to plan 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.510
 driven've got him on unity 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.090
 and even times are now just two 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.370
 subscribers means tried again 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.860
 to get back to business was unfortunately 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.210
 just about sex but i show the job 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.350
 Of course, I still had background 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.440
 now really not enough time one more time 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.660
 to drive europe so much time i have 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.850
 Of course not 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:19.190
 As I said, it can take a long time 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.200
 he does not have a good baby, that's it 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.700
 a little something to drive though 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.960
 pretty cool as I think my single 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.090
 really very unique weapons 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.890
 effect and that's what I care about everyone 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.600
 worth the case and yes, then I always hope 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.730
 that you like the video or continue 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.470
 had helped if such is yet 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.820
 easy on the ground comment or like there 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.590
 I would always be very happy about it 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.850
 and yes then have fun with that 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.080
 job and then we will see each other as always 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.080
 goodbye next time
