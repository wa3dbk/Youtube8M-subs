here<00:00:19.199> are<00:00:19.439> seasoned<00:00:19.859> performers<00:00:20.400> but<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.090> think

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
here are seasoned performers but I think

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.540

as<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.810> pressure<00:00:22.020> increases<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:23.039> it's

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
as the pressure increases and it's

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.880 
as the pressure increases and it's
become<00:00:23.910> very<00:00:24.150> political<00:00:24.810> now<00:00:25.289> because<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
become very political now because the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.740 
become very political now because the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
I know for a fact that a Praetorian

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.780 
I know for a fact that a Praetorian
below<00:00:31.050> was<00:00:31.289> really<00:00:31.949> really<00:00:32.250> disappointed

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
having lost both Team Championships

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.119 
having lost both Team Championships
juniors<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.700> seniors<00:00:36.649> the<00:00:37.649> nerves<00:00:37.890> of

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
juniors and seniors the nerves of

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.010 
juniors and seniors the nerves of
boundless<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.879> dismiss<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.360> from<00:00:39.570> Baloo<00:00:39.840> to

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020

the<00:00:40.140> girls<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.710> they<00:00:41.550> will<00:00:41.760> feel<00:00:41.969> much<00:00:42.300> more

the girls and they will feel much more
under<00:00:42.809> pressure<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.680> think<00:00:43.950> we<00:00:44.040> might<00:00:44.160> see

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
under pressure so I think we might see

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.979 
under pressure so I think we might see
