cardiovascular perspective kick in at
about<00:00:46.100> 2,000<00:00:47.100> milligrams<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:48.000> epa<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.420> DHA

about 2,000 milligrams of epa and DHA
per<00:00:49.110> day<00:00:49.320> okay<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.039> if<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.219> look<00:00:50.250> for<00:00:50.640> fish<00:00:50.820> oil

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170

per day okay so if you look for fish oil
you<00:00:52.170> may<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.500> want<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.710> make<00:00:52.800> sure<00:00:52.829> that

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
there's a good levels of both epa and

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.510 
there's a good levels of both epa and
DHA<00:00:55.230> otherwise<00:00:55.860> you're<00:00:56.160> really<00:00:56.309> not<00:00:56.399> getting

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
DHA otherwise you're really not getting

mentioned now with that said is krill
oil<00:01:23.369> better<00:01:23.850> than<00:01:24.060> fish<00:01:24.270> oil<00:01:24.509> well<00:01:25.320> again

antioxidant<00:01:34.110> pretty<00:01:34.770> much<00:01:34.950> okay<00:01:35.369> so

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
antioxidant pretty much okay so

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.789 
antioxidant pretty much okay so
astaxanthin<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.840> know<00:01:36.960> it's<00:01:37.079> pretty<00:01:37.439> kind<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.770> a

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
astaxanthin I know it's pretty kind of a

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.910 
astaxanthin I know it's pretty kind of a
little<00:01:38.159> tongue<00:01:38.310> twister<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:39.930> it's<00:01:40.799> a

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
little tongue twister is the it's a

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.980 
little tongue twister is the it's a
carotenoid<00:01:41.579> it's<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.759> pigments<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.360> makes

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
carotenoid it's a pigments that makes

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.490 
carotenoid it's a pigments that makes
salmon<00:01:43.829> red<00:01:44.040> it's<00:01:44.610> when<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.600> cook<00:01:45.840> lobster<00:01:46.079> or

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
salmon red it's when you cook lobster or

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.350 
salmon red it's when you cook lobster or
shellfish<00:01:46.979> that's<00:01:47.280> what<00:01:47.430> turns<00:01:47.759> them<00:01:48.000> kind<00:01:48.299> of

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
shellfish that's what turns them kind of

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.149 
shellfish that's what turns them kind of
reddish<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:49.079> that's<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.409> that's<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.950> that's

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
reddish so that's that that's a that's

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.639 
reddish so that's that that's a that's
that<00:01:50.280> carotenoid<00:01:50.850> astaxanthin<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.750> then

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
that carotenoid astaxanthin and then

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.300 
that carotenoid astaxanthin and then
krill

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
krill

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.069 
krill
it's<00:01:53.729> about<00:01:54.329> there's<00:01:54.960> about<00:01:55.490> 20<00:01:56.490> times<00:01:57.079> more

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
it's about there's about 20 times more

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.730 
it's about there's about 20 times more
astaxanthin<00:01:58.890> in<00:01:59.369> krill<00:01:59.729> oil<00:01:59.969> or<00:02:00.930> krill<00:02:01.320> itself

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
astaxanthin in krill oil or krill itself

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.080 
astaxanthin in krill oil or krill itself
which<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.130> kind<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.310> like<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.490> little<00:02:02.610> bottom

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
which is kind of like a little bottom

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.499 
which is kind of like a little bottom
feeders<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.590> sea<00:02:04.770> food<00:02:05.009> chain<00:02:05.509> versus

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
feeders of the sea food chain versus

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.419 
feeders of the sea food chain versus
salmon<00:02:06.930> as<00:02:07.049> an<00:02:07.200> example<00:02:07.619> okay<00:02:07.829> so<00:02:07.860> if<00:02:08.250> you're

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
salmon as an example okay so if you're

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.520 
salmon as an example okay so if you're
having<00:02:08.610> creature<00:02:09.030> using<00:02:09.450> krill<00:02:09.629> oil<00:02:09.750> there's

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
having creature using krill oil there's

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.020 
having creature using krill oil there's
this<00:02:10.830> higher<00:02:11.099> amount<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.400> astaxanthin<00:02:11.730> which

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
this higher amount of astaxanthin which

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.580 
this higher amount of astaxanthin which
is<00:02:12.239> an<00:02:12.330> antioxidant<00:02:12.540> and

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
is an antioxidant and

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.500 
is an antioxidant and
very<00:02:13.830> very<00:02:13.980> nice<00:02:14.160> because<00:02:14.400> antioxidants<00:02:15.269> are

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
very very nice because antioxidants are

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.229 
very very nice because antioxidants are
really<00:02:16.319> important<00:02:16.739> for<00:02:16.769> our<00:02:16.890> health<00:02:17.150> but<00:02:18.150> is

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
really important for our health but is

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.699 
really important for our health but is
that<00:02:18.330> enough<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:18.780> is<00:02:19.080> that<00:02:19.260> enough<00:02:19.560> to

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
that enough is that is that enough to

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.430 
that enough is that is that enough to
say<00:02:19.860> that<00:02:19.890> krill<00:02:20.250> oil<00:02:20.340> is<00:02:20.840> day<00:02:21.840> like<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:22.349> know

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
say that krill oil is day like you know

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.309 
say that krill oil is day like you know
far<00:02:22.950> by<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.459> know<00:02:23.730> by<00:02:23.910> by<00:02:23.940> any<00:02:24.690> stretch<00:02:24.930> you

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
far by you know by by any stretch you

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.750 
far by you know by by any stretch you
know<00:02:25.440> without<00:02:25.800> a<00:02:25.950> shadow<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.459> doubt<00:02:26.550> is

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
know without a shadow of the doubt is

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.180 
know without a shadow of the doubt is
better<00:02:27.330> than<00:02:27.480> fish<00:02:27.629> well<00:02:27.810> it's<00:02:28.709> really

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
better than fish well it's really

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.949 
better than fish well it's really
thought<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.519> really<00:02:29.700> depends<00:02:30.030> which<00:02:30.239> fish<00:02:30.660> oil

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
thought it really depends which fish oil

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.289 
thought it really depends which fish oil
you're<00:02:31.140> comparing<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:32.069> and<00:02:32.310> understand

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
you're comparing it to and understand

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.720 
you're comparing it to and understand
that<00:02:33.390> there<00:02:33.569> can<00:02:33.840> be<00:02:33.870> synthetic<00:02:34.489> versions<00:02:35.489> or

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
that there can be synthetic versions or

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.000 
that there can be synthetic versions or
sources<00:02:36.330> of<00:02:36.540> astaxanthin<00:02:37.440> that<00:02:37.830> are<00:02:37.920> not

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
sources of astaxanthin that are not

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.320 
sources of astaxanthin that are not
actually<00:02:38.340> coming<00:02:38.610> from<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.910> real<00:02:39.030> food

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
actually coming from the real food

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330 
actually coming from the real food
source<00:02:39.569> so<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:40.140> lot<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.500> really<00:02:40.799> tricky<00:02:41.160> things

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
source so a lot of really tricky things

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.390 
source so a lot of really tricky things
to<00:02:41.430> consider<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.030> for<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.569> average<00:02:42.720> consumer

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
to consider and for the average consumer

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.860 
to consider and for the average consumer
you<00:02:44.400> really<00:02:44.879> can't<00:02:45.209> make<00:02:45.299> any<00:02:45.510> sense<00:02:45.690> of<00:02:45.810> this

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
you really can't make any sense of this

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.750 
you really can't make any sense of this
because<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.319> look<00:02:46.680> at<00:02:46.769> a<00:02:46.799> food<00:02:47.010> label<00:02:47.160> or<00:02:47.489> an

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
because you look at a food label or an

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.740 
because you look at a food label or an
ingredient<00:02:48.120> list<00:02:48.239> and<00:02:48.329> you're<00:02:48.480> just<00:02:48.630> like

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
ingredient list and you're just like

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.559 
ingredient list and you're just like
okay<00:02:49.530> sure<00:02:49.860> I<00:02:49.890> just<00:02:50.040> that<00:02:50.400> looks<00:02:50.579> alright<00:02:50.760> or

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
okay sure I just that looks alright or

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:52.670 
okay sure I just that looks alright or
some<00:02:51.810> people<00:02:51.989> don't<00:02:52.110> even<00:02:52.260> look<00:02:52.410> at<00:02:52.560> the

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
some people don't even look at the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.860 
some people don't even look at the
ingredient<00:02:53.010> list<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.190> they<00:02:53.310> just<00:02:53.489> grab

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
ingredient list and they just grab

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.180 
ingredient list and they just grab
official<00:02:54.870> that's<00:02:55.019> recommended<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.620> them<00:02:55.769> or

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
official that's recommended to them or

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.890 
official that's recommended to them or
that<00:02:56.549> they<00:02:56.670> saw<00:02:56.819> on<00:02:56.849> TV<00:02:57.000> or<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.480> friend

that they saw on TV or a friend

that they saw on TV or a friend
recommended<00:02:58.349> and<00:02:58.530> so<00:02:58.920> forth<00:02:59.129> so<00:02:59.310> krill<00:03:00.030> oil

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
recommended and so forth so krill oil

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.850 
recommended and so forth so krill oil
the<00:03:00.660> main<00:03:00.840> difference<00:03:01.200> is<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:01.530> contains

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
the main difference is that it contains

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.509 
the main difference is that it contains
high<00:03:02.040> amounts<00:03:02.250> of<00:03:02.610> astaxanthin<00:03:04.129> some<00:03:05.129> studies

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
high amounts of astaxanthin some studies

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.170 
high amounts of astaxanthin some studies
have<00:03:05.640> shown<00:03:05.879> that<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:07.200> it's<00:03:08.069> omega-3s<00:03:08.879> are<00:03:09.120> a

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
have shown that the it's omega-3s are a

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.559 
have shown that the it's omega-3s are a
little<00:03:09.540> bit<00:03:09.750> easier<00:03:09.959> to<00:03:10.940> assimilate<00:03:11.940> into<00:03:12.360> the

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
little bit easier to assimilate into the

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.110 
little bit easier to assimilate into the
body<00:03:12.750> so<00:03:13.049> absorb<00:03:13.590> into<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:13.799> body<00:03:14.010> versus<00:03:14.910> some

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
body so absorb into the body versus some

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.670 
body so absorb into the body versus some
it<00:03:15.269> some<00:03:15.540> fish<00:03:15.750> oils<00:03:15.989> but<00:03:16.200> again<00:03:16.440> it<00:03:16.560> really

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
it some fish oils but again it really

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.530 
it some fish oils but again it really
depends<00:03:17.099> on<00:03:17.250> which<00:03:17.400> fish<00:03:17.730> oils<00:03:18.060> have<00:03:18.299> been

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
depends on which fish oils have been

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.750 
depends on which fish oils have been

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
compared to that because as I've

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.360 
compared to that because as I've
mentioned<00:03:20.910> there<00:03:21.239> are<00:03:21.299> different<00:03:21.720> types

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370

triglycerides<00:03:25.639> re<00:03:27.620> there's<00:03:28.620> about<00:03:28.799> three

about

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
about

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.870 
about
by<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.060> processing<00:03:33.810> official<00:03:34.650> so<00:03:34.889> unless<00:03:35.639> you

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
by the processing official so unless you

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.479 
by the processing official so unless you
know<00:03:36.090> which<00:03:36.930> fish<00:03:37.410> oil<00:03:37.650> contains<00:03:38.040> which<00:03:38.220> one

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
know which fish oil contains which one

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.490 
know which fish oil contains which one
there<00:03:39.120> are<00:03:39.209> very<00:03:39.510> very<00:03:39.540> different<00:03:40.049> absorption

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
there are very very different absorption

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.890 
there are very very different absorption
rates<00:03:40.920> in<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.730> human<00:03:42.000> body<00:03:42.120> so<00:03:42.480> that's<00:03:42.660> again

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
rates in the human body so that's again

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.780 
rates in the human body so that's again
why<00:03:43.109> I<00:03:43.139> talked<00:03:43.440> a<00:03:43.470> lot<00:03:43.859> about<00:03:44.010> this<00:03:44.250> stuff<00:03:44.370> in

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
why I talked a lot about this stuff in

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.520 
why I talked a lot about this stuff in
my<00:03:45.180> official<00:03:45.359> report<00:03:45.720> which<00:03:46.049> I<00:03:46.200> highly

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
my official report which I highly

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.530 
my official report which I highly
recommend<00:03:46.769> you<00:03:47.609> grab<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:47.819> copy<00:03:48.090> of<00:03:48.299> if<00:03:48.450> you

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
recommend you grab a copy of if you

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.890 
recommend you grab a copy of if you
haven't<00:03:48.900> already<00:03:49.910> again<00:03:50.910> it's<00:03:51.209> just<00:03:51.299> top

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
haven't already again it's just top

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.900 
haven't already again it's just top
quality<00:03:52.349> information<00:03:52.829> that<00:03:52.980> really<00:03:53.519> is<00:03:53.609> very

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
quality information that really is very

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.589 
quality information that really is very
tough<00:03:54.269> to<00:03:54.299> find<00:03:54.630> online<00:03:54.780> so<00:03:56.389> again<00:03:57.389> coming

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
tough to find online so again coming

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.120 
tough to find online so again coming
back<00:03:57.690> from<00:03:57.959> any<00:03:58.079> question<00:03:58.380> cruel<00:03:58.620> versus<00:03:58.950> fish

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
back from any question cruel versus fish

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.370 
back from any question cruel versus fish
well<00:03:59.340> I<00:03:59.519> don't<00:04:00.359> think<00:04:00.750> that<00:04:00.989> there's<00:04:01.290> a

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
well I don't think that there's a

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.530 
well I don't think that there's a
definitive<00:04:02.099> answer<00:04:02.730> to<00:04:02.760> which<00:04:03.060> one<00:04:03.269> is<00:04:03.389> better

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
definitive answer to which one is better

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.199 
definitive answer to which one is better
I<00:04:03.660> think<00:04:03.930> if<00:04:04.049> you<00:04:04.200> use<00:04:04.230> either<00:04:04.739> one<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.669> key<00:04:06.030> is

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
I think if you use either one the key is

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.120 
I think if you use either one the key is
looking<00:04:06.540> for<00:04:06.690> a<00:04:06.720> good<00:04:07.049> quality<00:04:07.290> one<00:04:07.889> either

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
looking for a good quality one either

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.920 
looking for a good quality one either
way<00:04:08.489> so<00:04:08.549> whether<00:04:08.819> it's<00:04:09.000> a<00:04:09.060> krill<00:04:09.389> or<00:04:09.540> fish<00:04:09.750> oil

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
way so whether it's a krill or fish oil

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.930 
way so whether it's a krill or fish oil
just<00:04:10.560> make<00:04:10.739> sure<00:04:10.859> it's<00:04:11.010> high-quality<00:04:11.190> as<00:04:11.639> much

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
just make sure it's high-quality as much

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.479 
just make sure it's high-quality as much
as<00:04:12.090> possible<00:04:12.269> and<00:04:13.130> whether<00:04:14.130> you're<00:04:14.340> using

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
as possible and whether you're using

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.250 
as possible and whether you're using
krill<00:04:14.849> or<00:04:15.090> whether<00:04:15.269> using<00:04:15.630> fish<00:04:15.810> oil<00:04:16.049> you're

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
krill or whether using fish oil you're

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.900 
krill or whether using fish oil you're
still<00:04:16.560> going<00:04:16.709> to<00:04:16.739> benefit<00:04:17.070> tremendously<00:04:17.220> okay

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
still going to benefit tremendously okay

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.360 
still going to benefit tremendously okay
it's<00:04:18.450> not<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:18.750> say<00:04:18.900> that<00:04:18.930> fish<00:04:19.680> oils<00:04:19.889> terrible

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
it's not to say that fish oils terrible

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.310 
it's not to say that fish oils terrible
krill<00:04:20.669> is<00:04:20.820> amazing<00:04:21.329> or<00:04:21.479> krill<00:04:21.870> is<00:04:21.989> terrible

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
krill is amazing or krill is terrible

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.719 
krill is amazing or krill is terrible
official<00:04:22.650> is<00:04:22.710> amazing<00:04:23.070> either<00:04:23.280> one<00:04:23.550> is<00:04:23.700> fine

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
official is amazing either one is fine

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:24.950 
official is amazing either one is fine
and<00:04:24.300> if<00:04:24.719> you

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
and if you

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.330 
and if you
want<00:04:25.110> to<00:04:25.169> get<00:04:25.259> the<00:04:25.319> best<00:04:25.590> benefits<00:04:26.100> from<00:04:26.190> all

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
want to get the best benefits from all

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.219 
want to get the best benefits from all
just<00:04:26.610> rotate<00:04:27.060> through<00:04:27.330> so<00:04:27.509> maybe<00:04:27.750> one<00:04:28.020> month

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
just rotate through so maybe one month

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:29.540 
just rotate through so maybe one month
to<00:04:28.319> use<00:04:28.440> krill<00:04:28.740> oil<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:29.039> next<00:04:29.220> to<00:04:29.280> use<00:04:29.430> your

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
to use krill oil the next to use your

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.939 
to use krill oil the next to use your
fish<00:04:29.699> oil<00:04:29.850> and<00:04:30.120> just<00:04:30.569> rotate<00:04:30.990> every<00:04:31.169> month<00:04:31.380> so

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
fish oil and just rotate every month so

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:34.129 
fish oil and just rotate every month so
you<00:04:32.009> get<00:04:32.220> the<00:04:32.310> benefits<00:04:32.759> of<00:04:32.880> both<00:04:32.940> okay<00:04:33.690> so

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
you get the benefits of both okay so

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.320 
you get the benefits of both okay so
that's<00:04:34.289> my<00:04:34.470> voice<00:04:34.770> on<00:04:35.039> official<00:04:35.610> versus<00:04:36.000> krill

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
that's my voice on official versus krill

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.600 
that's my voice on official versus krill
oil<00:04:36.509> either<00:04:37.169> one<00:04:37.560> is<00:04:37.680> going<00:04:37.800> to<00:04:37.860> contain<00:04:38.190> good

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
oil either one is going to contain good

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.040 
oil either one is going to contain good
amounts<00:04:38.940> of<00:04:39.000> omega-3<00:04:39.090> fatty<00:04:39.599> acids<00:04:39.990> which

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
amounts of omega-3 fatty acids which

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.230 
amounts of omega-3 fatty acids which
your<00:04:40.319> body<00:04:40.410> ultimately<00:04:41.039> needs<00:04:41.340> krill<00:04:42.210> oil

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
your body ultimately needs krill oil

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.570 
your body ultimately needs krill oil
contains<00:04:42.780> slightly<00:04:43.229> or<00:04:43.380> greater<00:04:44.160> amounts<00:04:44.520> of

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
contains slightly or greater amounts of

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.939 
contains slightly or greater amounts of
astaxanthin<00:04:45.000> which<00:04:45.419> is<00:04:45.539> an<00:04:45.630> antioxidant<00:04:45.949> but

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
astaxanthin which is an antioxidant but

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:49.430 
astaxanthin which is an antioxidant but
again<00:04:47.220> you<00:04:47.789> get<00:04:48.000> antioxidants<00:04:48.870> by<00:04:49.110> eating<00:04:49.349> a

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
again you get antioxidants by eating a

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.379 
again you get antioxidants by eating a
clean<00:04:49.710> Whole<00:04:50.009> Foods<00:04:50.039> diet<00:04:50.340> anyways<00:04:50.970> so<00:04:51.270> if

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
clean Whole Foods diet anyways so if

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:52.550 
clean Whole Foods diet anyways so if
that's<00:04:51.599> the<00:04:51.810> only<00:04:51.840> reason<00:04:52.470> you're

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
that's the only reason you're

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.040 
that's the only reason you're
considering<00:04:53.009> krill<00:04:53.190> oil<00:04:53.340> then<00:04:54.150> maybe<00:04:54.870> that's

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
considering krill oil then maybe that's

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.510 
considering krill oil then maybe that's
not<00:04:55.110> the<00:04:55.199> best<00:04:55.289> reason<00:04:55.830> but<00:04:55.919> the<00:04:56.039> other<00:04:56.250> thing

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
not the best reason but the other thing

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.550 
not the best reason but the other thing
to<00:04:56.580> consider<00:04:56.759> with<00:04:57.000> krill<00:04:57.270> oil<00:04:57.300> is<00:04:57.690> that<00:04:58.199> krill

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
to consider with krill oil is that krill

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.960 
to consider with krill oil is that krill
has<00:04:58.590> actually<00:04:59.039> been<00:04:59.160> banned<00:04:59.460> from<00:04:59.820> being

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
has actually been banned from being
