00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:18.640
 Today Thank you to Makoto Fuji Metropolitan This time I received a look at my video seminar 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:23.080
 How to migrate the existing site to be introduced from now on to wordpress 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:25.460
 A server that can use wordpress regardless of which rental server is used 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:30.580
 You can do the same if 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:34.200
 Because the operation method is different depending on each mental sarker 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:40.350
 Unfortunately I can not introduce how to slide 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.950
 So if this video seminar is being run on an existing site X server 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.640
 Limited 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.020
 Because it will be an explanation 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:50.000
 Please note in advance 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:54.430
 Also, the shopping site has no program built into it 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.430
 Simple homepage is targeted 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:06.480
 Then I will explain the transition procedure 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:09.740
 First of all, the existing html site is an existing html sea and this site is 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.909
 I want to use wordpress at this time 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.340
 First of all for this site 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.250
 Below 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:22.090
 Create a folder called wp 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:25.869
 And install wordpress there 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.520
 The other ground information It is this kind of information existing site 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.299
 The above image 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.299
 Enter 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:40.990
 And input of word-play students who wp folder installed When you have finished all 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:44.440
 Close and delete the existing html etc. 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.780
 delete files in wp folder 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:53.010
 After the 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:57.080
 Rewrite the database value using a batch rewrite tool and make the url old 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.080
 Change the lyrics from one to new 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:08.289
 Introducing the ftp software called file g et al. 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:11.050
 If the ftp software, but there are many to the move of wordpress 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:16.420
 It is one of the recommendations 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:18.580
 The reason is that the wordpress changes in the middle because the number is large and the overall size is also large 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.520
 Error is easy to occur 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:26.770
 This file g is less likely to be an error on the way 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:29.310
 Because there are many can become since that's the other two tp software 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.970
 If you are not good at personal computers 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:37.150
 We recommend this file g et al. 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.150
 It also has in also file g error also waiting child is not a movement 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.680
 Using this file g's over 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:47.290
 I will backup the existing site 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:51.590

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.520
 In it 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.680
 There is such a technology 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:33.690
 This ftp host user password here is each 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.980
 Cost here 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.380

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.760
 Supports password

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:10.379
 It will be a place 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:13.670
 It's your pc is here, but appropriate for the backup here 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:13.670
 Create a directory 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:31.130
 All this file to control or get command
