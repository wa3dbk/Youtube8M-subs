as<00:06:31.270> Eddie's<00:06:31.540> dead<00:06:31.750> on<00:06:32.170> the<00:06:32.740> film<00:06:33.010> but<00:06:33.220> this<00:06:33.370> is

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
as Eddie's dead on the film but this is

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:42.000 
as Eddie's dead on the film but this is
plain<00:06:33.790> straightforward<00:06:38.850> there's<00:06:41.010> great

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.010 
plain straightforward there's great

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:48.210 
plain straightforward there's great
similarity<00:06:43.740> but<00:06:44.740> i<00:06:44.800> think<00:06:45.160> the<00:06:46.590> smoky<00:06:47.590> is

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.220 
similarity but i think the smoky is

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.930 
similarity but i think the smoky is
slightly<00:06:48.640> drier<00:06:49.090> and<00:06:50.430> having<00:06:51.430> been<00:06:51.700> brought

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:51.940 
slightly drier and having been brought

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.450 
slightly drier and having been brought
up<00:06:52.240> on<00:06:52.450> bloaters<00:06:52.960> I<00:06:53.170> really<00:06:53.890> think<00:06:54.070> I'll<00:06:54.280> have

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:54.460 
up on bloaters I really think I'll have

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.030 
up on bloaters I really think I'll have
to<00:06:54.550> remain<00:06:54.880> loyal<00:06:54.940> to<00:06:55.420> them<00:06:55.780> the<00:06:56.620> yarmouth

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:57.040 
to remain loyal to them the yarmouth

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.360 
to remain loyal to them the yarmouth
bloater<00:06:57.280> takes<00:06:57.610> a<00:06:57.760> bit<00:06:57.910> of<00:06:57.940> beating
