 download and install retrica for it 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.090
 let's go to the link that is in 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.649
 the information of the video our web 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.020
 ricky apps and let's go to the end 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.840
 we have here the two replication options 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.510
 for android and ipad iphone replica 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.980
 or ipod touch this time I have connected 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.199
 to my samsung phone so I'm going to 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.750
 download from google play and I show you 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.430
 the final result some pictures that we 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.230
 appear here that have been taken with the 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.579
 application we are going to get something 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.739
 very similar on the day 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.110
 so we give the green button install 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.600
 we select our device and a 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.149
 more time we give the button to install 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.159
 metric will be installed on your device 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:13.229
 shortly remember that for this 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.060
 option to work correctly is 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.580
 necessary to have logged in 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.890
 Google play from your mobile phone and 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.080
 also on the computer with the same 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.970
 account and if it does not work that way 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.409
 nothing happens, only the 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.600
 google place from your phone and 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.100
 download it from there even though it's going to 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.740
 take a little more time because 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.690
 you have to look for the application and all of it 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.420
 well it shows you some of the 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.450
 main options of this application 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.630
 and it also has a timer as if 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.390
 will a digital camera have 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.159
 some filters that are more than 80 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.840
 filters most of them are 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.929
 free but there are some that are from 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.299
 pay I'll show you which ones you can use 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:57.330
 free and which will not allow us 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.700
 Share it through whatsapp mail 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.369
 electronic bluetooth and of course the 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.250
 social networks and brings many other 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.420
 options is great application I have 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.599
 over here connected 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.520
 Android phone and ready we enter 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.160
 a filter appears here an advice 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.890
 any photo you take before 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.470
 do it remember to touch the screen a 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.530
 little for the camera to do the 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.390
 approach and you get sharpness well the 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.510
 first is the ribbon and here 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.810
 let's choose how many photos we want 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.750
 we can choose one two three four or 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.790
 up to nine photos in a row as the 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.069
 let's schedule later I'll 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.470
 I say this time I'm going to choose four 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.420
 photos because today I have four 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.280
 very tiny models that are going to 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.380
 help with this video the second option 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.390
 is the one in this frame look at what is the 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.480
 effect that you can activate 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.269
 turn it off in every picture you do not 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.299
 worry let's leave it there and we're going to 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:01.730
 see the next option that is one with 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:04.640
 drop shape and is the option to add 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.860
 in shape with this approach you can move it 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.260
 on your screen pressing your finger 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.500
 you can enlarge it you can check it 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.540
 always focusing on your model and the 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.580
 character that you want to get the photo 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.769
 finally a framework if you want to what 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.920
 wide and what color I'm not going to choose 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.780
 frame this time and in the end we have the 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.319
 timer option that is the timer 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.690
 to see how many seconds you want to be 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.700
 take the picture after scheduling and the 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.670
 interval if we take more than one 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.849
 photo every interval we want the 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.609
 camera make the capture this time what 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:43.220
 I'm going to schedule in two seconds and now 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:46.160
 if the most important part comes with a 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.260
 a lot of metric filters are 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.260
 positions in this way with one of the 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.590
 best applications most of 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.500
 the filters are totally free and but 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.970
 some other options are pay 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.130
 closed nothing happens look 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.070
 when the button appears here free 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.810
 black central to be able to perform 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.700
 capture means that the option is 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.220
 free though if a 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.830
 candadito means that we are going to have 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:17.090
 make a payment to be able to use 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:20.060
 that filter but do not worry 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.580
 Most filters are free as well 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.460
 that you do not have to make any payment if 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.250
 is that you do not want and now we are going to 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.160
 proceed to take the photos look for 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.220
 we're just going to have to focus 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.800
 first focus so that it looks pretty 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.169
 clear and I'm going to position myself and I'm going to 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.410
 start by pressing the black button to 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:44.900
 a picture takes two seconds and it passes 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.810
 again it does not matter following another photo 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.729
 two seconds two seconds and two seconds 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.070
 plus we have the four images 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:55.389
 although the first one was repeated to me not 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:59.150
 nothing happens it's thing to go back to practice 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:01.520
 finally with this link option 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.440
 look we have here to share it 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.800
 by bluetooth email 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.960
 WhatsApp text messages or through 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.270
 the network you can delete the one you want 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.430
 delete this photo cancel or delete 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.039
 let's go back on the screen 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.530
 main application and I show you 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:20.479
 some of the additional options that 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.420
 have for it we're going to go here to 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:25.180
 configuration 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.900
 and we have the option to go to the option 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.460
 professional 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.710
 abul gheit so that it does not come out 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.690
 advertising or anything like that and many others 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.000
 filters from here we will be able to 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.890
 select a watermark in the 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.870
 Most of the photos will appear but 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:41.020
 you can also deactivate it so that 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.270
 appear the replica 1los logo if you 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.920
 like nothing happens you have many 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.110
 options for you to choose the brand of 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.570
 water that you like most there is here where 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.940
 google marc appears let's disable it 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.980
 I do not want any watermark 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.620
 at this time you can leave a 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:59.470
 application share it with your friends or 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.960
 tell it through the facebook we are going to 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:06.100
 back let's see the next option 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:08.680
 which is that of random functions like that 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.720
 that we have here in random pressing 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.940
 the random button will let us loose 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.770
 filters there is appearing the 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.860
 candadito in any of them means 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:20.560
 that are paid yes and many options 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:23.740
 that's really what makes this 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.360
 application is so so good at each 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.430
 one of them is going to appear 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.720
 approach or the framework you can 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.210
 turn it off 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.670
 every time you take a capture 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:36.970
 finally with the option to flip the 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:38.860
 camera we switch to the front camera and 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:41.080
 with that we would be embracing 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.750
 practically all the options that 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.220
 has this application a friends what 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.020
