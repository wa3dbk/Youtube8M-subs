what
well<00:07:40.029> I'm<00:07:40.449> looking<00:07:40.599> forward<00:07:41.109> to<00:07:41.229> the<00:07:41.349> next

00:07:41.499 --> 00:07:43.909 
well I'm looking forward to the next
Olympics<00:07:42.099> I<00:07:42.369> think<00:07:43.149> this<00:07:43.329> year<00:07:43.539> I've<00:07:43.659> been

00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 
Olympics I think this year I've been

00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:46.589 
Olympics I think this year I've been
more<00:07:44.919> successful<00:07:45.519> than<00:07:45.609> in<00:07:45.789> past<00:07:45.999> Olympics

00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:46.599 
more successful than in past Olympics

00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:51.239 
more successful than in past Olympics
just<00:07:46.749> by<00:07:46.869> being<00:07:47.139> here<00:07:47.349> and<00:07:47.999> in<00:07:48.999> a<00:07:49.089> race<00:07:49.269> I<00:07:50.249> think

00:07:51.239 --> 00:07:51.249 
just by being here and in a race I think

00:07:51.249 --> 00:07:53.879 
just by being here and in a race I think
I've<00:07:51.339> had<00:07:51.519> bad<00:07:51.759> luck<00:07:51.989> and<00:07:52.989> the<00:07:53.079> fact<00:07:53.349> that<00:07:53.469> the

00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:53.889 
I've had bad luck and the fact that the

00:07:53.889 --> 00:07:56.699 
I've had bad luck and the fact that the
last<00:07:54.129> two<00:07:54.789> months<00:07:55.119> have<00:07:55.239> been<00:07:55.359> really<00:07:55.599> up<00:07:56.529> and

00:07:56.699 --> 00:07:56.709 
last two months have been really up and

00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:59.819 
last two months have been really up and
down<00:07:56.769> health-wise<00:07:57.519> but<00:07:57.579> I<00:07:58.439> think<00:07:59.439> that<00:07:59.619> in<00:07:59.739> the

00:07:59.819 --> 00:07:59.829 
down health-wise but I think that in the

00:07:59.829 --> 00:08:01.349 
down health-wise but I think that in the
next<00:07:59.979> two<00:08:00.219> years<00:08:00.249> I<00:08:00.609> don't<00:08:00.669> want<00:08:00.939> to<00:08:00.999> take<00:08:01.179> any

00:08:01.349 --> 00:08:01.359 
next two years I don't want to take any

00:08:01.359 --> 00:08:03.509 
next two years I don't want to take any
more<00:08:01.509> breaks<00:08:01.829> for<00:08:02.829> injuries<00:08:03.159> or<00:08:03.339> anything

00:08:03.509 --> 00:08:03.519 
more breaks for injuries or anything
