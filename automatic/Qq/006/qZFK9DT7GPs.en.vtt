goals and things and then at the top we
actually<00:03:17.160> have<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.310> silver<00:03:17.730> striker<00:03:18.210> and<00:03:18.540> I

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
actually have a silver striker and I

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.870 
actually have a silver striker and I
used<00:03:19.440> him<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:19.800> he<00:03:19.920> was<00:03:20.070> I<00:03:20.280> believe<00:03:20.340> he<00:03:20.670> was

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
used him and he was I believe he was

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.360 
used him and he was I believe he was
gold<00:03:21.240> in<00:03:21.540> fifa<00:03:21.930> 12<00:03:22.140> I<00:03:22.380> thought<00:03:23.070> he<00:03:23.190> was<00:03:23.280> very

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
gold in fifa 12 I thought he was very

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.770 
gold in fifa 12 I thought he was very
good<00:03:23.670> in<00:03:23.700> fifa<00:03:23.970> 12<00:03:24.150> but<00:03:24.300> I<00:03:24.330> haven't<00:03:24.510> had<00:03:24.660> the

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
good in fifa 12 but I haven't had the

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.420 
good in fifa 12 but I haven't had the
opportunity<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:25.500> play<00:03:25.620> with<00:03:25.830> him<00:03:25.950> in<00:03:26.070> FIFA<00:03:26.370> 13

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
opportunity to play with him in FIFA 13

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.910 
opportunity to play with him in FIFA 13
so<00:03:26.970> I'm<00:03:27.330> i<00:03:27.540> decided<00:03:27.990> i'd<00:03:28.110> give<00:03:28.290> that<00:03:28.440> a<00:03:28.470> go<00:03:28.710> and

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
so I'm i decided i'd give that a go and

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.370 
so I'm i decided i'd give that a go and
he<00:03:29.070> is<00:03:29.160> still<00:03:29.430> a<00:03:29.460> very<00:03:29.850> strong<00:03:30.570> striker<00:03:31.050> in

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380

that<00:05:04.770> often<00:05:05.280> is<00:05:05.370> my<00:05:05.580> teams<00:05:05.820> are<00:05:05.970> very<00:05:06.210> pushed

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
that often is my teams are very pushed

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:10.190 
that often is my teams are very pushed
up<00:05:06.720> but<00:05:07.350> it<00:05:08.130> actually<00:05:08.430> it's<00:05:09.180> okay<00:05:09.630> as<00:05:09.870> weird<00:05:10.080> as

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
up but it actually it's okay as weird as

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.270 
up but it actually it's okay as weird as
this<00:05:10.229> sounds<00:05:10.350> you<00:05:10.710> know<00:05:10.740> they<00:05:10.950> all<00:05:11.070> have<00:05:11.250> a

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
this sounds you know they all have a

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.950 
this sounds you know they all have a
high<00:05:11.520> attacking<00:05:11.910> were<00:05:12.000> right<00:05:12.180> but<00:05:12.570> because<00:05:12.930> of

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
high attacking were right but because of

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.110 
high attacking were right but because of
the<00:05:13.169> pace<00:05:13.410> and<00:05:13.680> the<00:05:13.770> back<00:05:13.979> they<00:05:14.490> can<00:05:14.669> afford<00:05:14.790> to

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
the pace and the back they can afford to

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.880 
the pace and the back they can afford to
attack<00:05:15.780> like<00:05:16.020> that<00:05:16.050> and<00:05:16.410> still<00:05:16.650> get<00:05:16.860> back

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
attack like that and still get back

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.680 
attack like that and still get back
because<00:05:17.250> they<00:05:17.520> have<00:05:17.700> the<00:05:17.820> pace<00:05:18.000> to<00:05:18.210> get<00:05:18.360> back<00:05:18.510> I

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
because they have the pace to get back I

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.780 
because they have the pace to get back I
mean<00:05:19.440> you<00:05:19.620> I<00:05:19.650> mean<00:05:19.890> the<00:05:20.010> slowest<00:05:20.400> player<00:05:20.520> at

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970

the back is I think Sergio Ramos at 84
or<00:05:24.030> the<00:05:24.390> 83<00:05:24.870> or<00:05:24.900> something<00:05:25.290> but<00:05:25.770> yeah<00:05:26.310> I<00:05:26.340> mean

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.350 
it's it's something that kind of worried
me<00:05:28.710> when<00:05:28.830> I<00:05:28.890> was<00:05:29.040> making<00:05:29.340> the<00:05:29.430> team<00:05:29.610> but<00:05:30.120> I

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
me when I was making the team but I

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.270 
me when I was making the team but I

quickly learned that you know because
they're<00:05:32.490> so<00:05:32.700> fast<00:05:32.910> they<00:05:33.090> can<00:05:33.150> actually<00:05:33.360> get

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
they're so fast they can actually get

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.469 
they're so fast they can actually get
back<00:05:33.810> into<00:05:34.020> position<00:05:34.110> relatively<00:05:35.010> quickly
