failed me yet I've had it quite a few
years<00:00:50.760> now<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.980> just<00:00:52.980> bulletproof<00:00:53.449> and<00:00:54.680> back

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
years now and just bulletproof and back

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.459 
years now and just bulletproof and back
then<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.190> cost<00:00:56.550> me<00:00:56.760> something<00:00:57.090> like<00:00:57.469> eight

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
then it cost me something like eight

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.130 
then it cost me something like eight
pound<00:01:00.260> and<00:01:01.789> it<00:01:02.789> hasn't<00:01:02.969> broke<00:01:03.329> down<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.960> can

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
pound and it hasn't broke down you can

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:19.720 
pound and it hasn't broke down you can
buy<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.890> know<00:01:05.210> tuna<00:01:06.210> from<00:01:06.420> knives<00:01:06.750> dolls

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.500 

so<00:01:20.730> guys<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.270> method<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:22.250> using<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.640> flat<00:01:23.970> rock

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.570 
so guys this method is using a flat rock
and<00:01:25.340> to<00:01:26.340> cook<00:01:26.550> on<00:01:27.470> so<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.890> will<00:01:29.040> normally<00:01:29.190> use

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
and to cook on so you will normally use

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.960 
and to cook on so you will normally use
a<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:31.350> flattest<00:01:31.770> rock<00:01:32.010> you<00:01:32.160> could<00:01:32.340> found<00:01:32.610> in
