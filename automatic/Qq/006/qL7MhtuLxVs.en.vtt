00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:11.510
 Hi, how are I going to show you how 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.300
 make a paper clock 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.760
 what are we going to do this are we going to take 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.550
 our piece of paper in this case 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.430
 I'm using a paper that measures 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.029
 long 20 centimeters wide 6 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.029
 centimeters 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.900
 let's fold the paper in half 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.980
 Y 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.000
 then we are going to fold it 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.340
 as shown 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.010
 here 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.800
 and on the other side we're also going to fold it 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.800
 two 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.770
 Y 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.760
 let's talk again in half 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.770
 and let's do this doubles 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.390
 yes 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.080
 let's do this other 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.080
 i 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:57.899
 again as we do it to do the 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.170
 Paper ring is exactly the same 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.170
 process 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:10.920
 only that in this case we are going to use 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.920
 Well, a much bigger role 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.820
 like before 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:22.569
 let's go to this this side will go towards 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:26.700
 in carry that this other 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:29.510
 so that all this of this figure 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.510
 ah 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.890
 there will not be a figure like that 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.129
 now let's double this forgive if 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.129
 perhaps now 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.970
 equally the sides 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.880
 i 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.930
 let's turn our piece of paper 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.930
 and we are going to double 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.800
 like before 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.800
 i 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.660
 and then to the other side 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.530
 until you get this figure then what 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.530
 let's do 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.760
 let's separate 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.200
 and we are going to double 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.349
 Y 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.349
 partner 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.820
 what I'm going to do now 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.820
 I previously made a cover 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.310
 I'm going to paste it 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.280
 This is how the clock would look like 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.560
 I hope you liked the activity
