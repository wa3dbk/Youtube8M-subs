and so now I made it fourth and four so

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.910 
and so now I made it fourth and four so
luckily<00:02:35.490> you<00:02:35.670> know<00:02:35.700> with<00:02:35.940> this<00:02:36.060> play<00:02:36.740> you<00:02:37.740> have

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
luckily you know with this play you have

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.380

to<00:02:38.100> low<00:02:38.370> reeds<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:38.790> then<00:02:38.940> you<00:02:39.000> have<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.180> high

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.170 
to low reeds and then you have a high
read<00:02:39.660> so<00:02:39.870> both<00:02:40.110> does<00:02:40.320> a<00:02:40.350> little<00:02:40.590> reeds<00:02:40.740> are

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180
