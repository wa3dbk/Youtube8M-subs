00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:25.139
 the side we are with luis perdomo creator of a kadi alright they alright 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.550
 because we will address the issue of how not to hire people 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:34.349
 nowadays we find that the curricula are very similar, right? 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.940
 as manager knows any correct professional of the sentence 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.060
 a first thing is the manager knows 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.060
 Professional he's looking for 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.760
 first of all definite 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.930
 but its attributions what is the task that that position of the actor what I 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:53.770
 need 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.670
 I always have two components the person and the professional with their 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.400
 competence may or may not be specified in its 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.260
 curriculum 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.450
 and the person you are meeting at that moment 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.490
 at first and much more importantly 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.780
 meet the person 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.530
 to be discovered later and whether or not she has a professional 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.470
 those capabilities 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.150
 on the contrary professional more suitable this company what the manager 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.260
 should seek 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.400
 I do not think so 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.880
 as we can 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.299
 I would divide this question into light but some aspects the first is 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.190
 what are the values ​​of this person I'm looking for 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.050
 for your beliefs what I believe and what he must believe 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.170
 we can not fail to do so while we 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.180
 what a very important thing that he does no matter in what way he thinks 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.360
 what should I do 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.820
 then with encounters the person there yes I will seek to know for their abilities 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.650
 that she has and if she does not have any of the interesting things today 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.550
 in day and that we can easily put technical knowledge on us 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.880
 professionals when they want this knowledge is available 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.119
 the interview of the candidate 

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:16.399
 which should be the main focus of the manager 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:17.619
 the person 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:19.329
 the candidate is not 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:21.749
 the capabilities in my curriculum 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:25.729
 he is very distracted talking about the curriculum counting 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:28.869
 stories like the one who did it stopped doing 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:33.099
 this may have something to do with last week and we want to be 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.909
 how do you do it and why do you do some things 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:43.639
 What do you really want to see contribute to our organization? 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.509
 these are the most important things 

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:51.819
 then we will check for this art up because capacities like us 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.879
 already said they can be acquired can be done training with the 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.989
 professionals as long as he wants to 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.230
 is a professional contracted sectional company 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.779
 mediocre professional 

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:09.849
 have the same value have the same cost that interesting question because 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.060
 normally 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.699
 the mediocre costs me much more 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:19.379
 the two but not same things keep the same salaries same benefit 

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:22.689
 it will appear that the equal cost 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:25.969
 only the result non-professional sectional 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:28.969
 It will make a difference in my company. 

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:33.959
 little compared to the medium and will probably create situations 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.219
 if not productive, sometimes highly destructive or with potential 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:43.909
 destructive in the company when I compare these two things I come to the conclusion 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:47.569
 it is very expensive to hire a better professional is better not 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.019
 hire a thousand professional 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.199
 I read that you do not expect to have the best for your team.
