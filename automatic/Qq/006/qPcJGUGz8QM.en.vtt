00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello girls so welcome one day 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.089
 more to my channel discuss a little bit the 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.880
 voice that we are a bit grouped 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.600
 Well, I wanted to show you how 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.670
 they should make up their eyebrows 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.950
 why it is important to make up the 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.680
 after doing a makeup because 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.380
 really the frame of the eyebrows giving it 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.010
 a point a subtle point of makeup or 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.720
 make up completely is going to 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.610
 change the length of our face but 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.680
 always improving it by living marking 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.210
 too much to not enter our fans 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.700
 and in knowing how to make up my eyebrows and 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.700
 see step by step here I leave the video 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.920
 ah 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.650
 then the first step will be with a clamp 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.150
 clean our eyebrows with cheese I 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.309
 I mean to remove all the hairs that 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.340
 they are below them bone in the area 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.200
 of the eyelid and then we will comb the 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.600
 Well, as you can see here, I do not have 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.470
 a lot of hair is to say that I have some 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.040
 caritas are usually from birth 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.040
 ok and that's what there is 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.110
 with the help of a good marker I 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.570
 really just use this too you 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.939
 you can support with a good pencil because I 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.460
 I'm going to frame it gently I'm not going to 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.740
 mark too much and I will follow the form 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.039
 natural eyebrow to help me know 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.569
 How far do I have to paint it? 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:43.610
 the length of the eyebrow 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:46.490
 I'm going to measure with the brush going from the 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.069
 fin of the nose by the eye and then 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.959
 Then I will get the length of the eyebrow and 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:53.420
 I'm going to start retouching, I'm going to do 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:56.590
 very finite strokes like simulating hairs 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.590
 that would be ideal ok 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.790
 and now I'm going to comb it means that with 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.009
 this I will remove the excess pencil or 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.869
 the pen what I have put so that 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.220
 look a little more natural too 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:18.069
 I can fix them with this round it's like 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.870
 a mask but you leave what it does 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.830
 there is also a little bit of color and 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:27.730
 all fix them in my case to have calvi 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.950
 you are this type of masks not only in 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.020
 fill in what I do best 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.600
 how to color the hair and if there is no 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.540
 hair then not good so you see 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.890
 the difference of one eye with the other the 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.690
 it really stays very nice it stays very 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.280
 well marked and it is normally as not 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.519
 just carry and I think it 's the best 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.690
 way that you also do it 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.040
 Well now I'm going to teach another 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.230
 method 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.120
 it is also very similar but so that 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.799
 see that you can even recharge more 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.439
 the eyebrows if you like the eyebrow a little 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.230
 more stronger more pronounced if 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:01.150
 you carry in the makeups a little 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.090
 intense black good then here as os 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.239
 I said I'm going to directly put the 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.010
 eyebrow mask that I'm trying to 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.620
 fill the area where I do not have little hair 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.750
 but as you are seeing it costs me because 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.459
 Of course, since there is no hair, I'm 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.400
 painting like the skin but does not stay 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.139
 it does not stay fixed, well, I'm going to 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.450
 go over a bit more and by doing this 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:25.000
 go over a little more will catch more 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.030
 intensity to fill the spaces 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.970
 that I could not fill with my mask 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.060
 to use 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.830
 this is these shadows or shadows 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.780
 for eyebrows but you can also use 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.370
 any of your shadow palette the 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.490
 that you like most usually you have to 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.220
 opt for gray brown colors 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:47.690
 even beige but xuvia light beige 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.690
 dark good too 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.310
 a very practical way to know where 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.820
 start to live where I have to 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.520
 start to mark delineate is with a 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.050
 brush or with a stick as you see here 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.030
 to be able to pass the letter the nose 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.130
 passing the lacrimal and well where I 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.160
 take that is going to be the area 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:11.400
 that I'm going to score to start can not 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:17.600
 be not too pulling to the center of the nose 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.600
 neither too much tucked towards the eye 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.490
 and knowing these measures we are not going to 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.150
 help bring the eyebrows are very short 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.150
 or very long 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.230
 another way of knowing where they have to 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.150
 start our eyebrows is very easy 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.610
 because we put the same stick we 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.770
 we help and measure from one eyebrow to the other 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.560
 we do see three centimeters of 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:50.290
 separation so that you can make a 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.520
 idea of ​​the midline of the nose the 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.660
 centimeter and half a centimeter and a half 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.460
 that would be to start drawing the eyebrow 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.770
 perfect and all the little hairs that over 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:03.340
 They would be removed and in that I decided 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.720
 we would make an eyebrow and according to our 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.170
 our traits to our measure 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.170
 our face 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.830
 to know where our point starts 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.500
 highest of the eyebrow where to draw the 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.580
 bow of the piquito as you want to call 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.169
 you do more or less this I am 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:22.650
 doing me and we would put the pencil 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:24.870
 at a right angle through the iris 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.520
 the end of the iris and well there 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.789
 right now he is marking me 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.789
 piquito 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.070
 and tell me which style you liked the most 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.050
 marked with the most subtle 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.800
 Well, thank you very much for watching me 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.610
 God - from the book by 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.610
 yes 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:04.749
 and I'm going to apply it directly and then 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:08.669
 I'll blend with a brush very 

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:08.669
 finite I will also place
