hi<00:00:01.110> this<00:00:01.230> dr.<00:00:01.350> Centeno<00:00:01.920> and<00:00:02.220> today<00:00:02.310> I'd<00:00:03.210> like

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
hi this dr. Centeno and today I'd like

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.120 
hi this dr. Centeno and today I'd like
to<00:00:03.480> talk<00:00:03.600> about<00:00:03.810> what's<00:00:04.259> up<00:00:04.440> with<00:00:04.620> regenexx

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
to talk about what's up with regenexx

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.730 
to talk about what's up with regenexx
and<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.609> FDA<00:00:06.000> I<00:00:06.420> get<00:00:06.930> a<00:00:06.960> lot<00:00:07.170> of<00:00:07.319> questions

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
and the FDA I get a lot of questions

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.589 
and the FDA I get a lot of questions
about<00:00:07.919> this<00:00:08.370> so<00:00:09.000> I<00:00:09.030> thought<00:00:09.240> it<00:00:09.360> would<00:00:09.480> be<00:00:09.570> a

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
about this so I thought it would be a

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.209 
about this so I thought it would be a
good<00:00:09.840> idea<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.440> put<00:00:10.650> something<00:00:10.920> on<00:00:11.160> the

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
good idea to put something on the

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.930 
good idea to put something on the
internet<00:00:11.610> saying<00:00:12.389> this<00:00:12.960> is<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:14.190> status<00:00:14.759> of

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
internet saying this is the status of

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.050 
internet saying this is the status of
all<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.089> that<00:00:16.220> so<00:00:17.220> there<00:00:17.640> have<00:00:17.730> always<00:00:17.940> been

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
all of that so there have always been

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.140 
all of that so there have always been
two<00:00:18.539> tracks<00:00:18.930> for<00:00:19.320> new<00:00:19.470> therapy<00:00:19.980> discovery<00:00:20.640> we

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
two tracks for new therapy discovery we

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.990 
two tracks for new therapy discovery we
have<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.510> much<00:00:21.689> slower<00:00:22.310> Pharma<00:00:23.310> track<00:00:23.609> and

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
have the much slower Pharma track and

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.929 
have the much slower Pharma track and
the<00:00:24.689> much<00:00:24.869> quicker<00:00:25.170> physician<00:00:26.070> discovery

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
the much quicker physician discovery

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.540 
the much quicker physician discovery
track<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:28.320> benefits<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:29.010> pharma

all this in 2005 with an IRB approved
study<00:02:23.480> we<00:02:24.480> published<00:02:24.690> some<00:02:25.670> imaging

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
study we published some imaging

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.120 
study we published some imaging
proof-of-concept<00:02:27.530> reports<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.770> during<00:02:29.010> that

time we weren't charging patients that

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.040 
time we weren't charging patients that
was<00:02:31.410> just<00:02:31.650> research<00:02:32.390> then<00:02:33.390> once<00:02:33.600> we<00:02:33.720> saw<00:02:33.900> that

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
was just research then once we saw that

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.860 
was just research then once we saw that

so<00:03:07.440> FDA<00:03:07.769> claim<00:03:08.220> that<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.580> cultured<00:03:09.060> procedure

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
so FDA claim that the cultured procedure

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.040 
so FDA claim that the cultured procedure
not<00:03:10.319> the<00:03:10.560> same<00:03:10.800> day<00:03:11.040> procedure<00:03:11.540> was<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.569> drug

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
not the same day procedure was a drug

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.240 
not the same day procedure was a drug
and<00:03:13.500> that<00:03:13.920> we<00:03:14.069> were<00:03:14.250> producing<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:14.850> new<00:03:15.030> drug

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
and that we were producing a new drug

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.430 
and that we were producing a new drug
now<00:03:17.250> they<00:03:17.730> claim<00:03:18.030> that<00:03:18.090> we<00:03:18.450> were<00:03:18.600> producing<00:03:18.780> an

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
now they claim that we were producing an

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.819 
now they claim that we were producing an
adulterated<00:03:20.190> biologic<00:03:21.060> product<00:03:21.720> by<00:03:22.440> taking

the patient's own stem cells culturing

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.590 
the patient's own stem cells culturing
them<00:03:25.799> to<00:03:26.250> get<00:03:26.430> bigger<00:03:26.790> numbers<00:03:27.239> of<00:03:27.420> those

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
them to get bigger numbers of those

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
them to get bigger numbers of those
cells<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:29.120> that<00:03:30.120> we<00:03:30.299> weren't<00:03:30.510> following<00:03:31.079> drug

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
cells and that we weren't following drug

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.050 
cells and that we weren't following drug
mass<00:03:31.950> manufacturing<00:03:32.910> standards<00:03:33.540> all<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:33.980> cGMP

ie<00:03:36.060> that<00:03:36.630> our<00:03:36.750> medical<00:03:36.959> practice<00:03:37.680> didn't<00:03:38.220> look

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
ie that our medical practice didn't look

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.740 
ie that our medical practice didn't look
like<00:03:38.549> a<00:03:38.850> Pfizer<00:03:39.209> drug<00:03:39.660> Factory<00:03:41.420> so<00:03:42.420> let's<00:03:42.600> look

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
like a Pfizer drug Factory so let's look

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.590 
like a Pfizer drug Factory so let's look
at<00:03:42.930> that<00:03:43.109> issue<00:03:43.609> we<00:03:44.609> were<00:03:44.730> a<00:03:44.760> medical<00:03:45.150> practice

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
at that issue we were a medical practice

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.740 
at that issue we were a medical practice
culturing<00:03:46.200> our<00:03:46.470> own<00:03:46.799> cells<00:03:47.190> for<00:03:47.790> our<00:03:48.030> own<00:03:48.299> use

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
culturing our own cells for our own use

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.430 
culturing our own cells for our own use
not<00:03:49.230> a<00:03:49.260> drug<00:03:49.590> Factory<00:03:50.750> there<00:03:51.750> was<00:03:51.900> never<00:03:52.079> any

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
not a drug Factory there was never any

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.220 
not a drug Factory there was never any
evidence<00:03:52.620> that<00:03:53.220> we<00:03:53.340> produced<00:03:53.700> any

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
evidence that we produced any

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.120

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
adulterated or contaminated cells at all

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.069 
adulterated or contaminated cells at all
we<00:03:59.130> had<00:03:59.310> multiple<00:03:59.820> safety<00:04:00.299> audits<00:04:00.660> showing

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
we had multiple safety audits showing

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.380 
we had multiple safety audits showing
that<00:04:01.260> we<00:04:01.500> were<00:04:01.650> doing<00:04:01.890> a<00:04:01.950> good<00:04:01.980> job<00:04:02.220> of<00:04:02.549> keeping

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
that we were doing a good job of keeping

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.819 
that we were doing a good job of keeping
cells<00:04:03.870> sterile<00:04:04.380> etc<00:04:05.010> and<00:04:06.200> we've<00:04:07.200> published

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.479 
research study not published by us
showing<00:04:15.690> that<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:15.930> procedure<00:04:16.289> was<00:04:16.709> safer

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
showing that the procedure was safer

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.440 
showing that the procedure was safer
than<00:04:17.519> fda-approved<00:04:18.109> medications<00:04:20.150> so<00:04:21.150> if

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
than fda-approved medications so if

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.380 
than fda-approved medications so if
there<00:04:21.989> were<00:04:22.140> no<00:04:22.349> safety<00:04:22.710> issues<00:04:23.130> what<00:04:23.820> was<00:04:24.120> the

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
there were no safety issues what was the

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.830 
there were no safety issues what was the
issue

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
issue

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.550 
issue
why<00:04:25.020> was<00:04:25.260> FDA

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
why was FDA

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.940 
why was FDA
concerned<00:04:27.810> well<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:28.900> entire<00:04:29.200> pound<00:04:29.470> gorilla

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
concerned well the entire pound gorilla

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.720 
concerned well the entire pound gorilla
was<00:04:30.670> really<00:04:31.380> how<00:04:32.380> to<00:04:32.440> classify<00:04:33.100> your<00:04:33.130> cells

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
was really how to classify your cells

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.830 
was really how to classify your cells
and<00:04:35.760> whether<00:04:36.760> or<00:04:36.880> not<00:04:36.940> those<00:04:37.240> cells<00:04:37.570> should<00:04:37.780> be

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
and whether or not those cells should be

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:45.660 
and whether or not those cells should be
body<00:04:38.170> parts<00:04:38.650> or<00:04:38.860> drugs<00:04:43.020> so<00:04:44.130> we<00:04:45.130> felt<00:04:45.400> that

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
body parts or drugs so we felt that

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.330 
body parts or drugs so we felt that
drugs<00:04:46.150> were<00:04:46.420> massed<00:04:46.750> distributed<00:04:47.620> things<00:04:47.950> and

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
drugs were massed distributed things and

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850
