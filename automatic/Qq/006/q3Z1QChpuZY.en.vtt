00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:14.050
 hello my friend flavio simonetti here 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:17.380
 and this video is about booster 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:19.449
 in the cic in june week and today 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.689
 I imagine a booster that is the 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:24.159
 brother of body attack nitro pump me 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.569
 I have to say that I have found politics since then 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:26.619
 four years are already good 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:28.810
 very very long when I am 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.819
 take supplements because it is one 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.290
 very solid company is she is on the 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:34.990
 cologne list that means it stands for 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.360
 quality for food supplement no 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.400
 Additives from any illegal 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.340
 steroids are in it and I know that 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.800
 they hit things that are absolutely good 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.820
 and the absolute to my goal and too 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.760
 fit my focus 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.480
 what is in the metro booster in there as 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.280
 the very first is in it 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.370
 creatin motorcycle clearly helps 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.170
 it is always up to the booster in any case 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.880
 every case good because it is me long term 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.950
 a little more power gives it when 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.049
 in it 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.520
 then there is better allergies in it 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.990
 to my point in the case, however 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.020
 that or where the head is a bit like 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.460
 tingling if you do too much and 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.249
 the usual things on the man 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.609
 I have never heard at all 

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:19.869
 the booster in very intensive workouts 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:21.429
 When I say I really want to go full throttle 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.639
 I have to go because then only goes 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:26.049
 pull off again or in the callya or 

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:28.359
 I had to give it right in July 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.119
 or a goat or muscle maker then 

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:31.869
 I'm chatting in or something like that 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.270
 when i say i have to go again 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.170
 do something neat and then 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.719
 booster really good 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.310
 I'll tell you something about the booster too 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:45.009
 Well , the taste is here 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:47.520
 So I stay very fruity 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.659
 taste that I like very much 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.100
 usually I find so booster of 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.279
 taste rather not great but if 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.899
 you like the taste of booster 

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:56.409
 then of course you take all the more 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.409
 rather 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.869
 booster 400 grams that is 32 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.799
 you can then just say units 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.209
 If I go to training three times a week 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.189
 holds the ten weeks 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:08.450
 The price is absolute for a booster 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.009
 OK 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.980
 What I like is that there is no 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.040
 Caffeine is why body attack has 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.050
 times a booster made the nightclub 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.870
 There was so much caffeine in it that it was 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.400
 absolutely destroyed me and I found 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.099
 training was really bad because of that 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.300
 I have to regain all my booster 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.269
 pass it on because I'm not at all 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.380
 could use and that is natural 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:35.140
 no sugar in it also a good thing 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.940
 exactly what else is there to say 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.950
 booster for whom is it suitable i say 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.120
 times for people during the training full throttle 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.310
 of course they want to give that 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.950
 Mostly for whom it is not 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.160
 suitable for people at the very beginning 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.630
 are the few months train one 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.110
 Half a year maybe yes 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:56.000
 No one let it be concentrate 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.610
 first trained on the training plan 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.880
 clean feels the right muscles clock 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.590
 also want to train and then I say 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.030
 then a year and a half years then 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.870
 can you maybe a booster 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.150
 think 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.190
 before there is no opinion in my opinion 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.150
 meaning you concentrate too much 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.430
 very much on the weight than he on the 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.230
 execution on the muscle so that's why 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.790
 take your time 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.470
 it is also good if you do not have it on 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.780
 I really need it at the beginning 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.609
 simply for more focus and more fun 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.079
 training to have such a point feeling 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:29.000
 is pretty cool during training 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.040
 this has the feel of the team 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.959
 a bit more success in the training and 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.519
 that's the advantage of being such a booster 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.519
 Of course, long term benefits too 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.049
 a bit of muscle growth with me 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.670
 but do not take every training 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.540
 if I'm honest but only if 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.190
 I say I want to go full throttle today 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.569
 that was it already the booster 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.079
