00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
my next video so this is a very short

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.070 
my next video so this is a very short
quest<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.520> once<00:03:32.520> you've<00:03:32.760> defeated<00:03:33.090> minak<00:03:33.690> you

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
quest and once you've defeated minak you
