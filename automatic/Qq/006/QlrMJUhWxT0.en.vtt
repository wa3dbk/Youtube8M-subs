00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.680
 good to everyone and here we are in the 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:10.030
 unboxing this time it's nothing technological 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.230
 of pc or nothing at all it's about him going 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.980
 to say again but I do not know exactly 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:17.109
 new is the samsung galaxy trend and good 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.810
 is one of the last mobile phones that has 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:23.140
 launched samsung for more pockets 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:26.259
 tight that is to say it is mid-range 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.689
 pulling down and now I will tell you why and 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.070
 well this time I'm going to do it in a 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.940
 boxing in this video later 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.110
 You will have a review of the more or less and 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.960
 good to say the features that 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:41.390
 they have as you see here does not bring much more 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:46.070
 As you can see, the box fits 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:48.950
 well that pedal up when you go have a 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.470
 player just a core to a core not 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.710
 has more the 4-inch screen 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:58.129
 ft is not even psn anything like that in the 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.440
 5 megapixel camera say that record 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:04.220
 vga video that is 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:07.010
 does not reach 720p not even so 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.620
 is what there is flash led one thing 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.080
 quite pretty good because some 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.050
 mobile phones in this category do not carry 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.640
 like the nokia lumia 620 or personal 625 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.190
 twenty 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.840
 and good the technologies that it has 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.210
 touchwiz that is from the technology of 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.780
 samsung for android gps geotagging and 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.780
 other bullshit 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:32.150
 that is, they have 24 points 0.4 of 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.150
 series of things to be there living 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.530
 and nothing else as you see the boxes very 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.380
 always very tiny as usual 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.710
 in the last phones and we go with the 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.710
 unboxing 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.960
 good as you see here nothing but praiseworthy 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:53.490
 the direct mobile is the phone 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.530
 now we will see it more carefully 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.840
 samsung battery 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.080
 we lift the eyelash and we have the 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.799
 quick start guide as you can see 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.810
 what else quick start fast usb cable 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.970
 which is quite long bought with 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.040
 some other brands that they have that has 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.680
 a channel and super cheating 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.660
 and the usb charger are all 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.170
 but you have 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.730
 and I'm not anything else so we went through 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.620
 directly with the phone that the most 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.959
 important 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.450
 and well later in another video I will do 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.620
 a little review of the but how can you 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.620
 see is such that 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.290
 the typical screen protectors of 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:42.750
 samsung that they put what you bring inside 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.879
 more or less and well we started with in the 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.700
 back side as you see brings after 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.739
 samsung in monos embossed if not in 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.310
 this one is not very rebellious compare with the s 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.530
 3 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.330
 has the flash led camera 5 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.060
 megapixels and the speaker as you can see 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.950
 it is exactly like the others 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.270
 samsung models 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.790
 when I say other regional models of 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.670
 3 s 3 mini s 4 the high part is 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.010
 exactly the same everywhere on this side 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.290
 we have the volume buttons with 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.959
 we will raise the volume on the side 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.060
 otherwise we have the microsd slot and the 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.050
 power button off or lock 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.060
 of unlocking according to what we are 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.250
 doing in the top part we have 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.220
 the 3 and a half headphone jack 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.350
 and in the bottom 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.540
 the connector so that the minimum phone 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.849
 sound 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.680
 and the front part as you can see is 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:33.650
 very simple with all the samsung has 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.030
 middle button has the buttons 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.610
 laterals that are not seen right now 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.770
 why are 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.260
 they go with light we go when you turn it on 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.630
 this would be the back button and this 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.920
 would be the options button later in the 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.700
 top part as you can see is 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.150
 then from samsung the speaker here we have 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.150
 the 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.140
 in the webcam since they were installed 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.840
 chubby here and then we have the 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.629
 light sensor and the 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.220
 the d is called I forgot when you 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:05.010
 you approach the phone that is blocked on 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.560
 phone itself so as not to walk with the 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.740
 we go 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.990
 and it does not have much more as you can see 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.600
 that is to say that it brings 4 internal gigs of 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.100
 memory and it is also expandable as I say 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.709
 with the micro sd 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.240
 and nothing else is here in a boxing more 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.120
 later as I say I will do a radio 

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:25.540
 he and nothing I hope you liked 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:30.250
 hit like if you liked it very much 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.250
 and greetings to all and until next time
