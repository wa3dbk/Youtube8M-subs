00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
these different words to know what what

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.060 
these different words to know what what
a<00:00:44.760> processor<00:00:45.570> all<00:00:45.750> these<00:00:45.960> different<00:00:46.739> kinds<00:00:47.039> of

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
a processor all these different kinds of

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.740 
a processor all these different kinds of
processors<00:00:47.730> everything<00:00:48.149> but<00:00:48.629> everything

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
processors everything but everything

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.170 
processors everything but everything
just<00:00:49.020> costs<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:49.680> much<00:00:49.739> money<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.460> trying<00:00:51.059> to

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
just costs so much money and trying to

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.029 
just costs so much money and trying to
figure<00:00:51.300> out<00:00:51.480> what<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.020> i<00:00:52.230> needed<00:00:52.800> that

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
figure out what it is that i needed that

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.729 
figure out what it is that i needed that
would<00:00:53.219> suit<00:00:53.520> my<00:00:53.699> needs<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.360> laptop<00:00:54.739> so

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
would suit my needs and a laptop so

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.910 
would suit my needs and a laptop so
anyway<00:00:56.010> yeah<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.309> bought<00:00:56.969> one<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.350> should

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
anyway yeah I bought one so I should

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.910 
anyway yeah I bought one so I should
have<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.930> probably<00:01:00.930> within<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.379> next<00:01:01.469> two

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
have it probably within the next two

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.030 
have it probably within the next two
weeks<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.670> think<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.899> usually<00:01:04.439> comes<00:01:04.619> quicker

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
weeks I think it usually comes quicker

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.810 
weeks I think it usually comes quicker
than<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.549> um<00:01:06.320> then<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.470> says<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.860> does<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.310> we<00:01:08.640> may

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
than I um then it says it does so we may

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.480 
than I um then it says it does so we may
even<00:01:08.880> be<00:01:09.180> here<00:01:09.330> by<00:01:09.510> next<00:01:09.960> weekend<00:01:10.560> it's<00:01:11.310> been<00:01:11.460> a
