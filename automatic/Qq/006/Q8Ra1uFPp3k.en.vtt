00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.069
 to teach how to download and install the 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.599
 skin emulator for your pc and here I 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.360
 they see that the assassin's is running 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.940

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.750

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.970
 that version is the one that has no errors 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.610

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.970
