00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.089
 dear media representatives warmly 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.920
 Welcome to the press conference jerseys 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.529
 here to the two trainer ewald lienen 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.689
 from fc st pauli and fck bosscoach kosta 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.119
 runjaic the first word is of course 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.920
 the boxes berlin here comment to 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:35.250
 this game please yes I think so 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:38.430
 It was a very close game for us 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.450
 all things when we go with 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.520
 kaiserslautern drive in his 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.320
 situation or even with 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.760
 like all our competitors still have to 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.460
 win the day before then that is 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.350
 of course a huge pressure situation and 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.300
 Of course that was clear that we now 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.320
 here can deliver open field battle 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:01:00.020
 but try defensively well too 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:04.860
 to close and behave 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:07.320
 collectively at the goal shooting 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.460
 and this is his first half 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.530
 not quite up 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.110
 We plan, we have given everything 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.700
 and everything went wrong but we could 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.170
 Do not stop them from doing good 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.330
 to play combinations in their half 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.759
 this variable attack game this one 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.720
 have with permanent 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.729
 Position changes has always 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.229
 people then give those on the wing then 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.880
 pushed through are the slender ones 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.259
 could play backports and 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.390
 they had three four really good ones 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.039
 We were not lucky 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.450
 have fallen behind 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:36.509
 We have it in the first half 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.550
 failed to shoot the 1 0 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.390
 There were many good combinations 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.410
 we knew that pauli was with man and mouse 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.270
 will defend 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.700
 we knew that the header strength 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.009
 They certainly did not know that 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.819
 fight out of the way 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.489
 and yet we did it 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:58.349
 to play out chances 

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:59.880
 who have not used the 

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:01.319
 We also talked at half-time 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.000
 knowing that such games always 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.039
 dangerous we have then lies 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.770
 luck and bad luck pretty close to each other 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.819
 sometimes and in a situation as well 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.099
 that falls once or zero to one 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.800
 of course good luck that the ball 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.470
 is so rebounded and in this room 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.730
 pauli has switched very well 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:26.430
 and then had this leadership 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.190
 made and then came an individual 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.100
 error and then you are 20 back 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.940
 at home 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.170
 yes i do my team 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.670
 then then how they continue 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.970
 have played football as she tries 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.380
 has to play forward against one 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.020
 Of course, the team will do even more 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.670
 then got the buzz with everyone 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.630
 means that were available to her 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.430
 It has always been defended 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.950
 somehow a foot tip in between head 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.360
 or the goalkeeper has kept up well and 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.230
 simply is not this match 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.750
 successful 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.300
 That's why we lost that too 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.550
 now deserved defeat was or 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.540
 deserved victory for Paul I will 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.910
 I certainly not here now 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.620
 judge 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:15.570
 It is important to me that you also recognize 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.410
 that this young team sometimes 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:22.470
 The last defeat was allowed to lose 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.950
 on 23 february last year went vfr 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.890
 Basking and I think that we are in this 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.270
 season essential other face 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.220
 Positive face of a team 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.459
 have and believe me very much 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.989
 disappointed and it is really for the 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.670
 Boys is not easy to digest 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.220
 Today we have ourselves in the hand 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.700
 had if today but also ourselves 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.760
 beaten and we will also be together 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.570
 and with the team together with 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.970
 all members of staff also here 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.250
 very well supported during the week 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.370
 have come out there and will try 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.190
 Now the next two play better 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:06.840
 to do that and get six points that 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:09.569
 is our goal and we will be this 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.480
 We will pursue and become the goal 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:14.189
 factually sober at this goal 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.519
 work and become this team 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:19.410
 support and all boys yes that 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.949
 give confidence as well as in the whole 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.169
 season 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:24.270
 it is very disappointing for ours too 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.190
 spectator I know that, too 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.919
 disappointing for the trainer and for that 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.250
 for the trainer and for every fck 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:34.050
 but a chance or in the crisis lies 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.320
 Also the chance it is a small crisis 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.130
 with two defeats and that we 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:44.099
 together out of there 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:46.349
 do that we will try 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:48.780
 then to win in the last 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:50.419
 try to win and then win 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.690
 we will see what happens in the end 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.150
 will come out 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:05:01.289
 So far, congratulations again on 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:05.699
 Paul good heimreise and be're not 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:06.349
 not to this team I should 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:10.830
 say 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:13.530
 too critical too critical for that 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:17.099
 guys are self-critical enough and the 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:19.680
 Boys learn and also this 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:22.139
 Game is certainly a game you 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:26.150
 where you can learn from and also strengthened 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:29.300
 can and will come out and for that 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.300
 I vouch for myself
