00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:11.059
 Chapter 4 Architectural Design Drawings 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:17.630
 Now we'll have to see about many islanders once a lotta trouble once 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:22.009
 After the festival, we had another party to see the design plans also envision or even copper Organization 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:26.060
 If another group is itguyo looked into when planning the design plan 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:28.220
 There've come out the basic blueprint for the next one all the time you just book 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:33.170
 I'll see you once. 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:38.330
 Now let's take a look at each of the schematics . 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:42.290
 You can see the shape of the pig. 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.220
 And he even said that the road show is of course written in the following 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:49.820
 There is 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:50.660
 And bearings always have to draw the drawing where the north is upwards 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.870
 to 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:01:00.560
 Well , you can look at the layout because you're behind it. 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:05.210
 The plan view of the floor plan shows how the reference floor is raised from 1 point to 1.5 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.799
 I cut it down and looked down, so the door or the window was cut. 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.270
 I did everything looks 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.590
 In the case of the outer side, similarly, 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:19.670
 It's the same. 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:25.850
 The area and the window entrance of the room will be all expressed in the room. 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:27.590
 If you are an elevation figure, you can see how we can accurately 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:33.229
 Can see 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.490
 So radeunga the exterior of the building or the height of the eaves represent external finishes 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.220
 I can do it right 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:43.520
 I'll be elevated 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:49.280
 Now, if such unions yogeot front section is cut off a building vertical and horizontal 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:54.440
 So it's the height of the building or the height of the floor 10 million 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.830
 Then things will show the height of the window height Knit shape choma 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.830
 I will. 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:04.219
 Here'll look and sound this exciting appearance is also based also on the basis of the case 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.509
 It's the same. 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:14.120
 Now Exploded Views Exploded Views Exploded Views little toad crab is indeyo 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:16.730
 It is the drawing that the design of the inside of each seal is expressed. 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.209
 Or the type of Chunsoo Oh Chang Ho 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:25.280
 Still those things you two gonna deploy represented 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:30.500
 Whether Udo is a window form or opening / closing method 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.420
 Or it 's like this is the number of places to go. 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.579
 I 'm going to be a window. 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:43.340
 Of course, when we look up on the ceiling , there is a genuine year . 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:45.470
 I even exposed one trillion people yiradeunga and HVAC these things or something that represent thousands 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.849
 That would be enough. 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:52.099
 The details are as follows: 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:57.920
 I will become a boss. 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:03:01.850
 Here's the problem neundeyo dwaeteot will issue five times, three times elevations questions 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:05.269
 It was the closest thing to what you see on the screen. 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:08.540
 Where are the shapes of the pig-shaped earth? 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:13.940
 You'll see the shape of the ground plan . 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:15.799
 Of course I will be going to see you in 10 minutes . 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.579
 It was a testimony. 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:24.829
 Negative wall shape or water finish 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:28.489
 Trust in what the elevation shows in the room . 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:33.700
 This pushes the elevations are you'll need to 9 minutes 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:33.700
 Now, let me take care of the rest of your problems.
