those type of things to begin with

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.280

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
it's a good fat and it basically what it

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.620 
it's a good fat and it basically what it
does<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:31.430> it's<00:01:32.430> not<00:01:32.640> as<00:01:32.790> fattening<00:01:33.270> as

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
other fats if that makes any sense but

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.190 
other fats if that makes any sense but
it<00:01:37.400> it<00:01:38.400> lowers<00:01:39.060> your<00:01:39.210> blood<00:01:39.270> sugar<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.049> does
