wrap it around the plier these are the
round<00:00:21.300> nose<00:00:21.480> pliers<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.619> when<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:22.859> get<00:00:22.980> to

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
round nose pliers and when you get to

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.259 
round nose pliers and when you get to
here<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.369> just<00:00:23.519> want<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.670> kind<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.939> bend<00:00:24.150> it

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.310 

then<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:35.670> want<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.940> grasp<00:00:36.210> with<00:00:36.870> your<00:00:37.020> flat

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
then you want to grasp with your flat

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.000 
then you want to grasp with your flat
nose<00:00:37.350> pliers<00:00:38.270> this<00:00:39.270> little<00:00:39.510> tail<00:00:39.890> and<00:00:40.890> you're

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
nose pliers this little tail and you're

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.940 
nose pliers this little tail and you're
gonna<00:00:41.160> wrap<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.700> around<00:00:42.800> probably<00:00:43.800> about

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
gonna wrap it around probably about

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.510 
gonna wrap it around probably about
three<00:00:44.340> times<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:45.000> think<00:00:46.129> just<00:00:47.129> gonna<00:00:47.280> wrap<00:00:47.489> it

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
three times I think just gonna wrap it

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.069 
three times I think just gonna wrap it
around<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.090> what's<00:00:48.210> good<00:00:48.390> about<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:48.840> wire

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
around and what's good about this wire

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.840 
around and what's good about this wire
is<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.649> know<00:00:49.739> kind<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.100> squishes<00:00:50.550> if<00:00:50.730> you

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
is it you know kind of squishes if you

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.720 
is it you know kind of squishes if you
you're<00:00:51.390> not<00:00:51.629> your<00:00:51.989> loops<00:00:52.289> aren't<00:00:52.559> quite<00:00:53.550> that

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
you're not your loops aren't quite that

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.490 
you're not your loops aren't quite that
tight<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.059> can<00:00:54.360> use<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.690> pliers<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.260> kind<00:00:55.410> of

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
tight you can use the pliers and kind of

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.950 
tight you can use the pliers and kind of
tighten<00:00:55.860> them<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:57.030> what<00:00:57.360> you've<00:00:57.449> got<00:00:57.629> here<00:00:57.899> is

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
tighten them so what you've got here is

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.260 
tighten them so what you've got here is
a<00:00:58.050> little<00:00:58.170> little<00:00:59.160> lollipop<00:00:59.579> head<00:00:59.820> with<00:01:00.120> you

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
a little little lollipop head with you

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.329 
a little little lollipop head with you
know<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.539> wire<00:01:00.719> wrapped<00:01:01.079> around<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:04.339> and

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
know the wire wrapped around it and

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.800 
know the wire wrapped around it and
you're<00:01:05.519> gonna<00:01:05.640> just<00:01:05.880> trim<00:01:06.240> off<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.450> little

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
then you would take the bead of your

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.030 
then you would take the bead of your
choice<00:01:12.750> I've<00:01:13.049> got<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.380> little<00:01:13.619> red<00:01:13.799> bead

see about how long you need for the for
the<00:01:27.210> part<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.619> wrapped<00:01:28.860> part<00:01:29.220> prob

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
the part that the the wrapped part prob

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.030 
the part that the the wrapped part prob
about<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.479> much<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.110> on<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.380> other<00:01:31.500> side<00:01:31.860> of
