the order of whispers armor say if you
wanted<00:00:20.980> it<00:00:21.130> on<00:00:21.310> a<00:00:21.910> character<00:00:22.779> that<00:00:22.900> didn't<00:00:23.169> go

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:23.259 
wanted it on a character that didn't go

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:24.960 
wanted it on a character that didn't go
with<00:00:23.439> that<00:00:23.589> order<00:00:23.980> or<00:00:24.160> something<00:00:24.490> like<00:00:24.820> that

with that order or something like that

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.349 
with that order or something like that
you<00:00:25.150> can<00:00:25.330> move<00:00:25.570> anything<00:00:26.499> that's<00:00:26.710> soul<00:00:26.919> bind

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
you can move anything that's soul bind

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.679 
you can move anything that's soul bind
to<00:00:28.359> another<00:00:28.390> character<00:00:29.189> now<00:00:30.189> all<00:00:30.369> you<00:00:30.490> need<00:00:30.689> is

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
to another character now all you need is

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.470 
to another character now all you need is
a<00:00:32.050> transmutation<00:00:32.439> crystal<00:00:33.220> or<00:00:33.480> transmutation

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
a transmutation crystal or transmutation

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.120 
a transmutation crystal or transmutation
stone<00:00:34.720> if<00:00:34.870> it's<00:00:35.020> not<00:00:35.170> a<00:00:35.200> level<00:00:35.410> anything<00:00:36.010> that

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.130 
stone if it's not a level anything that

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.400 
stone if it's not a level anything that
you're<00:00:36.280> wanting<00:00:36.640> to<00:00:36.670> move<00:00:37.000> but<00:00:37.840> the<00:00:37.990> idea<00:00:38.350> is

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
you're wanting to move but the idea is

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.440 
you're wanting to move but the idea is
that<00:00:38.890> you<00:00:39.040> make<00:00:39.070> the<00:00:39.370> item<00:00:39.640> account<00:00:39.940> bind<00:00:40.180> and

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
that you make the item account bind and

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.270 
that you make the item account bind and
then<00:00:40.570> you<00:00:40.660> transmute<00:00:41.140> the<00:00:41.260> skin<00:00:41.500> onto<00:00:41.740> a

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
then you transmute the skin onto a

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.010 
then you transmute the skin onto a
weapon<00:00:42.730> for<00:00:42.880> better<00:00:43.030> stats<00:00:43.330> on<00:00:43.510> the<00:00:43.630> character

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
weapon for better stats on the character

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.540 
weapon for better stats on the character
that<00:00:44.170> you<00:00:44.350> want<00:00:44.500> so<00:00:45.340> the<00:00:45.820> step<00:00:46.330> is<00:00:46.510> basically

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
that you want so the step is basically

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.540 
that you want so the step is basically
get<00:00:48.550> your<00:00:48.820> soul<00:00:49.300> bind<00:00:49.570> skin<00:00:49.920> by<00:00:50.920> an<00:00:51.220> item

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
get your soul bind skin by an item

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.760 
get your soul bind skin by an item
that's<00:00:51.700> a<00:00:51.820> count<00:00:52.060> bind<00:00:52.300> transmute<00:00:53.140> it<00:00:53.290> to<00:00:53.680> the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
that's a count bind transmute it to the

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.160 
that's a count bind transmute it to the
account<00:00:54.040> bind<00:00:54.250> item<00:00:54.580> and<00:00:54.760> then<00:00:55.570> that<00:00:55.960> will

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
account bind item and then that will

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.760 
account bind item and then that will
make<00:00:56.200> it<00:00:56.530> the<00:00:56.920> skin<00:00:57.280> a<00:00:57.490> current<00:00:57.820> bind<00:00:58.030> now<00:00:58.900> that

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
make it the skin a current bind now that

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.230 
make it the skin a current bind now that
sounds<00:01:00.100> a<00:01:00.130> bit<00:01:00.160> complicated<00:01:00.580> but<00:01:01.180> basically

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:01.240 
sounds a bit complicated but basically

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.790 
sounds a bit complicated but basically
you're<00:01:01.780> going<00:01:01.930> to<00:01:01.990> want<00:01:02.200> to<00:01:02.260> look<00:01:02.500> for<00:01:02.710> these

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
you're going to want to look for these

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.050 
you're going to want to look for these
weapon<00:01:03.250> vendors<00:01:03.730> on<00:01:04.659> your<00:01:04.900> map<00:01:05.340> they're<00:01:06.340> in

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
weapon vendors on your map they're in

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.190 
weapon vendors on your map they're in
capital<00:01:07.540> cities<00:01:07.810> and<00:01:07.960> they're<00:01:08.049> all

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
capital cities and they're all

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.870 
capital cities and they're all
throughout<00:01:08.710> different<00:01:09.009> explorable<00:01:09.609> zones

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
throughout different explorable zones

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
want is to buy a longbow so this is an

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:21.599 
want is to buy a longbow so this is an
account<00:01:18.189> bind<00:01:18.539> longbow<00:01:20.310> well<00:01:21.310> it's

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:21.609 
account bind longbow well it's

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:24.840 
account bind longbow well it's
technically<00:01:22.450> it's<00:01:22.630> not<00:01:22.719> bind<00:01:23.140> but<00:01:24.009> if<00:01:24.369> you<00:01:24.549> use

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
technically it's not bind but if you use

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.620 
technically it's not bind but if you use
this<00:01:25.359> transmutation<00:01:26.259> crystal<00:01:26.649> you<00:01:27.310> can<00:01:27.630> put

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
this transmutation crystal you can put

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.499 
this transmutation crystal you can put
the<00:01:28.749> skin<00:01:29.020> on<00:01:29.049> put<00:01:29.649> the<00:01:29.799> stats<00:01:30.249> the<00:01:30.729> stats<00:01:31.240> of

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
the skin on put the stats the stats of

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.480 
the skin on put the stats the stats of
the<00:01:32.409> white<00:01:32.950> item<00:01:33.759> the<00:01:34.740> current<00:01:35.740> bind<00:01:35.920> or<00:01:36.189> not<00:01:36.460> a

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
the white item the current bind or not a

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.209 
the white item the current bind or not a
count<00:01:36.759> behind<00:01:36.850> item<00:01:37.270> whatever<00:01:37.979> use<00:01:38.979> those

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 
count behind item whatever use those

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:42.959 
count behind item whatever use those
stats<00:01:39.520> and<00:01:40.109> then<00:01:41.109> look<00:01:42.009> at<00:01:42.100> that<00:01:42.249> factor

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:42.969 
stats and then look at that factor

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:46.260 
stats and then look at that factor
longbow<00:01:43.389> is<00:01:43.600> not<00:01:43.810> a<00:01:43.840> crank<00:01:44.139> bind<00:01:44.469> okay<00:01:45.399> so<00:01:46.119> that

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
longbow is not a crank bind okay so that

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.449 
longbow is not a crank bind okay so that
means<00:01:46.450> that<00:01:46.689> I<00:01:47.350> can<00:01:47.560> go<00:01:47.679> put<00:01:47.920> it<00:01:48.039> in<00:01:48.100> my<00:01:48.249> bank

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:48.459 
means that I can go put it in my bank

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:50.929 
means that I can go put it in my bank
and<00:01:48.700> take<00:01:48.939> it<00:01:49.060> out<00:01:49.179> on<00:01:49.209> another<00:01:49.389> character

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
and take it out on another character

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.699 
and take it out on another character
before<00:01:51.939> that<00:01:52.509> wasn't<00:01:52.840> possible<00:01:52.990> because<00:01:53.499> it

00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:53.709 
before that wasn't possible because it

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:55.559 
before that wasn't possible because it
was<00:01:53.799> soul<00:01:54.039> bind<00:01:54.310> and<00:01:54.549> you<00:01:54.579> know<00:01:54.999> a<00:01:55.030> soul<00:01:55.359> bind

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:55.569 
was soul bind and you know a soul bind

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:57.840 
was soul bind and you know a soul bind
item<00:01:55.959> is<00:01:56.139> linked<00:01:57.009> to<00:01:57.189> the<00:01:57.310> character<00:01:57.700> that

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
item is linked to the character that

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.789 
item is linked to the character that
it's<00:01:57.969> been<00:01:58.090> buying<00:01:58.299> to<00:01:58.509> so<00:01:58.840> you<00:01:59.530> can't

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
it's been buying to so you can't

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.109 
it's been buying to so you can't
actually<00:02:00.069> move<00:02:00.490> it<00:02:00.609> from<00:02:00.759> character<00:02:00.999> to

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
actually move it from character to

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.419 
actually move it from character to
character<00:02:01.289> so<00:02:02.289> this<00:02:02.469> little<00:02:02.740> trick<00:02:02.979> makes<00:02:03.310> it

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
character so this little trick makes it

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.459 
character so this little trick makes it
very<00:02:03.549> simple<00:02:04.029> to<00:02:04.090> move<00:02:04.450> your<00:02:04.659> skins<00:02:04.929> so<00:02:05.289> if<00:02:05.380> you

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
very simple to move your skins so if you

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:06.840 
very simple to move your skins so if you
have<00:02:05.590> a<00:02:05.619> very<00:02:05.920> expensive<00:02:06.369> weapon<00:02:06.520> but<00:02:06.789> a

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
have a very expensive weapon but a

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.910 
have a very expensive weapon but a
character<00:02:07.329> that<00:02:07.539> you<00:02:07.659> don't<00:02:07.840> like<00:02:08.020> it<00:02:08.170> on<00:02:08.289> then

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
character that you don't like it on then

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.400 
character that you don't like it on then
you<00:02:09.009> can<00:02:09.039> move<00:02:09.250> it<00:02:09.539> which<00:02:10.539> is<00:02:10.660> what<00:02:10.810> I<00:02:10.840> did<00:02:11.110> with

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
you can move it which is what I did with

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.710 
you can move it which is what I did with
my<00:02:11.860> full<00:02:12.190> fires<00:02:12.400> essence<00:02:12.850> I've<00:02:13.030> moved<00:02:13.330> it<00:02:13.510> from

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
my full fires essence I've moved it from

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.309 
my full fires essence I've moved it from
character<00:02:13.989> to<00:02:14.110> character

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
character to character

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.369 
character to character
what<00:02:15.769> character<00:02:16.159> I<00:02:16.640> thought<00:02:16.909> would<00:02:17.420> would<00:02:18.200> do

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
what character I thought would would do

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.559 
what character I thought would would do
with<00:02:18.530> it<00:02:18.650> at<00:02:18.769> the<00:02:18.859> time<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.280> I'm<00:02:19.849> gonna<00:02:19.969> pop<00:02:20.389> on

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
with it at the time and I'm gonna pop on

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.289 
with it at the time and I'm gonna pop on
fuzzball<00:02:21.049> here<00:02:21.230> and<00:02:21.409> show<00:02:21.739> you<00:02:21.799> the<00:02:22.340> second

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
fuzzball here and show you the second

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.309 
fuzzball here and show you the second
part<00:02:23.329> of<00:02:23.689> the<00:02:23.989> process<00:02:25.629> it's<00:02:26.629> pretty<00:02:26.870> simple

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
part of the process it's pretty simple

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.940 
part of the process it's pretty simple
and<00:02:28.569> it<00:02:29.569> can't<00:02:29.900> see<00:02:30.170> if<00:02:30.290> you're<00:02:30.469> buying<00:02:30.709> a

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
and it can't see if you're buying a

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.399 
and it can't see if you're buying a
weapon<00:02:31.099> again<00:02:31.579> or<00:02:31.819> you<00:02:32.659> know<00:02:32.780> cursing<00:02:33.260> the

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:33.409 
weapon again or you know cursing the

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:35.920 
weapon again or you know cursing the
fact<00:02:33.650> that<00:02:33.829> you<00:02:33.950> bind<00:02:34.129> it<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.549> a<00:02:35.180> character

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
fact that you bind it to a character

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.190 
fact that you bind it to a character
that<00:02:36.049> you've<00:02:36.260> grown<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:37.700> to<00:02:38.269> sort<00:02:38.510> of<00:02:38.599> hit<00:02:38.930> or

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
that you've grown to to sort of hit or

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.009 
that you've grown to to sort of hit or
maybe<00:02:40.040> ArenaNet<00:02:40.790> did<00:02:41.060> a<00:02:41.090> balance<00:02:41.480> and<00:02:41.689> you

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
maybe ArenaNet did a balance and you

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.809 
maybe ArenaNet did a balance and you
don't<00:02:42.650> you<00:02:42.829> just<00:02:43.010> don't<00:02:43.189> feel<00:02:43.340> your<00:02:43.489> character

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
don't you just don't feel your character

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.970 
don't you just don't feel your character
anymore<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:45.069> that<00:02:46.069> can<00:02:46.280> be<00:02:46.400> a<00:02:46.430> little<00:02:46.790> bit<00:02:46.999> a

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
anymore and that can be a little bit a

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.819 
anymore and that can be a little bit a
little<00:02:48.980> bit<00:02:49.129> disheartening<00:02:49.669> but<00:02:49.879> you<00:02:50.359> know<00:02:50.829> so

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
little bit disheartening but you know so

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.369 
little bit disheartening but you know so
on<00:02:51.950> fuzz<00:02:52.219> but<00:02:52.459> if<00:02:52.730> I<00:02:53.120> go<00:02:53.329> in<00:02:53.540> his<00:02:53.750> inventory<00:02:54.049> I

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
on fuzz but if I go in his inventory I

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.000 
on fuzz but if I go in his inventory I
have<00:02:54.409> a<00:02:55.299> pearl<00:02:56.439> which<00:02:57.439> is<00:02:57.590> absolutely<00:02:57.949> a

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
have a pearl which is absolutely a

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.959 
have a pearl which is absolutely a
horrible<00:02:58.699> by<00:02:58.909> the<00:02:58.969> way<00:02:59.150> para<00:02:59.930> longbow<00:03:00.379> and<00:03:00.969> I'm

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:01.969 
horrible by the way para longbow and I'm

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:05.709 
horrible by the way para longbow and I'm
going<00:03:02.299> to<00:03:02.560> take<00:03:03.560> one<00:03:04.189> of<00:03:04.400> my<00:03:04.760> transmutation

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:05.719 
going to take one of my transmutation

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:08.770 
going to take one of my transmutation
crystals<00:03:06.079> I'm<00:03:06.530> going<00:03:06.799> to<00:03:06.919> use<00:03:07.129> it<00:03:07.250> but<00:03:08.120> that<00:03:08.510> in

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
crystals I'm going to use it but that in

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.599 
crystals I'm going to use it but that in
so<00:03:09.109> now<00:03:09.319> I<00:03:09.349> can<00:03:09.620> use<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:09.859> skin<00:03:10.129> of<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.400> Frog

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
so now I can use the skin of the Frog

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.520 
so now I can use the skin of the Frog
longbow<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.209> stats<00:03:11.480> of<00:03:11.629> the<00:03:11.750> exotic<00:03:11.989> longbow

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
longbow the stats of the exotic longbow

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:19.509 
longbow the stats of the exotic longbow
and<00:03:13.989> voila<00:03:14.989> now<00:03:15.530> you<00:03:15.590> can<00:03:16.959> see<00:03:17.959> that<00:03:18.530> it<00:03:18.859> is<00:03:19.250> is

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
and voila now you can see that it is is

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.520 
and voila now you can see that it is is
is<00:03:19.699> it's<00:03:20.030> not<00:03:20.209> completely<00:03:21.019> and<00:03:21.349> utterly

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
is it's not completely and utterly

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.719 
is it's not completely and utterly
usable<00:03:22.340> on<00:03:22.459> fuzz<00:03:22.639> but<00:03:23.109> tada

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:24.729 
usable on fuzz but tada

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:28.059 
usable on fuzz but tada
so<00:03:25.729> that<00:03:25.970> was<00:03:26.120> a<00:03:26.329> soul<00:03:26.840> barring<00:03:27.290> frak<00:03:27.919> the

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
so that was a soul barring frak the

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.219 
so that was a soul barring frak the
longbow<00:03:28.489> that<00:03:28.819> was<00:03:28.939> on<00:03:29.120> my<00:03:29.299> my<00:03:29.780> low<00:03:29.959> level

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:30.229 
longbow that was on my my low level

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:32.949 
longbow that was on my my low level
Ranger<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:30.859> now<00:03:31.430> it's<00:03:31.849> soul<00:03:32.389> bond<00:03:32.540> on<00:03:32.750> fuzz

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
Ranger and now it's soul bond on fuzz

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.539 
Ranger and now it's soul bond on fuzz
but<00:03:33.169> from<00:03:33.530> just<00:03:33.709> a<00:03:33.769> few<00:03:33.889> simple<00:03:34.129> steps

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
but from just a few simple steps

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.309 
but from just a few simple steps
now<00:03:35.060> I<00:03:35.090> transmutation<00:03:35.689> crystals<00:03:35.989> can<00:03:36.139> be<00:03:36.290> a

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
now I transmutation crystals can be a

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.920 
now I transmutation crystals can be a
bit<00:03:36.530> hard<00:03:36.709> to<00:03:36.799> come<00:03:36.979> by<00:03:37.129> if<00:03:37.790> you<00:03:38.389> don't<00:03:38.599> want<00:03:38.780> to

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
bit hard to come by if you don't want to

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.929 
bit hard to come by if you don't want to

do by GM's they they like with real
money<00:03:41.120> or<00:03:41.449> you<00:03:42.109> can't<00:03:42.349> find<00:03:42.620> them<00:03:42.799> out<00:03:42.979> of<00:03:43.099> any

anything they can be a bit expensive but

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.749 
anything they can be a bit expensive but
you<00:03:47.689> know<00:03:47.769> they're<00:03:48.769> there<00:03:49.009> they're<00:03:49.519> the<00:03:49.609> only
