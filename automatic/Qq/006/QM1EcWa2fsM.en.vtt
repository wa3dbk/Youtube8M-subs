still gonna work out hopefully he's

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.150

playing<00:00:26.670> blue<00:00:26.970> so<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.930> don't<00:00:28.590> know<00:00:28.680> mill<00:00:28.949> decks

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
playing blue so I don't know mill decks

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.339 
playing blue so I don't know mill decks
don't<00:00:29.519> make<00:00:29.670> for<00:00:29.939> really<00:00:30.179> very<00:00:30.990> interactive

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
don't make for really very interactive

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.110 
don't make for really very interactive
gameplay<00:00:31.949> it's<00:00:32.099> usually<00:00:32.610> just<00:00:32.640> kind<00:00:33.059> of

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
gameplay it's usually just kind of

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.270 
gameplay it's usually just kind of
one-sided<00:00:33.980> but<00:00:36.140> yeah<00:00:37.140> so<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.800> kind<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.160> hope

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
one-sided but yeah so I I kind of hope

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.490 
one-sided but yeah so I I kind of hope
I'm<00:00:38.370> not<00:00:38.460> really<00:00:38.640> playing<00:00:38.850> it's<00:00:39.059> until<00:00:39.270> Dec<00:00:39.500> so

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
I'm not really playing it's until Dec so

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.010 
I'm not really playing it's until Dec so
I<00:00:40.530> don't<00:00:41.070> think<00:00:41.460> actually<00:00:42.149> i<00:00:42.480> think<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.840> card

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
I don't think actually i think that card

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.270 
I don't think actually i think that card
is<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.350> mill<00:00:43.500> deck<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.920> don't<00:00:44.100> know<00:00:44.160> it

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
is in the mill deck I don't know it

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.950 
is in the mill deck I don't know it
might<00:00:44.399> be<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.579> both<00:00:44.760> though<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.559> can't<00:00:46.559> remember

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
might be in both though I can't remember

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.950 
might be in both though I can't remember
either<00:00:48.960> way<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.680> can't<00:00:50.280> imagine<00:00:50.370> my<00:00:51.239> burn<00:00:51.750> deck

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
either way I can't imagine my burn deck

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.420 
either way I can't imagine my burn deck
losing<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.500> mill<00:00:52.649> deck<00:00:52.800> because<00:00:53.160> he

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
losing to the mill deck because he

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.660 
losing to the mill deck because he
usually<00:00:53.820> lets<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.480> draw<00:00:54.750> like<00:00:54.989> 45<00:00:55.469> cards<00:00:55.890> so

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
usually lets you draw like 45 cards so

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.750 
usually lets you draw like 45 cards so
if<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.000> draw<00:00:57.210> 45,000<00:00:58.170> billion<00:00:58.680> cards<00:00:58.949> yep

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
if you draw 45,000 billion cards yep

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.040 
if you draw 45,000 billion cards yep
there<00:00:59.969> we<00:01:00.059> go<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.359> playing<00:01:00.539> Jace<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.930> your

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
there we go and playing Jace is your

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.600 
there we go and playing Jace is your
major<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:03.439> nothing<00:01:04.439> else<00:01:04.589> all<00:01:05.309> right<00:01:05.460> i'll

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
major and nothing else all right i'll

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.149 
major and nothing else all right i'll
see<00:01:05.760> your<00:01:05.850> Xperia<00:01:06.299> in<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.479> face<00:01:06.659> then

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
see your Xperia in the face then

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.140 
see your Xperia in the face then
probably<00:01:08.159> should've<00:01:08.430> done<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.610> on<00:01:08.760> my<00:01:08.850> turn

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
probably should've done that on my turn

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.820 
probably should've done that on my turn
since<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.659> was<00:01:09.930> pretty<00:01:10.260> much<00:01:10.380> planning<00:01:10.650> on

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
since I was pretty much planning on

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.620 
since I was pretty much planning on
doing<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.100> no<00:01:11.310> matter<00:01:11.460> what<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:12.240> only<00:01:12.479> way<00:01:12.600> I

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
doing it no matter what the only way I

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.370 
doing it no matter what the only way I
wouldn't<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.140> if<00:01:13.170> he<00:01:13.530> played<00:01:13.740> like<00:01:15.380> whatever

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
wouldn't is if he played like whatever

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.550 
wouldn't is if he played like whatever
that<00:01:16.590> card<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.070> called<00:01:17.810> hedron<00:01:18.810> crab<00:01:19.049> if<00:01:19.409> you

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
that card is called hedron crab if you

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.990 
that card is called hedron crab if you
played<00:01:19.770> hedron<00:01:20.100> crab<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.430> would<00:01:20.580> not<00:01:20.700> have<00:01:20.729> 9

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
played hedron crab I would not have 9

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.679 
played hedron crab I would not have 9
but<00:01:21.380> anyway<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.740> mean<00:01:23.280> if<00:01:23.520> he<00:01:23.759> plays<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> howling

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
faster than I can just murder him with

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.450 
faster than I can just murder him with
burn<00:01:30.140> he<00:01:31.140> might<00:01:31.290> have<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.470> counterspell<00:01:32.280> for

mean<00:01:44.970> it'll<00:01:45.149> probably<00:01:45.420> do<00:01:45.930> for<00:01:46.140> damage<00:01:46.560> maybe

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
mean it'll probably do for damage maybe

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.560
