00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:12.809
 That's all , everyone's good stuff. 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.719
 the new novel in the air and giovanna 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.090
 antonelli always launches trend with 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.150
 his characters with the antenna could not 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.970
 be different she will use this nail art 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.580
 Metric is not exactly right because it has 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.910
 everything to do with the personality of the penalty 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.009
 learning how to do it here is a 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.050
 It's a very easy art, but I wanted to show it 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.059
 For you, what can you do with yourself? 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.469
 glaze does not need any 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.719
 special tool 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.800
 I then used a black black that is already 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.870
 matte 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.969
 but you can wear a normal black 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.899
 because then I'll pass the matte base 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.850
 on top of everything else to get more uniform 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:54.480
 so the middle finger up on the uses a 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.399
 triangle that only make two 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.530
 risks they meet these risks 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.739
 say the opposite 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.680
 and there's a different look, right, and she does not 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:09.060
 wear anything under your own nail 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.880
 even after the other fingers are all 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.640
 a risk on the diagonal I spent two 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.369
 layer and then the second layer would I 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.259
 Taking the risk to stay a bit 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.780
 more is straight and also if it does not work 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.640
 Can you pass a toothpick and clean you know? 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.810
 if you have any little things that were 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.579
 bothering 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.130
 the only thing that was a little annoying was only 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.530
 in the corners was always his own 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.799
 nail is then filled and she again 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.380
 in the corner and filled to stay more 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.020
 beautiful and now just pass a base 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.700
 Frosca over I used that of nintendo 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.840
 can use any one in your 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.549
 preference and there're ready then you 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.399
 She's with a half thinks she 's in the 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.250
 8 o'clock soap opera, which is important 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.590
 in the end of everything i found much worse if 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.090
 I think I'm enjoying using it so I 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.369
 I put on both hands are getting 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.899
 and that's it, I hope you 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.659
 Have you liked who left me? 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:10.099
 enjoy the channel and see you in the 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.099
 next of jute
