00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.709
 That's it, I'm here today, and today I came. 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:13.949
 bring you the best games 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:18.029
 free for android simple first 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:20.609
 Today's game is space top uses a game 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.939
 ask different and follow a mix of 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.980
 2d with 3d is very simple if you assume 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.710
 role of this guy here in this 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.009
 planet that has no name and purpose is 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.160
 to survive is in the middle of the battle of nothingness 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.930
 meteorites fall from the middle of the planet and also 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.900
 clients and girls who want to have a 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.300
 the goal is to survive and the 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.810
 which is a lot of fun behind a technique 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.030
 different certainly worth doing 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.820
 download 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.600
 let's go to the second game the second 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.390
 game is the naval battle 2 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.110
 It's a classic, I do not think every game 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.690
 naval battle and that also legal because 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.780
 have the option to play against android 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.570
 lanka against machine indicators 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.759
 online battle to play against others 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:18.240
 players finally hear that player 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:23.280
 buy android classic regime vai 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.229
 put it high here and then leave here 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:34.499
 I choose where I want to attack 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:36.929
 I already got it right now it's the android 's turn 

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:38.999
 this does not have much naval battle who 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.069
 Do you know what it's like? 

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:42.539
 if you do not know yet 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:45.389
 worth knowing 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:49.649
 ok let's go to the third game 

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:52.770
 third game is the 44 drag racing is a 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.139
 start up game but using cars 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.719
 four by four so here's the 

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:59.429
 logic you can buy other cars 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.200
 have the issue there and you can 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:04.350
 customize the school car more 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.389
 powerful and just like any other game 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.910
 or some rush to take a look 

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:14.620
 and it's simple here at first you accelerate 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:17.170
 waiting for the green light goes away 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.110
 When I say you change the gear 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.080
 It's very simple so at the beginning it's okay. 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.940
 easy as you advance from racing is 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.430
 also harder and you have to 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.070
 buy other cars to pass 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.440
 anyway this is the third game of today 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.740
 As I always leave the link for today. 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:41.010
 in the description I stand here 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:41.010
 A big hug and thanks
