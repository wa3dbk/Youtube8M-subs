00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.169
A gorgeous candy covered easter cake is
the perfect finale to your easter dinner.

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:16.139
With the seeming-less endless supply of
bunnies, eggs, beans and tarts,

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.000
decorating an easter cake is as
much fun as eating one.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.500
We'll show you 3 ways to decorate
a simple white frosted cake you

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.609
make yourself, or pick up at the bakery.

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.340
Give a round cake the look of an easter
basket full of candy eggs after the hunt.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.690
First, add a few drops of green food
coloring into a resealable plastic bag.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.570
Add shredded coconut, close the bag,
and shake until all the coconut is green;

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.160
add more drops of food coloring if needed.
Next mound the coconut in the center of

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.450
the cake, making a small indentation
in the center to look like a grass.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.449
Now add a clutch of chocolate
eggs, malted milk eggs,

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.500
or jelly beans, into the center
of the nest.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.370
To make the basket handle, fold a
sheet of aluminum foil in half

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:02.750
lengthwise, 4 times.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.540
Then, wrap with ribbon,
and tape the ends.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.590
Insert the ends of the handle into
the cake top.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.330
How about a bunny parade?

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.130
This is easy enough to have the
kids help out.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.570
Place chocolate bunnies around
the sides of the cake,

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.490
alternating their height, and size,
so they appear to be dancing.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.759
Decorate the top of the cake with the
colorful mosaic of jelly beans,

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.460
and candy covered chocolates.
Just press them right into the frosting.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.770
Place of chocolate bunny in the middle,
for a focal point.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.280
Peter Cottontail needs a bunny trail
to hop down, and where better

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.060
than on top of the easter cake.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.040
Use licorice whips to first make a
winding path.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.340
Line the outside of the path with green
colored coconut, and set in eggs,

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.700
tarts, and beans, for Peter to
visit on his journey.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.370
Decorating Easter cakes is easy when you
start out with a plain cake,

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.000
and lots of easter candy.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:07.229
Use your imagination to create colorful,
candy cakes for your next Easter dinner.
