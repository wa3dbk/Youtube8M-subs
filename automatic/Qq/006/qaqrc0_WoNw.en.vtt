most<00:00:42.750> people<00:00:42.899> want<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.890> think<00:00:43.980> it's<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.460> niche

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670

most people want I think it's a niche
market<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:45.329> think<00:00:45.960> most<00:00:46.410> people<00:00:46.559> just<00:00:46.890> need

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
market I think most people just need

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.069 
market I think most people just need
somebody<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.430> make<00:00:47.670> announcements<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.480> most

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
somebody to make announcements and most

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.650 
somebody to make announcements and most
clients<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:50.010> my<00:00:50.340> experience<00:00:50.850> want<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.600> to

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
clients in my experience want you to

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.170 
clients in my experience want you to
just<00:00:51.809> shut<00:00:51.960> up<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.230> jam<00:00:52.410> tunes<00:00:52.820> but<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.910> still

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
just shut up in jam tunes but you still

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.840 
just shut up in jam tunes but you still
have<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.480> say<00:00:54.690> some<00:00:54.960> stuff<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.789> don't

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
have to say some stuff and I don't

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.090 
have to say some stuff and I don't
particularly<00:00:57.660> like<00:00:57.840> scripts<00:00:58.530> but<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:58.890> think

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
particularly like scripts but I think

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.650 
particularly like scripts but I think
they're<00:00:59.219> good<00:00:59.399> for<00:00:59.579> some<00:00:59.820> people<00:00:59.850> Steve<00:01:00.329> sharp

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
they're good for some people Steve sharp

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.290 
they're good for some people Steve sharp
had<00:01:00.870> said<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.289> he's<00:01:01.469> dead<00:01:01.710> against<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:03.210> I

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
had said that he's dead against it and I

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.450 
had said that he's dead against it and I
feel<00:01:03.629> kind<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.350> same<00:01:04.559> way<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.769> guess<00:01:05.129> I'm<00:01:05.400> a

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
feel kind of the same way I guess I'm a

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.480 
feel kind of the same way I guess I'm a
very<00:01:05.970> improvisational<00:01:06.360> kind<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.260> guy<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:07.830> it

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
very improvisational kind of guy so it

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.770 
very improvisational kind of guy so it
would<00:01:08.580> be<00:01:08.700> hard<00:01:08.939> for<00:01:09.090> me<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.240> write<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.479> script

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
would be hard for me to write a script

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.179 
would be hard for me to write a script
for<00:01:09.900> anybody<00:01:10.320> because<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.740> kind<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:10.950> live<00:01:11.100> in
