00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.630 
first time that I'm fighting with em I
don't<00:00:54.240> like<00:00:54.510> it's<00:00:54.720> a<00:00:54.870> technique<00:00:55.640> absolutely

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
don't like it's a technique absolutely

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.990 
don't like it's a technique absolutely
it's<00:00:56.730> not<00:00:56.880> the<00:00:57.030> way<00:00:57.180> as<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:58.170> made<00:00:58.890> divider<00:00:59.340> but

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
it's not the way as I made divider but

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.860 
it's not the way as I made divider but
for<00:01:00.720> this<00:01:00.930> reason<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.680> can<00:01:02.070> be<00:01:02.250> unpredictable

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
for this reason it can be unpredictable

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.910

and he I don't see him like a fighter
who's<00:01:22.690> come<00:01:22.960> to<00:01:23.110> fight<00:01:23.410> and<00:01:23.770> make<00:01:24.010> trouble<00:01:24.520> in

the ring you know and that's why I told

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.100 
the ring you know and that's why I told
him<00:01:27.400> I<00:01:27.550> gonna<00:01:27.760> kick<00:01:28.030> his<00:01:28.180> ass<00:01:28.390> because<00:01:28.660> I<00:01:28.900> come

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
him I gonna kick his ass because I come

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.960 
him I gonna kick his ass because I come
to<00:01:29.229> fight<00:01:29.440> another<00:01:29.740> place<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:33.340> he<00:01:33.520> has<00:01:33.610> crazy

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
to fight another place this he has crazy

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.810 
to fight another place this he has crazy
style<00:01:34.360> his<00:01:34.660> strong<00:01:35.050> install<00:01:35.560> he's<00:01:36.520> motivated

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
style his strong install he's motivated

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.130 
style his strong install he's motivated
so<00:01:37.570> I<00:01:37.780> think<00:01:38.770> he<00:01:39.130> has<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.729> things<00:01:40.060> to<00:01:40.270> defeat

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
so I think he has the things to defeat

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.710 
so I think he has the things to defeat
through<00:01:41.500> her<00:01:41.710> loss<00:01:42.310> man<00:01:42.460> and<00:01:42.610> I<00:01:42.670> already<00:01:42.940> met
