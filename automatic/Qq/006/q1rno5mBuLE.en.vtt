00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
iPhone or you know a compact digital

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.670 
iPhone or you know a compact digital
camera<00:00:32.759> it'll<00:00:32.940> work<00:00:33.110> so<00:00:34.110> stick<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.469> in<00:00:34.590> between

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
camera it'll work so stick it in between

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.190 
camera it'll work so stick it in between
the<00:00:34.980> mounts<00:00:35.280> right<00:00:35.430> here<00:00:35.700> once<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.780> stick<00:00:37.050> it

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
in it's totally secure they can pull out

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.690 
in it's totally secure they can pull out
so<00:00:40.950> now<00:00:41.280> what<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.520> do<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:42.500> you<00:00:43.500> would<00:00:43.700> click

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
so now what you do is you would click

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.180 
so now what you do is you would click
the<00:00:44.850> entire<00:00:45.180> rig<00:00:45.420> into<00:00:46.020> these<00:00:46.500> piece<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.980> mouth

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
the entire rig into these piece of mouth

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.700 
the entire rig into these piece of mouth
so<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.030> adhesive<00:00:48.600> mount<00:00:48.809> there's<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.200> curved

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
so that adhesive mount there's a curved

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.229 
so that adhesive mount there's a curved
and<00:00:49.890> flat<00:00:49.950> adhesive<00:00:50.520> mounts<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:50.969> funny

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
and flat adhesive mounts and funny

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.430 
and flat adhesive mounts and funny
enough<00:00:51.420> these<00:00:51.570> are<00:00:51.660> actually<00:00:52.110> compatible

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
enough these are actually compatible

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.790 
enough these are actually compatible
with<00:00:52.710> GoPro<00:00:53.690> you<00:00:54.690> just<00:00:54.930> take<00:00:55.110> off<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.440> acusa

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
with GoPro you just take off the acusa

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.369 
with GoPro you just take off the acusa
mount<00:00:56.090> slap<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.270> right<00:00:57.300> onto<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.750> helmet<00:00:57.899> and

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
mount slap it right onto the helmet and

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.290 
mount slap it right onto the helmet and
you<00:00:58.440> can<00:00:58.620> see<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.039> it's<00:00:59.399> totally<00:00:59.789> secure<00:01:00.149> and

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
you can see that it's totally secure and

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.799 
you can see that it's totally secure and
it's<00:01:00.420> definitely<00:01:00.660> not<00:01:00.870> going<00:01:01.079> anywhere<00:01:02.239> so<00:01:03.239> at

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
it's definitely not going anywhere so at

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.380 
it's definitely not going anywhere so at
this<00:01:03.960> point<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:05.220> adjust<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.030> knob<00:01:06.210> right

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
this point you adjust the knob right

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.870 
this point you adjust the knob right
here<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.840> then<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.020> get<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.260> perfect<00:01:07.470> angle

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
here and then you get the perfect angle

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.370 
here and then you get the perfect angle
wherever<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.119> ride<00:01:09.330> most<00:01:09.780> riders<00:01:09.930> look<00:01:10.200> down

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
wherever you ride most riders look down

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.280 
wherever you ride most riders look down
so<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.710> want<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.979> look<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.159> little<00:01:11.340> bit<00:01:11.430> higher

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
so you want to look a little bit higher

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.450 
so you want to look a little bit higher
so<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.590> really<00:01:13.860> good<00:01:13.979> angle<00:01:14.130> right

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
so this is a really good angle right

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.490 
so this is a really good angle right
here<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.119> rider<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:15.840> if<00:01:15.930> he's<00:01:16.049> looking<00:01:16.350> down
