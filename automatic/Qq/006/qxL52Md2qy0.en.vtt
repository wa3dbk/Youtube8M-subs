00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
sharpness of this weapon is quite

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.590 
sharpness of this weapon is quite
incredible<00:01:20.420> for<00:01:21.200> a<00:01:21.229> low<00:01:21.709> /<00:01:22.310> high<00:01:22.639> rank<00:01:22.999> weapon

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
incredible for a low / high rank weapon

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.070 
incredible for a low / high rank weapon
so<00:01:24.520> let's<00:01:25.520> have<00:01:25.759> a<00:01:25.819> look<00:01:25.999> at<00:01:26.119> this

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
so let's have a look at this

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.940 
so let's have a look at this
the<00:01:28.680> attack<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.550> only<00:01:30.020> 168<00:01:31.020> but<00:01:31.800> the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
the attack of it is only 168 but the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.420 
the attack of it is only 168 but the
elemental<00:01:32.670> damage<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.650> 300<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.860> it's<00:01:35.040> aligned

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
elemental damage is 300 and it's aligned

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.620 
elemental damage is 300 and it's aligned
with<00:01:35.670> water<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.570> does<00:01:36.720> water<00:01:36.990> damage<00:01:37.500> at

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
with water so it does water damage at

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.320 
with water so it does water damage at
300<00:01:39.630> damage<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.770> sharpness<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:41.820> weapon

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
300 damage the sharpness of this weapon

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.830 
300 damage the sharpness of this weapon
is<00:01:42.650> green<00:01:43.650> but<00:01:44.430> look<00:01:44.760> at<00:01:44.910> that<00:01:45.060> green<00:01:45.360> bar<00:01:45.600> it

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
is green but look at that green bar it

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.170 
is green but look at that green bar it
is<00:01:46.140> absolutely<00:01:46.650> huge<00:01:47.010> you<00:01:47.490> will<00:01:47.790> be<00:01:47.940> not

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
is absolutely huge you will be not

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.600

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.280 
produced sharpness on this weapon is
incredible<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.400> but<00:02:24.120> yeah<00:02:24.270> that's<00:02:24.540> what<00:02:25.260> I

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
incredible and but yeah that's what I

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.350 
incredible and but yeah that's what I
would<00:02:25.560> suggest<00:02:25.709> if<00:02:26.130> you<00:02:26.250> have<00:02:26.459> gems<00:02:26.790> wine<00:02:27.090> run

would suggest if you have gems wine run

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.470 
would suggest if you have gems wine run
go<00:02:27.600> make<00:02:27.810> sharpener<00:02:28.440> or<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:29.490> think<00:02:30.209> yeah<00:02:30.330> it's
