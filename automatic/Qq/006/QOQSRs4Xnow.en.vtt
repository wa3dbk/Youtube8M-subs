00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
the player behind him now has space to

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:43.550 
the player behind him now has space to
move<00:02:33.420> into<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:36.180> he<00:02:36.240> gets<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.570> shot<00:02:36.750> off<00:02:42.560> here

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
move into and he gets the shot off here

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.460 
move into and he gets the shot off here
again<00:02:43.860> you'll<00:02:44.070> see<00:02:44.270> the<00:02:45.270> support<00:02:45.720> striker

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
again you'll see the support striker

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.250 
again you'll see the support striker
making<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.580> run<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:48.120> drag<00:02:48.480> players<00:02:48.840> out<00:02:49.110> of<00:02:49.140> the

way<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:50.090> in<00:02:51.090> this<00:02:51.330> case<00:02:51.630> he's<00:02:52.080> going<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.350> leave

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
way and in this case he's going to leave

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:00.710 
way and in this case he's going to leave
space<00:02:52.890> for<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.220> pass<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:53.760> be<00:02:53.880> made<00:02:54.060> into

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.000 

in<00:03:01.720> this<00:03:01.900> video<00:03:02.110> we're<00:03:02.379> going<00:03:02.470> to<00:03:02.530> take<00:03:02.709> a<00:03:02.769> look

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
in this video we're going to take a look

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.009 
in this video we're going to take a look
at<00:03:03.189> how<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.430> active<00:03:03.970> AI<00:03:04.120> affects<00:03:04.780> all

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
at how the active AI affects all

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.920 
at how the active AI affects all
situations<00:03:05.829> and<00:03:06.099> how<00:03:06.879> that<00:03:06.939> extends<00:03:07.720> into

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
situations and how that extends into

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.309 
situations and how that extends into
defending<00:03:10.260> in<00:03:11.260> pairs<00:03:12.099> 2011<00:03:13.000> you'll<00:03:13.989> see<00:03:14.140> here

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
defending in pairs 2011 you'll see here

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.390 
defending in pairs 2011 you'll see here
when<00:03:14.439> we<00:03:14.530> stop<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:14.829> video<00:03:14.920> that<00:03:15.280> the

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
when we stop the video that the

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.309 
when we stop the video that the
formation<00:03:15.909> of<00:03:16.000> teams<00:03:16.299> at<00:03:16.540> times<00:03:16.840> could<00:03:17.170> be

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
formation of teams at times could be

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.309 
formation of teams at times could be
really<00:03:17.470> have<00:03:17.709> hazard<00:03:18.810> you'll<00:03:19.810> see<00:03:19.989> here<00:03:20.290> that

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
really have hazard you'll see here that

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.500 
really have hazard you'll see here that
the<00:03:20.650> space<00:03:21.040> in<00:03:21.280> between<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:22.000> defensive<00:03:22.480> line

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
the space in between the defensive line

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.770 
the space in between the defensive line
and<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:22.959> midfield<00:03:23.319> line<00:03:23.560> far<00:03:24.250> too<00:03:24.459> big

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
and the midfield line far too big

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.729 
and the midfield line far too big
allowing<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:25.840> player<00:03:25.989> to<00:03:26.049> drift<00:03:26.379> into<00:03:26.620> the

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
allowing the player to drift into the

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.149 
allowing the player to drift into the
space<00:03:26.950> gear<00:03:27.280> shot<00:03:27.549> off<00:03:27.730> in<00:03:28.439> pairs<00:03:29.439> 2012<00:03:30.010> we're

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:30.159 
space gear shot off in pairs 2012 we're

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:32.759 
space gear shot off in pairs 2012 we're
going<00:03:30.280> to<00:03:30.340> pause<00:03:30.549> the<00:03:30.760> action<00:03:30.849> here<00:03:31.450> and<00:03:31.769> you

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
going to pause the action here and you

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:33.629 
going to pause the action here and you
should<00:03:32.950> be<00:03:33.069> able<00:03:33.129> to<00:03:33.280> see<00:03:33.370> that<00:03:33.549> the

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
should be able to see that the

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.460 
should be able to see that the
communication<00:03:34.299> between<00:03:34.420> the<00:03:34.720> defensive<00:03:35.290> and

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
communication between the defensive and

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.360 
communication between the defensive and
the<00:03:35.650> midfield<00:03:36.040> lines<00:03:36.280> is<00:03:36.579> much<00:03:36.909> better<00:03:38.250> so<00:03:39.250> the

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
the midfield lines is much better so the

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.160 
the midfield lines is much better so the
team<00:03:39.579> generally<00:03:40.090> tries<00:03:40.510> to<00:03:40.720> hold<00:03:40.870> its<00:03:41.079> shape

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
team generally tries to hold its shape

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.589 
team generally tries to hold its shape
much<00:03:41.739> better<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.819> it<00:03:42.970> results<00:03:43.329> in<00:03:43.420> this

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
much better and it results in this

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.050 
much better and it results in this
player<00:03:43.840> bunching<00:03:44.379> we've<00:03:45.280> already<00:03:45.430> seen<00:03:45.760> how

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
player bunching we've already seen how

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.050 
player bunching we've already seen how
the<00:03:46.510> active<00:03:46.840> AI<00:03:46.959> effects<00:03:47.739> formations<00:03:48.700> and

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
the active AI effects formations and

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.369 
the active AI effects formations and
defending<00:03:49.720> now<00:03:49.870> we're<00:03:49.989> going<00:03:50.079> to<00:03:50.139> take<00:03:50.319> a

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:50.379 
defending now we're going to take a

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.140 
defending now we're going to take a
closer<00:03:50.709> look<00:03:50.829> at<00:03:51.250> how<00:03:51.549> the<00:03:51.609> active<00:03:52.000> I<00:03:52.120> I

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
closer look at how the active I I

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.399 
closer look at how the active I I
effects<00:03:52.930> individual<00:03:53.530> decisions<00:03:55.200> so<00:03:56.200> at<00:03:56.319> the

attacking<00:04:34.840> possibilities<00:04:35.530> that<00:04:35.740> we've<00:04:35.889> added

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
attacking possibilities that we've added

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.399 
attacking possibilities that we've added
into<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:36.550> game<00:04:36.669> so<00:04:37.630> that<00:04:37.780> the<00:04:37.900> balance<00:04:38.229> is

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:38.409 
into the game so that the balance is

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:41.480 
into the game so that the balance is
just<00:04:38.650> right

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.249
