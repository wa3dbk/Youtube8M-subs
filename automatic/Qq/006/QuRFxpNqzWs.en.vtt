00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
either magnesium or phosphorous or a

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.110 
either magnesium or phosphorous or a
number<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.219> other<00:00:35.340> things<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.790> they<00:00:35.910> that

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
number of other things that they that

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.360 
number of other things that they that
some<00:00:36.300> tracers<00:00:36.630> use<00:00:36.809> but<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.410> ignites<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:37.890> so

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
some tracers use but it ignites that so

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.340 
some tracers use but it ignites that so
as<00:00:38.489> its<00:00:38.670> firing<00:00:39.030> it's<00:00:39.390> burning<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.050> back<00:00:40.200> of

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350
