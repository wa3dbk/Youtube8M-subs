00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.250 
way you put the batteries in is by
unscrewing<00:02:47.620> these<00:02:47.890> middle<00:02:48.250> part<00:02:48.489> here<00:02:48.670> and

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
unscrewing these middle part here and

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.620 
unscrewing these middle part here and
splitting<00:02:50.260> it<00:02:50.410> into<00:02:50.560> like<00:02:51.070> so<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:52.510> the

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
splitting it into like so and the

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.410 
splitting it into like so and the
batteries<00:02:52.989> will<00:02:53.140> go<00:02:53.260> in<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:54.270> second<00:02:55.270> half

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
batteries will go in the second half

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.120 
batteries will go in the second half
here<00:02:55.920> I'm<00:02:56.920> not<00:02:57.250> exactly<00:02:57.790> sure<00:02:58.739> which<00:02:59.739> way<00:02:59.980> the

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
here I'm not exactly sure which way the

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:07.110 
here I'm not exactly sure which way the
batteries<00:03:00.520> go<00:03:00.730> in<00:03:02.850> assuming<00:03:03.850> the<00:03:04.090> flat<00:03:04.510> end

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:16.840
