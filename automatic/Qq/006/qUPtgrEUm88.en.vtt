00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:08.580
 Multifunctional pruning and pulverizing spoon 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.800
 the new jet coffee 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.870
 has been released and has 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.870
 important producers of coffee from mines 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.109
 the family for more than 30 years 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.060
 fukuda cultivates the fruits and always with 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.160
 pompeia manufacturer help 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.630
 until then they relied on the technology 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.140
 gives here three millennia 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.660
 now 13 500 reinforces the fleet of 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.410
 machines and makes the difference 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.170
 in the countryside coffee was not always the culture 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.210
 which dominated the region 30 years 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.329
 Fukuda family grew beans in 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.200
 chest and at that time the jet already 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.870
 was present here by jet I can 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:54.059
 say that she has been since the founding of the chest 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.469
 It is right is right from the first spray 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.050
 of bars 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.780
 Today the family has four areas in mines 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.500
 and cultivates one and a half hectares of 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.409
 coffee has an average productivity of 45 to 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.380
 47 sacks per hectare in the areas of 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.799
 cultivation in rainfed and 10 more sacks 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.500
 in areas with an irrigation system 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:19.380
 the grains are of different varieties 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.460
 production is fully screened and 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.979
 geared mostly for export 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.409
 70% of the fruits go to the japan states 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.860
 united and europe 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.900
 It's up to us to have coffee. 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.619
 this is the perception of the 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.369
 client 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:43.280
 Of course, this coffee has a 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:46.799
 It's totally special and that's it. 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.960
 the way that coffee travels is we 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.240
 we understand it would be from the preparation of the 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.770
 ground until product delivery 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.590
 itself 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.770
 the product that until then was harvested with 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.549
 3 harvesters k3 millennium da jacu a 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:05.939
 first bought in 1999 and the last in 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:10.200
 2013 and which now gains a 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:14.489
 new harvester Jet Car 3500 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:18.269
 the trend is currently in agriculture 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:20.550
 it's really you're having a mechanization 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:24.030
 more efficient 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.580
 I can not say that right, and you're looking for 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.489
 efficiency that there are 3 500 comes 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.590
 with this demand that the chest has today 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.769
 having a differential in the package 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.280
 techno 3 500 she came with 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:42.269
 much more innovation, right? and with much more 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.040
 harvest accuracy during 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.080
 agrishow in cozy black creek 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.900
 considered by the second jet 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.360
 revolution in mechanization of coffee also 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.540
 was presented recently at the time 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.579
 up to three ends 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.650
 we think there is a new moment 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.380
 is a second revolution of mechanization 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.120
 coffee because because the first time 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.280
 was to be able to harvest mechanically and 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.720
 to make the producer believe that 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.130
 was possible and mechanically 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.750
 destroy his coffee trees 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.370
 now not now we have a 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.310
 another proposal 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.859
 this new concept that the jet brings to 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.840
 coffee growing mechanization will 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:21.060
 allow a machine that before 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.389
 worked only a few months ago in 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.829
 practically the year 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:28.410
 all 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.420
 This is a multipurpose device in the 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.160
 which producer can and will perform 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.350
 harvest operation it takes the system 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.690
 harvesting pruning system does the 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.519
 farm doors and then it can 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.139
 this pruning system to put a 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.850
 spraying system and pass the entire 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:44.670
 summer spraying taking care of the crop 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.709
 ending the time of the flowers stock 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.930
 in April it replaces the system 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.359
 and starts the cycle again. 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.090
 then it is an opportunity to use the 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:56.220
 investment throughout the year while 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.200
 a simple harvester is there of nine and 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.940
 ten months guarded in a stall shack 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.049
 we make an investment one 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:06.569
 harvester not to be used during 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:08.900
 three months a year with a 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:11.819
 specific right harvest 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:15.359
 In that sense, the jet did not 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:18.329
 people's proposal to have a 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:21.479
 fragmentation is one 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.980
 of this cost and other gainful operations 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.710
 efficiency 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.690
 another new concept that every 3 500 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.220
 marked is the ability to 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.880
 choose on large terrain 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.920
 slopes to our market research 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.790
 we found that the vast majority of 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.500
 producers 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.740
 they believe that mechanization is 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.690
 interesting to 20% slope to 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.700
 then we design our over 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.560
 new ideas today are 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.620
 recommended to work up to 20% 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.560
 declivity which covers up to 80% of the area 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.500
 planted in the south of mines 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.780
 durval also highlights the quality of 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.800
 harvest that follows the same standards 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:04.170
 dakar three millennia in the harvest part 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.030
 I can say that there have been changes 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:09.750
 mainly in the 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:13.500
 set of rod settings nÃ© 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:16.140
 but the rest she already had a kit of 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.050
 collection very well adjusted because already a 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:22.500
 project is very well consolidated within 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:25.320
 of the coffee crop and what we 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.690
 We hope we would be next in the 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:31.350
 operations such as spraying 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:33.990
 pruning systems that will be available 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:37.590
 in the next two years 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:40.790
 mechanization she came to give support 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:44.490
 to the farmer, right? 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:46.680
 allied to mechanization has technology 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.730
 which are two tools that walk together 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:53.810
 and mechanization really is salvation 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.810
 of the farmer nowadays 

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:04.939
 wants more details of the revolutionary 

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:06.769
 jet coffee harvesters 

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:08.989
 you can then find all the 

00:06:06.769 --> 00:06:12.499
 information on the jet company website 

00:06:08.989 --> 00:06:14.899
 dot com and technology of the field ends 

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:17.209
 here but next Saturday has more 

00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:19.009
 Our meeting is scheduled for 10am and 

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:20.629
 stocking here on the rural canal 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:22.969
 but if you want to review the 

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:25.849
 today accompanies his reprise on Wednesday 

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:28.039
 at 11:30 a.m. or see all the 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:30.139
 our reports on the technology website 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:33.189
 of the field dot com 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:33.189
 Good week for you
