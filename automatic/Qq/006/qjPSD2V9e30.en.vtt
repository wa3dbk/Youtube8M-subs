00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
because like I said you're entering this

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.960 
because like I said you're entering this
phase<00:01:52.920> where<00:01:53.159> you're<00:01:53.280> gonna<00:01:53.340> be<00:01:53.520> sitting<00:01:53.820> on<00:01:53.909> a

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
phase where you're gonna be sitting on a

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.929 
phase where you're gonna be sitting on a
lot<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.360> you're<00:01:54.810> not<00:01:54.930> going<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.140> feel<00:01:55.350> the

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
lot and you're not going to feel the

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.429 
lot and you're not going to feel the
negative<00:01:56.939> effects<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.719> sitting<00:01:57.930> down<00:01:58.170> too

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
negative effects of sitting down too

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.260 
negative effects of sitting down too
much<00:01:58.680> until<00:01:59.159> probably<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.729> when<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.360> are

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
much until probably you when you are

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.920 
much until probably you when you are
around<00:02:01.600> college<00:02:02.549> since<00:02:03.549> you<00:02:03.759> get<00:02:04.630> more

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
around college since you get more

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.080 
around college since you get more
responsibilities<00:02:05.770> and<00:02:05.799> stress<00:02:06.310> starts

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
responsibilities and stress starts

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.870 
responsibilities and stress starts
kicking<00:02:07.270> in<00:02:07.570> so<00:02:08.110> that's<00:02:08.530> that<00:02:09.310> really<00:02:09.580> puts<00:02:09.759> a

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
kicking in so that's that really puts a
