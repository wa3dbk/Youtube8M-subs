00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.420
 yes, what is going on here is her off 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.760
 and I say , no one really looks 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.640
 luck here on the map row call of 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.989
 Duty and once throwers and that's it 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.400
 actually quite easy what they do 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.290
 you have to stand here under these 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.130
 funny ventilation shaft easy 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.720
 put underneath 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.940
 and most important is that you guys 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.620
 just as much under it as me 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.329
 That's what makes this little four customer 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.329
 Direction should be achieved 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.980
 see because if you do not do that then 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.630
 You just jump against it a thousand times and 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.340
 you just can not do it for me 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.720
 That's why it's happening 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.420
 the same way and then it should 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.500
 work and when you're up 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.940
 So if you are jumped 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.980
 just needed to push forward 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.090
 and then comes the characterized and could 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.590
 land on the ceiling 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.570
 and yes, you actually have that 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.040
 difficult already created can now 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.930
 you look at the ideological and 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.939
 can look what is where you are 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.409
 everything could come and he can 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.250
 even then shoot are the people 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.530
 just shoot 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.700
 that's why it's a bit of a hobby 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.680
 not lucky because maybe 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.460
 you are banished you never know what 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.350
 can happen 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.009
 that's why it just shows a buddy 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.659
 and until today then see enough the same 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.270
 you still here in the third course of 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.009
 The prison is at the top 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.170
 and there you can also the people 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.639
 shoot all is really cool me 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.109
 I can recommend that to me 

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:35.990

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:37.850
 work and yes good people that was 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.369
