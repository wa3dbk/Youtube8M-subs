00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:30.760 
is installed let's look at the hardware

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.360 
is installed let's look at the hardware
keyboard<00:07:31.260> open<00:07:32.260> the<00:07:32.440> opposite<00:07:32.800> way<00:07:32.950> to<00:07:32.980> the

keyboard open the opposite way to the

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.860 
keyboard open the opposite way to the
Titan<00:07:34.360> to<00:07:34.510> kaiser<00:07:35.640> we<00:07:36.640> had<00:07:36.790> the<00:07:36.910> two<00:07:37.120> soft<00:07:37.660> keys

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:37.870 
Titan to kaiser we had the two soft keys

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:42.510 
Titan to kaiser we had the two soft keys
on<00:07:38.350> the<00:07:38.410> edges<00:07:39.780> we<00:07:40.780> have<00:07:40.960> a<00:07:40.990> Windows<00:07:41.410> key<00:07:41.680> the

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:42.520 
on the edges we have a Windows key the

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.000 
on the edges we have a Windows key the
LED<00:07:42.880> indicators<00:07:43.450> like<00:07:43.660> you'll<00:07:43.900> be<00:07:44.860> familiar

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.010 
LED indicators like you'll be familiar

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:49.230 
LED indicators like you'll be familiar
with<00:07:45.220> if<00:07:45.520> you<00:07:45.670> use<00:07:45.700> the<00:07:45.910> Kaiser<00:07:48.030> it's<00:07:49.030> quite

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:49.240 
with if you use the Kaiser it's quite

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.820 
with if you use the Kaiser it's quite
nice<00:07:49.360> really<00:07:50.220> good<00:07:51.220> click<00:07:51.490> to<00:07:51.640> the<00:07:51.730> keyboard

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:52.830 
nice really good click to the keyboard

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.930 
nice really good click to the keyboard
definitely<00:07:53.830> comparable<00:07:54.310> with<00:07:54.490> the<00:07:54.670> Kaiser

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:54.940 
definitely comparable with the Kaiser

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.870 
definitely comparable with the Kaiser
again<00:07:55.950> so<00:07:56.950> it<00:07:57.010> looks<00:07:57.070> like<00:07:57.280> it's<00:07:57.550> going<00:07:57.670> to<00:07:57.730> be

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:57.880 
again so it looks like it's going to be

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:04.339 
again so it looks like it's going to be
a<00:07:58.060> very<00:07:58.180> nice<00:07:58.660> device<00:08:01.410> ok<00:08:02.410> there<00:08:02.920> we<00:08:03.010> go
