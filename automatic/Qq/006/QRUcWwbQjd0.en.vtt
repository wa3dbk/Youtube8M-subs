 contagious is prodigious you have 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.230

 loved to play it when playing the rhythm and 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.570
 it made me think about two taboos of 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.470
 the company connected to old age is to 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.790
 to say aesthetic beauty and death 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.890
 because according to him no beauty 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.619
 our capitalist society anti old 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.270
 harness in tabarnak 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.400
 it is unfortunately we are better than 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.110
 give reality TV shows 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.970
 with showerbags so much 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.740
 narcissist who changes the balls with 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.340
 milk for their own reflection 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.340
 when he touches 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.520
 but the mornings of the world why it's 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.430
 nice a big daddy it's good ca 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.770
 big ears 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.900
 although my generation is saying the old 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.810

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.050
 the proof was sent to music 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.050

 recorded 110 long on these values 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.360
 a game will say death is not far on 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.280
 occult old age and then we do not speak 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.810
 of the hand we speak of misleading mores 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.460
 of fatal accidents but of death 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.210
 do not talk about it because the mass 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.980
 reminds of nothingness 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.220
