flagship titles for the ps4 was it

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.030 
flagship titles for the ps4 was it
obviously<00:02:03.270> supposed<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.869> be<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.290> launch<00:02:04.770> game

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
obviously supposed to be a launch game

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.449 
obviously supposed to be a launch game
as<00:02:05.219> well<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:06.719> course<00:02:06.780> isn't<00:02:07.160> exclusive<00:02:08.160> so

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
as well and of course isn't exclusive so

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.859 
as well and of course isn't exclusive so
that<00:02:08.729> would<00:02:08.849> be<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:08.970> bit<00:02:09.119> strange<00:02:09.390> for<00:02:09.569> them<00:02:09.750> to

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
that would be a bit strange for them to

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.589 
that would be a bit strange for them to
put<00:02:10.020> them<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:10.649> close<00:02:11.310> together<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:11.940> it

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
put them to so close together and it

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.790 
put them to so close together and it
would<00:02:12.780> be<00:02:13.410> and

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
would be and

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.740 
would be and
a bit<00:02:13.980> close<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.430> anticipated<00:02:15.300> release

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
a bit close to the anticipated release

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.900 
a bit close to the anticipated release
date<00:02:15.930> of<00:02:15.960> watchdogs<00:02:16.640> however<00:02:17.640> I<00:02:17.670> don't<00:02:17.790> think

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
date of watchdogs however I don't think

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.430 
date of watchdogs however I don't think
that's<00:02:18.060> too<00:02:18.300> much<00:02:18.420> of<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.600> concern<00:02:18.780> because<00:02:19.140> as

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
that's too much of a concern because as

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.620 
that's too much of a concern because as
I<00:02:19.560> said<00:02:19.620> it's<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.060> anticipated<00:02:21.060> release<00:02:21.360> date

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
I said it's the anticipated release date

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.320 
I said it's the anticipated release date
we<00:02:22.140> don't<00:02:22.290> have<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.530> release<00:02:22.830> date<00:02:22.860> exactly<00:02:23.670> for

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
we don't have a release date exactly for

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.790 
we don't have a release date exactly for
watchdogs<00:02:24.510> we<00:02:24.870> just<00:02:24.990> have<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.230> rough<00:02:25.500> release

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800

window<00:02:26.210> but<00:02:27.210> still<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.600> would<00:02:27.750> place<00:02:28.020> it<00:02:28.050> a

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
window but still it would place it a

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.020 
window but still it would place it a
little<00:02:28.560> bit<00:02:28.770> of<00:02:28.890> an<00:02:28.980> uncomfortable<00:02:29.550> spotless

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
little bit of an uncomfortable spotless

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.820 
little bit of an uncomfortable spotless

as a few games coming out in that period
however<00:02:32.730> what<00:02:33.480> it<00:02:33.600> would<00:02:33.750> do<00:02:33.990> is<00:02:34.250> help<00:02:35.250> those

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
however what it would do is help those

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.570 
however what it would do is help those

to put it up yet and they probably may

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.550 
to put it up yet and they probably may
have<00:02:59.640> taken<00:02:59.820> it<00:03:00.150> down<00:03:00.290> because<00:03:01.290> the
