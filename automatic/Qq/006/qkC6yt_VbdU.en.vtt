all the way up until now they are all

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.789 
all the way up until now they are all
rooted<00:01:57.750> on<00:01:57.930> this<00:01:58.110> idea<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:59.189> we<00:01:59.430> should<00:01:59.460> love

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
in a way that is

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.540 
in a way that is
horrible<00:02:07.530> Jesus<00:02:08.530> is<00:02:08.649> talking<00:02:08.860> about<00:02:09.160> being

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
horrible Jesus is talking about being

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.650 
horrible Jesus is talking about being
made<00:02:09.759> perfect<00:02:10.360> in<00:02:10.509> love<00:02:11.670> this<00:02:12.670> is<00:02:12.910> a<00:02:13.090> quality

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
made perfect in love this is a quality

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.150 
made perfect in love this is a quality
of<00:02:13.870> a<00:02:13.959> christ-follower

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
of a christ-follower

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.540 
of a christ-follower
because<00:02:15.880> it<00:02:16.030> is<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.330> quality<00:02:16.930> of<00:02:17.140> God<00:02:17.550> now

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
because it is the quality of God now

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.150
