 But today is everything else 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.970
 runners that the job of the candidates 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.129
 his 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.530
 my name is professor bad man 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:24.450
 square for production and 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.840
 industrial engineering and not only 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.340
 There I detect bottlenecks of all kinds 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.489
 and the candidates 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:37.500
 I can only advise no bottlenecks today 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:39.480

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.629

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.250
 like soap bubbles she can convince 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:45.989
 comes in the recall 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.860
 let's look at how ours 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.860
 Candidates claim 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.210
 Only six candidates have it in the 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.639
 recall done 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.980
 all from the university bayreuth 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:38.800
 mr professor doctor oberender 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.870
 why is that surprising? 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.300
 that we do not have excellent 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.360
 Students are very committed too 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.160
 on the cart 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.600
 bayreuther coining you know it has 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.900
 prevailed in the market 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.000
 changing students better teaching and 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.330
 what is also on this chio 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.100
 evaluation we are in the market for it 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.510
 and we are present and that the 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.600
 advantage for our students and that 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:07.150
 So our goal is hardly surprising 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:10.840
 Mr. Professor Doctor Oberender will be in 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.340
