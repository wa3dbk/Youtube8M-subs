just<00:00:45.180> sort<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.480> big<00:00:45.780> floaty<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.800> know<00:00:46.950> go

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
just sort of a big floaty you know go

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.130 
just sort of a big floaty you know go
fast<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.030> straight<00:00:48.059> line<00:00:48.300> that's<00:00:48.809> about<00:00:49.110> it

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140

that's<00:00:49.559> really<00:00:49.860> all<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:49.980> could<00:00:50.129> do<00:00:50.280> but<00:00:50.489> as<00:00:50.910> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
that's really all I could do but as the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.700 
that's really all I could do but as the
charge<00:00:51.360> has<00:00:51.510> gone<00:00:51.750> on<00:00:51.989> with<00:00:52.170> its<00:00:52.320> life<00:00:52.500> cycle

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710

they<00:00:53.149> very<00:00:54.149> slowly<00:00:54.480> improved<00:00:55.020> things<00:00:55.199> like

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
they very slowly improved things like

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.470 
they very slowly improved things like
better<00:00:55.680> performance<00:00:56.190> better<00:00:56.219> handling<00:00:56.730> much

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
better performance better handling much

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.319 
better performance better handling much
better<00:00:57.809> interior<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.680> now<00:00:58.859> for<00:00:59.520> 15<00:00:59.699> they've

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.380 
new it's not all new it's the same car
pretty<00:01:06.900> much<00:01:06.990> just<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.920> redesigned<00:01:08.909> front<00:01:09.210> end

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
pretty much just a redesigned front end

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.580 
pretty much just a redesigned front end
and<00:01:09.479> rear<00:01:09.659> end<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:09.960> bring<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.260> more<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.560> line

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
and rear end that bring it more in line

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.740 
and rear end that bring it more in line
with<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.979> Dodge<00:01:11.159> family<00:01:11.700> it's<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.360> lot<00:01:12.720> more

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
with the Dodge family it's a lot more

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.289 
with the Dodge family it's a lot more
like<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.439> dart<00:01:13.740> than<00:01:14.430> anything<00:01:14.790> else<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.210> in

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
like the dart than anything else and in

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.730 
like the dart than anything else and in
fact<00:01:15.450> from<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.720> rear<00:01:15.930> end<00:01:16.110> it's<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.409> little

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
fact from the rear end it's a little

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.260 
fact from the rear end it's a little
like<00:01:16.950> if<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.549> look<00:01:17.700> at<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.850> from<00:01:17.909> certain

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
like if you look at it from certain

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.240 
like if you look at it from certain
angles<00:01:18.360> it's<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.960> lot<00:01:19.290> like<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.650> dark<00:01:19.860> okay

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
angles it's a lot like the dark okay

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.980 
angles it's a lot like the dark okay
like<00:01:20.520> from<00:01:20.670> far<00:01:20.880> away<00:01:20.909> you'll<00:01:21.240> probably<00:01:21.509> sort

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
like from far away you'll probably sort

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.219 
like from far away you'll probably sort
is<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> dart<00:01:22.950> or<00:01:23.310> but<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.750> dark<00:01:24.960> doesn't

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
is that a dart or but the dark doesn't

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.710 
is that a dart or but the dark doesn't
look<00:01:25.320> bad<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:25.950> it's<00:01:26.310> okay<00:01:26.610> okay<00:01:27.150> this<00:01:27.509> is

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
look bad so it's okay okay this is

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.990 
look bad so it's okay okay this is
essentially<00:01:28.140> just<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.380> way<00:01:28.470> for<00:01:28.500> dodge<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.759> get

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
essentially just a way for dodge to get

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.640 
essentially just a way for dodge to get
money<00:01:30.270> out<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.509> people's<00:01:30.810> pockets<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.290> refresh

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
money out of people's pockets a refresh

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.219 
money out of people's pockets a refresh
if<00:01:31.920> it's<00:01:32.400> in<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.970> most<00:01:33.270> literal<00:01:33.570> sense<00:01:33.780> a

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
if it's in the most literal sense a

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.109 
if it's in the most literal sense a
facelift<00:01:34.680> okay<00:01:35.070> that's<00:01:35.340> about<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.640> but<00:01:36.000> you

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119
