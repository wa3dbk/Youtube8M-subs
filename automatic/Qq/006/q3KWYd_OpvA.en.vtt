this<00:00:18.890> one<00:00:19.510> check<00:00:20.510> this<00:00:20.660> out

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.160 

so<00:00:53.770> this<00:00:53.950> is<00:00:54.070> a<00:00:54.100> really<00:00:54.460> cool<00:00:54.670> intro<00:00:55.570> or<00:00:55.780> ending

so this is a really cool intro or ending

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.110 
so this is a really cool intro or ending
lick<00:00:56.350> probably<00:00:56.860> work<00:00:56.980> better<00:00:57.160> as<00:00:57.340> a<00:00:57.370> as<00:00:57.880> an

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
lick probably work better as a as an

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.060 
lick probably work better as a as an

happening with it you got to turn down

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.300 
happening with it you got to turn down
to<00:01:07.960> drop<00:01:08.200> D<00:01:08.440> and<00:01:08.740> then<00:01:09.430> I'm<00:01:10.390> playing<00:01:11.160> to<00:01:12.160> play

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
an a chord down to an a7 this would be

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.450 
an a chord down to an a7 this would be
like<00:02:49.340> G<00:02:49.580> over<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:50.150> then<00:02:50.239> D<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:52.450> a7
