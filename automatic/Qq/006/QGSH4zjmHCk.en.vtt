00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
think the lowest i've ever seen it was

think the lowest i've ever seen it was
like<00:00:25.949> maybe<00:00:26.220> 1<00:00:26.369> 30<00:00:26.609> or<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.900> it's<00:00:28.050> kind<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.260> a

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
like maybe 1 30 or so so it's kind of a

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.890 
like maybe 1 30 or so so it's kind of a

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
than tennis shoes I mean as far as being

don't think you could find a better boot

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.649 
don't think you could find a better boot
outside<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.810> wearing<00:01:22.020> combat<00:01:22.170> boots<00:01:26.360> but<00:01:27.360> I

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
outside of wearing combat boots but I

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.950 
outside of wearing combat boots but I
did<00:01:28.259> end<00:01:28.530> up<00:01:28.650> getting<00:01:28.680> some<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.189> these<00:01:29.280> as<00:01:29.520> well

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
these are more along the lines of uh I

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.090 
these are more along the lines of uh I
guess<00:01:33.540> fashion<00:01:33.960> more<00:01:34.380> than<00:01:34.560> anything<00:01:34.710> else

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
guess fashion more than anything else
