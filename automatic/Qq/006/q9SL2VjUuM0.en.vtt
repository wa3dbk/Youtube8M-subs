00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.299
 now at ultrabook pictures youtube 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.670
 channel of ultrabook king.de three 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:14.219
 ultrabook converter picture in comparison 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.740
 or 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.500
 next to each other we have three here 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.300
 convert picture 1 from the house lenovo 1 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.690
 from the house dell and one from the 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.270
 home asus a tai chi a xps 12 and 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.440
 a yoga 13 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.290
 they are different 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.980
 concepts have been used or implemented 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.190
 been 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.309
 how then the realization of or the 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.249
 transformation from ultrabooks to tablet resp 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.899
 done to tablet mode when my 

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:46.409
 tai chi 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:50.379
 It has two screens once 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:54.489
 in the outer area an ips panel 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:57.010
 touchscreen with full hd resolution and im 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:00.120
 inner area an ips-panel without 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.879
 Touchscreen also with full HD resolution 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.290
 the whole thing has a matte finish that will 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.450
 switched over a software 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.120
 You can either both at the same time 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.330
 operate only according to this one 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.950
 the inner one, or only the outer one, if 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.960
 You can still choose to operate both 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.370
 if you want to mirror the whole thing so on 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.400
 both exactly the same content 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.600
 represent or whether you want to expand 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.070
 so on both different 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.800
 content may represent for one 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.650
 presentation or something 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:34.750
 so much for tai chi then we come to 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:37.510
 xps 12 here's all about one im 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:43.540
 display frame degree swiveling 180 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:45.670
 display realized so you can do that 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:50.980
 actual display in this frame 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.900
 move here if you go back when 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.220
 the frame comes race of the 1st 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.830
 dockt pulls on a bit too 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.960
 itself thereto by very slight pressure 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.920
 what does it look like again 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.690
 then you can do that and the whole thing 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:13.160
 use like that 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:17.330
 or you use all that much for 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.850
 xps 12 we come now to the lenovo yoga 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.830
 13 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.350
 Here we have a whole 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:29.560
 normal ultrabook a normal one 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:33.670
 ideapad however with touch screen 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:37.130
 of course this is also xps 12 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.500
 forget but it is obvious so 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.890
 So here I can do it all 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.190
 finger use 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:49.160
 the transformation to the tablet or in the 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.020
 tablet mode is done by flipping the 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.709
 displays at 360 degrees 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.080
 then it looks like it can 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.950
 of course also set up 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:03.590
 how can it be used in temp mode or 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.930
 just completely put down disadvantage so too 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.720
 say that you always have the keyboard in it 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.330
 bottom area including touchpad the 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.040
 that's what it looks like 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.450
 but actually quite stable 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:20.480
 so it does not break it is 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.290
 does not get stuck somewhere or so yes 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.959
 we have the equipment now 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.640
 partly have different lengths 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.410
 we already tested them partially 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.230
 she has arrived today since 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.459
 yesterday 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.700
 so far our judgment is relative 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:39.500
 clearly that the concept of dell xps 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:42.340
 12 overall, we are most successful 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.110
 have a very good display 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.170
 we have full-blown ultrabook and 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.269
 also the use in the tablet mode is 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.519
 really that is really as well 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.140
 use tablet unlike yoga 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.489
 that you can use it altogether 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.829
 but it's a bit on the whole 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.630
 hard so if you are the regularly as 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:02.500
 probably would like to use tablet 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.730
 not so suitable every now and then 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.170
 and this one is brand new now 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.000
 get that it's actually a 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:12.109
 very fine concept with the two 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.519
 screens are our first 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.109
 Experience is that it is not quite 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.720
 The software works reliably 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:18.739
 with that one 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.000
 but the others will switch over 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.960
 the coming days will be the next 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.100
 Weeks when we get this 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.590
 take a closer look 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:32.930
 everything else then impress ours too 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.930
 our experiences on ultrabook in.de
