module type goggles you might be asking

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.750 
module type goggles you might be asking
yourself<00:00:38.470> well<00:00:38.770> why<00:00:38.860> would<00:00:39.010> I<00:00:39.100> want<00:00:39.130> to<00:00:39.310> run

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
yourself well why would I want to run

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.420 
yourself well why would I want to run
2.4<00:00:40.420> when<00:00:40.570> they<00:00:40.660> have<00:00:40.809> the<00:00:40.899> 1.3<00:00:41.590> or<00:00:41.739> the<00:00:41.829> 5.8

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
2.4 when they have the 1.3 or the 5.8

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.580 
2.4 when they have the 1.3 or the 5.8
well<00:00:42.940> as<00:00:43.149> you<00:00:43.420> guys<00:00:43.510> know<00:00:43.750> fpv<00:00:44.170> is<00:00:44.290> a<00:00:44.320> growing

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
well as you guys know fpv is a growing

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.049 
well as you guys know fpv is a growing
hobby<00:00:44.980> and<00:00:45.220> it's<00:00:45.340> just<00:00:45.489> getting<00:00:45.730> bigger<00:00:45.820> and

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
hobby and it's just getting bigger and

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:47.819 
hobby and it's just getting bigger and
bigger<00:00:46.120> so<00:00:46.780> that<00:00:46.809> means<00:00:47.110> more<00:00:47.350> channels<00:00:47.739> are

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
bigger so that means more channels are

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:49.500 
bigger so that means more channels are
becoming<00:00:48.160> used<00:00:48.550> and<00:00:48.850> when<00:00:49.000> you<00:00:49.090> try<00:00:49.270> to<00:00:49.300> fly

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
becoming used and when you try to fly

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.229 
becoming used and when you try to fly
fpv<00:00:50.020> it's<00:00:50.800> sometimes<00:00:51.280> hard<00:00:51.550> to<00:00:51.640> find<00:00:51.730> a

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
fpv it's sometimes hard to find a

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:53.700 
fpv it's sometimes hard to find a
channel<00:00:52.660> that<00:00:52.840> you<00:00:52.899> can<00:00:53.079> fly<00:00:53.230> with<00:00:53.260> with<00:00:53.559> your

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
channel that you can fly with with your

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.740 
channel that you can fly with with your
friends<00:00:54.040> so<00:00:54.489> recently<00:00:55.300> I've<00:00:55.420> been<00:00:55.510> doing<00:00:55.690> a

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
friends so recently I've been doing a

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.030 
friends so recently I've been doing a
lot<00:00:55.870> of<00:00:55.899> testing<00:00:56.290> on<00:00:56.379> the<00:00:56.530> 2.4<00:00:56.920> gigahertz

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
lot of testing on the 2.4 gigahertz

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.250 
lot of testing on the 2.4 gigahertz
module<00:00:57.850> and<00:00:58.030> I<00:00:58.120> gotta<00:00:58.300> say<00:00:58.450> I<00:00:58.480> really<00:00:58.719> like<00:00:59.020> it

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
module and I gotta say I really like it

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.200 
module and I gotta say I really like it
so<00:00:59.860> far<00:01:00.100> I've<00:01:00.219> been<00:01:00.370> able<00:01:00.460> to<00:01:00.610> test<00:01:00.910> it<00:01:01.090> out

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
so far I've been able to test it out

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.590 
so far I've been able to test it out
with<00:01:01.480> the<00:01:01.899> brand<00:01:02.590> new<00:01:02.739> immersion<00:01:03.250> RC<00:01:03.640> 700

milliwatts 2.4 gigahertz video
transmitter<00:01:06.880> and<00:01:07.200> paired<00:01:08.200> with<00:01:08.290> some

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
transmitter and paired with some

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.140 
transmitter and paired with some
long-range<00:01:08.860> antennas<00:01:09.549> we<00:01:09.670> were<00:01:09.729> able<00:01:09.850> to<00:01:10.000> get

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
long-range antennas we were able to get

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.539 
long-range antennas we were able to get
two<00:01:10.330> and<00:01:10.479> a<00:01:10.510> half<00:01:10.630> miles<00:01:10.930> at<00:01:11.470> about<00:01:11.979> 60<00:01:12.369> feet

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
two and a half miles at about 60 feet

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:14.340 
two and a half miles at about 60 feet
off<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:12.729> deck<00:01:13.060> it<00:01:13.240> was<00:01:13.360> on<00:01:13.479> a<00:01:13.510> quadcopter<00:01:13.810> with

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
off the deck it was on a quadcopter with

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.200 
off the deck it was on a quadcopter with
return<00:01:14.740> to<00:01:14.830> home<00:01:14.979> so<00:01:15.220> we<00:01:15.700> just<00:01:15.850> kept<00:01:16.030> pushing

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
return to home so we just kept pushing

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.030 
return to home so we just kept pushing
the<00:01:16.360> limit<00:01:16.659> and<00:01:16.750> pushing<00:01:17.049> the<00:01:17.140> limit<00:01:17.440> we're

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
the limit and pushing the limit we're

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.289 
the limit and pushing the limit we're
able<00:01:18.130> to<00:01:18.340> hit<00:01:18.460> about<00:01:18.580> two<00:01:18.760> and<00:01:18.909> a<00:01:18.939> half<00:01:19.060> miles

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
able to hit about two and a half miles

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.570 
able to hit about two and a half miles
so<00:01:19.479> that's<00:01:19.630> very<00:01:19.810> impressive<00:01:20.020> I<00:01:20.439> did<00:01:21.220> start<00:01:21.490> to

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
so that's very impressive I did start to

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.609 
so that's very impressive I did start to
try<00:01:21.760> these<00:01:21.820> out<00:01:22.119> with<00:01:22.360> the<00:01:22.750> circular

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
try these out with the circular

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.380 
try these out with the circular
polarized<00:01:24.010> antennas<00:01:24.460> however<00:01:25.000> I<00:01:25.030> wasn't

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
polarized antennas however I wasn't

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.550 
polarized antennas however I wasn't
getting<00:01:25.570> good<00:01:25.600> results<00:01:26.080> and<00:01:26.229> it<00:01:26.290> could<00:01:26.470> have

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
getting good results and it could have

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.380 
getting good results and it could have
been<00:01:26.650> because<00:01:26.799> of<00:01:26.979> a<00:01:27.159> few<00:01:27.820> different<00:01:27.909> factors

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
been because of a few different factors

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.420 
been because of a few different factors
one<00:01:28.630> there's<00:01:29.110> a<00:01:29.200> lot<00:01:29.320> of<00:01:29.439> guys<00:01:29.530> flying<00:01:29.799> 2.4

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
one there's a lot of guys flying 2.4

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.160 
one there's a lot of guys flying 2.4
around<00:01:30.700> me<00:01:30.880> and<00:01:31.150> that<00:01:31.390> could<00:01:31.540> have<00:01:31.659> reduced<00:01:31.960> my

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
around me and that could have reduced my

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.830 
around me and that could have reduced my
range<00:01:32.409> also<00:01:33.189> I<00:01:33.549> believe<00:01:33.820> that<00:01:34.299> the<00:01:34.420> antennas

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
range also I believe that the antennas

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.320 
range also I believe that the antennas
that<00:01:34.869> I<00:01:34.990> had<00:01:35.170> were<00:01:35.290> also<00:01:35.619> prototypes<00:01:36.130> so<00:01:36.640> I'm

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
that I had were also prototypes so I'm

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.310 
that I had were also prototypes so I'm
gonna<00:01:37.479> go<00:01:37.600> ahead<00:01:37.780> and<00:01:37.869> give<00:01:37.990> them<00:01:38.110> another

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
gonna go ahead and give them another

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.399 
gonna go ahead and give them another
shot<00:01:38.409> and<00:01:38.799> I'll<00:01:38.860> tell<00:01:39.159> you<00:01:39.250> guys<00:01:39.400> my<00:01:39.549> results

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
shot and I'll tell you guys my results

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.749 
shot and I'll tell you guys my results
soon<00:01:41.409> in<00:01:41.619> the<00:01:41.740> in<00:01:41.979> the<00:01:42.130> comments<00:01:42.490> below<00:01:42.580> or

I'll leave them in the description as to

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.560 
I'll leave them in the description as to
what<00:01:45.040> kind<00:01:45.189> of<00:01:45.250> range<00:01:45.430> we're<00:01:45.640> getting<00:01:45.850> real

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
what kind of range we're getting real

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.120 
what kind of range we're getting real
quick<00:01:46.720> let<00:01:46.869> me<00:01:46.930> show<00:01:47.079> you<00:01:47.170> guys<00:01:47.350> how<00:01:48.070> the

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
quick let me show you guys how the

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.420 
quick let me show you guys how the
module<00:01:48.490> works<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:50.259> have<00:01:50.439> yourself<00:01:50.860> the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
module works you have yourself the

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.130 
module works you have yourself the
Dominator<00:01:52.090> goggles<00:01:52.479> in<00:01:52.600> my<00:01:52.689> case<00:01:52.869> I've<00:01:53.020> got

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
Dominator goggles in my case I've got

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.319 
Dominator goggles in my case I've got
the<00:01:53.229> version<00:01:53.560> twos<00:01:53.799> I<00:01:54.070> did<00:01:54.729> verify<00:01:54.909> they<00:01:55.270> do

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
the version twos I did verify they do

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:56.940 
the version twos I did verify they do
work<00:01:55.780> with<00:01:55.960> the<00:01:56.049> version<00:01:56.380> twos<00:01:56.560> they<00:01:56.770> also

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
work with the version twos they also

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.639 
work with the version twos they also
work<00:01:57.280> with<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:57.549> HDS<00:01:58.030> as<00:01:58.210> well<00:01:58.780> as<00:01:58.990> the<00:01:59.170> current

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
work with the HDS as well as the current

work with the HDS as well as the current
Dominator<00:02:00.430> modules<00:02:00.909> Dominator<00:02:01.570> goggles<00:02:01.960> that

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
Dominator modules Dominator goggles that

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.440 
Dominator modules Dominator goggles that
are<00:02:02.110> out<00:02:02.290> the<00:02:02.470> black<00:02:02.890> one<00:02:03.130> so<00:02:03.700> simply<00:02:04.119> just<00:02:04.180> pop

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
are out the black one so simply just pop

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.719 
are out the black one so simply just pop
out<00:02:04.600> your<00:02:04.720> module<00:02:05.079> and<00:02:05.259> you<00:02:06.100> just<00:02:06.280> pop<00:02:06.520> in

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
out your module and you just pop in

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.339 
out your module and you just pop in
whichever<00:02:07.299> frequency<00:02:07.869> you're<00:02:08.019> planning<00:02:08.319> to

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
whichever frequency you're planning to

whichever frequency you're planning to
fly<00:02:08.409> in<00:02:08.829> my<00:02:09.220> case<00:02:09.489> I'm<00:02:09.700> going<00:02:09.729> to<00:02:09.849> be<00:02:09.970> using<00:02:10.179> the

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
fly in my case I'm going to be using the

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.379 
fly in my case I'm going to be using the
2.4<00:02:10.899> right<00:02:11.109> now<00:02:11.230> and<00:02:11.680> you<00:02:12.249> just<00:02:12.400> pop<00:02:12.939> in<00:02:13.120> your

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.389 
2.4 right now and you just pop in your

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:15.720 
2.4 right now and you just pop in your
little<00:02:14.169> door<00:02:14.469> for<00:02:14.709> your

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
little door for your

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.000 
little door for your
goggles<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:16.909> you've<00:02:17.810> got<00:02:18.019> video<00:02:18.170> there<00:02:18.530> now

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
goggles and you've got video there now

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.559 
goggles and you've got video there now
one<00:02:19.459> really<00:02:19.730> good<00:02:19.849> thing<00:02:19.909> about<00:02:20.120> these

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
one really good thing about these

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.630 
one really good thing about these
goggles<00:02:20.900> is<00:02:21.290> when<00:02:21.560> you<00:02:21.650> plug<00:02:21.860> them<00:02:22.010> in<00:02:22.189> you<00:02:22.579> can

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
goggles is when you plug them in you can

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.690 
goggles is when you plug them in you can
see<00:02:22.879> the<00:02:23.030> little<00:02:23.180> green<00:02:23.450> LED<00:02:24.409> come<00:02:24.680> on<00:02:24.829> I<00:02:25.010> mean

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
see the little green LED come on I mean

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.069 
see the little green LED come on I mean
that's<00:02:26.150> not<00:02:26.269> going<00:02:26.390> to<00:02:26.450> be<00:02:26.540> very<00:02:26.689> helpful<00:02:26.900> to

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.079 
that's not going to be very helpful to

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.289 
that's not going to be very helpful to
you<00:02:27.230> because<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:28.129> door<00:02:28.280> is<00:02:28.310> covered<00:02:28.730> but<00:02:29.120> when

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
you because the door is covered but when

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.330 
you because the door is covered but when
you<00:02:29.390> do<00:02:29.480> power<00:02:29.750> on<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:30.379> you<00:02:30.530> turn<00:02:31.129> it<00:02:31.220> on

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
you do power on and you turn it on

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.920 
you do power on and you turn it on
you'll<00:02:31.579> see<00:02:31.640> a<00:02:31.790> little<00:02:31.939> green<00:02:32.150> LED<00:02:32.510> that<00:02:32.720> tells

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
you'll see a little green LED that tells

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.410 
you'll see a little green LED that tells
you<00:02:33.170> that<00:02:33.409> the<00:02:34.159> power<00:02:34.340> is<00:02:34.549> on<00:02:34.730> a<00:02:34.939> little<00:02:35.329> bit

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
you that the power is on a little bit

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.809 
you that the power is on a little bit
different<00:02:35.750> with<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.140> 1.3<00:02:37.069> gigahertz<00:02:37.340> module

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
different with the 1.3 gigahertz module

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.880 
different with the 1.3 gigahertz module
when<00:02:38.150> you<00:02:38.269> select<00:02:38.629> channels<00:02:39.019> if<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.500> LED

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
when you select channels if the LED

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.860 
when you select channels if the LED
comes<00:02:40.189> on<00:02:40.370> for<00:02:40.939> the<00:02:41.060> channel<00:02:41.390> that<00:02:41.540> you<00:02:41.629> have

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
comes on for the channel that you have

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.559 
comes on for the channel that you have
selected<00:02:42.560> but<00:02:43.400> not<00:02:43.519> for<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.790> 2.4<00:02:44.269> you<00:02:44.420> just

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
selected but not for the 2.4 you just

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.970 
selected but not for the 2.4 you just
get<00:02:44.689> it<00:02:44.780> on/off<00:02:44.900> but<00:02:45.560> again<00:02:45.799> those<00:02:46.489> are<00:02:47.980> not

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
get it on/off but again those are not

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
get it on/off but again those are not
important<00:02:49.400> because<00:02:49.489> you're<00:02:49.730> not<00:02:49.790> gonna<00:02:49.909> be

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
important because you're not gonna be

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.280 
important because you're not gonna be
able<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.180> see<00:02:50.269> them<00:02:50.420> anyway<00:02:50.659> with<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:50.900> door<00:02:51.079> on

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
able to see them anyway with the door on

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.539 
able to see them anyway with the door on
so<00:02:52.989> real<00:02:53.989> quick<00:02:54.200> I<00:02:54.379> was<00:02:54.590> able<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:54.980> test<00:02:55.430> them

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
so real quick I was able to test them

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.410 
so real quick I was able to test them
out<00:02:55.700> with<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.269> LA<00:02:56.659> mate<00:02:56.870> 2.4<00:02:57.530> gigahertz

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
out with the LA mate 2.4 gigahertz

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.390 
out with the LA mate 2.4 gigahertz
transmitter<00:02:59.420> this<00:03:00.200> is<00:03:00.349> the<00:03:00.470> LA<00:03:00.620> mate<00:03:00.799> 1000

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
transmitter this is the LA mate 1000

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.990 
transmitter this is the LA mate 1000
milliwatts<00:03:02.620> so<00:03:03.620> I<00:03:03.650> would<00:03:04.099> say<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:04.519> one<00:03:04.730> watt

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
milliwatts so I would say the one watt

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.789 
milliwatts so I would say the one watt
Lommy<00:03:05.269> one<00:03:05.569> watt<00:03:05.810> works<00:03:06.109> so<00:03:06.530> does<00:03:06.680> the

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
Lommy one watt works so does the

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.699 
Lommy one watt works so does the
immersion<00:03:07.069> are<00:03:07.310> steep<00:03:07.549> ends<00:03:07.909> and<00:03:08.530> I'll<00:03:09.530> show

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
immersion are steep ends and I'll show

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.080 
immersion are steep ends and I'll show
you<00:03:09.739> guys<00:03:09.859> a<00:03:09.980> little<00:03:10.189> bit<00:03:10.310> of<00:03:10.400> footage<00:03:10.760> what

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
you guys a little bit of footage what

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.240 
you guys a little bit of footage what
they<00:03:11.209> look<00:03:11.389> like<00:03:11.569> through<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:11.959> DVR<00:03:12.349> now<00:03:12.889> on

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
they look like through the DVR now on

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.879 
they look like through the DVR now on
this<00:03:13.519> particular<00:03:13.989> setup<00:03:14.989> I<00:03:15.290> don't<00:03:15.680> have<00:03:15.769> the

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:15.889 
this particular setup I don't have the

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:17.379 
this particular setup I don't have the
best<00:03:16.040> camera<00:03:16.280> however<00:03:16.819> the<00:03:17.030> image<00:03:17.239> quality

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
best camera however the image quality

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.449 
best camera however the image quality
was<00:03:17.780> really<00:03:17.810> good<00:03:18.319> what<00:03:18.799> I'm<00:03:18.889> gonna<00:03:18.980> do<00:03:19.159> is<00:03:19.310> go

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
was really good what I'm gonna do is go

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.170 
was really good what I'm gonna do is go
ahead<00:03:19.549> and<00:03:19.639> power<00:03:20.449> this<00:03:20.780> on<00:03:21.669> and<00:03:22.669> I'll<00:03:22.970> power

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
ahead and power this on and I'll power

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.150 
ahead and power this on and I'll power
on<00:03:23.480> my<00:03:23.720> goggles<00:03:25.329> I've<00:03:26.329> seen<00:03:26.569> a<00:03:26.599> little<00:03:26.780> bit<00:03:26.989> of

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
on my goggles I've seen a little bit of

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.530 
on my goggles I've seen a little bit of
flutter<00:03:28.160> and<00:03:28.340> that's<00:03:28.489> probably<00:03:28.940> because<00:03:29.239> of

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
flutter and that's probably because of

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.280 
flutter and that's probably because of
the<00:03:30.430> 2.4<00:03:31.430> gigahertz<00:03:31.930> I'm<00:03:32.930> sorry<00:03:33.139> that's

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
the 2.4 gigahertz I'm sorry that's

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.819 
the 2.4 gigahertz I'm sorry that's
probably<00:03:33.680> because<00:03:33.980> of<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.250> lighting<00:03:34.730> in<00:03:34.819> here

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
probably because of the lighting in here

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.849 
probably because of the lighting in here
so<00:03:36.829> let<00:03:37.040> me<00:03:37.099> go<00:03:37.190> ahead<00:03:37.280> and<00:03:37.400> get<00:03:37.669> the<00:03:38.859> Dominator

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
so let me go ahead and get the Dominator

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:41.589 
so let me go ahead and get the Dominator

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:42.819 
module the Dominator goggles on one
really<00:03:41.840> cool<00:03:41.989> thing<00:03:42.049> about<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.470> Dominator

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
really cool thing about the Dominator

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.349 
really cool thing about the Dominator
goggles<00:03:43.220> they've<00:03:43.549> kind<00:03:43.730> of<00:03:43.790> built-in<00:03:44.090> DVR

as you can see you can actually see the

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.550 
as you can see you can actually see the
recording<00:03:52.760> that<00:03:53.000> the<00:03:53.690> live<00:03:53.840> video<00:03:54.049> is<00:03:54.290> putting

recording that the live video is putting
out<00:03:54.709> and<00:03:55.010> like<00:03:55.430> I<00:03:55.519> said<00:03:55.579> this<00:03:55.819> camera<00:03:56.150> is<00:03:56.269> not

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.389 
out and like I said this camera is not

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:58.300 
out and like I said this camera is not
the<00:03:56.569> best<00:03:56.750> and<00:03:56.959> because<00:03:57.620> of<00:03:57.650> the<00:03:57.799> fluorescent

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
the best and because of the fluorescent

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.969 
the best and because of the fluorescent
lighting<00:03:58.459> in<00:03:58.669> here<00:03:58.699> it's<00:03:59.120> pulsating<00:03:59.979> alright

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:00.979 
lighting in here it's pulsating alright

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:03.159 
lighting in here it's pulsating alright

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:03.169 
I also did go ahead and test out that it

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:04.960 
I also did go ahead and test out that it
works<00:04:03.409> with<00:04:03.620> the<00:04:03.650> immersion<00:04:03.949> RC<00:04:04.340> 2.4

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970

500 milliwatts this version has been
discontinued<00:04:10.549> there's<00:04:10.729> a<00:04:10.790> newer<00:04:10.970> one<00:04:11.180> out

Pixum Seawolf I believe this is the same
as<00:04:22.430> the<00:04:22.520> TBS<00:04:22.970> 69<00:04:23.449> camera<00:04:23.779> really<00:04:24.469> good<00:04:24.620> camera

whatnot<00:04:59.180> but<00:04:59.360> there's<00:04:59.569> definitely<00:04:59.960> a<00:04:59.990> bunch

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:00.259 
whatnot but there's definitely a bunch

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:01.959 
whatnot but there's definitely a bunch
of<00:05:00.349> colors<00:05:00.590> you<00:05:00.740> can<00:05:00.889> check<00:05:01.069> out<00:05:01.219> and<00:05:01.520> you<00:05:01.819> can

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:01.969 
of colors you can check out and you can

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:04.149 
of colors you can check out and you can
see<00:05:02.180> how<00:05:02.419> well<00:05:02.659> the<00:05:02.870> 2.4<00:05:03.349> gigahertz<00:05:03.620> with<00:05:04.039> the

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
laser 2.4 gigahertz module so you may be

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.159 
laser 2.4 gigahertz module so you may be
asking<00:05:10.669> yourself<00:05:11.180> why<00:05:11.719> doesn't<00:05:11.990> everybody

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
asking yourself why doesn't everybody

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.290 
asking yourself why doesn't everybody
run<00:05:12.469> 2.4<00:05:13.159> or<00:05:13.430> what<00:05:13.699> are<00:05:13.789> the<00:05:13.879> advantages

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
run 2.4 or what are the advantages

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.869 
run 2.4 or what are the advantages
disadvantages<00:05:14.509> well<00:05:15.469> for<00:05:15.740> one<00:05:15.919> antenna<00:05:16.580> size

00:05:16.869 --> 00:05:16.879 
disadvantages well for one antenna size

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:18.760 
disadvantages well for one antenna size
as<00:05:17.090> you<00:05:17.210> can<00:05:17.360> see<00:05:17.509> this<00:05:17.659> is<00:05:17.840> a<00:05:17.870> 1.3<00:05:18.319> gigahertz

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
as you can see this is a 1.3 gigahertz

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.040 
as you can see this is a 1.3 gigahertz
pepperbox<00:05:19.310> versus<00:05:19.729> a<00:05:19.759> 2.4<00:05:20.389> gigahertz<00:05:20.599> buffer

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
pepperbox versus a 2.4 gigahertz buffer

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.600 
pepperbox versus a 2.4 gigahertz buffer
box<00:05:21.199> this<00:05:21.680> is<00:05:21.800> a<00:05:21.830> lot<00:05:21.949> more<00:05:21.979> manageable<00:05:22.580> and

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
box this is a lot more manageable and

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.089 
box this is a lot more manageable and
you<00:05:23.120> can<00:05:23.900> fit<00:05:24.110> in<00:05:24.259> the<00:05:24.560> back<00:05:24.710> of<00:05:24.860> the<00:05:24.919> ground

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:25.099 
you can fit in the back of the ground

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:27.040 
you can fit in the back of the ground
station<00:05:25.430> a<00:05:25.460> little<00:05:25.550> bit<00:05:25.759> easier<00:05:26.090> versus<00:05:26.870> this

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
station a little bit easier versus this

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.879 
station a little bit easier versus this
big<00:05:27.259> hunk<00:05:27.529> of<00:05:27.590> a<00:05:27.680> thing<00:05:29.319> also<00:05:30.319> when<00:05:30.620> it<00:05:30.710> comes

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
big hunk of a thing also when it comes

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:32.529 
big hunk of a thing also when it comes
to<00:05:31.009> the<00:05:31.099> CP<00:05:31.430> antennas<00:05:31.879> as<00:05:32.029> you<00:05:32.150> can<00:05:32.270> see<00:05:32.389> this

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:32.539 
to the CP antennas as you can see this

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:34.119 
to the CP antennas as you can see this
one<00:05:32.750> you<00:05:33.020> know<00:05:33.110> size<00:05:33.379> of<00:05:33.469> a<00:05:33.500> grapefruit<00:05:33.740> and

00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:34.129 
one you know size of a grapefruit and

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:35.559 
one you know size of a grapefruit and
then<00:05:34.520> you<00:05:34.580> got<00:05:34.699> this<00:05:34.879> one<00:05:35.089> a<00:05:35.270> little<00:05:35.419> bit

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:35.569 
then you got this one a little bit

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:37.510 
then you got this one a little bit
smaller<00:05:35.599> actually<00:05:36.529> quite<00:05:36.860> a<00:05:36.889> bit<00:05:37.039> smaller<00:05:37.279> so

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
smaller actually quite a bit smaller so

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.070 
smaller actually quite a bit smaller so
again<00:05:37.969> the<00:05:38.120> antenna<00:05:38.419> is<00:05:38.539> a<00:05:38.659> little<00:05:38.810> bit<00:05:38.930> more

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
again the antenna is a little bit more

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.369 
again the antenna is a little bit more
manageable<00:05:39.699> another<00:05:40.699> pro<00:05:41.000> would<00:05:41.270> be<00:05:41.419> you<00:05:42.229> can

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:42.379 
manageable another pro would be you can

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:43.659 
manageable another pro would be you can
fly<00:05:42.529> with<00:05:42.560> friends<00:05:43.069> that<00:05:43.129> are<00:05:43.250> flying<00:05:43.430> on<00:05:43.550> the

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
fly with friends that are flying on the

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:46.129 
1.3 or the 5.8 gigahertz channel if it's

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:48.969 
1.3 or the 5.8 gigahertz channel if it's
too<00:05:46.569> jammed<00:05:47.569> up<00:05:47.810> so<00:05:48.169> long<00:05:48.319> as<00:05:48.500> everybody's

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:48.979 
too jammed up so long as everybody's

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:53.290 
too jammed up so long as everybody's

using 433 or 70 2 megahertz UHF you know

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.140 
using 433 or 70 2 megahertz UHF you know
you<00:05:53.419> a<00:05:53.479> chapter<00:05:53.900> 72<00:05:54.229> megahertz<00:05:54.879> when<00:05:55.879> you<00:05:55.969> get

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
you a chapter 72 megahertz when you get

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.809 
you a chapter 72 megahertz when you get
into<00:05:56.300> 2.4<00:05:57.139> gigahertz<00:05:57.349> and<00:05:57.740> you<00:05:58.129> have<00:05:58.279> 2.4

00:05:58.809 --> 00:05:58.819 
into 2.4 gigahertz and you have 2.4

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:00.279 
into 2.4 gigahertz and you have 2.4
gigahertz<00:05:59.029> controlled<00:05:59.659> you're<00:05:59.960> gonna<00:06:00.050> get<00:06:00.229> a

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.289 
gigahertz controlled you're gonna get a

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:02.740 
gigahertz controlled you're gonna get a
shoddy<00:06:00.560> image<00:06:00.979> we<00:06:01.699> did<00:06:01.849> test<00:06:02.210> that<00:06:02.360> out<00:06:02.389> this

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:02.750 
shoddy image we did test that out this

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.929 
shoddy image we did test that out this
past<00:06:03.259> weekend<00:06:03.650> where<00:06:03.830> there's<00:06:04.520> a<00:06:04.610> couple<00:06:04.819> guys

00:06:04.929 --> 00:06:04.939 
past weekend where there's a couple guys

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:06.550 
past weekend where there's a couple guys
flying<00:06:05.180> 2.4<00:06:05.810> and<00:06:05.930> I<00:06:05.990> was<00:06:06.110> trying<00:06:06.289> to<00:06:06.349> use<00:06:06.439> the

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
flying 2.4 and I was trying to use the

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.800 
flying 2.4 and I was trying to use the
2.4<00:06:07.039> video<00:06:07.310> it<00:06:07.759> was<00:06:07.909> stomping<00:06:08.300> on<00:06:08.389> my<00:06:08.449> video

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
2.4 video it was stomping on my video

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.059 
2.4 video it was stomping on my video
and<00:06:08.960> I<00:06:09.020> wasn't<00:06:09.199> getting<00:06:09.379> very<00:06:09.650> good<00:06:09.860> range

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:10.069 
and I wasn't getting very good range

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:12.820 
and I wasn't getting very good range
however<00:06:10.969> when<00:06:11.330> we<00:06:11.419> did<00:06:11.569> pair<00:06:11.779> it<00:06:11.900> with<00:06:11.930> the<00:06:12.139> 433

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
however when we did pair it with the 433

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.610 
however when we did pair it with the 433
dragon<00:06:13.279> link<00:06:13.460> and<00:06:13.610> the<00:06:13.909> 2.4<00:06:14.620> excellent

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
dragon link and the 2.4 excellent

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.350 
dragon link and the 2.4 excellent
results<00:06:15.979> we<00:06:16.159> were<00:06:16.250> getting<00:06:16.550> no<00:06:16.909> video

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
results we were getting no video

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.189 
results we were getting no video
glitches<00:06:17.810> no<00:06:18.229> issues<00:06:18.770> no<00:06:18.919> interference<00:06:19.490> so

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:20.199 
glitches no issues no interference so

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:23.499 
glitches no issues no interference so
2.4<00:06:21.199> is<00:06:21.469> a<00:06:21.500> good<00:06:22.339> frequency<00:06:22.849> to<00:06:22.939> use<00:06:23.150> when<00:06:23.419> you

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:23.509 
2.4 is a good frequency to use when you

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:26.939 
2.4 is a good frequency to use when you
get<00:06:23.659> into<00:06:23.839> flying<00:06:24.710> with<00:06:24.889> multiple<00:06:25.310> people<00:06:25.750> and

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:26.949 
get into flying with multiple people and

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:29.559 
get into flying with multiple people and
also<00:06:27.949> the<00:06:28.339> antenna<00:06:28.639> management<00:06:29.180> is<00:06:29.300> a<00:06:29.330> lot

00:06:29.559 --> 00:06:29.569 
also the antenna management is a lot

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:32.110 
also the antenna management is a lot
easier<00:06:29.599> so<00:06:30.439> it's<00:06:31.370> a<00:06:31.400> couple<00:06:31.639> pros<00:06:31.789> and<00:06:31.969> cons

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
easier so it's a couple pros and cons

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.659 
easier so it's a couple pros and cons
I'll<00:06:32.360> continue<00:06:32.900> doing<00:06:33.050> testing<00:06:33.650> and<00:06:33.919> put<00:06:34.550> my

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:34.669 
I'll continue doing testing and put my

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:36.790 
I'll continue doing testing and put my
results<00:06:35.150> in<00:06:35.300> the<00:06:35.930> comments<00:06:36.409> below<00:06:36.500> but

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
results in the comments below but

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.379 
results in the comments below but
overall<00:06:37.099> I'm<00:06:37.339> very<00:06:37.370> happy<00:06:37.580> with<00:06:37.969> this<00:06:38.089> and<00:06:38.330> it

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:38.389 
overall I'm very happy with this and it

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:41.200 
overall I'm very happy with this and it
keeps<00:06:38.599> me<00:06:39.190> very<00:06:40.190> nice<00:06:40.399> compact<00:06:40.909> and

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
keeps me very nice compact and
