dry up too much I suppose like chicken
breast<00:03:13.400> but<00:03:14.360> we'll<00:03:14.630> go<00:03:14.720> a<00:03:14.750> little<00:03:14.870> bit<00:03:15.049> over<00:03:15.230> so

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
breast but we'll go a little bit over so

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.840 
breast but we'll go a little bit over so
we're<00:03:15.470> about<00:03:15.530> like<00:03:15.769> talk<00:03:16.010> about<00:03:16.040> 13<00:03:16.730> ounces

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.820 
we're about like talk about 13 ounces
it'll<00:03:17.510> probably<00:03:17.570> cook<00:03:17.959> it<00:03:18.080> yields<00:03:18.350> about<00:03:18.440> 12

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
it'll probably cook it yields about 12

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.710 
it'll probably cook it yields about 12
ounces<00:03:18.950> so<00:03:19.340> that's<00:03:19.519> one<00:03:20.060> thing<00:03:20.299> that<00:03:20.360> I<00:03:20.540> do<00:03:20.600> is

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
ounces so that's one thing that I do is

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.890 
ounces so that's one thing that I do is
I<00:03:20.930> always<00:03:21.200> measure<00:03:21.500> my<00:03:21.680> protein<00:03:22.299> cooked<00:03:23.299> so<00:03:23.810> if

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
I always measure my protein cooked so if

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.780 
I always measure my protein cooked so if
I'm<00:03:24.080> just<00:03:24.290> doing<00:03:24.500> a<00:03:24.590> fresh<00:03:24.830> meal<00:03:25.070> straight<00:03:25.760> up

I'm just doing a fresh meal straight up

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.430 
I'm just doing a fresh meal straight up
I'll<00:03:26.060> just<00:03:26.269> do<00:03:26.360> a<00:03:26.390> little<00:03:26.570> bit<00:03:26.810> more<00:03:27.019> and<00:03:27.230> then

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
I'll just do a little bit more and then

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.170 
I'll just do a little bit more and then
I'll<00:03:27.530> read<00:03:27.739> measure<00:03:27.920> it<00:03:28.040> after<00:03:28.459> only<00:03:29.060> usually

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
I'll read measure it after only usually

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.330 
I'll read measure it after only usually
when<00:03:29.420> dieting<00:03:29.810> and<00:03:29.959> just<00:03:30.260> to<00:03:30.380> make<00:03:30.709> sure<00:03:30.739> be

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
when dieting and just to make sure be

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.340 
when dieting and just to make sure be
precise<00:03:31.760> so<00:03:31.970> we<00:03:32.060> got<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.690> steak<00:03:32.930> all<00:03:33.110> cooked

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.780 
precise so we got the steak all cooked
up<00:03:33.530> 12<00:03:34.160> ounces<00:03:34.959> normally<00:03:35.959> I<00:03:36.019> would<00:03:36.140> grill<00:03:36.380> this

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
up 12 ounces normally I would grill this
