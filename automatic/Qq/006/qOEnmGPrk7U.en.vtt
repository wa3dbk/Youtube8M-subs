00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
guy not to mention I was like two kills

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.890 
guy not to mention I was like two kills
off<00:01:24.509> me

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
off me

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.570 
off me
my<00:01:25.049> Kem<00:01:25.259> strike<00:01:25.380> thing<00:01:25.740> there<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.430> would

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
my Kem strike thing there so that would

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.130 
my Kem strike thing there so that would
have<00:01:26.670> sucked<00:01:27.030> anyways<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.630> helicopter<00:01:28.020> did

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
have sucked anyways the helicopter did

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.510 
have sucked anyways the helicopter did
okay<00:01:28.470> it's<00:01:28.680> not<00:01:28.829> really<00:01:28.979> good<00:01:29.100> on<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.310> map

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
okay it's not really good on this map

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.859 
okay it's not really good on this map
there's<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.729> lot<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.030> hide<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.360> but<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.600> mean<00:01:30.720> it

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
there's a lot to hide it but I mean it

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.120 
there's a lot to hide it but I mean it
was<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.110> think<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.470> helicopter<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.950> nine

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
was I think the helicopter is a nine

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.370 
was I think the helicopter is a nine
kill<00:01:32.430> streak<00:01:32.640> or<00:01:32.850> at<00:01:33.329> least<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.840> equivalent

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
kill streak or at least the equivalent

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.030 
kill streak or at least the equivalent
to<00:01:34.470> nine<00:01:34.590> go<00:01:34.680> straight

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
to nine go straight

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.499 
to nine go straight
I<00:01:35.070> think<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.520> has<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.670> same<00:01:35.880> system<00:01:36.240> as<00:01:36.329> black

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
I think it has the same system as black

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.240 
I think it has the same system as black
ops<00:01:36.689> 2<00:01:36.869> whereas<00:01:37.020> if<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.320> like<00:01:37.470> cap<00:01:37.710> flags<00:01:38.009> and

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
ops 2 whereas if you like cap flags and

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.100 
ops 2 whereas if you like cap flags and
stuff<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.909> also<00:01:39.150> goes<00:01:39.270> towards<00:01:39.450> your<00:01:39.900> score

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
stuff that also goes towards your score

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.090 
stuff that also goes towards your score
streak<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:40.500> not<00:01:40.560> kill<00:01:40.770> streaks<00:01:40.979> and

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
streak so it's not kill streaks and

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.889 
streak so it's not kill streaks and
score<00:01:41.280> streaks<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.610> think<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.119> don't<00:01:42.780> quote

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
score streaks I think that don't quote

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.270 
score streaks I think that don't quote
me<00:01:43.020> on<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.140> that's<00:01:43.470> just<00:01:43.590> what<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.770> think

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
me on that that's just what I think

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.370 
me on that that's just what I think
anyways<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.060> yeah<00:01:45.329> I'm<00:01:45.450> just<00:01:45.509> trying<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.899> get<00:01:46.320> a

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
anyways so yeah I'm just trying to get a

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.660 
anyways so yeah I'm just trying to get a
feel<00:01:46.590> for<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.860> spawns<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.369> game<00:01:47.520> I'm

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
feel for the spawns in this game I'm

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.010 
feel for the spawns in this game I'm

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
you're either going to try to spawn

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.410 
you're either going to try to spawn
trout<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.829> get<00:01:53.280> near<00:01:53.460> their<00:01:53.610> spawn<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.210> kill

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
trout and get near their spawn and kill

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.399 
trout and get near their spawn and kill
them<00:01:54.540> when<00:01:54.659> they<00:01:54.750> come<00:01:54.899> out<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.049> their<00:01:55.170> spawn

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
them when they come out of their spawn

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.440 
them when they come out of their spawn
like<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.920> spawn<00:01:56.189> trap<00:01:56.430> or<00:01:56.790> you're<00:01:57.149> just<00:01:57.180> get

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450

what's going on right now like there are
a<00:02:07.170> few<00:02:07.320> maps<00:02:07.560> in<00:02:07.680> this<00:02:07.799> game<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.069> I

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
a few maps in this game that I

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.999 
a few maps in this game that I
cannot<00:02:08.819> play<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.780> absolutely<00:02:10.379> ridiculous

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
cannot play it is absolutely ridiculous

cannot play it is absolutely ridiculous
I<00:02:11.250> have<00:02:11.370> no<00:02:11.519> idea<00:02:11.790> why<00:02:11.909> they<00:02:12.060> did<00:02:12.209> this

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
I have no idea why they did this

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.970 
I have no idea why they did this
obviously<00:02:12.900> in<00:02:13.319> case<00:02:13.470> you<00:02:13.560> guys<00:02:13.650> didn't<00:02:13.950> know

obviously in case you guys didn't know

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.380 
obviously in case you guys didn't know
when<00:02:14.159> the<00:02:14.220> Xbox<00:02:14.370> one<00:02:14.700> comes<00:02:14.909> out<00:02:15.120> they're

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.729 
when the Xbox one comes out they're
gonna<00:02:15.480> start<00:02:15.720> they're<00:02:16.379> gonna<00:02:16.470> implement

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
gonna start they're gonna implement

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.979 
gonna start they're gonna implement
groundwork<00:02:17.459> so<00:02:17.519> it's<00:02:17.730> me<00:02:17.790> 99<00:02:17.909> so<00:02:18.750> max<00:02:18.900> will

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
groundwork so it's me 99 so max will

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.119 
groundwork so it's me 99 so max will
feel<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.349> lot<00:02:19.470> better<00:02:19.650> there'll<00:02:19.920> be<00:02:19.950> more

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
feel it a lot better there'll be more

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.649 
feel it a lot better there'll be more
people<00:02:20.159> won't<00:02:20.670> be<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:20.940> spacious

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
people won't be so spacious

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:22.850 
people won't be so spacious
you'll<00:02:21.870> be<00:02:21.989> running<00:02:22.140> around<00:02:22.349> for<00:02:22.620> so<00:02:22.709> long

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
you'll be running around for so long

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.839 
you'll be running around for so long
without<00:02:23.040> finding<00:02:23.340> anybody<00:02:23.489> which<00:02:23.700> would<00:02:23.790> be

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
without finding anybody which would be

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.000 
without finding anybody which would be
great<00:02:23.970> but<00:02:24.480> still<00:02:24.750> it's<00:02:24.959> like<00:02:25.110> even<00:02:25.290> 99<00:02:25.829> these

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
great but still it's like even 99 these
