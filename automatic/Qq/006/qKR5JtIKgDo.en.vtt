 time and I look forward to it now 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.989
 you realize nothing special with it 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.400

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.680

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.340
 I greatly appreciate what you normally do 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.570

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.470

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.640
 taken harmful and I had given 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.840
 just a moment 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.519
 i think i'm going for friday morning or 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.590

 you know what i watched on saturday morning 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.150
 So basically you have to 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.209
 Friday evening 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.739
 10 12 o'clock we could have a place and 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.120
 like this video 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.680
 and then you look okay you deserve 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.080
 to win a million minutes popped up 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.200
 consult keep you can play the pc 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.849
 you can play the xbox on the playstation 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.049

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.180
 all not out in case you 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.849
 that has to think what just has to do is 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.010
 leave a like behind you subscribe that 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.510

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.859
 for example, want to win or for that and 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.209
 that reason I am not really going to succeed 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.010
 the plus the reason win 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.170
 because that is a subjective something 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.640
 stepping things that I think is the best 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.950
 just a nice comment captivates me 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.870
 actually no more commitment and yawning 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.400
 just watch what you say 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.450

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.220
