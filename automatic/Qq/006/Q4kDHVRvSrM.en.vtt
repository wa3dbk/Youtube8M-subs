00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
of times we don't choose those things

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.170 
of times we don't choose those things
they<00:02:28.810> that<00:02:29.810> could<00:02:29.960> be<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:31.070> death<00:02:31.280> of<00:02:31.490> someone

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
close it could be the exposure of an

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.870 
close it could be the exposure of an
addiction<00:02:36.740> it<00:02:37.040> could<00:02:37.190> be<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.460> loss<00:02:37.640> of<00:02:37.790> a

business<00:02:38.210> it<00:02:38.390> could<00:02:38.540> be<00:02:38.720> there's<00:02:39.140> just<00:02:39.350> many

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
business it could be there's just many

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.710 
business it could be there's just many
many<00:02:40.130> things<00:02:40.430> that<00:02:40.820> will<00:02:41.300> bring<00:02:41.420> us<00:02:41.570> to<00:02:41.600> the

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
many things that will bring us to the

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.140 
many things that will bring us to the
place<00:02:41.900> where<00:02:42.230> we<00:02:42.350> have<00:02:42.470> to<00:02:42.500> make<00:02:42.830> choices<00:02:43.580> and

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
place where we have to make choices and

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.810 
place where we have to make choices and
watch<00:02:45.080> them<00:02:45.410> ripple<00:02:45.770> out<00:02:45.860> and<00:02:46.220> I<00:02:46.430> think<00:02:46.490> that's

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
watch them ripple out and I think that's

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.120 
watch them ripple out and I think that's
the<00:02:47.120> metaphor<00:02:47.330> of<00:02:47.540> crossroads<00:02:48.170> we<00:02:48.770> get<00:02:48.980> to

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
the metaphor of crossroads we get to

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.990 
the metaphor of crossroads we get to
watch<00:02:49.340> inside<00:02:50.000> one<00:02:50.990> person's<00:02:51.530> soul<00:02:52.040> the

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
watch inside one person's soul the

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.930 
watch inside one person's soul the
impact<00:02:53.570> of<00:02:53.780> having<00:02:53.959> to<00:02:54.260> make<00:02:54.459> or<00:02:55.459> the

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
impact of having to make or the

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.700 
impact of having to make or the
invitation<00:02:56.810> in<00:02:57.020> two<00:02:57.700> choices
