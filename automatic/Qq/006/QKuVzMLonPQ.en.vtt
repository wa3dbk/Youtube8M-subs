00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.540
 welcome again wild android today 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.240
 let's see the famous game of 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.210
 turtles girls according what happens 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.490
 the turtles to the race are translated 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.170
 so say it then you pass that are the 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.470
 most modern ninja turtles of the 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.930
 Modern drawings are not from the ancients 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.460
 but good that they did not agree with 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.070
 leave in the links in the comments 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.600
 so you can download it let's see 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.600
 a bit like how to hit 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.960
 this starts as if it were a store 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.790
 agreement and we can go buying at 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.180
 turtles at first let us buy 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.830
 one I bought good I bought the first one 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.200
 he left me because as he was also a 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.570
 little to prove where to meet leonardo 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.250
 and nothing we can also buy the series 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.930
 of objects to get better now let's go 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.690
 to see a little bit about what the game is but 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.640
 well we will see we will understand a bit of 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.190
 what is this the game is a little bit 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.260
 similar to a sky safari combined with 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.369
 a ramÃ³n temple is what I do not like 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.680
 because I was expecting one more game 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.510
 normalito but good let's see what 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.550
 you will see that it is not bad 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.370
 to hang out after is the typical 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.230
 Android game to spend a little the 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.130
 we'll see a little bit the 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.130
 functioning 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.010
 to us that we do as 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.659
 tohono we control the movement only the 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.880
 jump then we have 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.860
 get these little green balls that we 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.799
 they allow us to stay longer and we have to 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.509
 kill the enemies so that we 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.119
 taking good care of the screen to 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.630
 get the coins we need 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.820
 for 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.880
 is to unlock things and follow 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.380
 advancing in the way is simply 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.670
 touching the screen when it appears 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.649
 an enemy what we do is touch two 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.930
 times the same as we do to jump 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.770
 twice to the imagination there not this one 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.090
 has been very there but good 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.000
 I would have preferred 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:12.830
 move with a touch 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.830
 but for not much happens 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.340
 Nor is it just bad good 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.460
 Well, that's going to adapt a bit and now 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.380
 is 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.440
 very well 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.660
 in the game we do not get lost when the 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.520
 green bar reaches zero 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.950
 and that happens when we are normally given 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.680
 quite this what is 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.480
 all right 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.140
 for what we have apart from this has 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.579
 two parts I 've only seen that the 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.140
 first part is when we 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:44.140
 we drive we go by the 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.359
 how bad start now we will use this 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.370
 for us on the rooftops and when 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:54.299
 we go in the car is worth when we go here 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.950
 we can change we push the car 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.750
 we have to dodge the obstacles that 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.120
 they are appearing to us at the same time 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.469
 we got the green balls the 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.180
 moment we do not get the balls 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:05.989
 greens is when we are killing ourselves 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.989
 like now 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.830
 he's going to kill us but he's about to die 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.930
 that I have very fair 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.630
 and when we want to continue we can go 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:21.490
 using the balls we are getting 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.890
 but every time we have to use 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.810
 so then that's a little bit 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.430
 I'm watching to pass the time is not 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.260
 bad but the truth is that for what it is 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.020
 and for what measures the game could have 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.180
 It has been much better 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.950
 different activated and once 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.080
 we finish with this phase what we do is 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.080
 go back to the rooftops 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.280
 every time evidently the difficulty goes 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.090
 increasing but not at all of the 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.730
 world 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.860
 It is a disparate action 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.030
 when the enemy appears simply 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.030
 we press 4 side and you're done 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:04.750
 and that's when the day ends both 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.630
 once we've reached the end or by 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.370
 the power what we do our times 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.319
 enter again on the rooftops we have 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.530
 advanced because we do not repeat the 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.600
 Roof theme 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:20.670
 because it's different I want to say here 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:23.130
 we have the time turtle yes 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.320
 that appears to us enemies and we have 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.070
 to click to get courses 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.140
 again we have done too well 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.920
 that's the goal is to beat the biggest 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:37.100
 number of possible enemies 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:40.040
 to get coins something interesting 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.840
 in this game are the coins today 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.690
 we can also a series of movements 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.720
 that we can walk with the posters 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.670
 and good things and if we fall 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.980
 we automatically lose logically 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.979
 this as it goes a little bolero because we 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.719
 we are also going 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:58.549
 the ideal is to climb the more better it is 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:01.879
 try to climb because if we fall 

00:04:58.549 --> 00:05:04.639
 do not kill him all at once is a roll of 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:06.619
 everything I say this we follow others and 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.809
 coins and characters and probably 

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:11.419
 then we can unlock maybe new 

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:14.360
 levels that is what interests us but 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:16.569
 that the game is not that it has too much 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.569
 difficulty 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:28.979
 up and up the perfect roofs 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.360
 posts in play in the distance the links 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:34.039
 in the comments so you can 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:38.149
 download it and nothing 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:38.149
 Greetings and until next time
