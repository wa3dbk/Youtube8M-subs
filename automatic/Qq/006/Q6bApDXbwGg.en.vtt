I'm<00:00:07.620> going<00:00:07.859> to<00:00:07.919> test<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.370> USB<00:00:08.820> killer<00:00:09.090> against

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
I'm going to test the USB killer against

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:21.050 
I'm going to test the USB killer against
this<00:00:10.080> Dell<00:00:18.859> the<00:00:19.859> USB<00:00:20.189> killer<00:00:20.460> was<00:00:20.670> introduced

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
this Dell the USB killer was introduced

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.000 
this Dell the USB killer was introduced
earlier<00:00:21.300> this<00:00:21.630> year<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.869> think<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.260> February<00:00:22.800> on

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
earlier this year I think in February on

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.720 
earlier this year I think in February on
the<00:00:23.039> 25th<00:00:23.789> 2015<00:00:24.630> as<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.590> proof<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:25.980> concept<00:00:26.039> for

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
the 25th 2015 as a proof of concept for

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.400 
the 25th 2015 as a proof of concept for
a<00:00:26.760> USB<00:00:27.090> device<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.810> could<00:00:28.019> look<00:00:28.199> like<00:00:28.260> a

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
a USB device that could look like a

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.070 
a USB device that could look like a
standard<00:00:28.890> USB<00:00:29.390> flash<00:00:30.390> drive<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.050> can

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
standard USB flash drive that you can

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.900 
standard USB flash drive that you can
plug<00:00:31.349> into<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.679> computer<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.610> could

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
plug into a computer that could

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.940 
plug into a computer that could
effectively<00:00:33.270> fry<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:34.020> computer<00:00:34.500> there's

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
effectively fry that computer there's

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.350 
effectively fry that computer there's
been<00:00:35.130> some<00:00:35.280> skepticism<00:00:35.610> as<00:00:36.000> whether<00:00:36.210> or<00:00:36.300> not

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
been some skepticism as whether or not

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.350 
been some skepticism as whether or not
it<00:00:36.510> could<00:00:36.630> actually<00:00:36.780> cause<00:00:37.110> real<00:00:37.410> damage<00:00:38.000> so<00:00:39.000> I

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
it could actually cause real damage so I

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.720 
it could actually cause real damage so I
decided<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.440> recreate<00:00:40.860> his<00:00:41.070> work<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.520> put<00:00:41.640> it

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
decided to recreate his work and put it

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.290 
decided to recreate his work and put it
to<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.910> test

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
to the test

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.260 
to the test
albeit<00:00:42.930> not<00:00:43.140> as<00:00:43.290> beautiful<00:00:43.469> as<00:00:43.829> his<00:00:44.040> was<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.610> I

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
albeit not as beautiful as his was and I

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.279 
albeit not as beautiful as his was and I
think<00:00:45.510> with<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.750> tests<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.050> I've<00:00:46.200> been

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
think with the tests that I've been

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.740 
think with the tests that I've been
running<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.829> should<00:00:47.280> still<00:00:47.550> work<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:48.539> take<00:00:48.719> a

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
running it should still work to take a

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.240 
running it should still work to take a
few<00:00:48.989> precautions<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.680> am<00:00:49.800> going<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.010> do<00:00:50.129> this

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
few precautions I am going to do this

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.740 
few precautions I am going to do this
outside<00:00:50.460> because<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.090> don't<00:00:51.239> want<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.510> smell

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
outside because I don't want the smell

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.930 
outside because I don't want the smell
of<00:00:51.960> burning<00:00:52.199> wires<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.739> my<00:00:52.829> house<00:00:53.010> if<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.730> does

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
of burning wires in my house if it does

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.139 
of burning wires in my house if it does
get<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.390> point<00:00:54.829> but<00:00:55.829> after<00:00:56.640> this<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:56.969> will

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
get to that point but after this I will

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.819 
get to that point but after this I will
do<00:00:57.300> another<00:00:57.539> video<00:00:57.719> showing<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.289> aftermath

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
do another video showing the aftermath

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.560 
do another video showing the aftermath
as<00:00:59.160> far<00:00:59.399> as<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.760> know<00:00:59.850> what<00:01:00.030> components<00:01:00.510> were

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
as far as you know what components were

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.779 
as far as you know what components were
fried<00:01:00.870> I'm<00:01:01.620> going<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.800> test<00:01:02.039> each<00:01:02.219> component

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
fried I'm going to test each component

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.030 
fried I'm going to test each component
see<00:01:02.969> which<00:01:03.149> ones<00:01:03.420> were<00:01:03.600> fried<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.080> kind<00:01:04.949> of

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
see which ones were fried and kind of

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.490 
see which ones were fried and kind of
run<00:01:05.189> through<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.760> damage<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.210> was<00:01:06.390> done<00:01:06.500> so

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
run through the damage that was done so

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:32.850 
run through the damage that was done so
enjoy<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.689> let's<00:01:09.689> see<00:01:09.840> if<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.049> works

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:58.240 

let's<00:01:33.860> lighting<00:01:34.250> up<00:01:41.860> like<00:01:42.860> Elijah<00:01:55.960> smoke<00:01:57.250> on

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
let's lighting up like Elijah smoke on

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.770 
let's lighting up like Elijah smoke on
one<00:01:58.640> set<00:01:59.270> fire

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
one set fire

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:20.250 
one set fire
holy<00:02:00.409> Sh

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.120 

it's<00:02:21.260> on<00:02:21.440> fire

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
it's on fire

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:35.740 
it's on fire
I<00:02:22.160> think<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.819> power<00:02:23.060> supply<00:02:23.420> is<00:02:23.480> on<00:02:23.600> fire<00:02:34.750> well

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
I think the power supply is on fire well

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.350 
I think the power supply is on fire well
apparently<00:02:36.170> you<00:02:36.380> can<00:02:36.650> set<00:02:37.370> a<00:02:37.400> computer<00:02:38.269> on

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
apparently you can set a computer on

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.770 
apparently you can set a computer on
fire<00:02:38.630> with<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:38.989> killer<00:02:39.200> USB<00:02:40.750> although<00:02:41.750> I

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
fire with the killer USB although I

00:02:41.780 --> 00:03:00.820 
fire with the killer USB although I
don't<00:02:41.959> recommend<00:02:42.440> it<00:02:58.630> so<00:02:59.630> right<00:02:59.750> now<00:02:59.989> it<00:03:00.620> looks

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
don't recommend it so right now it looks

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.680 
don't recommend it so right now it looks
like<00:03:02.830> looks<00:03:03.830> like<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.130> power<00:03:04.370> supply<00:03:04.880> I<00:03:05.269> think

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
like looks like the power supply I think

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.350 
like looks like the power supply I think
it's<00:03:05.780> not<00:03:05.959> the<00:03:06.080> power<00:03:06.290> supplies<00:03:06.709> on<00:03:06.980> fire

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
it's not the power supplies on fire

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.569 
it's not the power supplies on fire
nothing<00:03:08.360> else<00:03:08.540> is<00:03:12.130> everything<00:03:13.130> looks<00:03:13.280> black

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
nothing else is everything looks black

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.059 
nothing else is everything looks black
but

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
but

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:29.100 
but
looks<00:03:16.030> like<00:03:16.180> the<00:03:16.269> power<00:03:16.450> supply's<00:03:16.989> on<00:03:17.230> fire

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:39.900 

all<00:03:29.650> right<00:03:29.830> let's<00:03:30.100> take<00:03:30.220> a<00:03:30.280> look<00:03:30.340> inside<00:03:38.910> holy

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.160 
all right let's take a look inside holy

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:49.170 

oh<00:03:41.700> it's<00:03:42.700> pride<00:03:43.150> oh<00:03:45.300> wow<00:03:46.300> it's<00:03:46.660> hot<00:03:46.840> too
