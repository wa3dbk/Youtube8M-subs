00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.340 
was a study that showed that there was
about<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.610> two<00:01:35.820> point<00:01:36.060> five<00:01:36.210> percent<00:01:36.600> increase

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
about a two point five percent increase

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.870 
about a two point five percent increase
in<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.770> percentage<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.310> black<00:01:38.490> women<00:01:38.700> who

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
in the percentage of black women who

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.149 
in the percentage of black women who
didn't<00:01:39.270> get<00:01:39.329> married<00:01:39.570> for<00:01:40.200> every<00:01:40.350> one<00:01:40.680> percent

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
didn't get married for every one percent

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.580 
didn't get married for every one percent
increase<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:42.090> incarceration<00:01:42.689> rate<00:01:42.840> well

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
increase in the incarceration rate well

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.319 
increase in the incarceration rate well
guess<00:01:43.799> what<00:01:43.979> if<00:01:44.220> you're<00:01:44.430> locking<00:01:44.729> all<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.060> men

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
guess what if you're locking all the men

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.090 
guess what if you're locking all the men
up<00:01:45.540> look<00:01:45.930> like<00:01:46.140> we<00:01:46.320> did<00:01:46.500> during<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.890> war<00:01:47.040> on

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
up look like we did during the war on

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.149 
up look like we did during the war on
drugs<00:01:47.250> but<00:01:47.909> for<00:01:48.149> about<00:01:48.270> 20<00:01:48.600> 20<00:01:48.990> 30<00:01:49.170> years<00:01:49.409> well

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
drugs but for about 20 20 30 years well

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.889 
drugs but for about 20 20 30 years well
you're<00:01:50.790> not<00:01:50.909> going<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.119> have<00:01:51.240> as<00:01:51.360> many<00:01:51.509> men<00:01:51.780> to

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
you're not going to have as many men to

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.830 
you're not going to have as many men to
marry<00:01:52.079> you're<00:01:52.350> not<00:01:52.470> going<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.680> have<00:01:52.860> as<00:01:53.840> much

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
marry you're not going to have as much

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.350 
marry you're not going to have as much
of<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.710> know<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:55.979> as<00:01:56.490> many<00:01:56.670> families<00:01:57.180> being

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
of you know that as many families being

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.060 
of you know that as many families being
built<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.810> families<00:01:58.229> being<00:01:58.409> maintained<00:01:58.860> as

can't get opportunities well then you

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.580 
can't get opportunities well then you
guess<00:02:18.760> what<00:02:18.940> you're<00:02:19.120> destroying<00:02:19.450> families<00:02:19.750> so

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
guess what you're destroying families so

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.290 
guess what you're destroying families so
you<00:02:20.650> can't<00:02:20.920> destroy<00:02:21.250> families<00:02:21.550> on<00:02:22.000> one<00:02:22.270> hand

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
you can't destroy families on one hand

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.260 
you can't destroy families on one hand
and<00:02:22.750> then<00:02:23.320> get<00:02:23.980> mad<00:02:24.190> because<00:02:24.520> families<00:02:25.120> don't

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
and then get mad because families don't

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.580 
and then get mad because families don't
exist<00:02:25.660> on<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.900> other<00:02:26.050> hand<00:02:26.200> that<00:02:26.350> doesn't

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
exist on the other hand that doesn't

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.170 
exist on the other hand that doesn't
make<00:02:26.650> any<00:02:26.830> sense<00:02:27.040> why<00:02:27.730> would<00:02:27.760> I<00:02:27.970> destroy

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
make any sense why would I destroy

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.730 
make any sense why would I destroy
something<00:02:28.630> and<00:02:28.870> then<00:02:28.990> get<00:02:29.260> mad<00:02:29.440> at<00:02:29.620> you

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
something and then get mad at you

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.740 
something and then get mad at you
because<00:02:29.920> that<00:02:30.310> thing<00:02:30.610> I<00:02:30.940> destroyed<00:02:31.360> doesn't

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
because that thing I destroyed doesn't

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.100 
because that thing I destroyed doesn't
exist<00:02:32.020> anymore<00:02:32.260> so<00:02:32.860> I<00:02:33.190> think<00:02:33.340> that<00:02:33.850> if<00:02:34.110> someone

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
exist anymore so I think that if someone

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.230 
exist anymore so I think that if someone
like<00:02:35.320> Ben<00:02:35.500> Carson<00:02:35.560> wants<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.370> talk<00:02:36.550> about<00:02:36.730> the
