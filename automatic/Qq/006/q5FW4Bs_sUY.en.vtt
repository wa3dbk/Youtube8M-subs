paper is best for this and a metal bar
so<00:00:23.099> that<00:00:23.130> we<00:00:23.610> can<00:00:23.820> adjust<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.780> size<00:00:25.020> and<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
so that we can adjust the size and the

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.420 
so that we can adjust the size and the
thickness<00:00:26.780> the<00:00:27.780> filling<00:00:28.199> will<00:00:28.500> be<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.980> praline

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
praline a may not be too cold best is

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.439 
praline a may not be too cold best is
the<00:00:55.350> praline<00:00:55.620> e<00:00:55.799> on<00:00:55.979> room<00:00:56.219> temperature<00:00:59.030> so<00:01:00.030> put

the praline e on room temperature so put

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:10.960 
the praline e on room temperature so put
this<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.079> frame

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970

will be the bottom that we can easily

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.490 
will be the bottom that we can easily
dip<00:02:47.800> them<00:02:48.100> in<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:49.030> chocolate<00:02:49.200> otherwise<00:02:50.200> the

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.860 

pay<00:03:04.900> attention<00:03:05.530> that<00:03:05.739> if<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.700> slab<00:03:06.970> is<00:03:07.239> too

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
pay attention that if the slab is too

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.890 
pay attention that if the slab is too
cold<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:09.010> chocolate<00:03:09.489> will<00:03:09.730> set<00:03:10.060> very<00:03:10.570> quick

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
cold the chocolate will set very quick

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.740 
cold the chocolate will set very quick
so<00:03:11.700> best<00:03:12.700> is<00:03:13.170> bring<00:03:14.170> it<00:03:14.320> first<00:03:14.620> on<00:03:14.950> a<00:03:15.750> room

set now now we're going to cut it take

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:39.630 
set now now we're going to cut it take
another<00:03:32.590> plate<00:03:34.530> turn<00:03:35.530> upside<00:03:36.190> down<00:03:38.459> pull<00:03:39.459> off

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
another plate turn upside down pull off

the paper and as you see the chocolate
is<00:03:45.070> hard<00:03:45.400> so<00:03:45.670> it<00:03:45.910> moves<00:03:46.269> easily<00:03:46.630> from<00:03:47.290> the

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
is hard so it moves easily from the

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.340 
is hard so it moves easily from the
plate<00:03:47.650> so<00:03:48.010> we<00:03:48.220> can<00:03:48.459> slide<00:03:48.760> it<00:03:48.910> off<00:03:49.090> and<00:03:49.320> put<00:03:50.320> it

now we have nice little squares that are

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:57.550 
now we have nice little squares that are
ready<00:04:53.870> to<00:04:54.410> dip<00:04:54.830> if<00:04:55.220> you<00:04:56.060> don't<00:04:56.300> have<00:04:56.630> a<00:04:57.139> guitar

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
ready to dip if you don't have a guitar

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.120 
ready to dip if you don't have a guitar
which<00:04:58.370> is<00:04:58.400> of<00:04:58.820> course<00:04:59.030> expensive<00:04:59.810> you<00:05:00.770> can<00:05:00.800> use

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
which is of course expensive you can use

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.029 
which is of course expensive you can use
simply<00:05:01.550> a<00:05:01.580> knife<00:05:01.990> but<00:05:02.990> then<00:05:03.199> you<00:05:03.440> need<00:05:03.650> to<00:05:03.800> cut

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
simply a knife but then you need to cut

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:07.240 
simply a knife but then you need to cut
of<00:05:04.280> course<00:05:04.490> very<00:05:05.479> well<00:05:05.600> and<00:05:06.050> exactly<00:05:06.889> the

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
of course very well and exactly the

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.360 
of course very well and exactly the
right<00:05:07.610> size<00:05:08.030> so<00:05:08.780> all<00:05:09.470> what<00:05:09.740> we<00:05:09.889> need<00:05:09.919> is<00:05:10.310> a

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
right size so all what we need is a

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.770 
right size so all what we need is a
dipping<00:05:11.060> fork<00:05:11.360> a<00:05:11.889> plate<00:05:12.889> a<00:05:13.220> second<00:05:14.150> plate<00:05:14.360> with

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
dipping fork a plate a second plate with

a<00:05:15.050> paper<00:05:15.199> and<00:05:15.800> something<00:05:16.669> heavy<00:05:17.120> for<00:05:18.020> example

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
a paper and something heavy for example

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.700 
a paper and something heavy for example
a<00:05:18.500> knife<00:05:18.740> that<00:05:19.250> the<00:05:19.550> paper<00:05:19.820> is<00:05:20.150> not<00:05:20.210> moving<00:05:21.050> by

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
a knife that the paper is not moving by

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:27.129 
a knife that the paper is not moving by
the<00:05:22.130> posing<00:05:22.610> the<00:05:22.880> first<00:05:23.289> Bond<00:05:24.289> balls<00:05:24.820> so<00:05:26.139> if

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:27.139

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:37.789 
left hand the bonbons to dip so that you

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:43.750 
left hand the bonbons to dip so that you
can<00:05:38.000> work<00:05:38.419> in<00:05:38.720> a<00:05:39.260> logic<00:05:39.830> order<00:05:40.419> so<00:05:41.419> then<00:05:42.760> put

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
can work in a logic order so then put

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.939 
can work in a logic order so then put
the<00:05:44.240> bomb<00:05:44.419> ball<00:05:44.690> dip<00:05:45.620> it<00:05:46.270> just<00:05:47.770> until<00:05:48.770> the

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:48.949 
the bomb ball dip it just until the

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:52.089 
the bomb ball dip it just until the
surface<00:05:49.240> cover<00:05:50.240> it<00:05:50.449> with<00:05:50.960> a<00:05:51.229> thin<00:05:51.620> layer<00:05:51.830> of

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:52.099 
surface cover it with a thin layer of

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:57.210 
surface cover it with a thin layer of
chocolate<00:05:53.470> remove<00:05:54.470> it<00:05:54.650> and<00:05:55.389> dip<00:05:56.389> on<00:05:56.720> the

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
chocolate remove it and dip on the

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.490 
chocolate remove it and dip on the
surface<00:05:58.220> to<00:05:58.699> remove<00:05:58.970> the<00:05:59.720> excess<00:06:00.229> of

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
surface to remove the excess of

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:09.129 
surface to remove the excess of
chocolate<00:06:03.789> so<00:06:04.789> again<00:06:06.370> take<00:06:07.370> a<00:06:07.400> bowl<00:06:07.639> ball<00:06:08.139> dip

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:09.139 
chocolate so again take a bowl ball dip

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:12.159 
chocolate so again take a bowl ball dip
it<00:06:09.320> until<00:06:09.979> the<00:06:10.130> surface<00:06:10.539> cover<00:06:11.539> it<00:06:11.750> with<00:06:12.139> a

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:12.169 
it until the surface cover it with a

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:17.140 
it until the surface cover it with a
thin<00:06:12.470> layer<00:06:14.289> remove<00:06:15.289> it<00:06:15.409> and<00:06:15.650> dip<00:06:16.639> on<00:06:16.880> the

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150 
thin layer remove it and dip on the

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.100 
thin layer remove it and dip on the
surface<00:06:17.720> the<00:06:18.289> surface<00:06:18.460> tension<00:06:19.539> takes<00:06:20.539> more

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
surface the surface tension takes more

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.830 
surface the surface tension takes more
chocolate<00:06:21.800> away<00:06:22.150> than<00:06:23.150> for<00:06:23.630> example<00:06:24.250> dipping

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
chocolate away than for example dipping

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:33.279 
chocolate away than for example dipping
on<00:06:26.840> the<00:06:27.199> edge<00:06:28.780> yeah<00:06:29.780> so<00:06:30.349> what<00:06:31.130> I<00:06:31.159> did<00:06:31.310> is<00:06:32.289> make

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:33.289 
on the edge yeah so what I did is make

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:37.210 
on the edge yeah so what I did is make
some<00:06:33.979> chocolate<00:06:34.310> a<00:06:35.169> little<00:06:36.169> bit<00:06:36.320> thicker<00:06:36.530> by

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:37.220 
some chocolate a little bit thicker by

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:42.659 
some chocolate a little bit thicker by
adding<00:06:37.789> sugar<00:06:37.970> syrup<00:06:38.750> or<00:06:39.039> some<00:06:40.039> alcohol<00:06:41.020> then

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:42.669 
adding sugar syrup or some alcohol then

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:49.060 
adding sugar syrup or some alcohol then
stir<00:06:43.669> well<00:06:45.280> take<00:06:46.280> a<00:06:46.310> piping<00:06:46.849> bag<00:06:46.880> and<00:06:48.039> make<00:06:49.039> a

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:49.070 
stir well take a piping bag and make a

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:52.450 
stir well take a piping bag and make a
kind<00:06:49.400> of<00:06:49.580> leaf<00:06:49.820> so<00:06:50.300> first<00:06:51.110> pipe<00:06:51.470> a<00:06:51.800> kind<00:06:52.310> of
