00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
siege battle and minecraft I thought it

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.120 
siege battle and minecraft I thought it
would<00:00:18.210> be<00:00:18.359> pretty<00:00:18.690> cool<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.439> have<00:00:19.590> more<00:00:19.859> siege

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130

out where I could make the map that much
better<00:02:57.819> and<00:02:58.120> it<00:02:58.930> got<00:02:59.109> to<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.260> point<00:02:59.470> where

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
better and it got to the point where
