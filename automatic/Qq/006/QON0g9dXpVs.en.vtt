00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.420 
you're going to add a geometric
tolerance<00:02:16.000> so<00:02:17.000> basically<00:02:17.599> I'm<00:02:17.989> going<00:02:18.290> to

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
tolerance so basically I'm going to

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.709 
tolerance so basically I'm going to
a<00:02:19.519> rough<00:02:20.299> geometric<00:02:20.810> tolerance<00:02:21.019> here<00:02:22.480> so<00:02:23.480> in

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:23.719 
a rough geometric tolerance here so in

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:26.830 
a rough geometric tolerance here so in
here<00:02:23.959> I'm<00:02:24.109> going<00:02:24.349> to<00:02:24.560> give<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:25.450> value<00:02:26.450> of

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
here I'm going to give the value of

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.339 
here I'm going to give the value of
point<00:02:27.530> zero<00:02:27.650> three

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.800 

and<00:02:30.519> that's<00:02:32.049> reference<00:02:33.049> will<00:02:33.319> be<00:02:33.349> say<00:02:33.860> a<00:02:34.810> novel

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
and that's reference will be say a novel

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.199 
and that's reference will be say a novel
okay<00:02:36.459> so<00:02:37.459> you<00:02:37.519> have<00:02:37.730> this<00:02:37.879> particular

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
okay so you have this particular

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.720 
okay so you have this particular
tolerance<00:02:38.780> being<00:02:39.049> creative<00:02:39.439> so<00:02:39.609> let<00:02:40.609> me

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
tolerance being creative so let me

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.199 
tolerance being creative so let me
insert<00:02:41.030> one<00:02:41.450> more<00:02:41.659> factor<00:02:42.640> as<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.700> datum

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
insert one more factor as the datum

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.399 
insert one more factor as the datum
feature<00:02:46.060> so<00:02:47.060> I<00:02:47.329> will<00:02:47.599> name<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.930> datum<00:02:48.200> feature

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:48.409 
feature so I will name the datum feature

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:54.420 
feature so I will name the datum feature
as<00:02:48.650> a<00:02:48.890> over<00:02:49.220> here

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:04.410 

okay<00:02:55.900> and<00:02:56.900> I<00:02:57.500> need<00:02:57.710> the<00:02:57.800> central<00:02:58.160> lines

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.660 

so<00:03:05.350> okay<00:03:06.480> so<00:03:07.480> some<00:03:08.260> of<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.530> things<00:03:08.980> which<00:03:09.459> I'm

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
so okay so some of the things which I'm

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.150 
so okay so some of the things which I'm
showing<00:03:10.090> in<00:03:10.360> this<00:03:10.510> tutorial<00:03:10.980> one<00:03:11.980> be

you need to be knowing about the tall

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.500 
you need to be knowing about the tall
inseam<00:03:32.739> tool<00:03:33.989> so<00:03:34.989> go<00:03:35.470> to<00:03:35.530> insert<00:03:36.510> dimensioning

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
inseam tool so go to insert dimensioning

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.949 
inseam tool so go to insert dimensioning
tolerance<00:03:38.080> and<00:03:38.350> geometric<00:03:39.070> tolerance<00:03:39.250> and

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
tolerance and geometric tolerance and

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.520 
tolerance and geometric tolerance and
once<00:03:40.959> you<00:03:41.340> click<00:03:42.340> on<00:03:42.610> this<00:03:42.970> particular<00:03:43.570> access

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
once you click on this particular access

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.360 
once you click on this particular access
line<00:03:44.739> you<00:03:45.550> get<00:03:45.790> the<00:03:45.970> tolerance<00:03:46.420> in<00:03:46.660> quick<00:03:47.530> and

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
line you get the tolerance in quick and

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.930 
line you get the tolerance in quick and
you<00:03:49.360> can<00:03:49.660> give<00:03:49.870> a<00:03:49.900> value<00:03:50.350> say<00:03:50.769> five

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.560 

so<00:03:55.070> let<00:03:56.070> me<00:03:56.190> just<00:03:56.430> give<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:56.970> datum<00:03:57.330> feature

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
so let me just give a datum feature

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:03.610 
so let me just give a datum feature
before<00:03:57.870> that

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.670 

let's<00:04:04.220> just<00:04:04.459> say<00:04:04.730> I'm<00:04:05.150> giving<00:04:05.420> a<00:04:05.959> B<00:04:06.920> over<00:04:07.250> here

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
let's just say I'm giving a B over here

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.280 
let's just say I'm giving a B over here
and<00:04:09.680> again<00:04:10.069> I'm<00:04:10.340> giving<00:04:12.489> C<00:04:13.489> over<00:04:13.760> here<00:04:14.290> and

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
and again I'm giving C over here and

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:25.540 
and again I'm giving C over here and
then<00:04:20.500> linking<00:04:21.500> them

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.350 

1:05

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:38.570 

BC<00:04:31.460> wait<00:04:32.460> we're<00:04:32.759> just<00:04:32.939> not<00:04:35.689> so<00:04:36.689> we<00:04:37.650> have<00:04:37.860> few

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
BC wait we're just not so we have few

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.020 
BC wait we're just not so we have few
options<00:04:39.120> or<00:04:39.389> few<00:04:39.949> spaces<00:04:40.949> over<00:04:41.219> here<00:04:41.550> so<00:04:41.819> I'm

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
options or few spaces over here so I'm

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.059 
options or few spaces over here so I'm
going<00:04:42.270> to<00:04:42.389> explain<00:04:42.840> you<00:04:43.050> or<00:04:43.259> exactly<00:04:43.770> all

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:44.069 
going to explain you or exactly all

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:47.179 
going to explain you or exactly all
those<00:04:44.310> places<00:04:45.300> are<00:04:45.629> meant<00:04:45.840> to<00:04:45.930> be<00:04:46.139> so<00:04:46.800> what<00:04:47.069> you

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:47.189 
those places are meant to be so what you

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:49.429 
those places are meant to be so what you
can<00:04:47.340> see<00:04:47.550> over<00:04:47.699> here<00:04:47.849> is<00:04:48.300> the<00:04:48.509> insert<00:04:48.930> symbol

value<00:05:12.150> what<00:05:12.870> you<00:05:12.960> can<00:05:13.169> insert<00:05:13.500> over<00:05:13.770> here<00:05:14.039> so

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
value what you can insert over here so

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.909 
value what you can insert over here so
this<00:05:14.699> is<00:05:14.759> all<00:05:15.060> about<00:05:15.330> the<00:05:15.599> spaces<00:05:16.590> which<00:05:16.770> you

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
this is all about the spaces which you

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.100 
this is all about the spaces which you
need<00:05:17.069> to<00:05:17.219> cover<00:05:17.430> in<00:05:17.759> the<00:05:18.210> genetic<00:05:18.659> tolerance

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
need to cover in the genetic tolerance

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.040 
need to cover in the genetic tolerance
window<00:05:19.469> so<00:05:20.210> what<00:05:21.210> is<00:05:21.300> this<00:05:21.419> tolerance

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050
