00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:10.179
So the eyes are a very useful ways to sometimes
to determine truthfulness, and there’s a

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:15.389
lot of things so the first thing, let’s
talk about eye contact.

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.630
There’s not one shred of academic research
that shows breaking eye contact is an indication

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.630
of lying.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.180
However, everybody believes that.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.140
Everybody believes that If you break eye contact
you’re lying, there’s not one shred of

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.570
research that shows that, okay.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.580
However, there is some research that shows
that people tend to make an overbearing amount

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.820
of contact when they lie, because they think
that you, you think that if they break eye

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.400
contact that you are going to perceive them
as lying.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.600
So one of the things you’ll see people do
is, I swear to God, I swear to God, I didn’t

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.610
do that, and then they make an unusual amount
of eye contact, which is a deviation from

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.559
how they make could be an indication of lying.

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:03.690
Also blink rates, it’s really a strong way
of determining, it’s not a strong way, but

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.860
it’s one of the ways you could maybe use
to determine whether someone is lying.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.030
So there’s two responses with blink rate.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.000
Our blink rate tends to increase when we get
really emotional about something, all right.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.580
So blink rate is coordinated with emotion
all right, so you’ll see an increase in

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.810
blink rate right there.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.710
But blink rate also decreases when we experience
something called cognitive overload.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.990
And what cognitive overload is, it’s basically
when our brain, lying requires more cognition

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.130
then telling the truth.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.689
So lying requires more cognitive facilities
than when you are telling something honest.

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.560
So what tends to happen behaviors tend to
stop when you are lying.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.050
So one of the cool things you’ll tend to
see is, some research points to, when you

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.900
see someone is telling a lie, you’ll see
a decrease in cognitive overload, and when

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.320
they get away with it, you’ll see an increase
in blink rate, because they just got away

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.320
with it.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.380
So it’s kind of cool, but it’s not highly
accurate and it’s hard to look for, but

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.789
it’s something you can be mindful of.
