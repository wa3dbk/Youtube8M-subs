00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
about

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.830

but hooded eyelids are more like they

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.560

have<00:01:46.079> skin<00:01:47.070> over<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.520> top<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:47.970> their<00:01:48.119> eyelids

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
have skin over the top so their eyelids

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.620 
have skin over the top so their eyelids
kind<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.280> disappear<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.549> there's<00:01:51.420> like

and<00:02:39.900> in<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.560> picture<00:02:40.860> you<00:02:41.460> will<00:02:41.580> be<00:02:41.700> able<00:02:41.970> to

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
and in the picture you will be able to

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.360 
and in the picture you will be able to
see<00:02:42.420> what<00:02:42.570> I'm<00:02:42.660> talking<00:02:43.020> about<00:02:43.110> another<00:02:44.040> one

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
see what I'm talking about another one

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.940 
see what I'm talking about another one
that<00:02:44.730> is<00:02:44.790> called<00:02:44.970> prominent<00:02:45.870> eyes<00:02:46.050> and<00:02:46.470> that

eyes are sticking out which it's not a
bad<00:03:04.260> thing<00:03:04.590> I<00:03:05.040> already<00:03:05.340> talked<00:03:05.520> about<00:03:05.550> deep

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
bad thing I already talked about deep

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.330 
bad thing I already talked about deep
set<00:03:06.180> deep<00:03:06.540> set<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:07.110> can<00:03:07.380> tell<00:03:07.740> if<00:03:07.920> you<00:03:07.950> have<00:03:08.040> it

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
set deep set you can tell if you have it

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.040 
set deep set you can tell if you have it
if<00:03:08.490> you<00:03:08.640> put<00:03:08.850> like<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.030> pencil<00:03:09.510> on<00:03:09.690> your<00:03:09.810> brow

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
if you put like a pencil on your brow

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.570 
if you put like a pencil on your brow
bone<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.500> your<00:03:10.620> cheek<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:11.070> if<00:03:11.220> your<00:03:11.370> eye<00:03:11.400> is

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
bone to your cheek and if your eye is

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.060 
bone to your cheek and if your eye is
behind<00:03:12.300> it<00:03:12.510> then<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:13.560> have<00:03:13.650> deep<00:03:13.860> set<00:03:14.040> eyes

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
behind it then you have deep set eyes

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.310 
behind it then you have deep set eyes
like<00:03:14.820> I<00:03:14.940> said<00:03:15.120> my<00:03:15.300> eyes<00:03:15.480> aren't<00:03:15.780> completely

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
like I said my eyes aren't completely

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.440 
like I said my eyes aren't completely
deep<00:03:16.739> set<00:03:17.010> but<00:03:17.310> they<00:03:17.430> do<00:03:17.489> have<00:03:17.910> deep<00:03:18.180> set

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
deep set but they do have deep set

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.470 
deep set but they do have deep set
qualities<00:03:18.900> last<00:03:19.620> two<00:03:20.040> would<00:03:20.459> be<00:03:20.580> close<00:03:20.970> set<00:03:21.300> so

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
qualities last two would be close set so

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.670 
qualities last two would be close set so
that<00:03:21.630> means<00:03:21.840> your<00:03:21.989> eyes<00:03:22.020> are<00:03:22.320> a<00:03:22.350> little<00:03:22.470> bit

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
that means your eyes are a little bit

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.610 
that means your eyes are a little bit
