00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.590
 The future of olive growing in Spain 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.930
 passes inexorably through the search for 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.600
 quality the entry of new countries 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.880
 producers makes initiatives like 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.830
 of the company todolivo call the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.350
 attention to both producers and 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.390
 marketers the establishment of 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.790
 olive grove system is your 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.320
 main axis to cost reduction 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.410
 which implies the mechanization of the crop 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.309
 the increase in the quality of the 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.309
 oil obtained 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.540
 the whole bolivarense system 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.100
 Allows 100% of the oils 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.050
 obtained a farm be extra virgin 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.309
 This is possible thanks to the speed 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.309
 that use the harvesters 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.140
 that oscillates between 50 minutes and 2 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.239
 hours and a half per hectare depending 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.460
 of the plantation frame this speed 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.260
 will allow us to collect the 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.790
 whole of the olive of a farm in 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.530
 its best maturation time for 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.369
 produce extra virgin oils 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.710
 very high quality 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.570
 Harvesting with harvesters is not 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.190
 further guarantees that all olives 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.930
 have been collected from the tree without 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.000
 touch the ground preserving well in the 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.570
 oil all its health and quality 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.150
 organoleptic 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.430
 the whole process of obtaining the oil 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.440
 We make extra virgin at a low cost 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.540
 thanks to that we reduce the main ones 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.550
 operating expenses such as for example 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.530
 the collection that we place your cost 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.600
 between 2 and 5 cents per 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.670
 kilo of olive we also use 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.750
 tolerant varieties diseases that 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.270
 they require less use of products 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.400
 phytosanitary and also reduce by 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.990
 example the nutritional contribution that 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.729
 does the olive tree thanks that we incorporate 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.369
 Every year prunings 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.290
 crushed to the ground the virgin oils 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.940
 extra obtained with this system is 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.280
 characterized by having a very acidity 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.310
 Low be very soft on the palate and own 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.229
 Intense fruity aroma these oils are 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.940
 highly demanded markets and quoted at 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.870
 a price superior to the rest of the 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.360
 extra virgin oils 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.250
 another one of the axes of todolivo is the 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.560
 research and innovation starting 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.140
 of the varieties that best adapt 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.690
 to the insect crop here we have 5 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.010
 varieties this is small is a 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.900
 Genetic improvement program variety 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.930
 University of Cordoba and Dad is a 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.510
 avenue hybrid because what is a 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.910
 variety is with a very reduced vigor 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.860
 then they are varieties that are 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.680
 narrower frames than for example the 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.510
 Arbequina in this case dry this 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.580
 area is not giving four points of 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.740
 fat above karvinÃ¡ this 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.570
 variety with x of a Greek variety 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:40.990
 which is characterized above all because 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.730
 has a precocious entry in 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.880
 production is up for those 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.540
 lands where where the flow of 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.920
 nutrients 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.920
 stability to healthy water 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.560
 I was also studying year 99 and day 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.870
 today for us and the development is 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.140
 is giving here in this in this field in 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.140
 variety 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.580
 more interesting that we are studying 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.530
 because it is a very productive variety 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.150
 we have produced arbequina and the 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.650
 Fat yield is less than 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.870
 little but there is a point with enzyme 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.180
 that of arbequina that the expense in pruning 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.610
 with this variety is very small in 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.400
 comparison with arbequina practically 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.700
 it self-regulates that it is very productive and 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.440
 also 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.569
 nothing alternating nothing was once a 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.430
 variety that if you go this olive tree that is 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:31.230
 loaded next year is just as 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:36.010
 charged this life 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.540
 the variety the classic variety and about 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.030
 everything very good originates because it is up to 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.510
 the cold to the cold the exit does not have 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.280
 that area where the most 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.140
 cold is the variety the skill that is 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.760
 must use and in those areas where 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.190
 the soil is saline is also the 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.989
 variety of a variety that we could 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.209
 to count on her this variety is the 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:58.060
 variety also came the year 2007 a 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.620
 Italy's genetic improvement program 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.410
 variety we are rehearsing because 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.500
 came out the market year 2007 we completed the 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.160
 we are seeing important difficulties 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.190
 then what are we seeing at a 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:12.430
 variety that blooms but can not 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.290
 then studying what we think that 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.640
 has a pollination problem in the 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.889
 tests carried out by this company 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.620
 Cordobesa encompass the different systems 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.690
 Irrigation plantation frames 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.300
 even the orientation of the crop 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.370
 they also dare to obtain 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.060
 new varieties from one 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.120
 Program 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.830
 genetic improvement in that program in that 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.180
 genetic improvement program totem and 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:39.940
 we took into account 565 varieties 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:43.750
 arbequina something healthy with which 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.750
 chiquitita and picual is worth to be 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.389
 cross-linking among them of those 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.389
 trials since 2006 2007 are 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:55.980
 they obtained seeds that were finished on 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:59.200
 2007 2008 of which some 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:03.130
 1,500 plants approximately of those 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:07.510
 1,500 plants an important number was 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:09.850
 of those that germinated were were colonel 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.010
 and by healthy tree or something healthy by crown 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.930
 that it is worth that the greatest number of plants 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.740
 who lived in the country this 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:19.690
 campaign is your first harvest this 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.520
 campaign is where we are going to discern what 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.340
 variety is going to stay for 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.590
 multiply vegetatively 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.990
 with the criterion of oil quality 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.990
 amount of oil and precocity in 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.210
 productivity and all this to get 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.190
 high quality fruity oils this 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.110
 loss of a common denominator that the 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.690
 enjoyed so great that he has the bass 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.400
 level of bitterness and itching and the 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:46.020
 softness and lightness that these have 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.130
 oils that in some way help 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.440
 organoleptically to enjoy much more 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.510
 to the final consumer not the consumer 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.600
 final as objective without losing sight of 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.370
 the profitability of the producing sector 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.729
 essential for the survival of 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.729
 olive growers
