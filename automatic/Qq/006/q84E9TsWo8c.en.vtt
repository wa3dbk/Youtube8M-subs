and<00:02:21.680> you'll<00:02:21.920> have<00:02:22.190> a<00:02:22.220> plant<00:02:22.640> like<00:02:22.879> this<00:02:23.209> that's

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
and you'll have a plant like this that's

and you'll have a plant like this that's
absolutely<00:02:24.739> beautiful<00:02:25.720> now<00:02:26.720> this<00:02:27.379> plant<00:02:27.769> is
