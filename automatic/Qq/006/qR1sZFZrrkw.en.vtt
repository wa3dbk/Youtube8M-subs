lesson two welcome to computer craft 101

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.290 
lesson two welcome to computer craft 101
basic<00:00:09.900> level<00:00:10.139> one<00:00:10.349> red<00:00:10.650> cent<00:00:10.860> red<00:00:11.099> poles<00:00:11.340> all

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
basic level one red cent red poles all

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.110 
basic level one red cent red poles all
right<00:00:13.070> so<00:00:14.070> if<00:00:14.160> you<00:00:14.219> type<00:00:14.400> programs<00:00:14.790> you<00:00:15.000> can

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
right so if you type programs you can

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.390 
right so if you type programs you can
see<00:00:15.330> there<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:15.809> red<00:00:16.320> set<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:17.060> red<00:00:18.060> pulls<00:00:19.400> the

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
see there is red set and red pulls the

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.429 
see there is red set and red pulls the
red<00:00:20.550> pulse<00:00:20.789> does<00:00:21.119> what<00:00:21.390> you<00:00:21.510> think<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.779> would

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.200 

let's<00:00:25.439> say<00:00:25.560> 100<00:00:25.920> pulses<00:00:26.340> one<00:00:27.090> second<00:00:29.000> now<00:00:30.000> see

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
let's say 100 pulses one second now see

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.709 
let's say 100 pulses one second now see
it's<00:00:30.359> like<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.779> can't<00:00:31.349> type<00:00:31.790> right<00:00:32.790> now<00:00:32.940> let's

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
it's like I can't type right now let's

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.090 
it's like I can't type right now let's
doing<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.050> thing<00:00:36.800> I'd<00:00:37.800> have<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.010> actually

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
doing the thing I'd have to actually

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.600 
doing the thing I'd have to actually
shut<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.579> down<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.690> stop<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.579> control<00:00:41.579> shift

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
shut this down to stop it control shift

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:49.549 
shut this down to stop it control shift
s<00:00:43.370> all<00:00:44.370> right<00:00:44.579> red<00:00:45.200> set-top<00:00:46.200> true<00:00:48.500> it's<00:00:49.500> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
s all right red set-top true it's the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.930 
s all right red set-top true it's the
simplest<00:00:49.860> way<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.070> get<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> signal<00:00:50.640> on<00:00:50.700> like<00:00:50.910> a

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
simplest way to get a signal on like a

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:59.010 
simplest way to get a signal on like a
lever

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:06.270 

let's<00:00:59.620> just<00:00:59.710> do<00:01:00.810> 10.5<00:01:01.980> what<00:01:02.980> Oh<00:01:05.070> make<00:01:06.070> sure<00:01:06.100> you

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
let's just do 10.5 what Oh make sure you

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:17.610 
let's just do 10.5 what Oh make sure you
type<00:01:06.520> it<00:01:06.640> right<00:01:06.820> a<00:01:12.570> blinky<00:01:13.570> blinky<00:01:16.440> alright<00:01:17.440> so

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
type it right a blinky blinky alright so

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.469 
type it right a blinky blinky alright so
that's<00:01:17.740> how<00:01:17.950> red<00:01:19.140> pulse<00:01:20.140> in<00:01:20.380> red<00:01:20.560> set<00:01:20.830> work

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
that's how red pulse in red set work

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:41.030 
that's how red pulse in red set work
let's<00:01:22.479> just<00:01:22.540> say<00:01:22.690> right<00:01:23.620> on<00:01:24.300> alright<00:01:25.300> so<00:01:37.680> true

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:54.389 

redstone<00:01:42.040> set<00:01:43.030> output<00:01:43.690> oh<00:01:49.860> not<00:01:50.860> them<00:01:53.399> to

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
redstone set output oh not them to

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.260 
redstone set output oh not them to
fast-forward<00:01:54.850> this

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.240 

and<00:02:00.229> I<00:02:00.320> don't<00:02:00.500> forget<00:02:00.710> any<00:02:00.890> this<00:02:01.009> program

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
and I don't forget any this program

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:14.770 
and I don't forget any this program
basically<00:02:02.200> my<00:02:05.950> rep<00:02:06.950> all<00:02:07.549> right<00:02:12.640> Bob<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:14.629> room

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
basically my rep all right Bob the room

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.150 
basically my rep all right Bob the room
is<00:02:14.870> mm-hmm<00:02:15.500> leatherback<00:02:16.430> front-runner<00:02:16.760> but

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
is mm-hmm leatherback front-runner but

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.630 
is mm-hmm leatherback front-runner but
okay<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:21.260> just<00:02:21.560> so<00:02:21.709> we<00:02:21.830> know<00:02:21.860> we<00:02:22.250> made<00:02:22.430> it<00:02:22.549> to

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
okay and just so we know we made it to

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:33.300 
okay and just so we know we made it to
the<00:02:22.760> end

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:42.809

red set oops false turn that off I think
I<00:02:52.459> got<00:02:52.610> a<00:02:52.640> program<00:02:52.970> already<00:02:53.150> in<00:02:53.329> there<00:02:54.250> yeah

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
I got a program already in there yeah

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.270 
I got a program already in there yeah
ball<00:02:55.879> warmer<00:02:59.319> and<00:03:00.319> just<00:03:00.739> like<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:00.980> other<00:03:01.129> one
