a regular basis on a weekly basis you

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.580 
a regular basis on a weekly basis you

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
so many different shows that can be a

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.020 
so many different shows that can be a
problem<00:03:19.810> because<00:03:20.709> you<00:03:21.130> can<00:03:21.310> forget<00:03:21.730> sometimes

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
problem because you can forget sometimes

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.420
