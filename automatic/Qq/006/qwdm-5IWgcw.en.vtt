00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.279
 box that I am capable 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.279
 disrespect 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:35.140
 well you know how it hurts addicted and 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.140
 true that very well 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:42.620
 we see here in what would be the mobile 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.620
 let's get it out 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.289
 you already see 5 inches hd 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.460
 comes with some pretty features 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:00.100
 powerful the truth 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:02.120
 comes with a gmt k 65 89 processor 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:08.290
 four cores 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:11.490

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.000

 64 GB can enter 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.630
 double without good you see by a stage of 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.630
 protection 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.710
 a kind of support because if we want 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.800
 support it somewhere that has very 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.800
 all right 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.880
 the headphones seems to be the hands 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.880
 free too 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.990
 the charger theme 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.799
 everyone looks that this time they have sent 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.799
 European 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:07.590
 with a small plug or if we are 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.519
 living in china or in usa 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.519
 for this reason 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:18.930
 around here the usb cable to connect to 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:23.450
 to the computer or in this case also for 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:27.280
 plug the phone into the current 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:31.099
 a battery that comes in two because one 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:34.230
 still earlier that is to say that is 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:37.590
 pretty good with two batteries 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.830
 and good manual in English that good for 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.590
 the android system is also not necessary 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.470
 a lot of history 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.630
 just to catch it in your hands is 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.440
 enough 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:56.110
 the truth that has a design and a 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:58.970
 quite good texture to the touch is not 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.790
 that plastic 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.240
 I do not know is a feel to the touch 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.450
 the mobile is quite nice 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.319
 in itself the truth is very very very good 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.780
 Print 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.780
 let's tear it 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.999
 Well then you see a little 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.999
 how the phone is coming 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:30.140
 good comes with the typical android design 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.410
 the camera of truth that is very well 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:41.620
 have 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.620
 it seems I do not know if it's a resolution 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:49.290
 1080 x 720 in video 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:56.010
 and in what would be in the photo I think they are 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.660
 three megapixels 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.330
 I'm not sure I'd have to look at what 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.660
 let's do a test to see how 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.660
 pulls out 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.440
 for example here 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.890
 I know well 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.530
 good has the protector this 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.530
 I do not want to remove it either 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:39.120
 it's pretty good, I think it's 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:43.370
 about 3 megapixels elpidio yes that 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.370
 I tell you it 's from hdd 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:51.060
 1080 x 720 the truth that this is very 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.340
 all right 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.240
 well here you have a sample of what 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.240
 it would be him 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.570
 the mobile 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.120
 and he looks good you see that 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:09.610
 resolutions 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.610
 the truth is very good 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.889
 and you can see the pictures more or less than 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.480
 I've done 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:25.180
 and good that 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:29.249
 there is no doubt that shows that 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:32.779
 that is really good 

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:32.779
 good in applications 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.720
 typical 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:42.660
 you have the play store to download the 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:45.490
 good android apps then I already 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:49.120
 I have changed my language 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:54.220
 and a mobile that with the price that it has 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:57.220
 with quite high characteristics 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.110
 or is price quality is very good 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.530
 so good in principle if you want 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:07.360
 acquire it then in my store that you the 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:10.870
 I remember that it is www store dot steps 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.560
 of the scientific method puntocom I hope you 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.560
 a greeting
