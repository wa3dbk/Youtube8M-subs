to fulfill her own her own hopes for the

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.479 
to fulfill her own her own hopes for the
world<00:04:07.180> yeah<00:04:08.180> I<00:04:08.540> think<00:04:09.470> you're<00:04:09.590> right<00:04:09.769> and<00:04:10.130> that

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489

world yeah I think you're right and that
makes<00:04:10.760> a<00:04:10.910> lot<00:04:11.060> of<00:04:11.120> sense<00:04:12.040> it's<00:04:13.040> like<00:04:13.220> she

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
makes a lot of sense it's like she

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.780 
makes a lot of sense it's like she
doesn't<00:04:13.840> you<00:04:14.840> know<00:04:14.959> didn't<00:04:15.860> get<00:04:15.950> to<00:04:16.130> do<00:04:16.549> what

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
doesn't you know didn't get to do what

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.750 
doesn't you know didn't get to do what
she<00:04:17.060> wanted<00:04:17.480> and<00:04:17.900> so<00:04:18.799> she<00:04:18.859> wants<00:04:19.220> me<00:04:19.430> to<00:04:19.459> pick

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
she wanted and so she wants me to pick

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.090 
she wanted and so she wants me to pick
up<00:04:19.880> where<00:04:20.060> she<00:04:20.090> left<00:04:20.269> off<00:04:20.600> but<00:04:21.350> I<00:04:21.650> have

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
up where she left off but I have

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.470 
up where she left off but I have
completely<00:04:22.580> different<00:04:22.850> hopes<00:04:23.180> and<00:04:23.360> dreams

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
completely different hopes and dreams

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.090 
completely different hopes and dreams
than<00:04:23.810> she<00:04:23.990> does

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.740 

I<00:04:28.130> think<00:04:28.790> that<00:04:28.910> actually<00:04:29.090> he<00:04:29.420> was<00:04:29.540> better

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
I think that actually he was better

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.580 
I think that actually he was better
anyone<00:04:30.170> can<00:04:30.830> and
