 of the day we have time to get a little tired 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.820
 so the first step is very important 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.829
 is taking a shower and bath 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.129

 cheer up all the girls I went to the shower 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.280
 and I advise you 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.770
 choose your favorite shower gel 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.170
 with a pleasant aroma i will use 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.610
 Strawberry stones with cream its gentle 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.949
 the scent will help me tune in 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.539
 romantic mood to date 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.539
 feel full of confidence 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.430
 refreshing sweet doran color 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.140
 continue skin care with cameos 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.930
 and apply body lotion with fragrance 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.119
 strawberries and cream hair will not dry 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.570
 let them dry naturally but not until 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.939
 the end 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.540
 apply hair spray 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.430
 it was easier to comb for care 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.520
 facial skin using light daytime 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.960
 cream and start makeup 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.869
 By the way, so that the hair does not interfere 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.950
 I advise you to bundle them 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.170
 I will do makeup as much as possible 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.549
 natural red lips black smokey 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.500
 ice leave for later 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.600
 in order to even out the complexion and 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.850
 give the skin a velvety matte effect i 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.100
 I use powder on those areas where I 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.380
 I need more coverage I apply a little more 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.689
 powder with a small brush in 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.240
 my case, this area under the eyes and around 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:52.070
 nose to emphasize cheekbones 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.070
 I select them using a browser 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.659
 if you have naturally gorgeous eyebrows and 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.119
 You did not have time because they distort 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.520
 I did you then lucky and just 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:07.920
 put with a brush from puts already 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:10.080
 or with eyebrow gel 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.370
 I will spend a little more time ip-address 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.370
 this is what is missing 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.730
 it's time to take your eyes brown 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.489
 pencil 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.709

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.310
 blend it well and draw it 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.890
 attention to no gaps left 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.750
 between the cilia we do this step as 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.849
 times so that the eyelashes are thicker 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.650
 you will never miss if 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.700

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.549
 on a mobile century 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:44.280
 and the crease of the century 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.660
