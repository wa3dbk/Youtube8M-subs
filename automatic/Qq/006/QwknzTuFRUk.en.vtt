00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.710 

bring<00:03:05.340> a<00:03:05.430> little<00:03:05.610> bit<00:03:05.790> of<00:03:05.850> that<00:03:05.970> color<00:03:06.360> just

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
underneath the lash line as well so you

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.310 
underneath the lash line as well so you
get<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:11.430> be<00:03:11.670> going<00:03:11.940> that<00:03:12.120> way<00:03:12.330> and<00:03:12.630> if<00:03:12.870> it's<00:03:13.230> like

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
get a be going that way and if it's like

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.970 
get a be going that way and if it's like
a<00:03:13.380> w<00:03:13.940> alrighty<00:03:15.320> let<00:03:16.320> me<00:03:16.410> just<00:03:16.530> want<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:16.740> blend

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
same one we used as the base and I'm

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.410 
same one we used as the base and I'm
taking<00:04:05.370> some<00:04:05.519> of<00:04:05.609> it<00:04:05.730> onto<00:04:05.909> just<00:04:06.239> like<00:04:06.390> a

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
taking some of it onto just like a

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.740 
taking some of it onto just like a
little<00:04:06.629> synthetic<00:04:06.930> brush<00:04:08.000> so<00:04:09.000> literally<00:04:09.510> just

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
and then I'm going to use that to line

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.280 
and then I'm going to use that to line
my<00:04:19.930> upper<00:04:19.959> lash<00:04:20.530> line<00:04:21.060> if<00:04:22.060> your<00:04:22.690> if<00:04:22.930> your<00:04:22.960> demo

pencil sharp enough you could just draw

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:40.660 
pencil sharp enough you could just draw
