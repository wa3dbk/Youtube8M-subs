00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
movement as well and here's the like the

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.680 
movement as well and here's the like the
tilt<00:01:00.620> movement<00:01:01.070> is<00:01:01.190> really<00:01:02.089> really<00:01:02.300> smooth

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
tilt movement is really really smooth

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.710 
tilt movement is really really smooth
you<00:01:02.900> can<00:01:02.960> go<00:01:03.830> into<00:01:04.040> any<00:01:04.339> position<00:01:04.759> you<00:01:05.119> want<00:01:05.509> to

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
you can go into any position you want to

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.190 
you can go into any position you want to
it<00:01:06.259> tilts<00:01:06.979> for<00:01:07.160> like<00:01:07.340> sixty<00:01:07.910> percent<00:01:08.119> this<00:01:08.930> way

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
it tilts for like sixty percent this way

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.160 
it tilts for like sixty percent this way
and<00:01:09.770> for<00:01:10.460> sixty<00:01:10.910> percent<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:11.630> other<00:01:11.869> way

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
and for sixty percent the other way

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.580 
and for sixty percent the other way
that's<00:01:12.800> pretty<00:01:13.250> pretty<00:01:13.700> for<00:01:14.060> I<00:01:14.090> say<00:01:14.570> you<00:01:15.410> can

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
that's pretty pretty for I say you can

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.510 
that's pretty pretty for I say you can
get<00:01:15.770> down<00:01:16.009> there<00:01:16.220> like<00:01:16.780> really<00:01:17.780> really<00:01:17.930> far

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
get down there like really really far

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.940 
get down there like really really far
then<00:01:19.520> it<00:01:20.119> has<00:01:20.330> his<00:01:20.539> mechanism<00:01:20.810> that<00:01:21.320> if<00:01:21.619> you

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
then it has his mechanism that if you

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.719 
then it has his mechanism that if you
release<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:23.539> tilt<00:01:23.899> and<00:01:24.259> you<00:01:25.250> would<00:01:25.369> have<00:01:25.550> like

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
release the tilt and you would have like

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.450 
release the tilt and you would have like
a<00:01:25.759> heavy<00:01:26.090> camera<00:01:26.450> on<00:01:26.810> it<00:01:27.020> it<00:01:27.380> will<00:01:27.530> not<00:01:27.890> fall

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
a heavy camera on it it will not fall

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.779 
a heavy camera on it it will not fall
over<00:01:28.520> like<00:01:28.970> that<00:01:29.180> because<00:01:29.450> it<00:01:29.750> has<00:01:29.899> this

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
over like that because it has this

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.249 
over like that because it has this
spring<00:01:31.789> mechanism<00:01:32.090> in<00:01:32.630> a<00:01:32.660> debt<00:01:32.899> it<00:01:33.050> will

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
spring mechanism in a debt it will

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.950 
spring mechanism in a debt it will
always<00:01:33.619> like<00:01:34.090> kind<00:01:35.090> of<00:01:36.160> you<00:01:37.160> know<00:01:37.220> it<00:01:37.580> will

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
always like kind of you know it will

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.200 
always like kind of you know it will
hold<00:01:38.960> it<00:01:39.200> it<00:01:39.860> will<00:01:40.039> never<00:01:40.310> fall<00:01:40.729> over<00:01:41.030> like

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
hold it it will never fall over like

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.910 
hold it it will never fall over like
that<00:01:43.119> the<00:01:44.119> plate<00:01:44.420> here<00:01:44.750> on<00:01:44.869> top<00:01:45.140> pretty<00:01:45.740> easy

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
that the plate here on top pretty easy

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.700 
that the plate here on top pretty easy
to<00:01:46.189> release<00:01:46.549> it<00:01:46.820> release<00:01:47.110> this<00:01:48.110> one<00:01:48.380> over<00:01:48.680> here

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
to release it release this one over here

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.520 
to release it release this one over here
this<00:01:49.490> one<00:01:49.700> lets<00:01:49.909> you<00:01:50.030> set<00:01:50.659> like<00:01:50.900> the<00:01:51.049> position

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
this one lets you set like the position

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.780 
this one lets you set like the position
of<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:51.770> plates<00:01:52.009> you<00:01:52.189> could<00:01:52.340> slide<00:01:52.580> it<00:01:52.759> forward

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
of the plates you could slide it forward

of the plates you could slide it forward
or<00:01:53.330> backward<00:01:53.810> release<00:01:54.740> it<00:01:55.009> then<00:01:55.340> press<00:01:55.610> this

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
or backward release it then press this

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.030 
or backward release it then press this
red<00:01:56.090> button<00:01:56.150> on<00:01:56.540> the<00:01:56.630> side<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:57.530> plate<00:01:57.770> comes

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
red button on the side the plate comes

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.730 
red button on the side the plate comes
off<00:01:58.479> it<00:01:59.479> comes<00:01:59.540> with<00:01:59.930> two<00:02:00.049> screws<00:02:00.290> so<00:02:00.710> a

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
off it comes with two screws so a

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.950 
off it comes with two screws so a
thicker<00:02:01.520> thread<00:02:01.820> and<00:02:02.119> this<00:02:02.299> one<00:02:02.509> this<00:02:02.750> one<00:02:02.930> is

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
thicker thread and this one this one is

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.289 
thicker thread and this one this one is
for<00:02:03.229> like<00:02:03.380> to<00:02:03.500> say<00:02:03.650> to<00:02:03.710> standard<00:02:04.220> DSLR<00:02:04.790> cameras

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
for like to say to standard DSLR cameras

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.169 
for like to say to standard DSLR cameras
and<00:02:05.979> most<00:02:06.979> of<00:02:07.159> the<00:02:07.250> cameras<00:02:07.610> have<00:02:07.790> this<00:02:08.000> threat

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
and most of the cameras have this threat

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.330 
and most of the cameras have this threat
so<00:02:08.479> i<00:02:08.509> got<00:02:08.780> this<00:02:08.929> screw<00:02:09.229> in<00:02:09.380> there<00:02:09.590> but<00:02:10.220> it

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
so i got this screw in there but it

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.250 
so i got this screw in there but it
comes<00:02:10.549> with<00:02:10.640> another<00:02:10.970> one<00:02:11.120> as<00:02:11.299> well<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:11.989> just

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
comes with another one as well and just

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.110 
comes with another one as well and just
slide<00:02:12.980> it<00:02:13.130> back<00:02:13.280> in<00:02:13.519> till<00:02:13.670> you<00:02:13.760> hear<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.000> click

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
slide it back in till you hear the click

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.560 
slide it back in till you hear the click
and<00:02:14.709> then<00:02:15.709> you<00:02:15.920> can<00:02:16.100> set<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:17.000> point<00:02:17.269> where<00:02:17.450> you
