so<00:00:28.830> what<00:00:29.490> exactly<00:00:29.610> is<00:00:30.210> augmented<00:00:30.900> reality

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
so what exactly is augmented reality

world<00:00:56.010> layered<00:00:56.940> on<00:00:57.090> top<00:00:57.120> there's<00:00:57.540> a<00:00:57.600> kind<00:00:57.720> of

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
world layered on top there's a kind of

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.620 
world layered on top there's a kind of
magic<00:00:58.170> there<00:00:58.649> with<00:00:58.829> augmented<00:00:59.219> reality<00:01:00.059> and

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:00.630 
magic there with augmented reality and

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.030 
magic there with augmented reality and
it's<00:01:00.780> only<00:01:00.899> what<00:01:01.079> we're<00:01:01.200> really<00:01:01.380> using<00:01:01.649> with

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
it's only what we're really using with

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.719 
it's only what we're really using with
something<00:01:02.370> like<00:01:02.520> reality<00:01:03.000> fighter<00:01:04.670> we<00:01:05.670> are

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
something like reality fighter we are

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.600 
something like reality fighter we are
trying<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.390> kind<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.770> create<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.340> world

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
trying to kind of create the world

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.139 
trying to kind of create the world
between<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.630> real<00:01:10.619> world<00:01:10.649> versus<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.940> kind

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
between the real world versus the kind

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.790 
between the real world versus the kind
of<00:01:12.240> virtual<00:01:12.450> world<00:01:14.300> so<00:01:15.300> as<00:01:15.390> an<00:01:15.509> example<00:01:15.630> if<00:01:16.380> you

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
of virtual world so as an example if you

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.040 
of virtual world so as an example if you
want<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.070> play<00:01:17.340> look<00:01:18.330> at<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.539> characters<00:01:19.020> in

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
want to play look at the characters in

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.620 
want to play look at the characters in
close<00:01:19.440> proximity<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:20.759> allow<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.300> do<00:01:21.450> that

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
close proximity we allow you to do that

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.020 
close proximity we allow you to do that
by<00:01:21.930> using<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.500> single<00:01:22.860> AR<00:01:23.160> car<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.850> can

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
by using a single AR car so you can

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.690 
by using a single AR car so you can
really<00:01:24.450> zoom<00:01:24.600> into<00:01:25.050> the<00:01:25.229> characters<00:01:25.800> but<00:01:26.610> if

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
really zoom into the characters but if

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.070 
really zoom into the characters but if
you're<00:01:26.850> out<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.119> about<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.780> somewhere

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
you're out and about and somewhere

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.990 
you're out and about and somewhere
interesting<00:01:28.380> like<00:01:28.979> maybe<00:01:29.580> go<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:29.910> a

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
interesting like maybe go on a

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.690 
interesting like maybe go on a
skyscraper<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:31.229> can<00:01:31.439> actually<00:01:31.860> project<00:01:32.250> your

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
skyscraper you can actually project your

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.570 
skyscraper you can actually project your
fighters<00:01:33.299> from<00:01:33.869> top<00:01:34.080> of<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.260> skyscraper<00:01:34.580> onto

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
fighters from top of a skyscraper onto

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.060 
fighters from top of a skyscraper onto
the<00:01:35.670> ground<00:01:35.909> level<00:01:36.299> now<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.170> character<00:01:37.860> size

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
the ground level now the character size

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.880 
the ground level now the character size
will<00:01:38.700> be<00:01:38.729> scaled<00:01:39.240> up<00:01:39.390> accordingly<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.710> if<00:01:40.770> we

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
will be scaled up accordingly so if we

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.520 
will be scaled up accordingly so if we
do<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.640> higher<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.509> building<00:01:42.900> ago<00:01:43.170> with

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
do the higher of the building ago with

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.440 
do the higher of the building ago with
bigger<00:01:43.770> character<00:01:44.159> gets<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.150> end<00:01:45.240> result

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
bigger character gets so the end result

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.200 
bigger character gets so the end result
is<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.320> could<00:01:46.560> have<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:47.159> giant<00:01:47.580> Godzilla

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
is that you could have a giant Godzilla

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.510 
is that you could have a giant Godzilla
size<00:01:48.750> character<00:01:49.500> fighting<00:01:50.159> on<00:01:50.250> top<00:01:50.400> of<00:01:50.490> a

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
size character fighting on top of a

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.160 
size character fighting on top of a
skyscraper<00:01:50.580> so<00:01:51.420> it's<00:01:51.509> really<00:01:51.840> really

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
skyscraper so it's really really

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.460 
skyscraper so it's really really
exciting

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.770 

for<00:01:58.470> me<00:01:58.620> I<00:01:58.860> think<00:01:59.010> augmented<00:01:59.700> reality<00:01:59.780> it's

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
for me I think augmented reality it's

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.260 
for me I think augmented reality it's
made<00:02:01.200> for<00:02:01.590> portable<00:02:02.160> devices<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:03.090> look

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
made for portable devices you look

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.970 
made for portable devices you look
through<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.810> device<00:02:04.080> and<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.470> augmented

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
through the device and the augmented

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.160 
through the device and the augmented
reality<00:02:05.370> is<00:02:05.430> layered<00:02:05.790> on<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.150> world<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.750> this

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
reality is layered on the world and this

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.650 
reality is layered on the world and this
there's<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.650> kind<00:02:07.830> of<00:02:08.040> magic<00:02:08.340> with<00:02:08.790> that<00:02:09.030> where

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
there's a kind of magic with that where
