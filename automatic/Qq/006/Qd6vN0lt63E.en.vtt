we rotate around I come across to the
right<00:02:06.420> side<00:02:06.799> you<00:02:07.799> can<00:02:07.859> see<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.369> here<00:02:09.149> is<00:02:09.239> the

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
right side you can see that here is the

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.999 
right side you can see that here is the
optical<00:02:09.929> drive<00:02:10.170> which<00:02:10.349> in<00:02:10.500> this<00:02:10.590> case<00:02:10.769> is<00:02:10.979> a

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
technology so you can actually take this

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.410 
technology so you can actually take this
out<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.180> replace<00:02:18.769> it<00:02:19.769> with<00:02:19.799> either<00:02:20.430> dummy

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
out and replace it with either dummy

something<00:02:31.470> like<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:33.260> up<00:02:34.260> next<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.280> we

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
something like that up next to it we

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.550 
something like that up next to it we
have<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.910> 34<00:02:36.420> millimeter<00:02:36.810> ExpressCard<00:02:36.989> slot

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
have a 34 millimeter ExpressCard slot

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.949 
have a 34 millimeter ExpressCard slot
which<00:02:38.160> underneath<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.120> has<00:02:39.269> a<00:02:39.299> media<00:02:39.750> card

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
which underneath it has a media card

which underneath it has a media card
reader<00:02:40.049> and<00:02:40.470> then<00:02:41.160> there<00:02:41.459> is<00:02:41.549> another<00:02:41.579> USB<00:02:42.120> I

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.130 
reader and then there is another USB I
believe<00:02:43.019> that's<00:02:43.200> a<00:02:43.319> 2.0<00:02:43.829> here<00:02:44.610> on<00:02:45.599> the<00:02:45.959> back

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
believe that's a 2.0 here on the back

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.800 
believe that's a 2.0 here on the back
left<00:02:46.620> or<00:02:47.099> right<00:02:47.310> side<00:02:47.489> rather<00:02:47.760> then<00:02:48.329> we<00:02:48.450> rotate

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
left or right side rather then we rotate

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.870 
left or right side rather then we rotate
around<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.319> back<00:02:49.500> there's<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.400> vertical

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
around to the back there's a vertical

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.089 
around to the back there's a vertical
USB<00:02:51.660> powered<00:02:52.079> port<00:02:52.380> so<00:02:52.530> you<00:02:52.560> can<00:02:52.650> charge<00:02:52.799> your

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
USB powered port so you can charge your

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.789 
USB powered port so you can charge your
smartphones<00:02:53.730> other<00:02:54.480> devices<00:02:54.870> off<00:02:55.380> of<00:02:55.590> that

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
smartphones other devices off of that

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.920 
smartphones other devices off of that
then<00:02:56.370> is<00:02:56.610> your<00:02:56.880> there's<00:02:57.209> your<00:02:57.420> Ethernet<00:02:57.900> port

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
then is your there's your Ethernet port

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.610 
then is your there's your Ethernet port
there<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:58.849> then<00:02:59.849> on<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.480> right<00:03:01.200> side<00:03:01.410> of<00:03:01.560> the

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
there and then on the right side of the

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.589 
there and then on the right side of the
back<00:03:01.769> you<00:03:02.220> can<00:03:02.370> see<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.670> there's<00:03:03.150> that<00:03:03.420> the

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
back you can see that there's that the

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.289 
back you can see that there's that the
power<00:03:03.780> jack<00:03:04.220> we<00:03:05.220> have<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.519> nine<00:03:05.670> cell<00:03:05.940> battery

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
power jack we have the nine cell battery

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:07.699 
power jack we have the nine cell battery
here<00:03:06.480> so<00:03:06.630> it's<00:03:06.780> sticking<00:03:07.019> out<00:03:07.260> at<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.560> back

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
here so it's sticking out at the back

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.460 
here so it's sticking out at the back
end<00:03:08.069> that<00:03:09.000> that's<00:03:09.780> going<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:09.989> give<00:03:10.079> you<00:03:10.170> longer

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
end that that's going to give you longer

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.470 
end that that's going to give you longer
battery<00:03:10.680> life<00:03:10.829> of<00:03:11.160> course<00:03:11.459> but<00:03:12.030> on<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.269> flip

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
battery life of course but on the flip

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.410 
battery life of course but on the flip
side<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:13.230> does<00:03:13.470> add<00:03:13.650> weight<00:03:13.950> with<00:03:14.730> that<00:03:14.970> 9<00:03:15.150> cell

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
side it does add weight with that 9 cell

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.530 
side it does add weight with that 9 cell
battery<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.079> weight<00:03:16.260> comes<00:03:16.709> around<00:03:17.540> 5.2

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
battery and the weight comes around 5.2

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.809 
battery and the weight comes around 5.2
pounds<00:03:18.959> so<00:03:19.170> for<00:03:19.709> a<00:03:19.739> 14<00:03:20.100> inch<00:03:20.250> laptop<00:03:20.609> it's

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
pounds so for a 14 inch laptop it's

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.309 
pounds so for a 14 inch laptop it's
fairly<00:03:21.150> heavy<00:03:22.100> we<00:03:23.100> do<00:03:23.310> have<00:03:23.549> a<00:03:23.579> latch<00:03:23.940> style

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
fairly heavy we do have a latch style

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.559 
fairly heavy we do have a latch style
shut<00:03:25.319> closing<00:03:25.920> mechanism<00:03:26.069> here<00:03:26.609> so<00:03:26.819> whereas

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
shut closing mechanism here so whereas

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.379 
shut closing mechanism here so whereas
on<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:27.750> X<00:03:27.900> 230<00:03:28.410> it's<00:03:28.709> just<00:03:29.069> used<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.030> hinges

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
on the X 230 it's just used the hinges

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.379 
on the X 230 it's just used the hinges
to<00:03:30.600> hold<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.200> lid<00:03:31.769> shut<00:03:32.069> the<00:03:32.310> t<00:03:32.489> 430<00:03:32.940> does<00:03:33.150> have

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
to hold the lid shut the t 430 does have

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.589 
to hold the lid shut the t 430 does have
the<00:03:33.630> built-in<00:03:34.530> latch<00:03:34.739> system<00:03:35.180> so<00:03:36.180> you<00:03:36.569> can

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
the built-in latch system so you can

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.180 
the built-in latch system so you can
just<00:03:36.900> release<00:03:37.139> it<00:03:37.200> there<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:37.650> then<00:03:37.739> lift<00:03:38.040> the

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
just release it there and then lift the

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.670 
just release it there and then lift the
lid<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:38.639> you<00:03:39.510> check<00:03:39.750> out<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.019> steel<00:03:40.290> hinges

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
lid and you check out the steel hinges

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.800 
lid and you check out the steel hinges
here<00:03:40.889> they're<00:03:41.160> all<00:03:41.849> ours<00:03:42.120> they<00:03:42.420> ever<00:03:42.569> were

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
here they're all ours they ever were

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.140 
here they're all ours they ever were
it's<00:03:43.109> very<00:03:43.590> thick<00:03:43.950> very<00:03:44.280> rigid<00:03:44.760> so<00:03:44.970> this

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
it's very thick very rigid so this

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.180 
it's very thick very rigid so this
screen<00:03:45.480> just<00:03:45.690> does<00:03:46.319> not<00:03:46.470> wobble<00:03:46.739> when<00:03:47.040> you

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
screen just does not wobble when you

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.909 
screen just does not wobble when you
