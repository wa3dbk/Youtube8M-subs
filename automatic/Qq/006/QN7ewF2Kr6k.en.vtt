00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:15.139
 answers of death sciences because you can only with the super bike engine 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.990
 have 150 horses 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.220
 air-cooled engine 2 valves per cylinder 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:27.220
 let's say to me unless you make me on the crazy displacement but later 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.300
 would have other contraindications with me 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.210
 defamation in the genre 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.810
 cannot have 150 horses 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.390
 to have 150 horses 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.830
 and having them above all with a stress-free engine 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:49.030
 1198 with 150 horses really little stressed. green 170 1 also 185 people 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.640
 1098 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.010
 icon reduced to 150 horses 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.320
 how can I say calm 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.320
 he could not have given him 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.320
 then a long valve recording interval 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.250
 reduces maintenance costs and obviously an important thing for all 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.730
 motorcycles with an extremely important touring bike 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.900
 while in the important for a strangely sporty bike like 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.260
 then engine 1198 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.650
 the super bike 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.049
 he was born with the mind not write of 12 thousand kilometers 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.120
 because for a super byke motorcycle it was considered reasonable 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.600
 while 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.150
 deemed necessary to increase this range for a touring motorcycle 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.820
 this correlation 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.060
 ap1000 this is different than a3000 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.060
 at 4000 different still but not only 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.660
 also in first 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.870
 different from the second different from in third alpini different for each marsala 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.710
 and even in crowds and different yet 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.219
 grappa 

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:11.149
 so all mad you with all the matrix 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:14.479
 and in the end they become are 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:15.859
 20 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:18.859
 combinations of rpm 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:21.859
 1010 milan of 500 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:24.319
 I'm 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.039
 twenty-eight 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:28.539
 combinations of 

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:31.539
 28 degrees of opening of qui spirit gum 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:35.219
 per week if 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.599
 xmen of the combinations are hundreds 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:41.359
 first free buyvip 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:46.339
 we used gp sis bikes but in the field of cars we already know it 

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.889
 from before
