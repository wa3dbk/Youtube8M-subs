00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 in this video I'll show you how 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:09.140
 prepare homemade mixed seasonings from 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.140
 an easy and fast way 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.769
 or 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:21.610
 we're going to need black pepper in the ball 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:24.070
 this is cumin whole leaves of oregano 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.430
 this is coriander ball cilantro 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.890
 sejos laurel leaves and 3 chiles 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.950
 tree that I'm going to use a grinder for 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.500
 This coffee, if it does not have a crusher, I will 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.110
 use the ma jin google or the otter 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.270
 mÃ¼ller that you bring to these plants if 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.400
 it has to be the flat ones and it's the 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.560
 even will not be useful for 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.960
 grind well you can also do it in a 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.150
 mill in the molcajete or that you 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.590
 have in the blender I do not recommend 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.610
 because it does not grind well in the blender 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.930
 we are going to remove the seed from chiles 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.210
 I'm going to put all the 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.100
 ingredients in a container although it 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.410
 can be putting directly in the 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.049
 grinder I will measure with a teaspoon of 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.900
 15 milliliters and I'm going to put 2 tablespoons 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:10.000
 of coriander 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.850
 they are going to be two tablespoons too 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.750
 Pepper 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.729
 two tablespoons of oregano and cumin 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.530
 it's going to be only a spoonful because 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.869
 the cumin is stronger and we do not want 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.610
 predominant taste of caraway I will 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.850
 put a fistful of leaves of the mind 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.380
 can be from 5 to 7 leaves now I'm going to 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.610
 place it in the grinder 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.610
 and we are going to grind 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.610
 I like it 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.009
 we were perfectly bitten our 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.670
 seasoning we are going to pass it to a 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.700
 little boat 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.100
 I am using a container of a 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.340
 Mount same previous that I bought what I washed 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.310
 for 5 minutes it has to be to be able to 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.110
 save my condiments ministers and then 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.239
 my knowledge has already been seen for 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.250
 elaborate them and use these 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.010
 condiments I use them generally in 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.530
 the meat meals broths like 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.630
 meatballs shrimp broth diste 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.120
