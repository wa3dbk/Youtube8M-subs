is automation there is little influence
over<00:00:57.300> with<00:00:58.290> because<00:00:58.920> itself<00:00:59.910> we<00:01:00.120> see

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.020 

it<00:01:08.290> was<00:01:08.560> decided<00:01:09.160> that<00:01:09.190> Agora<00:01:10.090> trees<00:01:10.480> and<00:01:12.030> the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
it was decided that Agora trees and the

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.500 
it was decided that Agora trees and the
danger<00:01:13.450> area<00:01:13.720> will<00:01:14.140> be<00:01:14.440> built<00:01:14.740> at<00:01:15.070> the

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
danger area will be built at the

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.470 
danger area will be built at the
installation<00:01:16.510> overwrites<00:01:17.440> prefecture

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:18.480 
installation overwrites prefecture

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.360

therefore<00:01:19.480> linimo<00:01:19.870> was<00:01:20.170> rebuilt<00:01:20.590> as<00:01:21.010> new

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
therefore linimo was rebuilt as new

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
therefore linimo was rebuilt as new
transportation<00:01:22.560> at<00:01:23.560> first<00:01:24.210> as<00:01:25.210> a

on exceeding capacity on linimo
the<00:02:38.220> trouble<00:02:38.640> is<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:39.210> we<00:02:39.360> could<00:02:39.570> only

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870
