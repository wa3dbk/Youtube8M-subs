00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
three cases with metals in them now i

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.870 
three cases with metals in them now i
will<00:01:58.380> note<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.649> none<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.070> these<00:01:59.219> cases<00:01:59.490> seem

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
will note that none of these cases seem

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.670 
will note that none of these cases seem
to<00:02:00.030> match<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.509> one<00:02:00.719> case<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.229> seems<00:02:01.409> to

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
to match the one case that seems to

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.440 
to match the one case that seems to
match<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.159> closest<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:03.030> one<00:02:03.240> right<00:02:03.270> here

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
match the closest is this one right here

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.889 
match the closest is this one right here
and<00:02:04.280> but<00:02:05.280> but<00:02:05.460> but<00:02:05.700> if<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.880> look<00:02:06.030> at<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.600> do<00:02:06.869> a

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
and but but but if you look at and do a

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.830 
and but but but if you look at and do a
comparison<00:02:07.439> on<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.860> images<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:09.030> top<00:02:09.270> left<00:02:09.629> of

that image where you see those those

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.520 
that image where you see those those
blue<00:02:11.879> metals<00:02:12.239> or<00:02:12.390> whatever<00:02:12.629> they<00:02:13.110> don't<00:02:13.230> match

blue metals or whatever they don't match

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.880 
blue metals or whatever they don't match
with

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
with

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.670 
with

the call of duty site and again I'm just

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.970 
the call of duty site and again I'm just
looking<00:02:18.569> and<00:02:18.750> neither<00:02:19.050> do<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.410> frames<00:02:19.709> the

looking and neither do the frames the

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.640 
looking and neither do the frames the
frames<00:02:20.250> these<00:02:20.580> frames<00:02:20.850> are<00:02:21.060> much<00:02:21.300> larger<00:02:21.650> it

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
frames these frames are much larger it

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.680 
frames these frames are much larger it
looks<00:02:22.890> almost<00:02:23.100> like<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.459> regular<00:02:24.180> picture

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
looks almost like a regular picture

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.710 
looks almost like a regular picture
frame<00:02:25.020> that<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.230> hang<00:02:25.500> in<00:02:25.650> your<00:02:25.680> wall<00:02:26.060> on<00:02:27.060> on

frame that you hang in your wall on on

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.190 
frame that you hang in your wall on on
the<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.470> image<00:02:28.770> from<00:02:29.010> call<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.340> duty<00:02:29.900> but<00:02:30.900> it

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
the the image from call of duty but it

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.890 
the the image from call of duty but it
does<00:02:31.560> bear<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.370> striking<00:02:32.730> resemblance<00:02:32.940> that

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
does bear a striking resemblance that

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.770 
does bear a striking resemblance that
the<00:02:34.020> rest<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.350> its<00:02:34.770> rest<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.370> us<00:02:35.490> the<00:02:36.330> rest<00:02:36.600> of

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
the rest of its rest of us the rest of

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.520 
the rest of its rest of us the rest of
it<00:02:36.900> aside<00:02:37.620> from<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.220> top<00:02:38.490> left<00:02:38.880> part<00:02:39.320> seems<00:02:40.320> to

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
it aside from the top left part seems to

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.520 
it aside from the top left part seems to
match<00:02:40.709> now<00:02:41.640> also<00:02:41.910> in<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.300> same<00:02:42.480> thread<00:02:43.140> they

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
match now also in the same thread they

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.600 
match now also in the same thread they
were<00:02:43.590> talking<00:02:43.920> about<00:02:44.270> this<00:02:45.770> metal<00:02:46.770> case<00:02:47.160> with

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
were talking about this metal case with

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.540 
were talking about this metal case with
metals<00:02:48.000> in<00:02:48.150> its<00:02:48.330> existing<00:02:49.260> on<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.920> zombie<00:02:50.220> map

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
metals in its existing on the zombie map

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.570 
metals in its existing on the zombie map
5<00:02:50.880> so<00:02:51.209> let's<00:02:51.390> take<00:02:51.600> a<00:02:51.630> look<00:02:51.840> at<00:02:51.959> that<00:02:52.430> so<00:02:53.430> if<00:02:53.489> you

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
5 so let's take a look at that so if you

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.270 
5 so let's take a look at that so if you
actually<00:02:53.730> go<00:02:54.120> up<00:02:54.150> into<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:55.440> upper<00:02:55.830> level<00:02:56.130> the

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
actually go up into the upper level the

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.060 
actually go up into the upper level the
war<00:02:56.489> room<00:02:56.720> down<00:02:57.720> this<00:02:57.900> far<00:02:58.170> corner<00:02:58.680> you'll<00:02:58.980> see

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
war room down this far corner you'll see

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.640 
war room down this far corner you'll see
that<00:02:59.489> there's<00:03:00.150> an<00:03:00.330> office<00:03:00.690> area<00:03:00.870> in<00:03:01.200> here<00:03:01.500> and

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
that there's an office area in here and

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.440 
that there's an office area in here and
on<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.489> wall<00:03:02.670> i'm<00:03:02.760> just<00:03:02.940> trying<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.150> knock<00:03:03.300> out

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
on the wall i'm just trying to knock out

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.729 
on the wall i'm just trying to knock out
all<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.600> glass<00:03:03.780> out<00:03:04.050> of<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.260> way<00:03:04.380> so<00:03:04.410> we<00:03:04.620> can

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
all the glass out of the way so we can

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.370 
all the glass out of the way so we can
get<00:03:04.860> a<00:03:04.920> clearer<00:03:05.430> picture<00:03:05.870> so<00:03:06.870> this<00:03:07.019> is<00:03:07.050> on<00:03:07.260> the

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
get a clearer picture so this is on the

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.800 
get a clearer picture so this is on the
zombie<00:03:07.739> Matt<00:03:07.890> 5<00:03:08.160> so<00:03:08.430> there's<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.820> same<00:03:09.090> the

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
zombie Matt 5 so there's the same the

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.340 
zombie Matt 5 so there's the same the
same<00:03:10.040> basic<00:03:11.040> case<00:03:11.510> two<00:03:12.510> of<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.750> same<00:03:12.900> cases

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
same basic case two of the same cases

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.840 
same basic case two of the same cases
out<00:03:13.470> of<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.680> three<00:03:13.920> that<00:03:14.070> we<00:03:14.190> saw<00:03:14.370> in<00:03:14.400> the

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
out of the three that we saw in the

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.780 
out of the three that we saw in the
campaign<00:03:15.269> so<00:03:16.050> and<00:03:16.800> again<00:03:16.920> that<00:03:17.370> one<00:03:17.580> on<00:03:17.700> the

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
campaign so and again that one on the

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.270 
campaign so and again that one on the
right<00:03:18.000> it<00:03:18.239> looks<00:03:18.480> exactly<00:03:18.810> identical<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.769> the

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
right it looks exactly identical to the

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.060 
right it looks exactly identical to the
one<00:03:20.489> from<00:03:21.000> revelations<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:22.170> top<00:03:22.470> left<00:03:22.769> corner

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
one from revelations the top left corner

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.800 
one from revelations the top left corner
of<00:03:23.190> it<00:03:23.400> doesn't<00:03:23.760> really<00:03:23.940> match<00:03:24.239> that<00:03:24.660> you

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
of it doesn't really match that you

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.240 
of it doesn't really match that you
don't<00:03:24.989> have<00:03:25.200> that<00:03:25.470> sort<00:03:25.709> of<00:03:25.829> triangular

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
don't have that sort of triangular

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.660 
don't have that sort of triangular
shaped<00:03:26.670> string<00:03:27.630> of<00:03:27.780> blue<00:03:27.989> blue<00:03:28.709> ribbons<00:03:29.430> or

blue<00:03:29.850> medals<00:03:30.239> presumably<00:03:31.019> that<00:03:31.970> and<00:03:32.970> you

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
blue medals presumably that and you

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.360 
blue medals presumably that and you
don't<00:03:33.239> see<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:33.630> in<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.320> image<00:03:34.590> from<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:34.950> the

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
don't see that in the image from the the

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.030 
don't see that in the image from the the
cod<00:03:35.549> site<00:03:35.989> so<00:03:36.989> unfortunately<00:03:37.709> we<00:03:37.769> don't

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
cod site so unfortunately we don't

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.130 
cod site so unfortunately we don't
really<00:03:38.250> have<00:03:38.519> much<00:03:38.820> to<00:03:39.030> go<00:03:39.180> on<00:03:39.209> but<00:03:39.390> it's<00:03:39.989> the

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
really have much to go on but it's the

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.620 
really have much to go on but it's the
same<00:03:40.320> sort<00:03:40.620> of<00:03:40.880> that's<00:03:41.880> not<00:03:42.060> really<00:03:42.299> even

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
same sort of that's not really even

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.509 
same sort of that's not really even
first<00:03:43.530> person<00:03:43.980> that<00:03:44.010> you're<00:03:44.160> looking<00:03:44.430> at

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
first person that you're looking at

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.460 
first person that you're looking at
because<00:03:44.670> you're<00:03:44.940> seeing<00:03:45.269> his<00:03:45.840> shoulder<00:03:46.350> his

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
because you're seeing his shoulder his

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.400 
because you're seeing his shoulder his
left<00:03:46.799> shoulder<00:03:47.630> presumably<00:03:48.630> so<00:03:48.989> it's<00:03:49.200> not

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
left shoulder presumably so it's not

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.979 
left shoulder presumably so it's not
it's<00:03:50.100> not<00:03:50.250> doesn't<00:03:50.940> really<00:03:51.120> look<00:03:51.420> like<00:03:51.480> you're

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
it's not doesn't really look like you're

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.500 
it's not doesn't really look like you're
in<00:03:52.140> first<00:03:52.380> person<00:03:52.709> so<00:03:53.130> maybe<00:03:53.910> it's<00:03:54.120> not<00:03:54.209> from

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
in first person so maybe it's not from

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.580 
in first person so maybe it's not from
the<00:03:54.630> campaign<00:03:55.019> where<00:03:55.290> you're<00:03:55.440> actually

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
the campaign where you're actually

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.970 
the campaign where you're actually
playing<00:03:56.340> as<00:03:56.579> that<00:03:56.790> person<00:03:57.680> but<00:03:58.680> it<00:03:58.799> does<00:03:58.950> look

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
playing as that person but it does look

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.550 
playing as that person but it does look
if<00:03:59.340> his<00:03:59.670> hand<00:03:59.910> was<00:04:00.060> just<00:04:00.120> there<00:04:00.510> and<00:04:00.750> minus

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
if his hand was just there and minus

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.350 
if his hand was just there and minus
that<00:04:01.769> that<00:04:02.250> blue<00:04:02.400> partner<00:04:02.760> was<00:04:02.880> just<00:04:03.030> shifted

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
that that blue partner was just shifted

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.640 
that that blue partner was just shifted
over<00:04:03.450> then<00:04:03.720> would<00:04:03.870> it<00:04:03.900> look<00:04:04.200> almost<00:04:04.380> exactly

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
over then would it look almost exactly

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.039 
over then would it look almost exactly
like<00:04:05.239> Mason<00:04:06.239> did<00:04:06.269> when<00:04:06.630> he<00:04:06.660> was<00:04:06.810> walking

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
like Mason did when he was walking

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.479 
like Mason did when he was walking
through<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:09.230> the<00:04:10.230> corridors<00:04:10.680> there<00:04:10.950> and<00:04:11.250> in

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
through the the corridors there and in

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.810 
through the the corridors there and in
looking<00:04:12.000> at<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.440> those<00:04:13.519> cases<00:04:14.519> with<00:04:14.730> the

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
looking at the those cases with the

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.240 
looking at the those cases with the
metals<00:04:15.090> in<00:04:15.209> them<00:04:15.329> so<00:04:15.600> that's<00:04:16.410> that's<00:04:17.010> all<00:04:17.220> I

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
metals in them so that's that's all I

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.090 
metals in them so that's that's all I
got<00:04:17.510> who<00:04:18.510> knows<00:04:18.750> again<00:04:19.200> an<00:04:19.470> older<00:04:19.829> looking

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
got who knows again an older looking

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.770 
got who knows again an older looking
hand<00:04:20.430> he's<00:04:20.760> got<00:04:20.940> something<00:04:21.239> around<00:04:21.390> the<00:04:21.539> wrist

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
hand he's got something around the wrist

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.070 
hand he's got something around the wrist
bloom<00:04:22.680> possiblys<00:04:23.640> in<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.300> hospital<00:04:24.780> does<00:04:24.990> it

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
bloom possiblys in the hospital does it

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.830 
bloom possiblys in the hospital does it
make<00:04:25.200> sense<00:04:25.229> that<00:04:25.590> there<00:04:25.800> would<00:04:25.890> be<00:04:25.919> a

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
make sense that there would be a

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.740 
make sense that there would be a
frame<00:04:27.590> with<00:04:27.889> war<00:04:28.250> medals<00:04:28.639> hanging<00:04:29.570> on<00:04:29.630> the

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
frame with war medals hanging on the

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.659 
frame with war medals hanging on the
wall<00:04:29.960> in<00:04:30.110> the<00:04:30.169> hospital<00:04:30.710> but<00:04:30.889> hey<00:04:31.460> you<00:04:31.520> never

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
wall in the hospital but hey you never

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.100 
wall in the hospital but hey you never
know<00:04:31.880> maybe<00:04:32.030> it's<00:04:32.270> a<00:04:32.300> some<00:04:32.690> sort<00:04:32.840> of<00:04:32.930> military

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
know maybe it's a some sort of military

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.290 
know maybe it's a some sort of military
hospital<00:04:33.680> who<00:04:33.770> knows<00:04:33.949> that's<00:04:34.790> all<00:04:35.030> I<00:04:35.060> got<00:04:35.270> so

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
hospital who knows that's all I got so

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.050 
hospital who knows that's all I got so
