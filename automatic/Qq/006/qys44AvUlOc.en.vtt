00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.570
 hello good brothers here is that in a 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.220
 new video and I come here very motivated 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.870
 because I get some news of the new 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.190
 useful color you can see the title call of 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:17.060
 duty ghost and I do not bring it from the 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.400
 director who is a very famous youtube in 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.380
 well-known united states and so 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.910
 thanks and right sections of the serve the 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.369
 idea of ​​doing the inspections is my 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.760
 idol I would like to be like him as soon as 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.849
 to videos and as to mates that is a 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.210
 fucking monster in all kinds of things with 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.210
 numbers 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.239
 well it turns out that he knows you have 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:44.490
 a friend who works on the engine 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:46.800
 graphics of the new call of duty and 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.960
 and as you can see it has several sections 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.540
 of creating a game both the 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.610
 aesthetic part as part of the 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.740
 weapons like the graphic engine that are the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.080
 movements and all these then this 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.720
 friend in whom he fully trusts says 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.600
 that he would even leave his life in his hands 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.220
 so I trust him because he was 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.410
 counting things not many because he has not 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.530
 wanted to unveil everything or could not 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:13.050
 unveil everything but he has done it so that 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.730
 know the people then I want 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.870
 seize this moment and they 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:20.990
 I bring to you so you know 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.430
 I did not feel week with the last ones will not be 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.770
 a modern warfare 4 as expected 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.470
 already has this franchise exploited 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.600
 then it will be productive before call 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.570
 call of duty phantoms but they changed it 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:37.450
 to ghosts because it seemed so much prettier 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.450
 soundly with only 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.659
 and they may change the name but what 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.929
 most likely do not change it that 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.939
 stay with taste and will make sure the 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.130
 name in May the 1st of May the most 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:54.549
 likely to be when the first one comes out 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.729
 trailer as they have told you or is not it 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:00.340
 totally true but it is very likely 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:04.299
 that is 1 on 2 and 3 is the 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.729
 the month before but by that date it will be 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.890
 the next trailer we're going to talk a 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.300
 little of the game and the theme works in 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.550
 the future may 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.950
 at the end of the century you can walk from 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.630
 centuries I have no idea but it will be with 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.090
 current weapons and this surely is 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.350
 because a law will come out in the campaign in 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.130
 which will allow us to make weapons 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:29.490
 futuristic or water yes because it would be 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.020
 prohibited for being very dangerous or with 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.420
 maybe there was a nuclear disaster a 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.680
 technological disaster and we have to 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.210
 go back to the current weapons to be able 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.070
 defend ourselves 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.110
 the loading screens of the game do not 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.580
 I mean in the campaign but in the 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.260
 multiplayer now for example you have 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.770
 could see the beginning of the video at 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.320
 being that the photo of the map 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.090
 and loading which you start to eat 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.490
 the snot when it happens then 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.850
 they will have dynamic loading screens that 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.740
 they will be moving not you but there will be a 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.960
 video of a guy moving in infiltrating 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.700
 inside the base with your team 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.530
 escaping by helicopter escaping the 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.750
 business dogs maybe the other team 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.330
 is trying to block that step 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.660
 to face you face off against you 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.840
 you do not know very well but it will have 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:22.500
 load screens talking about the engine already 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.620
 graphic in one of the movements 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.690
 new will be to throw yourself in iron good in 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.270
 iron not but sliding down the 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.830
 floor of ass or knees at the same time 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.270
 you shoot or you can shoot or not 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.400
 shoot this seems to me a movement 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.930
 logical and you can do real life and 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.610
 it is very practical will have to be a 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.780
 shot very inaccurate because if not 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.030
 everyone would be using it 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.760
 constantly because it 's a body 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.500
 small that moves fast shooting 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.970
 Having an accurate shape will be very difficult 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.350
 of killing so they will have to do it a 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.030
 little precise 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.990
 the dolphin since then surely 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.760
 will be removed and there will be a movement that 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.070
 will be to look around the corners I do not know 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.550
 if it will be only for pc it is possible that 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.860
 also for the consoles since 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.260
 new consoles will have new buttons 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.819
 example play 4 as you can have 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.999
 seen already 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.590
 in the videos of play 4 will have that 

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:14.939
 touch screen surely with them you 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.350
 can do certain movements like 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:18.449
 East look through the corners 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.980
 just with your head to cover the 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.870
 body 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.000
 and you can also do another one that is 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.550
 lie on the ground and spin like a 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.660
 croquette for example if you are in the middle 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.520
 of a hallway shooting with 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.770
 light machine gun for putting a 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.830
 example you can shoot you can 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.990
 hit that button and you turn to the 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.940
 sides towards a wall or something and 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.040
 then cover you it seems a moment 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.210
 very logical also in real life and with 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.260
 the new buttons of the controls 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.720
 surely it can also be done 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.180
 special operations will be 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.930
 replaced have not said because it must be 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:56.390
 because they have very little very little fame very 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.430
 few hands very very bad fame almost nobody 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.050
 play some of them when you get bored 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.270
 but very few people play jazz because 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.670
 They are very boring and it will be for something new 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.470
 they have not said they are someone else 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:10.040
 kind of mini - games surely but not 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.260
 have specified that the maps are more 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.150
 destructive easier to destroy good 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.940
 in fact they are not easy to destroy they are 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.770
 impossible - windows and cars 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.110
 then they will want to do that you can 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.030
 destroy walls and things like that 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.680
 battlefield type that maybe if 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.060
 you destroy a helicopter with a stinger 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.030
 you can crash building control 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.710
 and that it falls down is wall and I think that 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.950
 It would be interesting if you could kill 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.810
 people with these things but it would not be something 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.040
 that I would explode because I know it's something 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.370
 that is successful but I do not 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.490
 they would explode 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.620
 and the last thing we have about this this 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:48.449
 game is that they will come out in the new 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:51.120
 generation of the xbox 360 and play 4 ipc no 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:54.900
 will come out neither for play 3 nor for xbox 360 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:57.370
 I think 360 before 720 and well this has 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.080
 been everything for today 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.790
 there's not much more to talk about 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:04.840
 I have a desire to know if this is 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:06.910
 truth if this is true stop me and I 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.550
 I fully trust in director I hope that 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:12.850
 be true all that everything that we 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:15.280
 has counted and looks very good all 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.780
 because making a new console is going to 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.040
 try to implement new things 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.600
 I hope they bring again the 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.100
 specialist have not said anything about 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.040
 specialist mode has not said anything of 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:26.350
 the low rats have not said anything 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:29.710
 on maps except those that are 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:32.770
 destroyed basically everything that I have 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:34.419
 brought is what they have said and good 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.310
 share this video so that a lot 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:37.750
 people find out about this may be left 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.840
 like a fool if it is not true what 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.389
 happens but if it is true what happens 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:45.190
 they will know that there was someone who knew that 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:47.430
 how was the wolf going to be with the duty and 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.430
 good 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.750
 goodbye
