to<00:00:49.469> promote<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.950> pawn<00:00:50.160> he<00:00:50.489> has<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.940> push<00:00:51.510> it

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
to promote the pawn he has to push it

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.389 
to promote the pawn he has to push it
forward<00:00:51.809> but<00:00:52.140> he<00:00:52.170> can't<00:00:52.530> just<00:00:52.739> push<00:00:53.250> it

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.139 
forward but he can't just push it
forward<00:00:53.809> because<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:55.879> loses<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.000> pawn

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
forward because that loses the pawn

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.630 
forward because that loses the pawn
immediately<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.230> draw<00:00:58.440> neither<00:00:59.190> King<00:00:59.489> can

immediately and to draw neither King can
make<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.910> other<00:01:04.549> so<00:01:05.549> he<00:01:05.670> has<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.909> try<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.119> move

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
make the other so he has to try to move

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.020 
make the other so he has to try to move
his<00:01:06.420> King<00:01:06.600> forward<00:01:07.369> to<00:01:08.369> defend<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:10.670> but<00:01:11.670> blacks

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
White's King through it's gonna move to

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.120 
White's King through it's gonna move to
block<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.659> now<00:01:18.659> White's<00:01:19.409> King<00:01:19.710> can't<00:01:19.979> move

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
block and now White's King can't move

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.530 
block and now White's King can't move
forward<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.549> can't<00:01:20.729> go<00:01:20.880> here<00:01:21.180> King's

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
forward you can't go here King's

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.679 
forward you can't go here King's
attacking<00:01:21.990> can't<00:01:22.320> go<00:01:22.409> here<00:01:22.650> Kings<00:01:22.890> attacking

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
attacking can't go here Kings attacking

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.100 
attacking can't go here Kings attacking
and<00:01:24.689> he<00:01:24.750> can't<00:01:24.960> go<00:01:25.110> here<00:01:25.560> because<00:01:26.659> then<00:01:27.659> this

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
and he can't go here because then this

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.870 
and he can't go here because then this
pawn<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.530> not<00:01:28.680> able<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.100> be<00:01:29.220> defended<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.729> it's

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
pawn is not able to be defended and it's

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.060 
pawn is not able to be defended and it's
gonna<00:01:29.970> be<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> draw<00:01:30.420> again<00:01:33.049> so<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.079> can<00:01:34.890> might

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
gonna be a draw again so I can might

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:42.399 
gonna be a draw again so I can might
move<00:01:35.189> back<00:01:35.460> blacks<00:01:36.210> King<00:01:36.420> moves<00:01:36.720> forward

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.700 

and<00:01:43.210> you<00:01:44.210> know<00:01:44.270> why<00:01:44.780> it<00:01:44.840> may<00:01:45.049> push<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:45.530> black

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
and you know why it may push the black

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.340 
and you know why it may push the black
king<00:01:46.009> down<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.789> board<00:01:49.840> this<00:01:50.840> positioning

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
king down the board this positioning

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.940 
king down the board this positioning
will<00:01:51.619> actually<00:01:52.039> end<00:01:52.189> up<00:01:52.310> drawn<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:54.560> correct

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
will actually end up drawn the correct

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.819 
will actually end up drawn the correct
technique<00:01:55.369> for<00:01:55.670> black<00:01:55.850> is<00:01:56.439> to<00:01:57.439> stay<00:01:57.619> in

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
technique for black is to stay in

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.460 
technique for black is to stay in
opposition<00:01:58.159> to<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:58.579> white<00:01:58.789> king<00:01:59.210> so<00:01:59.600> the

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
opposition to the white king so the

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.749 
opposition to the white king so the
Kings<00:02:00.649> are<00:02:00.799> currently<00:02:01.100> in<00:02:01.220> opposition<00:02:01.490> you

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
Kings are currently in opposition you

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.330 
Kings are currently in opposition you
can<00:02:01.970> see<00:02:02.149> with<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.750> pawn<00:02:02.899> between<00:02:03.110> them<00:02:03.439> black

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
can see with the pawn between them black

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.109 
can see with the pawn between them black
king<00:02:04.610> should<00:02:04.789> move<00:02:05.000> back<00:02:05.210> in<00:02:05.420> a<00:02:05.840> straight<00:02:06.079> line

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
king should move back in a straight line

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.580 
king should move back in a straight line
to<00:02:08.119> keep<00:02:08.269> his<00:02:08.360> options<00:02:08.450> open<00:02:08.810> whether<00:02:09.229> white

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
to keep his options open whether white

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.729 
to keep his options open whether white
goes<00:02:09.800> here<00:02:10.250> or<00:02:10.489> here<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:12.110> black<00:02:12.319> King<00:02:12.590> can

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
goes here or here the black King can

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.250 
goes here or here the black King can
always<00:02:13.010> just<00:02:13.220> move<00:02:13.550> in<00:02:13.670> opposition<00:02:14.260> white

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
always just move in opposition white

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.330 
always just move in opposition white
doesn't<00:02:15.470> have<00:02:15.650> anything<00:02:15.830> better<00:02:16.160> than

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
doesn't have anything better than

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.600 
doesn't have anything better than
playing<00:02:16.580> check<00:02:17.620> black<00:02:18.620> goes<00:02:18.950> here<00:02:19.220> why<00:02:19.489> it's

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
playing check black goes here why it's

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.940 
playing check black goes here why it's
forced<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:20.030> move<00:02:20.120> here<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:20.360> defend<00:02:20.950> black

promote it an important exception to

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.090 
promote it an important exception to
this<00:04:23.060> rule<00:04:23.180> is<00:04:23.710> when<00:04:24.710> you're<00:04:24.830> talking<00:04:25.039> about

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
this rule is when you're talking about

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
an edge pawn so let's say we have this

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.960 
an edge pawn so let's say we have this
position<00:04:32.410> no<00:04:33.410> matter<00:04:33.590> what<00:04:33.830> black<00:04:34.310> can<00:04:34.639> always

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970

just stay on this edge he'll never be

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.159 
just stay on this edge he'll never be
driven<00:04:37.070> out<00:04:37.449> you<00:04:38.449> know<00:04:38.570> let's<00:04:38.720> say<00:04:38.870> he<00:04:39.020> just

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
driven out you know let's say he just

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:47.000 
driven out you know let's say he just
goes<00:04:39.470> here

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.770 

you<00:04:47.490> know<00:04:47.610> I<00:04:47.640> can<00:04:47.940> never<00:04:48.030> get<00:04:48.270> him<00:04:48.360> out<00:04:48.480> of<00:04:48.540> this

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
you know I can never get him out of this

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:54.020 
you know I can never get him out of this
corner<00:04:52.160> so<00:04:53.160> you<00:04:53.190> can<00:04:53.400> just<00:04:53.550> stay<00:04:53.820> there

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
corner so you can just stay there

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.110 
corner so you can just stay there
forever<00:04:54.180> and<00:04:55.430> you<00:04:56.430> know<00:04:56.460> that'll<00:04:56.940> be<00:04:57.090> a

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
forever and you know that'll be a

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:06.620 
forever and you know that'll be a
stalemate<00:05:02.780> and<00:05:03.780> you<00:05:04.290> can<00:05:04.410> see<00:05:05.450> black<00:05:06.450> will

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
stalemate and you can see black will

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.990 
stalemate and you can see black will
never<00:05:06.780> be<00:05:06.930> forced<00:05:07.230> out<00:05:07.290> of<00:05:07.350> the<00:05:07.560> corner<00:05:07.860> so<00:05:08.160> if

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
never be forced out of the corner so if

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.290 
never be forced out of the corner so if
it<00:05:09.360> you<00:05:09.570> have<00:05:09.690> an<00:05:09.810> edge<00:05:09.930> upon<00:05:10.430> that<00:05:11.430> is<00:05:11.700> not

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
it you have an edge upon that is not

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.660 
it you have an edge upon that is not
winning<00:05:12.870> for<00:05:13.200> the<00:05:13.800> side<00:05:14.010> with<00:05:14.190> the<00:05:14.280> pond<00:05:14.460> it's

winning for the side with the pond it's

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:24.140 
winning for the side with the pond it's
always<00:05:14.910> going<00:05:15.090> to<00:05:15.210> be<00:05:15.300> a<00:05:15.330> draw<00:05:22.880> so<00:05:23.880> that's<00:05:24.060> a

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
always going to be a draw so that's a

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.030 
always going to be a draw so that's a
basic<00:05:24.450> overview<00:05:24.540> of<00:05:24.900> King<00:05:25.440> and<00:05:25.590> one<00:05:25.740> pond
