00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.870
 When you start GTA 5, you still get the error ERR_NO_LAUNCHER 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.219
 Let's start with litsuhi. 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.821
 If you bought discs that you cannot run, then 

00:00:15.821 --> 00:00:19.119
 This is due to the high quality of PC gaming. 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.640
 To solve the problem, you need to pull out the folder with 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.109
 updates, delete and reinstall the game, return the folder to its place. 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.169
 When you start the game, it downloads the missing files and the game 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:30.289
 should start. 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.760
 If you downloaded your litsuhu directly from Rockstar servers, 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.579
 then the problem again is that you are a pekboyarin. 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.820
 The fact is that Rockstar did not think of anything better than how to cut 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.030
 the game is huge pieces of 5 gigabytes, and if at the moment 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.629
 jumps close for example a window - then they start to climb 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.250
 errors and files come broken. 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.989
 Neither the downloader, nor the game itself check them in any way. 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:55.690
 integrity. 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.200
 In this case, you need to either download these 65 GB 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.110
 several times before the victory, or use the torrent. 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.440
 It just checks files, and pumps if necessary. 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.730
 Yes, dear girls, your toy will be yours 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.440
 download from torrents. 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.520
 Another way to win ERR_NO_LAUNCHER - run the game 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.980
 from admin 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.120
 Another common cause 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.550
 errors ERR_NO_LAUNCHER - old versions of a computer 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.550
 Visual Studio. 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.340
 You need to remove all packages until 2010 exclusively. 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.670
 After which you will need to put these here - this 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.890
 .NET Framework 4.5, 64-bit Visual Studio 2012 and Update 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:37.890
 DirectX. 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.240
 In rare cases, you must also install the Update. 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.640
 MFC security systems. 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.310
 Another reason for the error ERR_NO_LAUNCHER - you run 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.330
 the game is not through launcher.exe, but by some other file, 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.990
 for example GTAV.exe Another cause 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.570
 ERR_NO_LAUNCHER errors are an attempt to launch a game from a folder in 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.820
 which way there are Russian letters. 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.040
 The game from there will never start. 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.670
 Need to rename the folder in English. 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.240
 Also, do not forget that your user folder 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.860
 Windows should be in English. 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.970
 Not only the username and account, but also a folder with documents! 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.820
 Well, the main reason for the error ERR_NO_LAUNCHER is in the folder 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.000
 There is no crack with the game, that is, there is a 3dmgame.dll file. On this screenshot 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.140
 with the Russian folder quack either, that is, the game is not 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.000
 will never start. 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.340
 In order for the crack in the folder to appear, you need to disable 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.159
 antivirus, and re-download this file 3dmgame.dll Bye 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:45.840
 you do not solve the problem with the antivirus file to pump 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.019
 meaningless. 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.620
 Especially uporotyh trying to deceive me without understanding 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.299
 with an antivirus that deletes a file and enclose it 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.939
 This file 3dmgame.dll under other names, for example 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:07.780
 3dmgamedll.dll or 3dmgame (1) .dll, and then amplify what they did 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.300
 according to the instructions, you d'Artagnan, and Izya fag. 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.590
 You are not fooling me, but yourself. In order to repel you 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:24.400
 feelings of your uniqueness, I will simply show 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.439
 screenshots of exactly the same wise men as you and say that 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:39.340
 in them 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.459
 no crack 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:43.459
 No crack. 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.889
 No crack. 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:48.779
 No crack. 

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:51.670
 No crack. 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.680
 As you can see, the antivirus turned out to be the most effective tool. 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.299
 anti-piracy in the ranks of stupid schoolchildren. 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.049
 There is no crack because the antivirus is not disabled. 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.639
 Even if it seems to you that you have disabled the antivirus, 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:11.980
 and there is no file - it means you have not disabled the antivirus. 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.829
 Even if it seems to you that there is no anti-virus at all 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:18.580
 computer - and the game gives an error ERR_NO_LAUNCHER, it means 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.790
 there is an antivirus, and you have not disabled it. 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.350
 Sometimes it happens that there is a 3dmgame.dll file in the folder, 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.761
 but the game still gives out ERR_NO_LAUNCHER - this means that 

00:04:29.761 --> 00:04:33.570
 The antivirus did not delete it but simply blocks this file. 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.000
 How to deal with antivirus? 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.390
 Well, first of all, click on the flagstaff-kun next to 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.460
 for hours, and open a security center or center 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.320
 notifications and find security in it - in short, I 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.070
 In this your govnorussky interface is not strong, look for 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.070
 yourself. 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:57.130
 Windows has a built-in antivirus - Windows Defender. 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.720
 He should turn off the fuck. 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.900
 I emphasize, not a firewall, but a protector. 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.470
 Although a firewall would also be nice to disable. 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.810
 Well, now go on to disable the antivirus, 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:11.950
 which you have installed. 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.600
 It must either be deleted altogether, or the file should be pulled out of quarantine, 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.300
 or add the entire game folder to the exceptions - in short 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.110
 Fuck yourself, ponadavili any shit, now look for. 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.180
 Here I picked up screenshots from a variety of popular 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:36.890
 antivirus software - Esset Nod, AVG, Avira, Microsoft Security MS 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.801
 Essentials and so on - with approximate places of the interface, where 

00:05:40.801 --> 00:05:41.801
 you need to search. 

00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:42.960
 Fuck. 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.890
 File with crack 3dmgame.dll need to download only after that 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.050
 how do you deal with antiviruses that remove it or 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.050
 blocking. 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.590
 The file can be downloaded from the same torrent with the game, 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.410
 noting at the start of the torrent only this file, and from the rest 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.260
 remove the jackdaws so as not to re-pump all 65 gigs. 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.020
 Remember - until the folder is unlocked 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:13.250
 file 3dmgame.dll - the game will not work. 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:20.150
 You can lie to me that everything was done according to the instructions. 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.370
 you can beg me to help, you can run around the street 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.810
 with bare ass, you can suck me - but while you 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.210
 do not understand the antivirus - the game will not work.
