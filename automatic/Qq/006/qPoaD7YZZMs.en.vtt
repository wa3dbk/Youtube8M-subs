00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
something she came up with something

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.130 
something she came up with something
that<00:02:47.760> was<00:02:48.000> her<00:02:48.209> vision<00:02:48.390> after<00:02:48.810> singing<00:02:49.080> the

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140

room<00:02:49.319> and<00:02:49.790> we<00:02:50.790> kind<00:02:51.030> of<00:02:51.090> had<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:51.239> reinvent<00:02:51.629> the

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
room and we kind of had to reinvent the

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.360 
room and we kind of had to reinvent the
wheel<00:02:51.900> so<00:02:52.200> there<00:02:52.590> were<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.680> lot<00:02:52.709> of<00:02:52.890> logistics

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
wheel so there were a lot of logistics
