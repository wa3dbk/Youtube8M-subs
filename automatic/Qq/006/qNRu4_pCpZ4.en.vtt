very<00:02:03.010> thick<00:02:03.340> and<00:02:03.550> probably<00:02:04.390> about<00:02:04.600> 20<00:02:05.350> inches

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
very thick and probably about 20 inches

very thick and probably about 20 inches
long<00:02:05.680> maybe<00:02:06.070> 21<00:02:06.490> and<00:02:06.910> it's<00:02:07.750> a<00:02:07.870> female<00:02:08.140> because

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
long maybe 21 and it's a female because

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.139 
long maybe 21 and it's a female because
you<00:02:08.769> can<00:02:08.890> see<00:02:09.009> it<00:02:09.069> has<00:02:09.190> a<00:02:09.220> very<00:02:09.459> small<00:02:09.580> head<00:02:09.970> in

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
you can see it has a very small head in

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.600 
you can see it has a very small head in
proportion<00:02:10.629> to<00:02:10.780> its<00:02:10.810> body<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:11.500> it<00:02:12.340> nailed

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
of the lure in its mouth you know that

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.420 
of the lure in its mouth you know that
it<00:02:16.959> really<00:02:17.170> wanted<00:02:17.800> to<00:02:17.860> get<00:02:18.099> it

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
it really wanted to get it

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.309 
it really wanted to get it
so<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:18.730> hit<00:02:18.849> at<00:02:18.970> high<00:02:19.150> speed<00:02:19.540> barb<00:02:20.050> could<00:02:20.260> I

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
so it hit at high speed barb could I

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:21.949 
so it hit at high speed barb could I
have<00:02:20.440> one<00:02:20.470> of<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.739> pyres<00:02:20.980> that<00:02:21.280> are<00:02:21.400> there

typical<00:03:17.830> Barbra<00:03:18.190> that<00:03:18.370> most<00:03:18.610> people<00:03:18.940> would

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120

typical Barbra that most people would
use<00:03:19.360> but<00:03:20.050> it's<00:03:20.320> not<00:03:20.560> as<00:03:20.740> sensitive<00:03:21.220> it's

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
use but it's not as sensitive it's

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.130 
use but it's not as sensitive it's
perfect<00:03:21.820> for<00:03:21.880> younger<00:03:22.209> kids<00:03:22.360> so<00:03:22.780> because<00:03:23.020> it

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
perfect for younger kids so because it

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.720 
perfect for younger kids so because it
adds<00:03:23.290> more<00:03:23.560> weight<00:03:23.800> to<00:03:23.830> your<00:03:24.130> line<00:03:24.340> and<00:03:24.550> it's

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
adds more weight to your line and it's

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.570 
adds more weight to your line and it's
easier<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.240> cast<00:03:25.709> this<00:03:26.709> one<00:03:26.950> Barbara<00:03:27.370> on<00:03:27.459> the

easier to cast this one Barbara on the
other<00:03:27.700> hand<00:03:27.970> adds<00:03:28.240> a<00:03:28.450> lot<00:03:28.600> less<00:03:28.959> weight<00:03:29.260> to

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290

your<00:03:29.590> line<00:03:29.800> and<00:03:30.040> it's<00:03:30.340> a<00:03:30.459> lot<00:03:30.640> more<00:03:30.820> sensitive

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240

what<00:03:31.810> I<00:03:31.840> like<00:03:32.050> about<00:03:32.200> both<00:03:32.530> floats<00:03:32.920> Amy<00:03:33.490> is

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
what I like about both floats Amy is

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.910 
what I like about both floats Amy is
that<00:03:33.820> they're<00:03:34.510> very<00:03:34.780> easy<00:03:35.019> to<00:03:35.170> move<00:03:35.440> around<00:03:35.590> on

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
that they're very easy to move around on

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.040 
that they're very easy to move around on
the<00:03:36.040> line<00:03:36.250> with<00:03:36.850> the<00:03:37.030> bobber<00:03:37.269> because<00:03:37.870> it's

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
the line with the bobber because it's

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.570 
the line with the bobber because it's
got<00:03:38.200> the<00:03:38.320> spring<00:03:38.590> mechanism<00:03:38.739> just<00:03:39.340> push<00:03:39.550> down

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
got the spring mechanism just push down

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.090 
got the spring mechanism just push down
on<00:03:39.850> the<00:03:40.090> top<00:03:40.300> and<00:03:40.600> you<00:03:41.019> can<00:03:41.170> slide<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:41.800> float

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
on the top and you can slide the float

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.220 
on the top and you can slide the float
up<00:03:42.340> and<00:03:42.489> down<00:03:42.610> the<00:03:42.850> line<00:03:43.060> and<00:03:43.330> the<00:03:43.720> same<00:03:43.930> thing

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
up and down the line and the same thing
