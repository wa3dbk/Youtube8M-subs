00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
on it give it a good amount of force

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.720 
on it give it a good amount of force
just<00:00:39.270> don't<00:00:39.510> slam<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:40.050> up<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.379> down<00:00:40.730> just

gently and you should hear the glue

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.720 
gently and you should hear the glue
start<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.059> kind<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.390> crack<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> little<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:47.070> then

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
start to kind of crack a little and then

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.549 
start to kind of crack a little and then
it'll<00:00:47.910> just<00:00:48.059> pop<00:00:48.210> right<00:00:48.270> out<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.379> was

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
it'll just pop right out so that was

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.910 
it'll just pop right out so that was
that<00:00:49.590> now<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.700> one<00:00:50.969> here<00:00:51.530> based<00:00:52.530> on<00:00:52.739> its

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
that now this one here based on its

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.910 
that now this one here based on its
location<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.000> everything<00:00:54.420> like<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.920> seems

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
location and everything like that seems

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.200 
location and everything like that seems
to<00:00:56.190> be<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.340> little<00:00:56.579> bit<00:00:56.820> more<00:00:57.030> tricky<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.890> assume

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
to be a little bit more tricky I assume

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.299 
to be a little bit more tricky I assume
that<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.359> probably<00:01:00.660> can<00:01:01.020> be<00:01:01.199> done<00:01:01.440> much<00:01:02.070> the

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
that it probably can be done much the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.530 
that it probably can be done much the
same<00:01:02.489> way<00:01:02.660> but<00:01:03.660> thus<00:01:04.049> far<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.680> haven't<00:01:05.540> gotten

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
same way but thus far I haven't gotten

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.080 
same way but thus far I haven't gotten
it<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.380> one<00:01:07.590> actually<00:01:07.770> I'm<00:01:08.490> putting

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
it and this one actually I'm putting

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.570 
it and this one actually I'm putting
more<00:01:09.270> force<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.950> yeah<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.189> not<00:01:11.340> really

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
more force on yeah and it's not really

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.160 
more force on yeah and it's not really
doing<00:01:11.790> anything<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.720> we're<00:01:12.810> gonna<00:01:12.900> have<00:01:13.080> to

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
doing anything so we're gonna have to

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.870 
doing anything so we're gonna have to
come<00:01:13.320> up<00:01:13.350> with<00:01:13.500> something<00:01:13.830> else<00:01:14.130> for<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.490> so

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
come up with something else for this so

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.630 
come up with something else for this so
let<00:01:15.030> me<00:01:15.350> mess<00:01:16.350> around<00:01:16.530> with<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.100> piece<00:01:17.340> for<00:01:17.610> a

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
let me mess around with this piece for a

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.690 
let me mess around with this piece for a
while<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.119> I'll<00:01:18.570> tell<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.869> my<00:01:19.020> solution

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
while and I'll tell you my solution

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.249 
while and I'll tell you my solution
