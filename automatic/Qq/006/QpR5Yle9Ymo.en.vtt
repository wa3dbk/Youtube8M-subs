00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
one crew guy that I guess got hit by a

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.190 
one crew guy that I guess got hit by a
piece<00:02:48.579> of<00:02:48.640> debris<00:02:48.820> off<00:02:49.030> one<00:02:49.209> of<00:02:49.239> the<00:02:49.329> car<00:02:49.480> so<00:02:49.780> I

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
piece of debris off one of the car so I

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.949 
piece of debris off one of the car so I
was<00:02:50.590> kind<00:02:50.650> of<00:02:50.769> scary-looking<00:02:51.040> but<00:02:51.480> no<00:02:52.480> we're

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
but it's pretty unfortunate for a team
