right away i think i did bloat like the
last<00:05:24.460> couple<00:05:24.669> days<00:05:25.000> of<00:05:25.210> my<00:05:25.270> pregnancy<00:05:25.750> I

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.409 
last couple days of my pregnancy I
didn't<00:05:26.290> get<00:05:26.560> too<00:05:26.950> bloated<00:05:27.220> so<00:05:27.700> I<00:05:27.729> look<00:05:28.240> pretty

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
didn't get too bloated so I look pretty

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:30.960 
didn't get too bloated so I look pretty
normal<00:05:28.750> from<00:05:29.169> here<00:05:29.470> up<00:05:29.610> but<00:05:30.610> then<00:05:30.760> you<00:05:30.850> look

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
normal from here up but then you look

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.850 
normal from here up but then you look
down<00:05:31.150> and<00:05:31.390> obviously<00:05:31.510> I'm<00:05:31.900> pregnant<00:05:32.290> I<00:05:32.470> did
