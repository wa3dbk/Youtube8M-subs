inside and personally I think it looks a
bit<00:01:16.869> more<00:01:17.049> like<00:01:17.289> a<00:01:17.409> car<00:01:18.689> that's<00:01:19.689> one<00:01:19.929> done<00:01:20.200> and

they drop it down up top on yeah overall
place<00:03:53.010> looks<00:03:53.490> a<00:03:53.610> lot<00:03:53.700> better<00:03:55.580> project<00:03:56.580> might

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
place looks a lot better project might

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.700 
place looks a lot better project might
be<00:03:56.910> on<00:03:57.030> like<00:03:57.180> this<00:03:57.710> do<00:03:58.710> them<00:03:58.860> I<00:04:00.560> think<00:04:01.560> these

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
be on like this do them I think these

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.110 
be on like this do them I think these
new<00:04:01.950> stock<00:04:02.280> shocks<00:04:02.550> I'll<00:04:02.820> put<00:04:03.000> on<00:04:03.230> there<00:04:04.230> quite

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
new stock shocks I'll put on there quite

think<00:04:08.010> you<00:04:08.250> need<00:04:08.370> to<00:04:08.430> set<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:08.790> right<00:04:09.030> height

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270
