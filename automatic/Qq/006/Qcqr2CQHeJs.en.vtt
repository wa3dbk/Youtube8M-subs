00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.500
Greetings, and welcome to Earthling
Cinema. I am your host, Garyx

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.160
Wormuloid. This week’s artifact is
The Dark Knight, co-written by

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.500
visionary auteur Jonathan Nolan and
directed by his brother.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.130
The Dark Knight tells the story of
Bruce Wayne, a run-of-the-mill

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.480
billionaire playboy who suffers
from a brain disease that makes him

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.449
pretend to be a rodent. Which is
good, because he lives in the most

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.360
mentally disturbed city in America.
Wayne uses his limitless wealth to

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.760
buy expensive armor, then goes
around punching lots of people who

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.250
aren’t wearing any armor, such as
Baghead, these mob guys

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.559
and an unemployed clown named
the Joker.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.700
The Joker decides he wants to get
to know this “Bat-man” a little

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.930
better, so he offers to not kill a
bunch of people in exchange for Batman’s

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.870
identity. Batman catches him
instead, but not before the Joker

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.590
sets up a tasty little trap.
District Attorney Harvey Dent and

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.690
perennial love interest Rachel
Dawes are locked in two different

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.610
rooms filled with barrels, which
are deadly to humans. Rachel is

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.850
killed and Dent changes his name to
Two-Face, even though Half-Face is

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.170
probably more accurate.
The Joker escapes, and Batman uses

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.600
his Bluetooth to track him down and
finally spend some quality time together.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.770
Two-Face starts throwing a hissy fit,
so Batman silences him with a big

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.030
hug, then takes the blame for everything and goes on a much needed vacation.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.600
The Dark Knight is a film permeated by duality.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.850
Batman (a.k.a. the Dark Knight)
yearns for a world

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.159
where he can be replaced by Harvey
Dent, the White Knight. Except in

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.720
Rachel’s bed, that is. When Dent
becomes Two-Face, he embodies this

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.280
duality, from the two sides of his
face to the two sides of his coin

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.700
to his two perfectly intact
eyeballs that never dry out, even

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.800
with prolonged exposure to air.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.600
Another duality is order versus chaos.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.600
"Chaos."

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.399
The Joker seeks to show the people of Gotham

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.500
that underneath the facade of an
orderly society is existential anarchy.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.300
Kind of like how underneath my eyebrows is another, crazier set of eyebrows.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.509
The Joker is a nihilist, one who

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.941
believes in nothing, not even the
concept of nihilism. When asked directly

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.600
"WHAT DO YOU ALL BELIVE IN?!"

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.620
... the Joker’s response is meaningless.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.000
"Whatever doesn't kill you simply makes you stranger."

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.819
So too is the grenade he puts in the manager’s mouth. It’s just an empty scare tactic that

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.600
emits a floral perfume. My guess is
Chanel number 5000.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.060
The Joker offers several different stories
about the source of his scars ...

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.110
But they are all lies. It doesn't
matter how he got the scars. The

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.690
Joker jokes because everything is
trivial.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.180
But unlike this picture of a cat on
a skateboard, the Joker's terrorist

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.660
acts aren't random. They try to
prove a point: morality is a sham.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.600
Take away humans’ physical comforts
or safety and they will turn into wild animals.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.000
Not literally, like we can. I’m talking metaphors here.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.800
The Joker exploits the innate, base lawlessness of humanity.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.140
"Their code, it's a bad joke."

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.220
The Joker has the bank robbers kill each other

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.720
in order to increase their
share of the loot. He gives three

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.890
"friends" a weapon, telling them
whoever survives gets to join his team.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.599
He threatens to blow up
hospitals if people don’t do his bidding –

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.349
causing cops to turn corrupt and citizens to attempt murder.

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.959
Pretty good for a guy who
can’t even put on his makeup correctly.

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.239
The Joker’s pièce de résistance,

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.879
pardon my French, is the corruption
of District Attorney Harvey Dent.

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.560
Harvey's double-sided coin
represents his rigid adherence to

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.819
the ideas of justice, morality, and
order, not to mention his firm

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.230
commitment to the U.S. Mint. He
leaves nothing to chance, "I make

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.720
my own luck." But after he becomes
Two-Face, the coin is scarred on

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.190
one side, turning it into a regular
coin: 50/50. Or if you’re really

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.010
good at coin-flipping, 60/60. Just
like the coin, Dent has been

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.879
infected by the Joker's vision – a
reality ruled only by cosmic anarchy.

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.260
"The only morality in a cruel world is chance."

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.600
At the beginning of the film,

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.500
Dent is a Christ figure whose campaign slogan has religious connotations:

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.030
“I believe in Harvey
Dent.”

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.590
But whereas most films use Christ
imagery to suggest that the

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.110
character has sacrificed himself
for an ideal, or for the good of

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.120
humanity, The Dark Knight shows us
a daring and modern interpretation

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.530
of the Christ image. It shows a Christ without

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.989
resurrection. In other words, just
a dead dude with a righteous beard.

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:20.000
A false Ideal, but one that must be
upheld as a beacon of hope for mankind.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.500
Batman takes it upon
himself to uphold that facade ...

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.680
thus maintaining order.
But unlike Dent, who represents

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.060
order through idealism, Batman
represents order through force.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.080
He is a fascist --
like my father-in-law -- a

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.310
necessary evil to tame the beastly
side of mankind.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.710
As the ferry scene
proves, the democratic method is

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.000
not enough. A simple vote would
have them do the amoral thing –

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
destroying the other boat to ensure
their survival.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.500
"140 against, 396 for."

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.000
It takes tyrannical power to ultimately uphold justice.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.500
which is why Gerald Ford kept being elected president.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.470
When Bat-man creates the sonar machine,

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.780
it is a tremendous violation of privacy, bordering on

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.000
morally bankrupt. But as Alfred
tells him, sometimes the only way

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.100
to catch a jewel thief is to "burn
the forest down."

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.100
"We burn the forest down."

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.000
