00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.490
 Sound induction 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:14.660
 Nightmare withdrawal

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.520
 Cars 2 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.520
 Half a century 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:31.570
 Rainy day or windy day 5 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:31.570
 It is the driver's job to keep running regardless of guns 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.000
 But there are a lot of strange things 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.500
 Waiting time for loading and unloading too long 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.030
 Operation of a forklift 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.820
 Picking goods for free 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.110
 Is it OK if I push it against the driver even if it is run or kan 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:15.909
 I can't get the farewell of running fares on top of that 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.909
 It Irun perpetuity us drivers working for what 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.120
 Sound induction 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.080
 Nightmare withdrawal

 Moon 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.260
 Half a century 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:39.670
 The country also goes 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:44.130
 It is a problem to have the driver free to work on a contract 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.130
 It says that there is a risk of violation of the law 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.110
 If this is a nightmare 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.110
 Wake up soon
