actually part of the next great feature
about<00:02:51.269> this<00:02:51.540> case<00:02:51.840> this<00:02:52.169> is<00:02:52.379> actually<00:02:52.769> as<00:02:52.889> a

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
about this case this is actually as a

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.909 
about this case this is actually as a
built-in<00:02:53.879> stands<00:02:54.329> as<00:02:54.599> well<00:02:54.810> if<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.620> didn't

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:55.919 
built-in stands as well if you didn't

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:59.449 
built-in stands as well if you didn't
notice<00:02:56.069> already<00:02:56.629> on<00:02:57.629> the<00:02:57.810> front<00:02:58.129> you<00:02:59.129> can<00:02:59.310> kind

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
notice already on the front you can kind

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.369 
notice already on the front you can kind
of<00:02:59.549> see<00:02:59.609> this<00:02:59.849> crease<00:03:00.269> it's<00:03:00.659> because<00:03:01.049> it's

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
of see this crease it's because it's

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.250 
of see this crease it's because it's
bent<00:03:01.799> and<00:03:02.189> that's<00:03:02.790> because<00:03:03.000> it's<00:03:03.719> actually<00:03:03.989> a

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
bent and that's because it's actually a

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.640 
bent and that's because it's actually a
stand<00:03:04.730> so<00:03:05.730> Stan<00:03:05.969> goes<00:03:06.329> in<00:03:06.599> just<00:03:07.049> like<00:03:07.169> that<00:03:07.230> and

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
stand so Stan goes in just like that and

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.080 
stand so Stan goes in just like that and
then<00:03:07.829> from<00:03:08.040> there<00:03:08.250> you<00:03:08.280> can<00:03:08.430> actually<00:03:08.790> flip<00:03:08.939> it

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
then from there you can actually flip it

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.050 
then from there you can actually flip it
over<00:03:11.209> now<00:03:12.209> you<00:03:12.269> have<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.540> very<00:03:13.049> nice<00:03:13.319> stand<00:03:13.709> at<00:03:13.950> a

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
over now you have a very nice stand at a

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.819 
over now you have a very nice stand at a
great<00:03:15.060> angle<00:03:15.359> very<00:03:15.930> easy<00:03:16.139> to<00:03:16.319> type<00:03:16.530> without

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
great angle very easy to type without

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.830 
great angle very easy to type without
this<00:03:17.010> angle<00:03:17.370> you<00:03:17.909> can<00:03:18.030> see<00:03:18.269> there<00:03:18.569> it<00:03:18.690> is<00:03:18.720> right

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
this angle you can see there it is right

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.399 
this angle you can see there it is right
there<00:03:19.790> great<00:03:20.790> I<00:03:21.120> mean<00:03:21.599> just<00:03:21.840> a<00:03:22.019> wonderful

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:22.409 
there great I mean just a wonderful

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:26.180 
there great I mean just a wonderful
angle<00:03:22.799> and<00:03:22.979> then<00:03:23.549> you<00:03:23.940> can<00:03:24.090> also<00:03:24.919> flip<00:03:25.919> it<00:03:26.069> up

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
angle and then you can also flip it up

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.339 
angle and then you can also flip it up
like<00:03:26.370> that<00:03:26.579> and<00:03:26.849> that's<00:03:27.599> kind<00:03:27.840> of<00:03:27.870> hard<00:03:28.049> to<00:03:28.109> see

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
like that and that's kind of hard to see

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.969 
like that and that's kind of hard to see
but<00:03:29.159> you<00:03:29.250> can<00:03:29.430> stand<00:03:29.729> it<00:03:29.909> upright<00:03:30.150> so<00:03:30.870> now<00:03:31.109> it's

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:31.979 
but you can stand it upright so now it's

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:33.649 
but you can stand it upright so now it's
a<00:03:32.129> good<00:03:32.340> viewing<00:03:32.669> angle<00:03:33.090> if<00:03:33.239> you<00:03:33.389> want<00:03:33.569> to
