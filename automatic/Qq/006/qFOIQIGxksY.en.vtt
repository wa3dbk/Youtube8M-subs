i<00:03:43.959> think<00:03:44.170> that<00:03:44.590> you<00:03:44.739> know<00:03:44.829> they<00:03:45.189> want<00:03:45.370> them<00:03:45.489> to

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
i think that you know they want them to

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.030 
i think that you know they want them to
establish<00:03:45.970> four<00:03:46.180> lines<00:03:46.510> and<00:03:46.840> they<00:03:47.739> want<00:03:47.950> to

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
establish four lines and they want to

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.410 
establish four lines and they want to
make<00:03:48.129> sure<00:03:48.159> they<00:03:48.370> establish<00:03:48.849> the<00:03:48.939> mobility<00:03:49.390> of

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
make sure they establish the mobility of

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.180 
make sure they establish the mobility of
their<00:03:49.599> defense<00:03:49.959> and<00:03:50.170> i<00:03:50.260> think<00:03:50.709> that<00:03:50.829> they<00:03:50.920> did

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
their defense and i think that they did

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.160 
their defense and i think that they did
both<00:03:51.430> those<00:03:51.700> things<00:03:51.750> tonight<00:03:52.750> when<00:03:52.959> you<00:03:53.019> look

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
both those things tonight when you look

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.990 
both those things tonight when you look
at<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:53.319> line<00:03:53.500> of<00:03:53.680> paul<00:03:53.980> miera<00:03:54.280> Schrader<00:03:54.760> and

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
at the line of paul miera Schrader and

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.990 
at the line of paul miera Schrader and
for<00:03:55.750> that<00:03:56.019> line<00:03:56.290> quietly<00:03:57.069> was<00:03:57.310> very<00:03:57.489> effective

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
for that line quietly was very effective

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.729 
for that line quietly was very effective
they<00:03:58.120> create<00:03:58.450> a<00:03:58.480> lot<00:03:58.659> of<00:03:58.750> offense<00:03:59.200> palmieri
