purpose of this dress is different

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.370 
purpose of this dress is different
because<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.979> has<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:17.460> cutouts<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.380> front

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
because it has like cutouts in the front

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.830 
because it has like cutouts in the front
tummy<00:01:19.799> area<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.820> have<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.420> choice<00:01:21.689> of

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
tummy area so you have the choice of

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.920 
tummy area so you have the choice of
either<00:01:22.110> doing<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.830> cutout<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.689> front<00:01:24.689> and
