these health problems really yes a good
example<00:00:29.140> is<00:00:29.439> the<00:00:29.590> relationship<00:00:30.220> between<00:00:30.460> the

what is the April a gene a poly is a

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.440 
what is the April a gene a poly is a

higher risk for high cholesterol than
most<00:01:47.739> people<00:01:48.219> oh<00:01:48.929> no<00:01:49.929> a<00:01:50.349> higher<00:01:51.340> risk<00:01:51.700> am<00:01:52.179> I

doomed not quite a higher risk means

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.010 
doomed not quite a higher risk means
that<00:01:57.399> if<00:01:57.520> you<00:01:57.639> eat<00:01:57.880> a<00:01:58.090> lot<00:01:58.119> of<00:01:58.359> certain<00:01:58.779> foods

respond to that it looks like people who
carry<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.489> belief<00:02:21.030> or<00:02:21.360> like<00:02:22.230> me<00:02:23.000> naturally<00:02:24.000> have

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
carry a belief or like me naturally have

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.570 
carry a belief or like me naturally have
a<00:02:24.150> higher<00:02:24.390> cholesterol<00:02:24.690> level<00:02:25.379> but<00:02:26.250> eating

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
a higher cholesterol level but eating

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.680 
a higher cholesterol level but eating
high<00:02:26.760> fat<00:02:26.790> foods<00:02:27.330> makes<00:02:27.959> it<00:02:28.140> much<00:02:28.349> worse<00:02:28.709> and

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
high fat foods makes it much worse and

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.550 
high fat foods makes it much worse and
people<00:02:30.690> who<00:02:30.810> carry<00:02:31.080> April<00:02:31.500> eat<00:02:31.680> ooh<00:02:32.150> like<00:02:33.150> you

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
people who carry April eat ooh like you

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.170 
people who carry April eat ooh like you
naturally<00:02:34.560> have<00:02:35.010> lower<00:02:35.400> cholesterol<00:02:35.879> levels

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
naturally have lower cholesterol levels

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.860 
naturally have lower cholesterol levels
and<00:02:36.799> eating<00:02:37.799> high<00:02:37.950> fat<00:02:37.980> foods<00:02:38.519> may<00:02:39.450> not<00:02:39.480> be<00:02:39.840> a

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
and eating high fat foods may not be a

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.119 
and eating high fat foods may not be a
problem<00:02:41.420> exactly<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:43.049> you<00:02:43.110> see<00:02:43.500> the

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
problem exactly so you see the

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.580 
problem exactly so you see the
differences<00:02:44.790> in<00:02:44.940> our<00:02:45.060> genes<00:02:45.360> make<00:02:45.900> us<00:02:46.079> respond

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
differences in our genes make us respond

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.940 
differences in our genes make us respond
to<00:02:46.769> foods<00:02:47.069> in<00:02:47.579> different<00:02:48.299> ways<00:02:48.650> which<00:02:49.650> means

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
to foods in different ways which means

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.869 
to foods in different ways which means
there<00:02:50.459> is<00:02:50.489> no<00:02:50.940> universal<00:02:51.720> diet<00:02:52.700> so<00:02:53.700> what

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
there is no universal diet so what

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.539 
there is no universal diet so what
you're<00:02:54.030> saying<00:02:54.359> is<00:02:54.660> I<00:02:54.989> should<00:02:55.739> eat<00:02:55.890> an<00:02:56.069> April

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
you're saying is I should eat an April
