00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
choose from but in my opinion out of all

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.960 
choose from but in my opinion out of all
of<00:03:33.300> them<00:03:33.770> when<00:03:34.770> I<00:03:34.800> was<00:03:35.040> searching<00:03:35.250> up<00:03:35.580> you<00:03:35.850> know

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
of them when I was searching up you know

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.500 
of them when I was searching up you know
just<00:03:36.270> specifically<00:03:36.840> modern<00:03:37.620> rally<00:03:37.890> cars

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
just specifically modern rally cars

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.150 
just specifically modern rally cars
which<00:03:39.510> they<00:03:39.900> actually<00:03:40.140> didn't<00:03:40.590> include<00:03:40.920> any

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
which they actually didn't include any

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.180 
which they actually didn't include any
of<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.370> trucks<00:03:41.700> for<00:03:41.910> some<00:03:42.060> reason<00:03:43.040> it<00:03:44.040> was

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
of the trucks for some reason it was

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.840 
of the trucks for some reason it was
really<00:03:44.550> between<00:03:44.880> this<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:46.410> focus<00:03:46.950> and<00:03:47.310> the

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
really between this the focus and the

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.360 
really between this the focus and the
Lancer<00:03:48.300> now<00:03:49.170> in<00:03:49.410> my<00:03:49.560> opinion<00:03:50.010> when<00:03:50.190> I<00:03:50.220> was

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
Lancer now in my opinion when I was

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.980 
Lancer now in my opinion when I was
comparing<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:50.880> stock<00:03:51.150> specs<00:03:51.540> between<00:03:51.840> all

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
comparing the stock specs between all

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.770 
comparing the stock specs between all
three<00:03:52.350> this<00:03:53.070> one<00:03:53.370> looked<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:53.940> best<00:03:53.970> now

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
three this one looked the best now

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.750 
three this one looked the best now
obviously<00:03:55.290> with<00:03:55.470> some<00:03:55.530> upgrades<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.610> some

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
obviously with some upgrades and some

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.180 
obviously with some upgrades and some
tuning<00:03:57.210> you<00:03:57.750> can<00:03:57.930> make<00:03:58.140> them<00:03:58.350> all<00:03:58.650> about<00:03:59.010> the

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
tuning you can make them all about the

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.010 
tuning you can make them all about the
same<00:03:59.550> you<00:03:59.820> know<00:03:59.940> I<00:03:59.970> mean<00:04:00.180> but<00:04:00.630> in<00:04:00.750> my<00:04:00.870> opinion

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
same you know I mean but in my opinion

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.380 
same you know I mean but in my opinion
I've<00:04:01.620> always<00:04:02.190> preferred<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.940> Subarus

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
I've always preferred the Subarus

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.070 
I've always preferred the Subarus
especially<00:04:04.020> that<00:04:04.230> Impreza<00:04:04.560> WRX<00:04:04.770> is<00:04:05.430> so<00:04:06.420> that's

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
especially that Impreza WRX is so that's

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.990 
especially that Impreza WRX is so that's
why<00:04:07.290> I<00:04:07.320> went<00:04:07.530> with<00:04:07.650> this<00:04:07.800> one<00:04:07.860> now<00:04:08.580> you<00:04:08.640> could

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
why I went with this one now you could

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.270 
why I went with this one now you could
also<00:04:09.270> either<00:04:09.570> go<00:04:09.750> with<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:09.900> hatchback<00:04:10.530> which

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
also either go with the hatchback which

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.010 
also either go with the hatchback which
is<00:04:11.490> the<00:04:11.670> 2008

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
is the 2008

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.380 
is the 2008
either<00:04:13.200> 9<00:04:13.530> or<00:04:13.560> 2011<00:04:14.310> don't<00:04:14.850> quote<00:04:15.060> me<00:04:15.210> on<00:04:15.240> it

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
either 9 or 2011 don't quote me on it

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.890 
either 9 or 2011 don't quote me on it
not<00:04:15.990> too<00:04:16.200> sure<00:04:16.470> I<00:04:17.690> think<00:04:18.690> it<00:04:18.780> might<00:04:18.870> be

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
not too sure I think it might be

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.320 
not too sure I think it might be
actually<00:04:19.110> 2008<00:04:19.920> either<00:04:20.459> way<00:04:20.730> you<00:04:20.790> can<00:04:21.060> go<00:04:21.180> with

one of those newer ones the newer style
and<00:04:23.970> third-generation<00:04:24.470> Subarus<00:04:25.470> or<00:04:26.430> you<00:04:26.880> can

for some reason this 2005 weighs the
same<00:04:51.390> amount<00:04:51.870> but<00:04:52.140> it<00:04:52.320> has<00:04:52.490> 311<00:04:53.490> horsepower<00:04:53.910> so

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
same amount but it has 311 horsepower so

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.810 
same amount but it has 311 horsepower so
by<00:04:55.200> the<00:04:55.260> specs<00:04:55.770> it<00:04:56.070> shows<00:04:56.310> that<00:04:56.490> this<00:04:56.640> one

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
by the specs it shows that this one

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.910 
by the specs it shows that this one
comes<00:04:57.090> out<00:04:57.240> better<00:04:57.630> stock<00:04:58.080> that's<00:04:58.680> my

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
comes out better stock that's my

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.730 
comes out better stock that's my
reasoning<00:04:59.730> why<00:04:59.910> I<00:04:59.940> got<00:05:00.330> this<00:05:00.510> one<00:05:00.750> now<00:05:01.410> I<00:05:01.440> hope

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
reasoning why I got this one now I hope

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.020 
reasoning why I got this one now I hope
you<00:05:01.830> guys<00:05:01.950> followed<00:05:02.370> along<00:05:02.550> with<00:05:02.610> the<00:05:02.760> tune

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
you guys followed along with the tune

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.530 
you guys followed along with the tune
because<00:05:03.420> I<00:05:03.600> really<00:05:04.380> really<00:05:04.860> fine<00:05:05.640> tune<00:05:06.000> every

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
because I really really fine tune every

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.810 
because I really really fine tune every
single<00:05:06.840> detail<00:05:07.230> especially<00:05:07.920> the<00:05:08.070> gearing<00:05:08.340> you

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
single detail especially the gearing you

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.580 
single detail especially the gearing you
guys<00:05:08.970> may<00:05:09.270> want<00:05:09.300> to<00:05:09.540> change<00:05:09.720> it<00:05:09.900> up<00:05:09.960> a<00:05:10.080> bit<00:05:10.110> but

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
guys may want to change it up a bit but

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.500 
guys may want to change it up a bit but
in<00:05:10.710> my<00:05:10.860> opinion<00:05:11.310> the<00:05:11.430> first<00:05:11.700> second<00:05:12.180> and<00:05:12.210> third

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
in my opinion the first second and third

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.020 
in my opinion the first second and third
here<00:05:12.840> are<00:05:13.020> top-notch<00:05:13.440> I<00:05:14.040> made<00:05:14.490> sure<00:05:14.730> to<00:05:14.760> make

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
here are top-notch I made sure to make

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.330 
here are top-notch I made sure to make
them<00:05:15.120> close<00:05:15.420> ratio<00:05:15.720> so<00:05:16.650> you<00:05:16.710> kind<00:05:17.130> of<00:05:17.190> get<00:05:17.310> a

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
them close ratio so you kind of get a

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.460 
them close ratio so you kind of get a
really<00:05:17.700> good<00:05:17.940> launch<00:05:18.270> off<00:05:18.480> the<00:05:18.510> line<00:05:18.870> and<00:05:19.290> then

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
really good launch off the line and then

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.650 
really good launch off the line and then
I<00:05:19.500> made<00:05:19.680> the<00:05:19.770> four<00:05:19.980> fifth<00:05:20.250> and<00:05:20.430> six<00:05:20.760> kind<00:05:21.420> of<00:05:21.540> a

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
I made the four fifth and six kind of a

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.510 
I made the four fifth and six kind of a
longer<00:05:21.990> ratio<00:05:22.500> because<00:05:22.920> if<00:05:23.070> you<00:05:23.160> get<00:05:23.280> on<00:05:23.400> those

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
longer ratio because if you get on those

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.680 
longer ratio because if you get on those
long<00:05:23.730> straightaways<00:05:24.240> you're<00:05:24.390> gonna<00:05:24.480> need

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
long straightaways you're gonna need

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.930 
long straightaways you're gonna need
every<00:05:24.870> what<00:05:25.080> I<00:05:25.110> mean<00:05:25.320> well<00:05:25.950> honestly<00:05:26.490> I<00:05:26.580> think
