team a lot of the players are there for

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.429 
team a lot of the players are there for
chemistry<00:01:44.939> reasons<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.479> because<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:46.049> wanted<00:01:46.380> to

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
chemistry reasons is because I wanted to

does he's very like slick and weaves in
and<00:02:08.640> out<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.940> everyone<00:02:09.209> slap<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.020> Deadeye<00:02:10.319> on

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
and out of everyone slap the Deadeye on

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.050 
and out of everyone slap the Deadeye on
him<00:02:10.679> which<00:02:10.830> improves<00:02:11.280> his<00:02:11.400> passing<00:02:11.910> and

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
him which improves his passing and

shooting and yeah
like<00:02:14.130> him<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.400> think<00:02:14.580> he's<00:02:14.700> very<00:02:14.760> good<00:02:15.120> I'd<00:02:15.240> pay

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
like him I think he's very good I'd pay

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.050 
like him I think he's very good I'd pay
12<00:02:15.780> K<00:02:15.960> for<00:02:16.200> him<00:02:16.290> once<00:02:16.500> again<00:02:16.680> but<00:02:17.640> I<00:02:17.670> think<00:02:17.970> he's

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
12 K for him once again but I think he's

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.880 
12 K for him once again but I think he's
dropped<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.450> about<00:02:18.660> like<00:02:18.810> five<00:02:19.050> or<00:02:19.230> six<00:02:19.260> K<00:02:19.680> now

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
dropped to about like five or six K now

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.920 
dropped to about like five or six K now
so<00:02:20.220> he's<00:02:20.730> very<00:02:20.970> cheap<00:02:21.240> you<00:02:21.390> could<00:02:21.510> pick<00:02:21.720> him<00:02:21.840> up

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
so he's very cheap you could pick him up

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.300 
so he's very cheap you could pick him up
you<00:02:22.170> know<00:02:22.260> just<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.560> try<00:02:22.770> them<00:02:22.920> out<00:02:23.010> if<00:02:23.190> you've

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
the only downside to him is the

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.300 
the only downside to him is the
limitations<00:03:19.260> of<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.590> teams<00:03:19.830> that<00:03:20.040> you<00:03:20.130> can
