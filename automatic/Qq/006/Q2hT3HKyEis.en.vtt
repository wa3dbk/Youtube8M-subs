 and good for both the island is 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.530
 manhattan and little else but 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:27.740
 I started as always all coal 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.810
 usual and more or less I started with this 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.720
 percent area of new york and what 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.250
 suburban party of manhattan veis 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.910
 here or it's just a general soup of how 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.910
 I started everything 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:45.430
 It's pretty industrial 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.160
 orienting myself here and later with 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.740
 she has a good area here in the 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.530
 city ​​there is not like that I started already a bridge already 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.810
 the role of the angel as you see parks 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.400
 sac because these are to spend gorgeous 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.980
 it's going to be full of skyscrapers more 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.870
 ahead 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.330
 dense presidential and commercial dense or 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.330
 be here there are people with tiny 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.860
 why 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.469
 all right 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.179
 here you see more or less advanced a 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:21.000
 little time 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:25.590
 but good and we're going to do it the first 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.289
 historic building usa new york el 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.420
 empire state building official with 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.110
 delighted lovely and pretty high the 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.590
 true 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:40.720
 here later forgive for the change 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.950
 of image that is a limitation of the 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.590
 central park here with everything full of 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:49.190
 trees parks and a little water and 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:51.680
 ponds stands out very much there is no other 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.350
 and here then still doing all the 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.500
 more more more more all skyscrapers come 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.590
 later that will be awesome 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.190
 here as you see I'm going to make another one 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.190
 historic building 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.100
 just how good you know me all 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.500
 world begins in the effect of truth 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.440
 there is the metric 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:22.940
 so it was a little park out there 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.920
 next to make it more beautiful 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.020
 and well from here you will see the 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.650
 final result of how the city was 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.410
 as you see a million inhabitants the 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.870
 part of the right well brooklyn and 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.090
 queens and all these neighborhoods adjusted to the 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:42.310
 corner I have made 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.310
 an airport in austria as you see here 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:54.260
 in this installed building 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:03:00.980
 united nations- very cool the station 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:03.940
 out there that once seemed huge but 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.940
 Now it sucks 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.840
 american 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:32.500
 and well I'll teach you more or less a 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.500
 all highway 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:43.390
 with the centrals there with everything but 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.390
 all things and the initial neighborhood 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.280
 a greeting
