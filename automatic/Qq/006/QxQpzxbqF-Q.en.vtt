00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.310
 Today I cook homemade cheese 

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:09.440
 buy milk on the farm 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.400
 no way to boil milk 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.200
 buy only 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.650
 those farmers who we really 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.080
 trust we heat up the milk to 37 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.160
 degrees 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.160
 pour out 2 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.700
 use a valuable leaven which 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.950
 sold in pharmacies 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:36.110
 strictly follow the instructions for use 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.650
 in terms of dosage 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.220
 add leaven 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.220
 and mix 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.180
 from where it is important to wash with warm reserve 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.790
 at five six o'clock 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.360
 after this time the serum 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.360
 should separate 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.930
 such softness is formed which 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.860
 will need to be cut into pieces 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.860
 necessarily 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.040
 then knock over some stuff 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.500
 could 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.760
 in order to flow out all serum here 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.760
 then hang 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.649
 lay out on a colander 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.649
 to make cheese one form 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.400
 after a few hours we turn over 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.750
 be sure to keep under load 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.560
 to serum 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.880
 separated even more 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.880
 all the remnants are out of it 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.610
 about half a day is enough to 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.290
 cheese head 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.910
 found its shape 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.910
 cooking salt water 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.800
 in the usual boiled water lukewarm 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.250
 add 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.250
 salt 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.780
 water salinity level checked 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.780
 1 and egg method 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:14.010
 wait for the egg to pop up if 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.090
 pops a value not enough salt 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.090
 add more 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.030
 coarse salt can also be used 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.310
 we added again stirred from the front 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.230
 pop up means ready 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.950
 Sulfuric head not cut into several 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.520
 parts and lay out the second 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.710
 where is she going to stay too 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.830
 all further time to complete 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.830
 disappearances 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.659
 that is, until we sit 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.689
 collected in tara 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.689
 now pour salt water 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.990
 this way in three or four days 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.430
 full-ripened cheese 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.430
 and will be ready to eat
