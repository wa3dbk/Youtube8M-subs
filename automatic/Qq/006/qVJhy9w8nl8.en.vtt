00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
Lumia 1520 so let's see how the game

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.600 
Lumia 1520 so let's see how the game
runs<00:00:11.490> on<00:00:11.730> this<00:00:11.880> device<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:13.040> love<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.160> screen<00:00:14.400> on

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
runs on this device I love the screen on

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.019 
runs on this device I love the screen on
this<00:00:14.790> device<00:00:15.089> it's<00:00:16.250> big<00:00:17.250> colorful<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:18.210> sharp

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.029 
this device it's big colorful and sharp

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.179 
this device it's big colorful and sharp
however<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.180> most<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.050> gaming<00:00:22.260> currently

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
however the most of the gaming currently

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.390 
however the most of the gaming currently
runs<00:00:23.490> at<00:00:24.050> 720p<00:00:25.050> instead<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.619> 1080<00:00:26.039> because

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
runs at 720p instead of 1080 because

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.759 
runs at 720p instead of 1080 because
most<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.939> games<00:00:27.150> are<00:00:27.590> optimized<00:00:28.590> for

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
most of the games are optimized for

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.460 
most of the games are optimized for
older<00:00:29.160> devices<00:00:29.640> yet<00:00:30.179> with<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.750> which<00:00:30.990> has<00:00:31.230> a

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
older devices yet with it which has a

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.810 
older devices yet with it which has a
720p<00:00:32.040> screen<00:00:33.050> but<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.110> thing<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.320> though<00:00:34.680> that

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
720p screen but the thing is though that

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.180 
720p screen but the thing is though that
the<00:00:36.500> gaming<00:00:37.500> experience<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:39.829> still<00:00:40.829> very<00:00:41.040> good

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
the gaming experience is still very good

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.360 
the gaming experience is still very good
and<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.820> don't<00:00:41.879> see<00:00:42.210> any<00:00:42.329> problem<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:43.070> 720p<00:00:44.070> is

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
and I don't see any problem that 720p is

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.069 
and I don't see any problem that 720p is
any<00:00:44.940> issue<00:00:45.210> on<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.719> device<00:00:47.809> anyway<00:00:48.809> let's

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
any issue on this device anyway let's

00:00:49.079 --> 00:01:00.650 
any issue on this device anyway let's
look<00:00:49.170> at<00:00:49.410> Java<00:00:58.219> there<00:00:59.219> are<00:00:59.370> some<00:00:59.609> micro<00:01:00.420> lags

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
look at Java there are some micro lags

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.820 
look at Java there are some micro lags
as<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.469> camera<00:01:02.280> stands<00:01:02.940> around<00:01:03.530> but<00:01:04.530> other

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
as the camera stands around but other

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:15.620 
as the camera stands around but other
than<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.850> looks<00:01:05.880> pretty<00:01:06.360> ok<00:01:14.210> yeah<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.450> I

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
than that it looks pretty ok yeah and I

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.490 
than that it looks pretty ok yeah and I
can<00:01:15.960> tell<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:17.420> these<00:01:18.420> are<00:01:18.689> not<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.229> ultimate

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
can tell that these are not the ultimate

graphics

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.039 

but<00:01:49.860> let's<00:01:50.070> see<00:01:50.250> how<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.000> game<00:01:51.420> performance

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
but let's see how the game performance

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.830 
but let's see how the game performance
is<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.890> whether<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.909> can<00:01:54.090> enjoy<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.570> scheme

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
is and whether you can enjoy the scheme

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.760 
is and whether you can enjoy the scheme
on<00:01:55.079> this<00:01:55.619> device<00:01:55.920> or<00:01:56.159> not<00:01:57.350> let's<00:01:58.350> see<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.619> there

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
on this device or not let's see is there

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.940 
on this device or not let's see is there
any<00:01:59.030> settings

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.430 

I<00:02:05.790> can't<00:02:06.790> go<00:02:07.060> to<00:02:07.119> setting'<00:02:07.540> at<00:02:07.689> the<00:02:07.810> moment<00:02:08.170> so

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
I can't go to setting' at the moment so

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:31.250 
I can't go to setting' at the moment so
let's<00:02:08.920> look<00:02:09.190> at<00:02:09.369> it<00:02:09.399> later

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.130 

is<00:02:32.260> let's<00:02:32.800> see<00:02:32.980> whether<00:02:33.340> is<00:02:33.550> there<00:02:33.760> any

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
is let's see whether is there any

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.300 
is let's see whether is there any
setting<00:02:35.140> no<00:02:35.320> but<00:02:35.470> there<00:02:35.770> is<00:02:35.830> no<00:02:35.950> graphic

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
setting no but there is no graphic

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.530 
setting no but there is no graphic
setting<00:02:36.640> so<00:02:36.880> I<00:02:38.220> can't<00:02:39.220> improve<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:39.760> graphics

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
setting so I can't improve the graphics

00:02:40.540 --> 00:03:21.300 
setting so I can't improve the graphics
or<00:02:40.930> effects<00:02:41.290> in<00:02:41.440> any<00:02:41.680> way

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:38.950 

pull<00:03:22.060> that<00:03:22.209> sniper<00:03:22.600> down<00:03:22.840> with<00:03:23.050> the<00:03:23.140> crap

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.190 

I<00:03:39.310> can<00:03:40.310> tell<00:03:40.460> that<00:03:40.490> I<00:03:40.700> have<00:03:41.150> both<00:03:41.360> seen<00:03:41.600> better

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
I can tell that I have both seen better

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.020 
I can tell that I have both seen better
gaming<00:03:42.470> performance<00:03:43.070> on<00:03:43.250> many<00:03:43.490> other<00:03:43.670> devices

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
gaming performance on many other devices

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.860 
gaming performance on many other devices
so<00:03:45.790> this<00:03:46.790> is<00:03:46.910> not<00:03:47.090> the<00:03:47.300> best<00:03:47.660> gaming

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
so this is not the best gaming

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.860 
so this is not the best gaming
performance<00:03:48.500> but<00:03:48.740> still<00:03:49.670> it's<00:03:50.240> not<00:03:50.390> that<00:03:50.630> bad

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
performance but still it's not that bad

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.040 
performance but still it's not that bad
as<00:03:51.050> well<00:03:51.290> and<00:03:51.640> probably<00:03:52.640> with<00:03:52.880> the

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
as well and probably with the

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.660 
as well and probably with the
optimization<00:03:54.050> of<00:03:54.290> this<00:03:54.890> game<00:03:55.160> for<00:03:55.520> this

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
optimization of this game for this

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.710 
optimization of this game for this
device<00:03:56.260> it<00:03:57.260> will<00:03:57.470> get<00:03:57.650> better<00:03:58.390> and<00:03:59.390> there<00:03:59.600> is

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
device it will get better and there is

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:06.860 
device it will get better and there is
no<00:03:59.840> doubt<00:04:00.050> about<00:04:00.080> that<00:04:00.530> one

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.520 

this<00:04:07.870> is<00:04:07.990> the<00:04:08.110> Xbox<00:04:08.560> game<00:04:08.890> and<00:04:09.310> Xbox<00:04:10.120> games

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
this is the Xbox game and Xbox games

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:17.870 
this is the Xbox game and Xbox games
does<00:04:11.530> not<00:04:11.740> get<00:04:12.100> the<00:04:12.930> updates<00:04:13.930> that<00:04:14.110> quickly<00:04:14.590> so

because<00:05:07.630> of<00:05:07.750> that<00:05:07.900> big<00:05:08.139> screen<00:05:08.380> and<00:05:08.740> the

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
because of that big screen and the

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
because of that big screen and the
colors<00:05:09.760> and<00:05:09.790> the<00:05:10.240> clarity<00:05:11.190> still<00:05:12.190> I'm<00:05:12.880> loving

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
colors and the clarity still I'm loving

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.320 
colors and the clarity still I'm loving
-<00:05:13.570> I<00:05:13.810> am<00:05:14.410> loving<00:05:14.680> the<00:05:14.860> game<00:05:15.190> on<00:05:15.460> this<00:05:16.030> device

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
- I am loving the game on this device

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.300 
- I am loving the game on this device
and<00:05:17.490> still<00:05:18.490> run<00:05:18.760> pretty<00:05:18.970> well<00:05:19.090> although<00:05:19.690> not

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
and still run pretty well although not

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.129 
and still run pretty well although not
it's<00:05:21.310> perfect<00:05:21.760> but<00:05:22.030> it's<00:05:22.300> not<00:05:22.450> perfect<00:05:22.870> I<00:05:22.990> mean

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
it's perfect but it's not perfect I mean

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:28.110 
it's perfect but it's not perfect I mean
but<00:05:23.980> still<00:05:25.740> not<00:05:26.740> bad<00:05:26.980> either<00:05:27.280> so<00:05:27.700> it's<00:05:27.850> a<00:05:27.970> good

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
but still not bad either so it's a good

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:34.650 
but still not bad either so it's a good
gaming<00:05:28.510> performance<00:05:33.090> as<00:05:34.090> you<00:05:34.150> can<00:05:34.450> see<00:05:34.630> a

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
gaming performance as you can see a

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.800 
gaming performance as you can see a
little<00:05:34.960> bit<00:05:35.169> of<00:05:35.320> micro<00:05:35.710> lags<00:05:36.510> but<00:05:37.510> that's

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
little bit of micro lags but that's

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.560 
little bit of micro lags but that's
probably<00:05:38.020> because<00:05:38.440> it<00:05:38.860> requires<00:05:39.340> an<00:05:39.580> update

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.030 

and<00:05:43.570> as<00:05:43.780> you<00:05:43.900> can<00:05:44.050> see<00:05:44.169> there<00:05:44.350> there<00:05:44.770> is<00:05:44.890> no

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:45.040 
and as you can see there there is no

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.340 
and as you can see there there is no
depth<00:05:45.640> of<00:05:45.790> field<00:05:46.090> and<00:05:46.330> the<00:05:46.390> rain<00:05:46.900> at<00:05:47.230> the

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
depth of field and the rain at the

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.760 
depth of field and the rain at the
background<00:05:47.910> so<00:05:48.910> once<00:05:49.510> again<00:05:49.660> it<00:05:49.960> it<00:05:50.290> proves<00:05:50.590> my

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
background so once again it it proves my

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.670 
background so once again it it proves my
point<00:05:50.800> that<00:05:51.220> it's<00:05:51.520> not<00:05:51.610> running<00:05:51.970> in<00:05:52.960> full

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
point that it's not running in full

00:05:53.680 --> 00:06:02.159 
point that it's not running in full
graphics<00:05:59.880> but<00:06:00.880> still<00:06:01.120> you<00:06:01.479> can<00:06:01.630> see<00:06:01.780> that<00:06:01.990> how
