sad condition it's actually just coming

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.540 
sad condition it's actually just coming
apart<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.320> we'll<00:00:55.590> reattach<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.219> at<00:00:56.370> some

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
apart so we'll reattach that at some

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.490 
apart so we'll reattach that at some
point<00:00:56.579> this<00:00:56.910> year<00:00:56.969> but<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:57.840> took<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.199> seat<00:00:58.379> off

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
point this year but I took the seat off

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.709 
point this year but I took the seat off
the<00:00:58.530> Murray<00:00:58.800> put<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.190> on<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.489> for<00:00:59.640> now<00:00:59.719> that

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
the Murray put it on it for now that

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:01.849 
the Murray put it on it for now that
should<00:01:00.870> get<00:01:00.960> us<00:01:01.020> going<00:01:01.230> it's<00:01:01.469> pretty<00:01:01.530> dirty

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
should get us going it's pretty dirty

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.210 
should get us going it's pretty dirty
because<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.340> haven't<00:01:02.820> washed<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.210> yet<00:01:03.420> just<00:01:04.260> dug

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
because I haven't washed it yet just dug

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.649 
because I haven't washed it yet just dug
it<00:01:05.339> out<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.580> storage<00:01:05.820> hasn't<00:01:06.299> started<00:01:06.479> yet

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
it out of storage hasn't started yet

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.510 
it out of storage hasn't started yet
this<00:01:06.900> year<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.619> hopefully<00:01:08.250> we're<00:01:08.369> going<00:01:08.460> to

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
this year so hopefully we're going to

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.880 
this year so hopefully we're going to
give<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.820> go<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.290> I'm<00:01:10.290> pretty<00:01:10.650> sure<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.830> will

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
give it a go and I'm pretty sure it will

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.320 
give it a go and I'm pretty sure it will
start<00:01:11.159> it's<00:01:11.400> never<00:01:11.640> given<00:01:11.909> us<00:01:12.000> problems

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
start it's never given us problems

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:20.300 
start it's never given us problems
before<00:01:13.549> all<00:01:14.549> right<00:01:18.650> it's<00:01:19.650> real<00:01:19.799> simple<00:01:20.009> make

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
before all right it's real simple make

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.789 
before all right it's real simple make
sure<00:01:20.430> it's<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.700> neutral<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.930> has<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> brake

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
sure it's a neutral it has a brake

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.170 
sure it's a neutral it has a brake
permissive<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.400> got<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.610> have<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.790> brake<00:01:23.970> on

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
permissive you got to have the brake on

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.609 
permissive you got to have the brake on
and<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.509> deck<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.869> up<00:01:25.020> I'm<00:01:25.200> going<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.409> give<00:01:25.530> it

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
and the deck is up I'm going to give it

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.600 
and the deck is up I'm going to give it
full<00:01:25.830> choke<00:01:26.750> half<00:01:27.750> throttle<00:01:28.110> turn<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.189> on<00:01:29.340> and

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
full choke half throttle turn it on and

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.609 
full choke half throttle turn it on and
hopefully<00:01:29.880> we'll<00:01:30.329> crank<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:31.200> battery's<00:01:31.560> not

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
hopefully we'll crank the battery's not

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.979 
hopefully we'll crank the battery's not
dead
