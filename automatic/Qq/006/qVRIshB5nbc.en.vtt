00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.820
 when we are solo in front of reindeer 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.530

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.539

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.729

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.260
 predict we put on also the 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.480
 alien flying saucer 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.820
 and we also have people armored vehicles 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.420
 armored trucks making snow and 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.440
