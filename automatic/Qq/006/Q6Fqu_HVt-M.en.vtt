00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.089
 not 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:14.059
 here in fact so we are in phase of 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:15.949
 competition since these are the 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.330
 world championships of schladming so 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.759
 there we are not at all in 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.590
 development one is really sure of 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:24.380
 activation training watch 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.300
 race eve so we go on 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.900
 inexpensive exercises in energy so 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.519
 support work light support sought 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.599
 that's always working even if 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.970
 it's an individual sport worked 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.940
 also on group cohesion so by 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.410
 little duels by exercises that 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.600
 involve a little bit the whole 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.420
 world so maintain some 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.010
 emulation within the group and so there 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.309
 we are really sure of the simple 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.589
 dynamic that costs in energy to be 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:56.930
 very fine not tired and is ready for the 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:58.519
 next day lean later two 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:17.200
 okay right today 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:17.200
 it's a pleasure to dilemma these two names 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:45.920
 josÃ© box with dynamic dynamics 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:51.880
 continue but so far I 'm doing my roof 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.880
 yeah during star impositions 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:07.849
 site that we but I know how much 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:19.790
 did you understand this tortuous missed four 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:35.600
 coaches of montevideo where can it happen 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:38.480
 on the islands then defeated by in the 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.790
 bags of halls and we see continuous 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:46.060
 continuous continuous 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.060
 lille has not balanced well
