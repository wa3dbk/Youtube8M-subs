00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.559
 observe that it has the seal of 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.690
 quality hinges left pointing 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.750

 the power and audio cord are original or 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.219
 acrylic on the back here 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.170
 Do not have anything, it's not just back. 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.199
 people and if that is perfect 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.739
 We'll even see the power cable. 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.500
 cool here and hinges in order the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.439
 is a device that is very 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.210
 preserved we'll see here coming back 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.299
 already a turn nor from here we go 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.280
 seeing the side 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:17.670
 really good conditions 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.890
 conditions and I will turn a little more 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.040
 Here we see the front part of the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:28.020
 somewhat as acrylic panel 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.479
 is not inferior in optimal conditions you 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.810
 they will see nothing is broken or have 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.150
 cadu the record board is very conservative 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.090
 It's really beautiful, we'll see. 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:43.890
 here is an acrylic that is quite 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:45.450
 transparent very nice no risks 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.390
 those spots 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.340
 It is pretty cool so far little sign of the 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.470
 identification of the environment 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.540
 we can only notice 11 trynka 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.360
 here in this machine here we 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.540
 have to stop to look this is fine 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.840
 soft talent boyle is the only detail 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.040
 zinho to have this cover to cap 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.820
 beautiful 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.890
 very whole does not have those have cases 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.200
 stains those horrible things not to 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.000
 People going inside are a cap. 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.270
 holding up 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.700
 We are seeing here in the background. 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.970
 hinges in excellent condition and the 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.310
 acrylic and well then it's there a lot 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.020
 Nice to happen to the table to the table. 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.360
 it's very conservative 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.070
 the small peeled here on the 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.710
 background just right 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.900
 but the rest from the base to very 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.700
 cool here have the stops 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.590
 neighbors of the acrylic 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.940
 so we see a very basic 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.380
 original weight is this appliance. 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.470
 have a skateboard 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:55.270

 capsule and a new needle is 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.220
 person to carry a new needle does not 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.260
 have to do no do not have to have 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.650
 no expense whatsoever 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.820
 We are learning here the rug in 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.900
 excellent conditions 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.790
 the dish great conditions also then the 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.280
 People are going to see a device that is fine. 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.570
 cool for the user 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.209
 We pass the front panel here. 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.640
 that have the descriptive serigraphy 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.549
 perfeitinha then it is a device 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:32.630
 fully automatic belt drive né 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:34.940
 it has two speeds 33 and 45 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.820
 the screen is fine. 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:41.890
 here is the mark of the model of the 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:45.560
 10 40 device and here all the keys 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.540
 functional gifts if you are 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.630
 functional we have to test 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:54.049
 It's to prove that, we 'll go there. 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:59.180
 Then we 'll put in the 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:04:01.780
 automatic and let's start and let's go 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.600
 see what happens there ó he has raised 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.090
 it will position itself on the disk 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.450
 Let's go, let's see your 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.520
 ability with which it falls on the disk is 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.950
 there ne 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:20.170
 I see a little dirt on the 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:22.690
 needle I 'm going to ready, beauty. 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:29.640
 Let's see the sound is giving this device 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:29.640
 here it has begun a little bit better 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:39.689
 3rd channel ghetto side canal side 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:42.939
 left running perfectly 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:46.810
 placement is very good as a right 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:50.259
 raise Pió move to another song 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.629
 next song we will think that you 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:53.530
 See the descent attack I 'll rise from 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:57.479
 new 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.479
 you will see in this smooth path 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:04.229
 now yes we following the designated rig O 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.830
 cast 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:16.060
 we have another table that is the channel 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:18.729
 lake of the environment goes to canal abc diego 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.520
 two working perfectly 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:26.800
 the rotation people perfect to you that 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:29.699
 knows the music can check the sound 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.699
 of this pair 

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:53.319
 but released a very stable dish and 

00:05:50.859 --> 00:05:56.039
 very cool and I will not ruin your 

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:56.039
 risks in the hour 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.380
 Good, we're going to have to sit down now, I'll go. 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.680
 download a little bit we'll test the 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:20.220
 automatic closing I tighten 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.080
 here he has to quit right in 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.030
 any time here anywhere 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.410
 is on the disc it will do the 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.080
 auto save 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:30.990
 this is one of the functions of a record player 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:33.240
 which is full is not fully automatic 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:39.330
 So we see here he hung up 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:40.950
 Let's make a protest that is the beginning. 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.900
 again the automaton that we are going to do 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:44.780
 auto-complete with problem 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:51.540
 then all the functioning of the mechanism 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:07:02.700
 because it accompanies the movement is very 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:07:05.420
 cool fail to start recording 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.420
 finalization 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:12.210
 so here it is good to put it on 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:15.240
 end when you take the islands to 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:22.640
 terna automatically is but he arrived 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:24.720
 in the final and returns just changed 

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.730
 fully automatic 

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.890
 the appliance has been proven that 

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.810
 Working perfectly 

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:33.090
 Are you looking invented? Are you? 

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:35.960

 good taste and the perfect sonority train 

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:52.590
 pac is a gradient on descends 40 good luck 

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:55.970
 for those who can acquire a large 

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:55.970
 hug until the next
