00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
millimeter size 20 whatever anyway so I

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.170

went and pounded that thing in there if

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.130 
went and pounded that thing in there if
you<00:00:54.300> look<00:00:54.450> here<00:00:54.780> there<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.380> a<00:00:55.920> cap<00:00:56.310> right<00:00:57.030> here

if you carefully you can slide them out
together<00:02:21.290> up<00:02:21.680> through<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:21.980> top<00:02:22.130> just<00:02:22.550> like

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
together up through the top just like

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.690 
together up through the top just like
this<00:02:23.470> okay

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
this okay

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.200 
this okay
that's<00:02:25.700> what<00:02:25.880> I<00:02:25.910> did<00:02:26.140> anyway<00:02:27.140> once<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.310> get

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
that's what I did anyway once you get

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.960 
that's what I did anyway once you get
all<00:02:29.330> that<00:02:29.740> out<00:02:30.740> of<00:02:30.800> the<00:02:30.980> way<00:02:31.130> you<00:02:31.670> want<00:02:31.820> to<00:02:31.880> make

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
all that out of the way you want to make

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.600 
all that out of the way you want to make
sure<00:02:32.000> you<00:02:32.390> loosen<00:02:32.780> this<00:02:32.930> up<00:02:33.170> then<00:02:33.470> next<00:02:33.770> but

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
sure you loosen this up then next but

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.670 
sure you loosen this up then next but
don't<00:02:34.790> take<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.060> bolt<00:02:35.240> out<00:02:35.390> quite<00:02:35.720> yet<00:02:36.020> okay

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
don't take the bolt out quite yet okay

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.830 
don't take the bolt out quite yet okay
it's<00:02:37.220> much<00:02:37.460> easier<00:02:38.000> if<00:02:38.240> you<00:02:38.390> get<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.630> proper

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
it's much easier if you get the proper

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.770 
it's much easier if you get the proper
size<00:02:39.140> wrench<00:02:39.440> of<00:02:39.620> this<00:02:39.740> one<00:02:39.890> I<00:02:39.920> can<00:02:40.220> tell<00:02:40.430> you

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
size wrench of this one I can tell you

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.810 
size wrench of this one I can tell you
is<00:02:41.780> 15<00:02:42.350> so<00:02:43.010> a<00:02:43.040> 15<00:02:43.520> millimeter<00:02:43.910> wrench<00:02:44.830> for<00:02:45.830> this

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
is 15 so a 15 millimeter wrench for this

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:47.920 
is 15 so a 15 millimeter wrench for this
down<00:02:47.060> here<00:02:47.330> and<00:02:47.390> I'm<00:02:47.570> gonna<00:02:47.690> go<00:02:47.780> ahead<00:02:47.840> and

if you're looking I'm looking
there<00:03:00.739> is<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.130> tensioner<00:03:01.640> right<00:03:02.180> there<00:03:03.610> okay

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.030 

basically<00:03:08.420> what<00:03:08.570> you<00:03:08.660> can<00:03:08.690> do<00:03:08.900> here<00:03:09.140> is<00:03:09.170> what

basically what you can do here is what

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.300 
basically what you can do here is what

you have to do is push down and that

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.630 
you have to do is push down and that
releases<00:03:13.580> tension<00:03:13.940> it's<00:03:14.360> awfully<00:03:14.750> tight<00:03:15.080> so

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
releases tension it's awfully tight so

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.860 
releases tension it's awfully tight so
push<00:03:16.640> down<00:03:16.820> and<00:03:16.940> release<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.330> tension<00:03:17.540> if<00:03:17.750> you

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
or get a breaker bar and push down on it

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.160 
or get a breaker bar and push down on it
it'll<00:03:21.950> relieve<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:22.430> pressure<00:03:22.670> from<00:03:23.330> the

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
it'll relieve the pressure from the

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.470 
it'll relieve the pressure from the
tension<00:03:24.500> from<00:03:24.620> this<00:03:24.830> and<00:03:25.190> then<00:03:25.850> once<00:03:26.180> this<00:03:26.330> is

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
tension from this and then once this is

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.990 
tension from this and then once this is
loosened<00:03:26.810> up<00:03:26.900> you'll<00:03:27.620> come<00:03:27.920> out<00:03:28.000> basically

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
loosened up you'll come out basically

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.830 
loosened up you'll come out basically
