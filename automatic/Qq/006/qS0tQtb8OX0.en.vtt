00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
him there so it's it's taken it to

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.090 
him there so it's it's taken it to
another<00:01:30.240> level<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.840> honestly<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.740> mean<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:31.950> was

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
another level and honestly I mean I was

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.100 
another level and honestly I mean I was
I<00:01:32.310> felt<00:01:32.579> better<00:01:32.759> with<00:01:32.970> our<00:01:33.119> race<00:01:33.600> car<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:33.990> in

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
I felt better with our race car that in

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.929 
I felt better with our race car that in
our<00:01:34.200> qualifying<00:01:34.650> car<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.130> hopefully<00:01:35.759> that

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
our qualifying car so hopefully that

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.880 
our qualifying car so hopefully that
that<00:01:36.180> bodes<00:01:36.869> well<00:01:36.990> for<00:01:37.140> us<00:01:37.350> for<00:01:37.560> tomorrow<00:01:38.000> the

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
that bodes well for us for tomorrow the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.219 
that bodes well for us for tomorrow the
idea<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.070> win<00:01:41.220> every<00:01:41.310> week<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:41.850> we<00:01:41.880> haven't

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.600 

I'm<00:01:46.229> done<00:01:46.409> again<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:46.830> for<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.100> would<00:01:47.430> be<00:01:47.520> good

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
I'm done again so for this would be good

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.240 
I'm done again so for this would be good
we<00:01:47.759> came<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.030> start<00:01:48.299> but<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:49.020> think<00:01:49.409> if<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.680> know

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
we came to start but I think if you know

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.530 
we came to start but I think if you know
what<00:01:50.400> you're<00:01:50.520> doing<00:01:50.759> with<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:50.970> championship

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
what you're doing with the championship

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.999 
what you're doing with the championship
the<00:01:51.840> pressures<00:01:52.200> on<00:01:52.290> from<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.560> first<00:01:52.770> race

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
the pressures on from the first race

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.380 
the pressures on from the first race
because<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.640> points<00:01:55.820> in<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.970> same<00:01:57.119> as<00:01:57.270> the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
because it points in the same as the

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.930 
because it points in the same as the
pointing<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.869> last<00:01:58.080> so<00:01:58.670> you<00:01:59.670> know<00:01:59.790> that

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
pointing to the last so you know that

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.310 
pointing to the last so you know that
pressure<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.420> on<00:02:00.539> because<00:02:00.750> we<00:02:00.990> all<00:02:01.080> want<00:02:01.259> to

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
pressure is on because we all want to

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.440 
pressure is on because we all want to
win<00:02:01.500> whether<00:02:01.710> it's<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.670> know<00:02:02.700> will<00:02:03.000> myself

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
win whether it's you know will myself

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.880 
win whether it's you know will myself
Scott<00:02:04.020> we<00:02:04.140> hope<00:02:04.259> with<00:02:04.409> different<00:02:04.710> pressure

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
Scott we hope with different pressure

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.950 
Scott we hope with different pressure
