00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.200
 hello how are we already back with 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:08.330
 more news from minecraft and its new 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.630
 update that is update 12 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:15.080
 the only new thing there is of the news 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.510
 of minecraft is that because of and studies 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.820
 uploaded a picture to twitter of the tape 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.380
 update did not say much only 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.780
 they said that without working in the 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.449
 update but here is a picture with 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.520
 new things so let's check the 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.789
 although I already came back but not these girls my 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.789
 plants 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:38.110
 as always we will go to see the 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.430
 ok image as we see here is the image 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.290
 not much to see 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.800
 well there's not much that I've discovered and 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.300
 waths up 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.920
 I'll still say it so I'm going to start now 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.489
 but first of all as surely 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.710
 make an account until after the 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.800
 structures that are colored like that 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.750
 yellow is a new blog called 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.670
 chis sans exist in English 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.410
 it's a block that joined in the 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.490
 computer nothing else you can get 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.689
 in 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.180
 I think you can not even get in 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.189
 creative way if you do not have to put it 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.630
 in commands by I'm sure that as 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.780
 we do not have commands to do the 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.360
 creative mode so that's something new 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.420
 a new block in minecraft something else 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.820
 new that is almost obvious is that there is now 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.100
 stairs for the edges like this here as 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.470
 in the structure of ekin and this little house 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.930
 has stairs are the edges 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.240
 they come together and so another thing that does not 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.820
 I'm pretty sure it's from the blocks 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.700
 from here down to the left I do not know very 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.420
 well what is that but it seems like they seem 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.420
 things 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:57.130
 but he's going to put it on the screen 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.380
 because I'm still recording and I do not want to use 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.840
 much 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.570
 a lot of time in this recording so 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.119
 we will continue with the following other 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.479
 thing that we can see good that I can see 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.880
 but I'm not sure about this is that there 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.350
 torches of different color I do not know if it is 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.990
 something good here I'm going to circulate 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.290
 for example this torch is more 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.670
 yellow that the red ones from here back 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.490
 I know very well in the video because they are 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.310
 something far away but I'm going to 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.520
 try to give a show in another image here 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.290
 you can pretty much distinguish what there is 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.560
 different color in the torches but not 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.690
 I'm very sure of that, so here's 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.570
 people who have put that are different 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.940
 torches of colors but not not very 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.180
 sure so do not have that much 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.430
 have no status for sure 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.170
 another thing that we see here back to 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:54.799
 the right I do not know what it is but it is colored 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:59.760
 like that purple black like it was 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:01.260
 obsidian but I guess if it's something 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.709
 new that has to do with obsidian 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.610
 I guess it's a lens hood I think 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.530
 what if it says in Spanish 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.890
 a chest of the entity is like a chest 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:15.370
 normal but to have it or you have it 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:19.090
 you put it and what you put eliceche is in 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.400
 that chest you will have the other chest 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.050
 of the entity that you put in another side for that 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.720
 it's not very safe either, today I'm a 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.420
 vision to one of the images nothing the 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.470
 they put twitter 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.420
 we have to go up in things but 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.220
 I think that's all as I said no 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.470
 I'm very sure about the types of 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.489
 torch colors and on the 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.489
 structure that is up here 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.150
 I guess it 's wood or something like that but not 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.770
 is very good that's all we have 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.450
 until now for the moment about 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.450
 minecraft news 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.420
 so with we have more news of 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.269
 close in minecraft as obviously 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.220

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.750

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.120

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.520

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:10.280
 upload to a video so 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:14.000
