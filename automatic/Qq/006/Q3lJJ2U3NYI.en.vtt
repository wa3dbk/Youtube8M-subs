00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620
 One day I'm here to show you. 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.620
 how to use the electric pressure cooker 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.719
 I the electronics 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.839
 It's worth remembering that this is the 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.539
 pressure as any other pan 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:28.650
 personal and leaves special care 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:34.980
 for her number too bad because 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:40.530
 have as having used it and I 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:43.140
 next look you put the food and 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.079
 put the link you should never 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.300
 exceed this last range of four 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.300
 fifths boarding the pan 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.930
 you can see that you should never have low 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.180
 a fifth that is is down there in part 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.010
 end of the pan 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:06.030
 so if you put below a 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.710
 fifth or above the last track you 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.100
 is at risk 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.369
 the case was liquid and cinnamon 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.710
 something small fast and result 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.030
 that puts a lot of water that also offer 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.040
 you only with her all around 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.780
 then it works normally 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:31.829
 I, for example, I get to the maximum 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:35.180
 three-fifths a little says more or 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:40.920
 at that time here in the nick frame 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:44.159
 many problems and another thing is this 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:50.600
 pot where it works 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:55.680
 When we put it down she goes. 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:02:00.920
 permanently attached to the shape and 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:03.950
 go help that is closed 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.710
 the function control valve must 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:11.330
 to be fully turned to height 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:14.510
 cover that is second home is Mexico 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.190
 can give problem worried her that is 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.800
 come back to you 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.780
 she is totally releasing presented 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.340
 as the king of the gang to cook she goes 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.850
 stay very fast and it will not run like 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.569
 port while maintaining the 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.519
 which does not totally face up 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:37.670
 to release after cooking your 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:41.150
 food to release to produce 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.850
 wheat as words immediately what 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.840
 waiting for repression or in this way 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.680
 it is 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.220
 or you will live the fully insulated pin 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.989
 on the left side 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.470
 This way you're releasing more 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:00.980
 eclectic photo of her and she goes 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.769
 Release the child for you can open 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.440
 with her in love you do not know who killed 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.180
 the result and thinks that it can occur 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.720
 any burn problem 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:18.530
 so do not try i advise another 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:20.780
 thing when you put your anec 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.150
 food has its cooking time 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.489
 this is not to say that it is not exactly 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.640
 because in that period you are enrolled 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.609
 on the banana because the rain is as follows 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.489
 Can you trust a pan? 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:38.000
 the rice with ten minutes in the person pan 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:41.530
 but he can trust later while I 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.450
 I 'm going home, you put rice 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.560
 There you go in the pot and click on the name 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.940
 rice 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:53.930
 it will mark aquino of control 10 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:57.549
 minutes but will only start to work and 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:02.359
 It took 10 minutes for you, which is cute. 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:05.840
 sold time after 8 to 9 and 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:10.640
 only after the window reaches the 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.640
 temperature and the version inside 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.370
 how does it stabilize 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.070
 acts in pressure inside I will pass 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.120
 decrease the child do not count 10 minutes 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.730
 fully 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.670
 he will pass and we have that robot 10 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:28.960
 minutes but will only count this 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:31.240
 after the pressure and temperature in the 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.510
 pot stabilize 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:38.290
 when you say that you put 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.850
 the beans arrived 40 minutes counting 40 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.120
 minutes 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:46.960
 There you go with the carioca beans that 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:50.050
 were finished right away hoping to get out 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:53.950
 pressure and when my panela beans 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.990
 It is in politics who do not want and 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.150
 is with the races is not running 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.940
 but it's almost there and you do not want to put 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.010
 plus 40 trout click and close again 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.950
 say you have in the table of 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.630
 for example that comes in the 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:11.530
 table has instinct eg chicken 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:13.840
 20 minutes you think it's more or less 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:17.590
 This time I'll cook you 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.320
 put the chicken 20 minutes and leave 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.479
 pot pan 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:26.080
 that period I will take that with his 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:29.410
 cinnamon when the process only 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.600
 panela that was happening and 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.330
 if you happen to think it is not 20 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:37.390
 minutes you will reap at 30 what you 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:40.930
 want to make movies that you have placed 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:42.430
 sin by mistake 20 minutes you 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.630
 places 30 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.890
 you go in time adjustments and it goes 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.160
 asking how many times it's necessary 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:55.479
 until you reach the time you want 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:59.650
 from there the pan normally and I go 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:06:01.570
 wait finish coin will happen 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:05.200

 Fininho turned directly to alf e 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:16.630
 when you finish thrashing the pan 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:21.510
 will're here you will choose to leave 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:25.320
 normally leave until there is pressure or 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:29.550
 to advance the pressure fernando raw pin 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:34.530
