00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
personally have the feeling that I

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.140 
personally have the feeling that I
should<00:02:49.829> be<00:02:49.950> mixing<00:02:50.310> up<00:02:50.519> a<00:02:50.609> little<00:02:50.819> bit<00:02:50.940> and

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
should be mixing up a little bit and

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.910 
should be mixing up a little bit and
this<00:02:51.569> challenge<00:02:52.079> series<00:02:52.409> might<00:02:52.680> actually

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
this challenge series might actually

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.339 
this challenge series might actually
allow<00:02:53.430> me<00:02:53.609> to<00:02:53.730> do<00:02:53.909> this<00:02:54.120> now<00:02:54.389> this<00:02:54.900> challenge

any class that up he could use any score

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.710 
any class that up he could use any score
streak<00:03:13.650> set<00:03:13.920> up<00:03:14.099> and<00:03:14.280> he<00:03:14.790> could<00:03:14.970> play<00:03:15.180> any<00:03:15.420> game

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.080 
streak set up and he could play any game
mode<00:03:15.930> but<00:03:16.109> he<00:03:16.169> had<00:03:16.379> to<00:03:16.500> play<00:03:16.709> solo<00:03:17.220> and<00:03:17.489> he<00:03:17.879> had

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
mode but he had to play solo and he had

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.849 
mode but he had to play solo and he had
to<00:03:18.269> life<00:03:18.449> commentate<00:03:19.019> throughout<00:03:19.500> and<00:03:19.739> then

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
to life commentate throughout and then

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.589 
to life commentate throughout and then
he<00:03:19.949> could<00:03:20.129> only<00:03:20.250> try<00:03:20.579> this<00:03:20.639> in<00:03:21.060> five<00:03:21.389> different

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
he could only try this in five different

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.180 
he could only try this in five different
games<00:03:21.930> so<00:03:22.049> we<00:03:22.109> had<00:03:22.230> five<00:03:22.440> different<00:03:22.799> attempts

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
games so we had five different attempts

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.860 
games so we had five different attempts
I'm<00:03:23.760> pretty<00:03:24.030> sure<00:03:24.209> that<00:03:24.389> he<00:03:24.510> failed<00:03:24.750> to

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
I'm pretty sure that he failed to

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:25.879 
I'm pretty sure that he failed to
complete<00:03:25.169> this<00:03:25.319> one<00:03:25.560> this<00:03:25.709> of<00:03:25.859> course

quite<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:55.590> bit<00:03:55.769> actually<00:03:55.919> just<00:03:56.310> personally

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
quite a bit actually just personally

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.129 
quite a bit actually just personally
didn't<00:03:56.879> really<00:03:57.090> feel<00:03:57.299> like<00:03:57.359> posting<00:03:57.720> a<00:03:57.989> new

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.379 
didn't really feel like posting a new
weapon<00:03:58.470> comparison<00:03:59.069> so<00:03:59.609> I<00:03:59.639> simply<00:04:00.120> haven't

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389
