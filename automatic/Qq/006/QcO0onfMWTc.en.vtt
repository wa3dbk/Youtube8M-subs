and a glass of champagne so let's get

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.620 
and a glass of champagne so let's get
over<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.869> set<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.260> begin<00:00:20.210> our<00:00:21.210> lane<00:00:21.420> is

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
over to the set and begin our lane is

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.140 
over to the set and begin our lane is
very<00:00:21.840> simple<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.439> clamp<00:00:22.980> lamp<00:00:23.279> with<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.640> hundred

through<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.230> piece<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.710> vellum<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.310> onto<00:00:29.849> our

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
through a piece of vellum and onto our

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.659 
through a piece of vellum and onto our
set<00:00:30.269> where<00:00:30.570> we<00:00:30.689> have<00:00:30.840> our<00:00:30.990> glass<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.669> behind

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
set where we have our glass and behind

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.190 
set where we have our glass and behind
that<00:00:32.790> you'll<00:00:33.000> see<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.390> stick<00:00:33.780> back<00:00:33.809> there

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
that you'll see that stick back there

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.500 
that you'll see that stick back there
that's<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.500> sparkler

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
that's a sparkler

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.490 
that's a sparkler
we're<00:00:36.510> get<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.660> better<00:00:36.809> look<00:00:37.050> at<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.290> from<00:00:37.469> a

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
we're get a better look at that from a

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.610 
we're get a better look at that from a
different<00:00:37.649> angle<00:00:38.540> so<00:00:39.540> here<00:00:39.719> we're<00:00:39.840> using<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:40.200> 70

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
different angle so here we're using a 70

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.470 
different angle so here we're using a 70
to<00:00:40.800> 200<00:00:40.980> millimeter<00:00:41.610> zoom<00:00:41.910> lens<00:00:42.149> on<00:00:42.329> the

to 200 millimeter zoom lens on the
camera<00:00:42.649> shoot<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.739> at<00:00:43.980> around<00:00:44.100> 121

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
camera shoot it at around 121

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.090 
camera shoot it at around 121
millimeters<00:00:45.539> there<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:45.960> see<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.320> light

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
millimeters there you see the light

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.520 
millimeters there you see the light
coming<00:00:47.670> through<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.940> vellum<00:00:48.360> tissue<00:00:48.440> and<00:00:49.440> on

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
coming through the vellum tissue and on

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.619 
coming through the vellum tissue and on
our<00:00:49.680> set<00:00:49.950> we<00:00:50.100> have<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.370> glass<00:00:50.640> set<00:00:51.300> up<00:00:51.449> in

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
our set we have the glass set up in

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.630 
our set we have the glass set up in
front<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.410> sparkler<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.070> sparkler<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:53.610> a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
front of a sparkler the sparkler is on a

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.310 
front of a sparkler the sparkler is on a
block<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.149> get<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.510> at<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.780> right<00:00:54.989> height

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
block to get it at the right height

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.439 
block to get it at the right height
because<00:00:56.129> we<00:00:56.250> want<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.610> sparkle<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.120> be<00:00:57.239> right

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
because we want the sparkle to be right

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.119 
because we want the sparkle to be right
behind<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.870> top<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.320> glass<00:00:58.500> or<00:00:58.800> near<00:00:59.010> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
behind the top of the glass or near the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.520 
behind the top of the glass or near the
top<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.550> glass<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.960> next<00:01:01.170> thing<00:01:01.410> we

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
top of the glass so the next thing we

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.380 
top of the glass so the next thing we
need<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.739> do<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.399> get<00:01:02.489> an<00:01:02.609> exposure<00:01:03.000> for

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
need to do is to get an exposure for

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.260 
need to do is to get an exposure for
just<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.780> sparkler<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.830> we've<00:01:05.339> marked<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
just the sparkler so we've marked on the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.080 
just the sparkler so we've marked on the
on<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.200> card<00:01:07.470> here<00:01:07.770> where<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.100> glass<00:01:08.310> goes<00:01:08.729> so

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
on the card here where the glass goes so

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.810 
on the card here where the glass goes so
we<00:01:09.180> can<00:01:09.299> take<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.630> away<00:01:10.549> and<00:01:11.549> now<00:01:11.700> we're

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
we can take that away and now we're

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.550 
we can take that away and now we're
going<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:11.970> do<00:01:12.090> just<00:01:12.119> an<00:01:12.540> exposure<00:01:12.900> for<00:01:13.439> the

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
going to do just an exposure for the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.950 
going to do just an exposure for the
sparkler<00:01:14.210> so<00:01:15.210> after<00:01:15.479> testing<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.900> few

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
sparkler so after testing a few

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.929 
sparkler so after testing a few
different<00:01:16.650> exposures<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.490> found<00:01:17.759> that

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
different exposures I found that

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.010 
different exposures I found that
shooting<00:01:18.210> an<00:01:18.330> f32

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
shooting an f32

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.370 
shooting an f32
at<00:01:19.560> two<00:01:20.040> seconds<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.970> really<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> good<00:01:21.840> exposure

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
at two seconds is really a good exposure

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.070 
at two seconds is really a good exposure
for<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.430> sparkler<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.210> will<00:01:24.360> give<00:01:24.509> us<00:01:24.630> enough

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
for the sparkler it will give us enough

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.460 
for the sparkler it will give us enough
time<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:26.240> record<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.299> lot<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.689> sparkles<00:01:28.229> as

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
time to record a lot of the sparkles as

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.560 
time to record a lot of the sparkles as
well<00:01:28.829> as<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.979> lot<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.220> depth<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.579> field<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.299> keep

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
well as a lot of depth of field to keep

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.920 
well as a lot of depth of field to keep
the<00:01:30.750> glass<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.829> sparkles<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.490> focus<00:01:32.930> okay

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
the glass and the sparkles in focus okay

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.149 
the glass and the sparkles in focus okay
now<00:01:34.079> we're<00:01:34.200> going<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.380> put<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.560> glass<00:01:34.740> back<00:01:34.770> on

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
now we're going to put the glass back on

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.249 
now we're going to put the glass back on
the<00:01:35.280> set<00:01:35.689> remember<00:01:36.689> we<00:01:36.810> marked<00:01:37.140> the

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
the set remember we marked the

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.870 
the set remember we marked the
background<00:01:37.740> with<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.009> line<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.549> we<00:01:38.640> can<00:01:38.729> get<00:01:38.790> it

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
background with a line so we can get it

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.940 
background with a line so we can get it
right<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.270> spot<00:01:39.540> we<00:01:40.170> had<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.470> before<00:01:40.829> when

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
right in the spot we had it before when

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.940 
right in the spot we had it before when
we<00:01:41.100> lined<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.460> up

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.170 

and<00:01:45.830> we<00:01:46.830> need<00:01:46.979> now<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.189> control<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.939> amount<00:01:48.060> of

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
and we need now to control the amount of

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.490 
and we need now to control the amount of
light<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.659> glass<00:01:48.869> we<00:01:49.110> need<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.320> get<00:01:49.409> our

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
light on the glass we need to get our

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.320 
light on the glass we need to get our
glass<00:01:49.710> exposure<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.520> we<00:01:50.670> do<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.000> by<00:01:51.180> moving

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
glass exposure and we do that by moving

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.960 
glass exposure and we do that by moving
the<00:01:51.600> light<00:01:51.830> not<00:01:52.830> by<00:01:53.040> adjusting<00:01:53.490> our<00:01:53.640> camera

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
the light not by adjusting our camera

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.020 
the light not by adjusting our camera
settings<00:01:55.250> so<00:01:56.250> just<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.549> further<00:01:56.790> explanation

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
settings so just a further explanation

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.260 
settings so just a further explanation
on<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.689> as<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.350> move<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.710> light<00:01:58.860> back<00:01:59.270> from

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
on that as you move the light back from

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.510 
on that as you move the light back from
the<00:02:00.390> paper<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.869> spreads<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.440> light<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.890> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
the paper it spreads the light and the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.630 
the paper it spreads the light and the
exposure<00:02:02.880> will<00:02:03.210> be<00:02:03.299> less<00:02:04.009> so<00:02:05.009> if<00:02:05.280> you're<00:02:05.460> too

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
exposure will be less so if you're too

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.050 
exposure will be less so if you're too
dark<00:02:05.940> simply<00:02:06.930> move<00:02:07.110> your<00:02:07.140> light<00:02:07.470> closer<00:02:08.060> try

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
dark simply move your light closer try

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.740 
dark simply move your light closer try
it<00:02:09.119> again

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
it again

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.840 
it again
you're<00:02:10.229> still<00:02:10.500> too<00:02:10.679> dark<00:02:10.830> move<00:02:11.100> it<00:02:11.250> closer<00:02:11.489> yet

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
you're still too dark move it closer yet

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.630 
you're still too dark move it closer yet
and<00:02:12.470> by<00:02:13.470> just<00:02:13.709> moving<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.040> light<00:02:14.220> back<00:02:14.430> and

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
and by just moving the light back and

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.059 
and by just moving the light back and
forth<00:02:14.940> like<00:02:15.209> this<00:02:15.510> you're<00:02:15.870> controlling<00:02:16.380> the

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
forth like this you're controlling the

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.590 
forth like this you're controlling the
amount<00:02:17.280> of<00:02:17.430> light<00:02:17.640> on<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.880> glass<00:02:18.090> without

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
amount of light on the glass without

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.340 
amount of light on the glass without
changing<00:02:19.590> any<00:02:19.769> of<00:02:19.860> your<00:02:20.040> camera<00:02:20.430> settings

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
changing any of your camera settings

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.600 
changing any of your camera settings
okay<00:02:22.350> so<00:02:22.590> now<00:02:22.680> we're<00:02:22.799> ready<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:23.100> give<00:02:23.220> it<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.400> try

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
okay so now we're ready to give it a try

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.500 
okay so now we're ready to give it a try
first<00:02:24.269> fill<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.810> glass<00:02:25.049> halfway<00:02:25.950> up<00:02:26.510> we're

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
first fill the glass halfway up we're

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.509 
first fill the glass halfway up we're
using<00:02:27.660> ginger<00:02:27.989> ale<00:02:28.230> by<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.470> way<00:02:28.680> we<00:02:29.130> go<00:02:29.280> broke

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
using ginger ale by the way we go broke

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.000 
using ginger ale by the way we go broke
with<00:02:29.700> champagne<00:02:30.299> so<00:02:31.200> we're<00:02:31.350> using<00:02:31.470> ginger<00:02:31.739> ale

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
with champagne so we're using ginger ale

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.970 
with champagne so we're using ginger ale
nice<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:33.030> bubbly<00:02:33.600> and<00:02:33.870> everything<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.890> our

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.610 
nice and bubbly and everything and our
sparklers<00:02:35.580> lined<00:02:35.790> up<00:02:35.940> behind<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:36.390> glass<00:02:36.620> so

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
sparklers lined up behind the glass so

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.199 
sparklers lined up behind the glass so
when<00:02:37.769> we<00:02:37.890> light<00:02:38.069> the<00:02:38.190> sparkler<00:02:38.730> we're<00:02:39.090> going

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
when we light the sparkler we're going

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.820 
when we light the sparkler we're going
to<00:02:39.269> just<00:02:39.450> have<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.720> pour<00:02:40.140> it<00:02:40.170> just<00:02:40.440> get<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.620> nice

to just have to pour it just get a nice

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.740 
to just have to pour it just get a nice
frothy<00:02:41.220> top<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:41.940> click<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.299> shutter<00:02:42.480> at<00:02:42.690> the

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
same time so let's get that sparkler lit

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.300 
same time so let's get that sparkler lit
and<00:02:46.410> give<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.069> try<00:02:49.010> I'm<00:02:50.010> going<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.220> light

know that I just did it once so you can

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.150 
know that I just did it once so you can
see<00:03:24.030> how<00:03:24.120> we<00:03:24.180> did<00:03:24.450> it<00:03:24.569> but<00:03:25.080> I<00:03:25.560> had<00:03:25.830> to<00:03:25.890> shoot

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
see how we did it but I had to shoot

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.050 
see how we did it but I had to shoot
this<00:03:26.340> probably<00:03:27.060> 20<00:03:27.450> times<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:28.530> get<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:29.060> shot

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
this probably 20 times to get the shot

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.110 
this probably 20 times to get the shot
that<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.330> see<00:03:30.569> that<00:03:30.720> I<00:03:30.750> liked<00:03:31.080> so<00:03:31.849> it's<00:03:32.849> a

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
that you see that I liked so it's a

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.820 
that you see that I liked so it's a
little<00:03:33.300> bit<00:03:33.540> of<00:03:33.630> a<00:03:33.690> setup<00:03:33.930> it's<00:03:34.260> a<00:03:34.349> lot<00:03:34.500> of<00:03:34.530> fun

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
little bit of a setup it's a lot of fun

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.780 
little bit of a setup it's a lot of fun
to<00:03:34.950> do<00:03:35.130> you<00:03:35.880> don't<00:03:36.390> necessarily<00:03:36.569> need<00:03:37.140> to<00:03:37.200> do<00:03:37.470> a

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
to do you don't necessarily need to do a

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.160 
to do you don't necessarily need to do a
poor<00:03:38.790> shot<00:03:39.090> with<00:03:39.330> a<00:03:39.360> sparkler<00:03:40.049> in<00:03:40.110> the

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
poor shot with a sparkler in the

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.809 
poor shot with a sparkler in the
background<00:03:40.620> but<00:03:41.340> it<00:03:41.430> does<00:03:41.580> show<00:03:41.790> you

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
background but it does show you
