3 Pro now this laptop is the thing that

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.160 
3 Pro now this laptop is the thing that
makes<00:02:26.879> a<00:02:27.090> tuned<00:02:27.390> one<00:02:27.629> because<00:02:27.959> when<00:02:28.080> you

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
makes a tuned one because when you

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.240 
makes a tuned one because when you
immediately<00:02:28.470> look<00:02:28.650> at<00:02:28.739> this<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:29.099> may<00:02:29.220> think

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
immediately look at this you may think

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.789 
immediately look at this you may think
it's<00:02:29.580> just<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:29.879> plain<00:02:30.239> laptop<00:02:30.870> but<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.650> thing

it's just a plain laptop but the thing
that<00:02:31.920> makes<00:02:32.069> this<00:02:32.190> a<00:02:32.250> 2<00:02:32.400> in<00:02:32.760> one<00:02:32.940> device<00:02:33.209> is<00:02:33.510> its

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
that makes this a 2 in one device is its

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.490 
that makes this a 2 in one device is its
special<00:02:34.379> a<00:02:34.530> hinge<00:02:34.879> so<00:02:35.879> this<00:02:36.030> device<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.989> the

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
special a hinge so this device the the

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.229 
special a hinge so this device the the
lid<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.860> display<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.370> can<00:02:38.400> flip<00:02:38.700> all<00:02:38.849> the<00:02:39.120> way

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
laptop and when looking at the CPU on

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.839 
laptop and when looking at the CPU on
this<00:03:08.489> beast<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:09.870> uses<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.440> core<00:03:10.950> M<00:03:11.160> line<00:03:11.549> of

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
this beast it uses the core M line of

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.420 
this beast it uses the core M line of
CPUs<00:03:12.329> from<00:03:12.510> Intel<00:03:13.019> which<00:03:13.709> is<00:03:13.859> what<00:03:13.980> allow<00:03:14.220> is

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
CPUs from Intel which is what allow is

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.569 
CPUs from Intel which is what allow is
this<00:03:14.579> laptop<00:03:14.819> to<00:03:15.239> be<00:03:15.390> so<00:03:15.720> small<00:03:16.319> and<00:03:17.250> this<00:03:17.370> is<00:03:17.549> a

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
this laptop to be so small and this is a

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.180 
this laptop to be so small and this is a
low<00:03:18.000> voltage<00:03:18.260> CPU<00:03:19.260> so<00:03:19.530> it's<00:03:19.650> not<00:03:19.769> going<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.099> be

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
low voltage CPU so it's not going to be

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.159 
low voltage CPU so it's not going to be

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
let's have dual core i5 or i7 processors

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.189 
let's have dual core i5 or i7 processors
which<00:04:29.430> is<00:04:29.580> pretty<00:04:29.790> standard<00:04:30.060> nowadays<00:04:30.419> yeah

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
which is pretty standard nowadays yeah

which is pretty standard nowadays yeah
it<00:04:31.830> has<00:04:32.100> 4<00:04:32.430> gigabytes<00:04:32.910> of<00:04:33.000> RAM<00:04:33.240> you<00:04:33.480> can<00:04:33.600> bump

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
it has 4 gigabytes of RAM you can bump

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.390 
it has 4 gigabytes of RAM you can bump
it<00:04:33.930> up<00:04:34.020> to<00:04:34.080> 8<00:04:34.260> gigabytes<00:04:34.410> if<00:04:34.860> you<00:04:34.949> want<00:04:35.220> which

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
it up to 8 gigabytes if you want which

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.430 
it up to 8 gigabytes if you want which
again<00:04:35.699> we<00:04:36.150> highly<00:04:36.479> would<00:04:36.570> recommend<00:04:37.050> gain<00:04:37.199> a

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
again we highly would recommend gain a

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.120 
again we highly would recommend gain a
gigabyte<00:04:38.180> set<00:04:39.320> the<00:04:40.320> starting<00:04:40.710> price<00:04:40.830> for<00:04:41.040> this

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
gigabyte set the starting price for this

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.820 
gigabyte set the starting price for this
thing<00:04:41.430> is<00:04:41.669> about<00:04:42.169> $700<00:04:43.169> if<00:04:43.320> you<00:04:43.410> want<00:04:43.650> you

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
thing is about $700 if you want you

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.219 
thing is about $700 if you want you
could<00:04:43.949> go<00:04:44.100> up<00:04:44.250> to<00:04:44.460> 1500<00:04:45.449> which<00:04:45.630> is<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:45.900> highest

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
could go up to 1500 which is the highest

could go up to 1500 which is the highest
that<00:04:46.320> we've<00:04:46.500> found<00:04:46.740> so<00:04:46.919> far<00:04:47.160> the<00:04:47.699> battery<00:04:48.060> life

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
that we've found so far the battery life

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.629 
that we've found so far the battery life
on<00:04:48.360> this<00:04:48.419> thing<00:04:48.630> at<00:04:48.840> an<00:04:48.960> optimal<00:04:49.710> on<00:04:49.979> optimal
