00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
I know so far the only sense of crafting

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.359 
I know so far the only sense of crafting
is<00:01:18.450> herbalism<00:01:18.840> where<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.560> can<00:01:19.740> make<00:01:20.159> some

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369

potions and things like that that are
obviously<00:01:22.170> better<00:01:22.409> than<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.369> ones<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.640> can

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820
