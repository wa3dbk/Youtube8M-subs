00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
simpler approach and based it off a

nineteen eighty styled chevy monte carlo

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.479 
nineteen eighty styled chevy monte carlo
now<00:00:54.059> as<00:00:54.210> far<00:00:54.390> as<00:00:54.449> performance<00:00:54.690> goes<00:00:55.219> this<00:00:56.219> car

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
now as far as performance goes this car

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.349 
now as far as performance goes this car
has<00:00:57.170> about<00:00:58.170> average<00:00:58.739> acceleration<00:00:59.359> average

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
has about average acceleration average

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.689 
has about average acceleration average
handling<00:01:00.870> but<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.410> top<00:01:01.620> speed<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:01.949> actually

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
handling but the top speed is actually

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.390 
handling but the top speed is actually
kind<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.090> fast<00:01:03.359> making<00:01:04.080> for<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> very<00:01:04.530> solid

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
kind of fast making for a very solid

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.260 
kind of fast making for a very solid
vehicle<00:01:06.830> now<00:01:07.830> just<00:01:08.130> like<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.490> vig<00:01:08.670> arrow<00:01:08.909> this

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
vehicle now just like the vig arrow this

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.780 
vehicle now just like the vig arrow this
car<00:01:09.479> also<00:01:09.780> comes<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.439> beater<00:01:10.710> version<00:01:11.220> other

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
car also comes in a beater version other

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.060 
car also comes in a beater version other
than<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.210> ratty<00:01:12.600> appearance<00:01:13.200> there<00:01:13.860> are<00:01:13.950> also

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
than a ratty appearance there are also

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.280 
than a ratty appearance there are also
differences<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.790> performance<00:01:15.290> the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
differences in performance the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.710 
differences in performance the
acceleration<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.070> slower<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.970> top<00:01:18.210> speed<00:01:18.509> is

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
acceleration is slower the top speed is

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.410 
acceleration is slower the top speed is
about<00:01:18.840> average<00:01:19.310> but<00:01:20.310> handling<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.090> about<00:01:21.270> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
about average but handling is about the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.469 
about average but handling is about the
same<00:01:21.630> surprisingly<00:01:22.439> overall<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:24.000> new<00:01:24.180> saber

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
same surprisingly overall the new saber

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.020 
same surprisingly overall the new saber
is<00:01:24.720> an<00:01:24.840> all<00:01:25.080> around<00:01:25.320> good<00:01:25.619> car<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.580> think<00:01:26.909> it

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
is an all around good car and I think it

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.730 
is an all around good car and I think it
just<00:01:27.150> might<00:01:27.360> be<00:01:27.509> my<00:01:27.659> favorite<00:01:27.900> car<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:28.470> grand

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
just might be my favorite car in grand

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.490 
just might be my favorite car in grand

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
theft auto four the only downside

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.760 
theft auto four the only downside
however<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.240> reality<00:01:33.450> monte<00:01:34.290> carlo's
