positions are not trained yet if you

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.560 
positions are not trained yet if you
want<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.279> train<00:00:23.490> positions<00:00:23.939> which<00:00:24.269> are<00:00:24.420> not

as<00:00:27.750> position<00:00:28.289> types<00:00:29.510> and<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.660> can<00:00:30.810> decide

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
as position types and you can decide

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
as position types and you can decide
between<00:00:31.320> completely<00:00:32.279> off<00:00:32.579> luta<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:34.100> will

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
between completely off luta I will

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.400 
between completely off luta I will
demonstrate<00:00:35.280> both<00:00:35.850> approaches<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.899> minute

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
demonstrate both approaches in a minute

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.700 
demonstrate both approaches in a minute
we<00:00:38.250> start<00:00:38.520> with<00:00:38.640> complete<00:00:39.030> line<00:00:39.379> we<00:00:40.379> set<00:00:40.590> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
we start with complete line we set the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.940 
we start with complete line we set the
max<00:00:40.980> length<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.460> line<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.149> five<00:00:45.739> correct<00:00:46.739> move

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
max length of line to five correct move

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.770 
max length of line to five correct move
is<00:00:47.129> just<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.460> top<00:00:47.640> rank<00:00:47.910> for<00:00:48.120> my<00:00:48.270> site

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
is just the top rank for my site

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.889 
is just the top rank for my site
furthermore<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.920> decide<00:00:50.329> always<00:00:51.329> demo<00:00:51.719> line

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
furthermore you decide always demo line

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.500 
furthermore you decide always demo line
first<00:00:55.730> you<00:00:56.730> are<00:00:56.789> ready<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.059> start<00:00:57.420> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
first you are ready to start the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.009 
first you are ready to start the
training<00:01:00.739> you<00:01:01.739> can<00:01:01.920> see<00:01:02.070> how<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.219> program<00:01:03.019> shows

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
training you can see how a program shows

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.509 
training you can see how a program shows
where<00:01:04.260> line<00:01:04.439> which<00:01:04.619> we<00:01:04.799> are<00:01:04.860> supposed<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.309> play

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
where line which we are supposed to play

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.210 
where line which we are supposed to play
in<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.600> second<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:09.439> try<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.500> remember<00:01:10.799> bright

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
in a second I try to remember bright

might see free it's okay I have to

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:10.300 
might see free it's okay I have to
repeat<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.240> same<00:02:00.270> line<00:02:00.719> if<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.530> made<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.740> mistake

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.380 

trust<00:02:11.310> me<00:02:11.459> another<00:02:11.700> line<00:02:13.910> again<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:15.030> can<00:02:15.180> see

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
trust me another line again you can see

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:34.339 
trust me another line again you can see
it's<00:02:15.690> always<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:19.230> same<00:02:32.720> okay<00:02:33.720> that's<00:02:33.900> okay

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
it's always the same okay that's okay

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.619 
it's always the same okay that's okay
for<00:02:34.410> this<00:02:34.680> one<00:02:37.700> you<00:02:38.700> can<00:02:38.849> also<00:02:38.940> see<00:02:39.239> now<00:02:39.420> as<00:02:39.599> a

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
for this one you can also see now as a

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.699 
for this one you can also see now as a
statistic<00:02:40.260> changed<00:02:40.680> 3%<00:02:41.720> are<00:02:42.720> shown<00:02:43.080> as<00:02:43.349> learnt

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
statistic changed 3% are shown as learnt

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.780 
statistic changed 3% are shown as learnt
while<00:02:44.310> still<00:02:44.610> 97<00:02:45.239> percent<00:02:45.569> a<00:02:45.660> lot<00:02:45.780> trained<00:02:46.140> yet

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
while still 97 percent a lot trained yet

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.220 
while still 97 percent a lot trained yet
now<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:47.819> deactivate<00:02:48.540> always<00:02:49.099> Dumoulin<00:02:50.099> first

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
now I deactivate always Dumoulin first

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.650 
now I deactivate always Dumoulin first
and<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.349> will<00:02:52.500> check<00:02:53.430> start<00:02:53.849> with<00:02:54.000> new<00:02:54.209> position

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
and I will check start with new position

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.080 
and I will check start with new position
so<00:02:55.530> follow<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:55.890> program<00:02:56.129> always<00:02:56.489> start<00:02:56.910> with

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
so follow the program always start with

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.449 
so follow the program always start with
the<00:02:57.269> start<00:02:57.900> position<00:02:58.280> there's<00:02:59.280> one<00:02:59.430> a

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
the start position there's one a

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.790 
the start position there's one a
disadvantage<00:03:00.269> I<00:03:00.510> have<00:03:00.959> to<00:03:01.140> repeat<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.620> same

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
disadvantage I have to repeat the same

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.640 
disadvantage I have to repeat the same
moves<00:03:02.099> over<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.640> over<00:03:02.819> again<00:03:03.500> let<00:03:04.500> me<00:03:04.530> show

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
moves over and over again let me show

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.500 
moves over and over again let me show
you<00:03:04.830> an<00:03:05.010> impact<00:03:05.370> of<00:03:05.519> my<00:03:05.700> favorite<00:03:06.150> training

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
you an impact of my favorite training

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.350 
you an impact of my favorite training
option<00:03:06.870> which<00:03:07.650> is<00:03:07.680> start<00:03:08.580> with<00:03:08.760> new<00:03:08.909> position

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
option which is start with new position

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.899 
option which is start with new position
and<00:03:09.569> combination<00:03:10.140> of<00:03:10.260> complete<00:03:10.680> line<00:03:10.909> and

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
and combination of complete line and

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.030 
and combination of complete line and
reset<00:03:12.269> the<00:03:12.450> training<00:03:12.810> scores<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:13.709> now<00:03:13.830> let's

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
reset the training scores and now let's

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.949 
reset the training scores and now let's
see<00:03:14.220> how<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.400> program<00:03:14.849> behaves<00:03:15.150> this<00:03:15.480> time<00:03:17.959> so

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
see how the program behaves this time so

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:28.030 
see how the program behaves this time so
let's<00:03:19.110> no<00:03:19.260> demo<00:03:19.470> from<00:03:19.709> right<00:03:20.040> away<00:03:20.190> to<00:03:20.340> play

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.979 

now<00:03:29.040> notice<00:03:29.489> with<00:03:29.730> difference<00:03:30.120> you're<00:03:30.780> not

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
now notice with difference you're not

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.050 
now notice with difference you're not

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
starting again in the start position but

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.720 
starting again in the start position but
instead<00:03:33.209> it's<00:03:33.750> right<00:03:33.989> away<00:03:34.140> c6<00:03:34.920> is<00:03:37.549> it<00:03:38.549> that's

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
instead it's right away c6 is it that's

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.380 
instead it's right away c6 is it that's
all<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.180> now<00:03:39.599> we<00:03:39.659> can<00:03:39.870> see<00:03:40.049> again<00:03:40.230> you<00:03:40.920> right

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
all and now we can see again you right

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.650 
all and now we can see again you right

different variations you can use the
