okay<00:00:02.090> now<00:00:03.090> let's<00:00:03.330> understand<00:00:03.870> what<00:00:04.440> are<00:00:04.620> the

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:05.180 
okay now let's understand what are the

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:20.090 
okay now let's understand what are the
activities<00:00:09.740> in<00:00:14.870> agriculture<00:00:18.770> now<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:19.800> give<00:00:20.070> you

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
activities in agriculture now I give you

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.470 
activities in agriculture now I give you
an<00:00:20.279> example<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.949> field<00:00:22.949> wherein<00:00:26.180> you<00:00:27.180> had

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
an example of a field wherein you had

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.959 
an example of a field wherein you had
all<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:28.170> trees<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.710> plants<00:00:31.759> now<00:00:32.759> these

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
all the trees and plants now these

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.389 
all the trees and plants now these
plants<00:00:33.329> do<00:00:33.899> not<00:00:33.930> grow<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.380> one<00:00:34.770> single<00:00:35.160> day<00:00:35.340> it

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
plants do not grow in one single day it

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.900 
plants do not grow in one single day it
is<00:00:35.550> an<00:00:35.730> activity<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.630> series<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.200> activity<00:00:38.040> that

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
is an activity a series of activity that

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.810 
is an activity a series of activity that
are<00:00:39.149> taken<00:00:39.600> or<00:00:40.350> rather<00:00:40.680> done<00:00:41.040> by<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.309> farmer

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
are taken or rather done by the farmer

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.459 
are taken or rather done by the farmer
before<00:00:42.570> these<00:00:42.780> plants<00:00:43.469> come<00:00:43.710> up<00:00:45.289> so<00:00:46.289> these

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
before these plants come up so these

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.010 
before these plants come up so these
activities<00:00:46.739> are<00:00:47.430> blessing<00:00:48.000> classified<00:00:48.840> as

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
activities are blessing classified as

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.950 
activities are blessing classified as
follows<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:50.309> first<00:00:50.579> one<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.059> soil

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
follows the first one is soil

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.299 
follows the first one is soil
preparation<00:00:57.050> so<00:00:58.050> what<00:00:58.199> happens<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.890> you

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
preparation so what happens is that you

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.260 
preparation so what happens is that you
know<00:00:59.989> originally<00:01:00.989> as<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.859> let's<00:01:02.789> say<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:02.969> had

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
know originally as you let's say you had

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.530 
know originally as you let's say you had
a<00:01:03.300> particular<00:01:03.870> field<00:01:04.729> where<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.760> had<00:01:06.150> grown

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
a particular field where you had grown

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.070 
a particular field where you had grown
wheat<00:01:08.600> now<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:10.020> harvested<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.680> April<00:01:11.220> and

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
wheat now it is harvested in April and

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.300 
wheat now it is harvested in April and
at<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.320> point<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.680> time<00:01:13.860> when<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
at that point in time when the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.340 
at that point in time when the
harvesting<00:01:14.880> has<00:01:15.030> been<00:01:15.240> done<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.170> field

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
harvesting has been done in the field

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.450 
harvesting has been done in the field
will<00:01:16.619> become<00:01:16.759> very<00:01:17.759> rough<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.210> tough

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
will become very rough and tough

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.859 
will become very rough and tough
why<00:01:20.460> because<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.450> would<00:01:21.570> have<00:01:21.689> actually

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
why because you would have actually

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.560 
why because you would have actually
plucked<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.680> plants<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.460> wheat<00:01:23.640> plants<00:01:24.119> the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
plucked the plants the wheat plants the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.280 
plucked the plants the wheat plants the
roots<00:01:24.600> might<00:01:25.049> be<00:01:25.229> here<00:01:26.119> okay<00:01:27.150> somewhere<00:01:28.080> or

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
roots might be here okay somewhere or

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.660 
roots might be here okay somewhere or
the<00:01:28.439> other<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:31.350> soil<00:01:31.619> would<00:01:31.920> also<00:01:32.220> have

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
the other and the soil would also have

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.990 
the other and the soil would also have
kind<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:33.119> lost<00:01:33.810> its<00:01:34.350> ability<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:35.100> provide

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
kind of lost its ability to provide

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.569 
kind of lost its ability to provide
relevant<00:01:36.270> minerals<00:01:36.950> so<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.070> first<00:01:38.340> thing

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
relevant minerals so the first thing

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.749 
relevant minerals so the first thing
that<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:39.060> have<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.270> do<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:40.369> preparation<00:01:41.369> of

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
that you have to do is preparation of

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.380 
that you have to do is preparation of
soil<00:01:42.710> I'll<00:01:43.710> come<00:01:43.979> back<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.399> on<00:01:44.579> detail<00:01:45.149> you

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
soil I'll come back to you on detail you

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.840 
soil I'll come back to you on detail you
know<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:45.540> this<00:01:45.750> particular<00:01:46.049> part<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:47.490> second

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
know in this particular part the second

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:57.730 
know in this particular part the second
is<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.540> selection<00:01:50.899> and<00:01:53.840> sowing<00:01:55.670> seeds

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
is the selection and sowing seeds

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.289 
is the selection and sowing seeds
so<00:01:58.740> now<00:01:58.890> seeds<00:01:59.159> are<00:01:59.340> also<00:01:59.520> available<00:01:59.880> for

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
so now seeds are also available for

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.840 
so now seeds are also available for
different<00:02:00.479> categories<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:01.649> know<00:02:01.799> there<00:02:02.729> are

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
different categories you know there are

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.149 
different categories you know there are
seeds<00:02:03.090> depending<00:02:03.899> on<00:02:04.110> what<00:02:04.380> quality<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.890> seeds

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
seeds depending on what quality of seeds

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.570 
seeds depending on what quality of seeds
you<00:02:05.250> use<00:02:05.610> they<00:02:06.329> yield<00:02:06.770> or<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.069> production

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
you use they yield or the production

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.920 
you use they yield or the production
will<00:02:09.300> differ<00:02:09.660> materially

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.530 

so<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:13.980> have<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.489> select<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.879> proper<00:02:15.150> seed

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
so you have to select the proper seed

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.930 
so you have to select the proper seed
which<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:15.900> want<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.260> do<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.650> then<00:02:17.099> sew<00:02:17.580> it<00:02:17.610> in

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
which you want to do and then sew it in

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.690 
which you want to do and then sew it in
the<00:02:18.060> ground<00:02:18.239> which<00:02:18.480> means<00:02:18.720> that<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.680> put<00:02:20.549> it

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
the ground which means that you put it

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.820 
the ground which means that you put it
down<00:02:21.209> let's<00:02:21.629> say<00:02:21.780> this<00:02:21.900> is<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.170> ground<00:02:22.379> so<00:02:22.709> you

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
down let's say this is the ground so you

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.190 
down let's say this is the ground so you
try<00:02:23.099> and<00:02:23.220> put<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.549> here<00:02:26.840> below<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.959> ground

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
try and put it here below the ground

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.360 
try and put it here below the ground
level<00:02:30.019> then<00:02:31.019> comes<00:02:31.459> irrigation<00:02:34.010> so<00:02:35.010> once<00:02:35.190> the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
level then comes irrigation so once the

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.789 
level then comes irrigation so once the
seed<00:02:35.579> is<00:02:35.730> done<00:02:35.970> then<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:37.110> use<00:02:37.819> means<00:02:39.140> to<00:02:40.140> drop

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
seed is done then you use means to drop

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.729 
seed is done then you use means to drop
water<00:02:41.220> on<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.640> field<00:02:42.140> which<00:02:43.140> is<00:02:43.319> basically

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
water on the field which is basically

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:52.300 
water on the field which is basically
known<00:02:44.010> as<00:02:44.190> irrigation<00:02:46.819> then<00:02:47.819> is<00:02:48.000> weeding<00:02:48.629> and

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:02.869 

other<00:02:53.310> means<00:02:53.609> to<00:02:56.329> protect<00:02:59.120> crops<00:03:01.730> so<00:03:02.730> what

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
other means to protect crops so what

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:04.789 
other means to protect crops so what
happens<00:03:03.239> once<00:03:03.510> these<00:03:03.720> plants<00:03:04.140> start<00:03:04.440> coming

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
happens once these plants start coming

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.860 
happens once these plants start coming
up<00:03:04.950> it<00:03:05.250> might<00:03:05.879> just<00:03:06.209> be<00:03:06.359> that<00:03:07.230> some<00:03:08.099> plants

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
up it might just be that some plants

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.780 
up it might just be that some plants
amongst<00:03:09.870> these<00:03:09.959> plant<00:03:10.290> might<00:03:10.680> not<00:03:10.950> be<00:03:11.159> of<00:03:11.310> good

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
amongst these plant might not be of good

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.839 
amongst these plant might not be of good
quality<00:03:12.349> so<00:03:13.349> what<00:03:13.500> you<00:03:13.620> do<00:03:13.829> is<00:03:14.010> as<00:03:14.280> these<00:03:14.609> other

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
quality so what you do is as these other

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.150 
quality so what you do is as these other
plant<00:03:15.180> grow<00:03:15.420> you<00:03:15.780> just<00:03:16.079> remove<00:03:16.650> this<00:03:16.829> plant

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
plant grow you just remove this plant

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.960 
plant grow you just remove this plant
from<00:03:17.370> here<00:03:17.790> this<00:03:18.720> is<00:03:18.930> known<00:03:19.109> as<00:03:19.139> reading<00:03:21.019> okay

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
from here this is known as reading okay

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.140 
from here this is known as reading okay
or<00:03:23.970> it<00:03:24.480> may<00:03:24.630> just<00:03:24.660> be<00:03:25.079> that<00:03:25.290> let's<00:03:26.190> say<00:03:26.430> there

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
or it may just be that let's say there

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.360 
or it may just be that let's say there
are<00:03:27.299> certain<00:03:27.660> pests<00:03:28.200> which<00:03:28.650> go<00:03:28.919> down<00:03:29.160> through

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
are certain pests which go down through

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.300 
are certain pests which go down through
this<00:03:29.489> plant<00:03:29.819> so<00:03:30.299> you<00:03:30.500> spread<00:03:31.500> fertilizer<00:03:34.310> you

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
this plant so you spread fertilizer you

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.250 
this plant so you spread fertilizer you
use<00:03:35.549> fertilizers<00:03:36.329> to<00:03:36.989> protect<00:03:37.829> the<00:03:37.980> crop<00:03:38.519> from

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
use fertilizers to protect the crop from

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.949 
use fertilizers to protect the crop from
insects<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:41.810> then<00:03:42.810> finally<00:03:43.260> comes<00:03:43.500> the

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
insects and then finally comes the

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.280 
insects and then finally comes the
harvesting<00:03:47.239> which<00:03:48.239> means<00:03:48.510> that<00:03:48.900> once<00:03:49.109> these

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
harvesting which means that once these

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.589 
harvesting which means that once these
plants<00:03:49.680> are<00:03:49.799> ready<00:03:49.919> you<00:03:50.609> harvest<00:03:51.090> them<00:03:51.329> you

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
plants are ready you harvest them you

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:55.569 
plants are ready you harvest them you
cut<00:03:51.870> them<00:03:52.169> and<00:03:52.349> extract<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.579> relevant<00:03:54.120> things

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
cut them and extract the relevant things

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.300 
cut them and extract the relevant things
so<00:03:56.579> let's<00:03:56.790> say<00:03:57.199> you<00:03:58.199> extract<00:03:58.709> all<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.129> wheat

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
so let's say you extract all the wheat

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.960 
so let's say you extract all the wheat
and<00:03:59.549> put<00:03:59.849> it<00:03:59.970> in<00:04:00.090> a<00:04:00.239> wheat<00:04:00.900> back<00:04:01.849> because<00:04:02.849> these

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
and put it in a wheat back because these

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.409 
and put it in a wheat back because these
bags<00:04:03.269> are<00:04:03.510> ready<00:04:03.690> you<00:04:04.079> go<00:04:04.349> and<00:04:04.910> store<00:04:05.910> them<00:04:06.150> in

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
bags are ready you go and store them in

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:11.180 
bags are ready you go and store them in
the<00:04:08.150> storage<00:04:09.150> house<00:04:09.510> or<00:04:09.959> a<00:04:10.019> warehouse<00:04:10.319> that

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
the storage house or a warehouse that

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.759 
the storage house or a warehouse that
you<00:04:11.340> might<00:04:11.519> call<00:04:12.120> them<00:04:12.470> so<00:04:13.470> these<00:04:13.590> are

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
you might call them so these are

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.409 
you might call them so these are
different<00:04:13.889> steps<00:04:14.400> which<00:04:14.579> are<00:04:14.730> involved<00:04:14.879> in<00:04:15.269> an

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
different steps which are involved in an

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:18.560 
different steps which are involved in an
agriculture<00:04:16.169> process<00:04:16.729> we<00:04:17.729> will<00:04:17.910> kind<00:04:18.030> of<00:04:18.209> take

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
agriculture process we will kind of take

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.509 
agriculture process we will kind of take
them<00:04:18.840> a<00:04:18.989> little<00:04:19.199> more<00:04:19.500> into<00:04:19.799> details<00:04:20.250> in<00:04:20.430> some

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
them a little more into details in some

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.260 
them a little more into details in some
