00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.370 
get you know he was going to pay the
price<00:05:16.730> just<00:05:17.730> like<00:05:17.880> any<00:05:18.390> other<00:05:18.510> of<00:05:18.900> many

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
price just like any other of many

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.570 
price just like any other of many
peckers<00:05:19.620> opponents<00:05:20.370> so<00:05:21.410> overall<00:05:22.410> i<00:05:22.710> think<00:05:23.040> it

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
peckers opponents so overall i think it

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.030 
peckers opponents so overall i think it
was<00:05:23.730> a<00:05:23.910> very<00:05:24.360> very<00:05:24.720> good<00:05:24.960> fight<00:05:25.290> although<00:05:25.770> on

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
was a very very good fight although on

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.860 
was a very very good fight although on
the<00:05:26.280> card<00:05:26.669> it<00:05:26.970> was<00:05:27.120> a<00:05:27.150> landslide<00:05:27.980> i<00:05:29.870> still

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
the card it was a landslide i still

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.790 
the card it was a landslide i still
think<00:05:30.900> that<00:05:31.400> you<00:05:32.400> know<00:05:32.520> again<00:05:33.000> you<00:05:33.390> know<00:05:33.800> many

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
think that you know again you know many

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.920 
think that you know again you know many
Paquiao<00:05:35.220> even<00:05:35.490> admitted<00:05:36.030> it<00:05:36.150> that<00:05:36.390> it<00:05:36.540> was<00:05:36.750> not

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
Paquiao even admitted it that it was not

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.800 
Paquiao even admitted it that it was not
an<00:05:37.140> easy<00:05:37.260> fight<00:05:37.620> for<00:05:37.830> him<00:05:38.010> I<00:05:38.510> didn't<00:05:39.510> think<00:05:39.630> it

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
an easy fight for him I didn't think it

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.510 
an easy fight for him I didn't think it
was<00:05:39.900> going<00:05:40.110> to<00:05:40.260> be<00:05:40.470> an<00:05:40.560> easy<00:05:40.710> fight<00:05:40.980> for<00:05:41.220> him<00:05:41.340> I

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
was going to be an easy fight for him I

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.870 
was going to be an easy fight for him I
was<00:05:41.730> on<00:05:41.940> the<00:05:42.060> edge<00:05:42.210> of<00:05:42.450> my<00:05:42.630> seat<00:05:42.990> the<00:05:43.740> entire

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
was on the edge of my seat the entire

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.409 
was on the edge of my seat the entire
fight<00:05:45.380> because<00:05:46.380> I<00:05:46.410> knew<00:05:46.860> if<00:05:47.220> if<00:05:48.090> Manny

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 
fight because I knew if if Manny

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:50.300 
fight because I knew if if Manny
Pacquiao<00:05:48.930> got<00:05:49.110> tired<00:05:49.380> enough<00:05:49.800> and<00:05:50.160> got

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
Pacquiao got tired enough and got

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.510 
Pacquiao got tired enough and got
careless<00:05:50.700> enough<00:05:51.650> that<00:05:52.650> Joshua<00:05:53.310> Clottey

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
careless enough that Joshua Clottey

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.780 
careless enough that Joshua Clottey
could<00:05:54.000> have<00:05:54.210> very<00:05:54.630> well<00:05:54.950> caught<00:05:55.950> Manny

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:56.790 
could have very well caught Manny

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.690 
could have very well caught Manny
Pacquiao<00:05:57.360> and<00:05:57.690> knocked<00:05:58.050> him<00:05:58.200> out<00:05:58.350> I<00:05:58.700> still

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
Pacquiao and knocked him out I still

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.220 
Pacquiao and knocked him out I still
think<00:06:00.000> though<00:06:00.120> but<00:06:00.360> Manny<00:06:00.570> Pacquiao<00:06:01.020> was

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.230 
think though but Manny Pacquiao was

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:08.690 
think though but Manny Pacquiao was
smart<00:06:02.130> and<00:06:03.200> once<00:06:04.200> again<00:06:04.790> he<00:06:05.790> did<00:06:06.090> not<00:06:07.700> he

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
smart and once again he did not he

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.420 
smart and once again he did not he
didn't<00:06:09.510> let<00:06:09.630> me<00:06:09.810> down<00:06:09.990> he<00:06:10.710> didn't<00:06:10.980> let<00:06:11.040> any<00:06:11.250> of

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
didn't let me down he didn't let any of

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.719 
didn't let me down he didn't let any of
his<00:06:11.550> fans<00:06:11.760> down<00:06:12.000> really

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:13.729 
his fans down really

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.409 
his fans down really
and<00:06:13.849> he<00:06:14.659> really<00:06:14.960> showed<00:06:15.229> exactly<00:06:15.559> why<00:06:16.189> he<00:06:16.669> is<00:06:17.389> a

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:17.419 
and he really showed exactly why he is a

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:20.559 
and he really showed exactly why he is a
champion<00:06:17.749> and<00:06:18.559> I<00:06:18.680> love<00:06:19.009> the<00:06:19.219> way<00:06:19.400> that<00:06:19.759> Manny
