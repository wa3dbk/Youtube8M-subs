incredible to see how much food goes to

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.440 
incredible to see how much food goes to
waste<00:00:30.779> every<00:00:31.349> year<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:31.859> we<00:00:31.980> see<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.910> rotting<00:00:33.360> on

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
waste every year so we see it rotting on

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.110 
waste every year so we see it rotting on
the<00:00:33.510> ground<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.440> was<00:00:34.620> basically<00:00:35.250> one<00:00:36.090> of

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
the ground and that was basically one of

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.360 
the ground and that was basically one of
the<00:00:36.270> rationales<00:00:36.450> for<00:00:36.870> why<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.770> program

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
the rationales for why and a program

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.630 
the rationales for why and a program
like<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:38.730> needs<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.420> exist<00:00:39.750> in<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.110> valley

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
like this needs to exist in the valley

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.560 
like this needs to exist in the valley
there's<00:00:41.640> programs<00:00:41.820> like<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.300> all<00:00:42.510> over

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
there's programs like this all over

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.790 
there's programs like this all over
North<00:00:43.290> America

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
North America

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.340 
North America
so<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.250> was<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.670> made<00:00:45.030> sense<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.420> also<00:00:45.780> have<00:00:46.110> one

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
so it was it made sense to also have one

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.010 
so it was it made sense to also have one
here<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.579> there's<00:00:47.820> also<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.120> lot<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.360> people<00:00:48.570> in

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
here and there's also a lot of people in

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.990 
here and there's also a lot of people in
the<00:00:49.200> community<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.920> cannot<00:00:50.489> afford<00:00:50.610> to

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
the community that cannot afford to

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.170 
the community that cannot afford to
purchase<00:00:51.660> healthy<00:00:52.260> foods<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.670> was<00:00:53.850> kind<00:00:54.120> of

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
purchase healthy foods so it was kind of

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.350 
purchase healthy foods so it was kind of
a<00:00:54.270> match<00:00:54.449> made<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.750> heaven

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
a match made in heaven

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.880 
a match made in heaven
I'm<00:00:57.360> gonna<00:00:57.539> guess<00:00:57.809> five<00:00:58.079> hundred<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.559> fifty

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
I'm gonna guess five hundred and fifty

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.760 
I'm gonna guess five hundred and fifty
