00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.680
Hello

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.880
This is just too awkward!!!

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:08.960
Hello

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.220
I'm chef Omijah

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.880
Welcome to my life!

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.800
This is the Gran Blue kitchen

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.580
And this

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.700
Is the Matilda kitchen

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.360
The workers didn't turn off the A/C...

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:20.860
I shall punish them

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:21.620
Let me take a photo for evidence

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.660
What do you do when you first come to the kitchen?

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.860
I first check on ingredients

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.680
And sharpen the knives

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.740
I love to sharpen knives

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.500
Sometimes I ease my hangover by sharpening a knife LOL

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.680
You really have to focus on the blade of a knife to sharpen it properly

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.680
So as I give my full attention

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.220
I naturally wakeup from a hangover...

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.520
Why do you call yourself Omijah?

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.300
I like to make juice with omijah and Japanese apricots

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.960
A friend of mine saved my contacts as 'Omijah boy'

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.500
How should we call you?

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.460
You can just call me 'Omijah'

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.640
Can I call you 'Mijah'?

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.140
Sure!

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.480
The Matilda kitchen must be a really meaningful place for you

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.320
Jang Jin Woo Restaurant and Gran Blue have already been using the kitchen

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.100
So it's not perfect

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.320
I can only use this gas stove to cook

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.320
It's challenging to cook with shortage in equipment

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.020
But I find it charming to work with limited equipment

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.440
It helps me to concentrate more while cooking

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.340
This is my favorite moment

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.340
I've uploaded many photos like this on Instagram

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.460
A great combination of Manila clams and garlic

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.380
Along with Italian white wine

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.120
Sliced tomatoes and parsley

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.360
Are essential ingredients to making vongole pasta

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.740
I'm really proud of my vongole spaghetti

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.160
Your restaurant is always full with customers!

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.940
Customers are coming to my restaurant more than they go to Gran Blue haha

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:28.680
Um... Sure...

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.100
I heard chefs don't cook at home!

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.120
I finally bought some cooking equipment

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.920
But your kitchen is so empty...

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.580
The stove is broken..

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.180
I still have jam and other ingredients the previous house owner left at the house....

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.040
It's been 2 years already...

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.100
I've always thought the best food is what I don't cook... LOL

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.620
But I love to cook for my workers!

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.040
I'm like their mom... Haha

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.880
None of the cabs are stopping by!

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.900
I think it's probably because of the camera...

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.900
How long have you worked at Matilda?

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.620
It's been 10 years now!

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.240
I used to study art

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.340
And have been a member of a band

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.000
When I'm working in Matilda

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.560
I try to not forget the slogan 'Natural is Best'

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.640
If it takes 6 hours to make one sauce

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.100
I put in all my effor

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.880
Even if it's exhausting

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.100
I enjoy the gladness I get from tasting the amazing sauce that has been cooked for 6 hours!

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.040
Especially when I see the customers enjoying the sauce!
