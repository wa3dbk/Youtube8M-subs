00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
lot of ways there's a sense that humans

the Russians at a base called Vostok
what<00:01:10.619> we<00:01:10.799> found<00:01:11.130> was<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:12.150> coldest

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
what we found was that the coldest

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.359 
what we found was that the coldest
temperatures<00:01:13.110> are<00:01:13.350> actually<00:01:13.530> just<00:01:14.070> off<00:01:14.340> of

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
temperatures are actually just off of

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.270 
temperatures are actually just off of
the<00:01:14.880> crest<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.540> crest<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.140> an<00:01:16.710> area<00:01:16.979> where<00:01:17.159> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
the crest the crest is an area where the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.710 
the crest the crest is an area where the
air<00:01:17.460> as<00:01:17.700> soon<00:01:17.729> as<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.119> gets<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.540> low

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
air as soon as it gets to a low

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.960 
air as soon as it gets to a low
temperature<00:01:18.750> starts<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.650> drain<00:01:19.950> away<00:01:20.130> what

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
temperature starts to drain away what

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.090 
temperature starts to drain away what
you<00:01:21.119> need<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.540> place<00:01:21.930> where<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.530> air<00:01:22.860> is

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
you need is a place where that air is

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.789 
you need is a place where that air is
actually<00:01:23.549> caught<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.270> held<00:01:24.570> for<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> while<00:01:25.470> so

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
actually caught and held for a while so

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.550 
actually caught and held for a while so
that<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.040> can<00:01:26.189> cool<00:01:26.430> down<00:01:26.460> still<00:01:27.180> more<00:01:27.560> by

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
that it can cool down still more by

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.359 
that it can cool down still more by
radiating<00:01:29.040> away<00:01:29.430> into<00:01:29.790> space<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.200> those<00:01:32.100> are

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
radiating away into space and those are

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.100 
radiating away into space and those are
the<00:01:32.460> places<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.909> we're<00:01:33.150> finding<00:01:33.570> these<00:01:33.720> very

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
the places that we're finding these very

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.890 
the places that we're finding these very
very<00:01:34.409> low<00:01:34.619> temperatures<00:01:35.420> you<00:01:36.420> might<00:01:36.630> say

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
very low temperatures you might say

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.580 
very low temperatures you might say
let's<00:01:37.140> go<00:01:37.409> there<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.990> maybe<00:01:39.990> in<00:01:40.259> summer

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
let's go there and maybe in summer

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.350 
let's go there and maybe in summer
that's<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:41.009> reasonable<00:01:41.460> thing<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.790> try<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.060> do

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
that's a reasonable thing to try and do

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.590 
that's a reasonable thing to try and do
that's<00:01:43.049> it's<00:01:43.560> really<00:01:43.680> cold<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:45.000> things

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
that's it's really cold and so things

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.569 
that's it's really cold and so things
like<00:01:45.930> your<00:01:46.140> ordinary<00:01:46.259> thermometers<00:01:47.070> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
like your ordinary thermometers the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.340 
like your ordinary thermometers the
mercury<00:01:48.000> thermometer<00:01:48.540> won't<00:01:48.780> work<00:01:49.020> and

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
mercury thermometer won't work and

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.139 
mercury thermometer won't work and
alcohol<00:01:50.040> thermometer<00:01:50.610> will<00:01:50.729> have<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.909> lot<00:01:51.119> of

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
alcohol thermometer will have a lot of

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.480 
alcohol thermometer will have a lot of
trouble<00:01:51.570> we're<00:01:52.320> talking<00:01:52.770> about<00:01:52.890> temperatures

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
trouble we're talking about temperatures

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.490 
trouble we're talking about temperatures
that<00:01:53.640> are<00:01:53.759> 50<00:01:54.090> degrees<00:01:54.390> colder<00:01:54.840> than<00:01:54.869> anything

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
that are 50 degrees colder than anything

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.340 
that are 50 degrees colder than anything
that<00:01:55.740> has<00:01:56.130> ever<00:01:56.430> been<00:01:56.579> seen<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.360> Alaska<00:01:57.479> or<00:01:58.170> in

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
and then when the sky clears they drop

what<00:02:42.330> you<00:02:42.450> need<00:02:42.630> is<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.870> place<00:02:43.290> where<00:02:43.620> that<00:02:43.860> air

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
what you need is a place where that air

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.860 
what you need is a place where that air
is<00:02:44.430> actually<00:02:44.880> caught<00:02:45.270> and<00:02:45.600> held<00:02:45.900> for<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.500> while

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
is actually caught and held for a while

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.750 
is actually caught and held for a while
so<00:02:48.870> by<00:02:49.110> causing<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.710> airflow<00:02:50.460> to<00:02:50.520> be

so by causing the airflow to be

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.670 
so by causing the airflow to be
stationary<00:02:51.330> for<00:02:51.600> an<00:02:51.690> extended<00:02:52.200> period<00:02:52.230> you

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
stationary for an extended period you

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.920 
stationary for an extended period you
get<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:53.160> absolute<00:02:53.640> lowest<00:02:54.240> temperatures

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
get the absolute lowest temperatures

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.860 
get the absolute lowest temperatures
that<00:02:55.140> were<00:02:55.260> able<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.560> find
