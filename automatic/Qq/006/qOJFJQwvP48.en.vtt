 large garlic 3 bay leaves to the 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.870
 it's pretty torn but we're going to 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:11.110
 place it here a quarter of water 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:14.980
 ready and now we are going to liquefy this very 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:17.410
 very, very good, well, here I have my 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.960
 pieces of chicken a matter 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.490
 I always remove the skin we promote 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.170
 chicken now we are going to put it in the 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.120
 grill and if you remove the skin it 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.980
 begins to tear many times like this 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.780
 that for today I'm going to leave but without 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.880
 But before we eat we're going to 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.790
 removing that skin you're going to require a 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.890
 sachet of these with closure a question 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.200
 are a lot of pollution and what 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.840
 I do is that I use them washed them 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.640
 I use the laboras I use them washed and 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.430
 well what I'm going to do a little is here 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:50.430
 knock off the skin of my chicken 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.290
 to start marinating this chicken 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.110
 from inside so let's help each other 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.030
 of a knife because remember that the 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.190
 skin we're going to remove it so 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.040
 we want it to be marinated inside 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.229
 our chicken because the skin is pure 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.020
 fat so forget about being 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.390
 eating the skin that is cholesterol 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.240
 direct and all arteries ladies and 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.940
 gentlemen there they go well I'm detaching 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.720
 that little one and here is my cold cat 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.650
 happy with the smell of the pellejito to see 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:27.420
 frida what wave do you want chicken 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:29.970
 there is no life for this mixture 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.490
 We did with the chiles and the achote 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.850
 so we go red 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.130
 there goes then now I'm going to place 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.490
 it smells really good this mixture and I'm going to 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.630
 place inside the skin as 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.300
 far as they can to marinate this 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.970
 we are placing and this pellejito us 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.250
 will serve there as a house to be 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.660
 Marinated fits well will look 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.970
 flip 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.780
 we are going to place in the skins of 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.209
 here 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.209
 let's smear all that chick well 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.610
 let me tell you something the more 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.810
 time leave marinating your richest chicken 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.270
 they will be left if they can do this 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.770
 from a night before much better 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.130
 we are marinating what I'm going to 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:20.330
 put the bunny up a bit to 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.710
 give it that color when doing it 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.230
 Look, it was very well marinated. 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.860
 everything painted red here is not 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.750
 use 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.550
 frida maya has never seen her so 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.400
 excited, our food does not touch us 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.990
 He eats his croquettes and his cans so 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.680
 Generally this reaction only happens with the 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:40.890
 tuna so let's do the same with the 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.270
 another chicken we separated the skin from 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.250
 chicken 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.830
 good look for Carlos or coal is 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.510
 He was very strong but this is going to 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.670
 burn look at the skin and what is going 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.770
 to stay is this carnita rich where 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.430
 we put the marinade so we're going to 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.810
 let it continue to cook I have here 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.000
 some onions with salt-shaped edges 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.380
 salt and soda that will be very soon 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.400
