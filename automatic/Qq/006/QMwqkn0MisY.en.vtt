00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:06.819
 to the movie hello how about friends of 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:10.540
 youtube is the subtraction with a 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:14.040
 tutorial and good since we started to see 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:18.660
 this of what energy has been 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:22.640
 ec operating system like the previous one is 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.640
 very important given that 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.240
 depending on what value you use from the 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.390
 energy you will be able to have a better 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.950
 performance and well this is a tip for 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.330
 accelerate what you sell being a 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:39.330
 processor to md what was done was 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:43.260
 investigate and what I have here 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:46.170
 md processor is not a very good one but 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.970
 that has heated up a lot but when 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.590
 warms up new from nothing well given that 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.300
 I have to have a fan 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.240
 forever 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.620
 Y 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:01:01.180
 Well this is a program which it 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:05.480
 he received very fan that is called m of fusion 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.340
 it only weighs 4 megabytes since it is 4 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:13.630
 megas 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.630
 and it's an excel point I have here 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.219
 or not 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:24.130
 a program is this is an excel point 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:26.590
 The only thing they are going to do is extract the 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.880
 real point and double click on the point 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.420
 excel and install it 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.649
 well once you have installed 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:38.890
 we will open the program is totally 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.890
 Free does not need crack or serial 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:48.080
 good what you see in this program is to give 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:52.970
 but profiles for what I'm doing 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:55.039
 the use of energy and good at the time of 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.039
 activate any profile that is 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:01.310
 find on this side what will be 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:03.500
 the program is to deactivate the programs 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.280
 that you are not using or that are in 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.280
 background 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.459
 It has pros and cons within the pros 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:17.319
 is that it actually slows down the 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:20.050
 computer deactivating the programs and 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.790
 the cons are the following that you 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.170
 deactivated programs that you are 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:29.770
 using it turns off good things from 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.770
 windows that you do not use but that you 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.410
 might be useful 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.260
 and you can activate the antivirus that is a 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.670
 of the cons 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.450
 very very important and good for what 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.430
 it would be to avoid that deactivated 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:51.110
 deactivated antivirus and all that 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:54.959
 then you have to go is to go to software 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.930
 here in these options add the name 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:02.680
 of the program they want they do not want 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:06.609
 I know they do not want more than nothing 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.799
 how good they are deactivated they add the 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:12.280
 name to know the program number 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:14.170
 they go to the task manager 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.270
 and good here in the processes are going to 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.780
 find the whole name of the program 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:23.230
 with what corresponds for example these 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.200
 of the internet or the Internet tangle of 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.940
 a way the explorer 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.769
 that's logical that it's not just going to 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:36.380
 deactivate the vitoria good endless 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:39.090
 programs that you can add here 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.910
 I'm seeing but if you count as already 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.710
 I said but it really helps 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.840
 a lot where I'm doing the 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:50.760
 energy of the mind 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:55.569
 and good brings more smart profiles 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:04:00.219
 trans positive that you can turn them off 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:02.260
 i can modify the graphics the cpu this 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:04.870
 it's really a suite to accelerate 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.469
 processor production to md but to 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.819
 way in different ways you should both 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:12.450
 be that it goes to windows functions 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:16.030
 deactivate programs that we used 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.259
 as much as the performance that I have 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.090
 which is occupied for example of 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:21.430
 productivity is computer recorded 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.139
 as you can see if those from here and have 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.310
 optimized for preparing documents 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:29.580
 spreadsheets and presentations 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.139
 in the balanced m this is the 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.480
 maximum performance than what where 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:37.020
 being high yield performance of 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:40.050
 windows that the other active and performance 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.480
 maximum no connection one performance 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.490
 maximum online without connection wants 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.990
 say that you do not have access to the internet and 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.160
 maximum undertaking of lines that 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:52.560
 you have internet access and it is at a hundred 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.620
 computer what I like is that in 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.800
 medium reality long a little bit more the 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:01.290
 Battery life actually 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.830
 adds a little more than with the high 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.320
 windows performance 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.290
 and I am at this moment all the high 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.990
 performance of something that I do not have a 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:15.290
 why it is to have disconnected 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:18.500
 to the cable but it is from my house and this 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:20.690
 it is a very good recommendation once 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.060
 installed I recommend that for which 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.630
 profile change manage to do it 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.010
 from him 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:30.810
 the program because if they do it from here 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:33.720
 one from the other side of windows that is 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.210
 Start Control Panel System 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.070
 security energy users and if what 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.840
 modify from there I do not recommend it 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.409
 because they are going to activate the profile of 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.779
 merger jaime recovery 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:47.059
 that was automatically activated if 

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:49.399
 closes one way by finished or 

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:51.409
 you make the modification of that 

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:53.749
 windows I recommend you do it from 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:55.459
 it removes once the program is installed if 

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:57.009
 they want to do seconds of if they are in 

00:05:55.459 --> 00:06:00.069
 the and 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:01.659
 good they reconfigure what 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:05.379
 it would be the performance of his 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:06.800
 computer and good friends this has been 

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:11.120
 all 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:15.740
 for the moment remember to subscribe to 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:18.550
 channel go to the blog and good more than anything 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:21.080
 thank the subscribers that 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:24.919
 good 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:28.669
 subscribe to the redundancy and 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:30.970
 wait for more tutorials for you 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:30.970
 we see
