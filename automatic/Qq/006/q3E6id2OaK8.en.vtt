00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.890
 hello to everyone and everything 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.840
 find today for a new 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.390
 video of gta 5 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.910
 I will show you the reward we 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.210
 when we get the 50 pieces of 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.340
 ship that Omega asks us 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.869
 I of course helped a video on 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.120
 youtube to find them 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.190
 because my 50 pieces spread across 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.820
 the whole map is just impossible to 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.320
 hold and so I put you the link 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.379
 in the description for those who 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.539
 interested so that's so much me 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.239
 ask if I'm going to do platinum 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.670
 so yes I will try to age 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.960
 advance is pretty good I'm at 90 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.480
 92 % 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.199
 I'll make you videos like 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.989
 it can show you the progress and 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.790
 a few so when we want to do the 50th 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.550
 letter 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:08.120
 well let's not be a message from megan we 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:11.030
 said to come to his house there I come to 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:15.680
 him and you will see we have when we 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:19.140
 recovers 50 pieces I loved the 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.890
 reward I practice it 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.890
 see for yourself 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.410
 sold violated three fragrances 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.840
 so that's kind of like the 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.880
 car back to the future departure 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.820
 I'm told oh the what's this 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.900
 that and that's pretty cool huh it's 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.130
 rather funny to have a car like 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.100
 that in gta 5 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.200
 So here it is a bit complicated 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.700
 the voice is not complicated but it's 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.610
 a bit boring to go get my 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.050
 50 pieces but the advantage to go 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.369
 look for those fifty pieces and that 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.470
 you discover places of the 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.360
 map where you do not laugh been you 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.160
 walk of course so for those who 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.790
 interest it's by a I put the little 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.950
 link two of the fifty pieces and for 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.509
 so you talk about the reward bah 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.310
 I found them rather pretty bond 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.660
 she says simply you'll see by 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.170
 you even then trigger a small 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.390
 trophy in passing there will be others 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.709
 prophets you will see if not yes 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.330
 so to talk to you about the car 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.330
 it's peace 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.540
 said to the heart there the spectator fingers 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.940
 it's pretty funny huh it's with these 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.680
 two subjects and where they live a lot 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.220
 but it's pretty good 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.830
 so that's it if you want to see her 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.610
 mosquitoes to recover 50 pieces of 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.590
 ship and then you're on the hunt 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.080
 of this little room so here I am you 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.630
 wish a good evening 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.620
 a good video and then I tell you to 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.620
 later everything turns
