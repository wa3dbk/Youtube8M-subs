one out here and then get a block and

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:07.360 
one out here and then get a block and
then<00:05:06.940> go<00:05:07.030> like<00:05:07.150> that

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
then go like that

one tortilla first make sure thats first
then<00:05:27.500> the<00:05:27.650> other<00:05:27.740> tools<00:05:27.979> on<00:05:28.070> this<00:05:28.190> side<00:05:28.430> this

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
then the other tools on this side this

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.670 
then the other tools on this side this
piston<00:05:29.419> is<00:05:29.510> pushed<00:05:29.690> up<00:05:29.870> right<00:05:30.139> with<00:05:30.320> am

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
piston is pushed up right with am

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.320 
piston is pushed up right with am
torches<00:05:31.190> so<00:05:32.120> the<00:05:32.270> output<00:05:32.419> is<00:05:32.840> not<00:05:33.410> on<00:05:33.650> yet

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
torches so the output is not on yet

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.300 
torches so the output is not on yet
which<00:05:35.330> is<00:05:35.449> what<00:05:35.570> we<00:05:35.720> want<00:05:36.010> then<00:05:37.010> you<00:05:37.100> want<00:05:37.250> to

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
which is what we want then you want to

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.909 
which is what we want then you want to
take<00:05:37.580> this<00:05:37.760> redstone<00:05:38.360> downward<00:05:38.930> and<00:05:39.110> connect

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 
take this redstone downward and connect

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.409 
take this redstone downward and connect
it<00:05:40.010> up<00:05:40.130> to<00:05:40.280> that<00:05:40.430> fresh<00:05:40.639> flipped<00:05:43.270> where<00:05:44.270> has<00:05:44.360> it

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 
it up to that fresh flipped where has it

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:46.750 
it up to that fresh flipped where has it
gone<00:05:44.750> your<00:05:45.139> crust<00:05:45.560> appreciably<00:05:46.220> and<00:05:46.580> make

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
gone your crust appreciably and make

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.100 
gone your crust appreciably and make
sure<00:05:46.789> if<00:05:46.940> it<00:05:47.030> appears<00:05:47.360> on<00:05:47.570> my<00:05:47.690> just<00:05:47.870> in<00:05:48.050> case

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
sure if it appears on my just in case

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.629 
sure if it appears on my just in case
the<00:05:48.410> signal<00:05:48.770> runs<00:05:49.010> out<00:05:51.130> then<00:05:52.130> you<00:05:52.310> should<00:05:52.550> get

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 
the signal runs out then you should get

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:54.189 
the signal runs out then you should get
an<00:05:52.789> output<00:05:52.940> and<00:05:53.389> then<00:05:53.720> what<00:05:53.900> you<00:05:53.960> need<00:05:54.050> to<00:05:54.139> do

an output and then what you need to do

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:56.100 
an output and then what you need to do
with<00:05:54.320> the<00:05:54.410> output<00:05:54.830> is<00:05:54.979> bring<00:05:55.250> it<00:05:55.370> out<00:05:55.520> to<00:05:55.729> a

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
with the output is bring it out to a

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.629 
with the output is bring it out to a
redstone<00:05:57.110> ladder<00:05:57.410> you<00:05:58.160> don't<00:05:58.340> have<00:05:58.430> to<00:05:58.520> make
