classroom one of my favorite quotes from
Steiner<00:04:13.770> is<00:04:14.100> that<00:04:14.820> the<00:04:15.000> job<00:04:15.210> of<00:04:15.240> the<00:04:15.390> educator

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
Steiner is that the job of the educator

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.990 
Steiner is that the job of the educator
is<00:04:16.019> to<00:04:16.200> take<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:17.070> children<00:04:17.489> in<00:04:17.730> their<00:04:17.970> play

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
is to take the children in their play

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.470 
is to take the children in their play
and<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:18.959> sculpt<00:04:19.650> their<00:04:20.040> work<00:04:20.519> in<00:04:20.790> such<00:04:21.180> a<00:04:21.209> way

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
and to sculpt their work in such a way

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.000 
and to sculpt their work in such a way
that<00:04:21.630> they<00:04:21.750> have<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:22.049> same<00:04:22.290> relationship

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
that they have the same relationship

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.400

play as children and to me that feels

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.560 
play as children and to me that feels
like<00:04:28.410> an<00:04:29.130> incredible<00:04:29.790> opportunity<00:04:30.540> and
