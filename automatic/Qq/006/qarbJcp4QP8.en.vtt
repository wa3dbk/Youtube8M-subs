00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
blocks whopper for the ceiling and I

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.990 
blocks whopper for the ceiling and I
yeah<00:00:28.769> no<00:00:28.980> problem<00:00:29.310> just<00:00:29.460> give<00:00:29.550> me<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.670> blue

realize<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:33.090> for<00:00:33.239> me<00:00:33.420> flipping<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.410> over

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
realize that for me flipping this over

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.950 
realize that for me flipping this over
would<00:00:36.120> have<00:00:36.210> been<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.450> big<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.780> challenge

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
would have been that big of a challenge

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.760 
would have been that big of a challenge
but<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.620> am<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.860> freaking<00:00:38.730> new<00:00:38.940> um<00:00:39.590> let<00:00:40.590> me<00:00:40.620> go

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
but I am a freaking new um let me go

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.580 
but I am a freaking new um let me go
ahead<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.040> just<00:00:41.129> clear<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.460> off<00:00:41.670> right<00:00:41.850> here

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
ahead and just clear this off right here

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.709 
ahead and just clear this off right here
so<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.800> took<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.250> little<00:00:44.280> trial<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.000> error<00:00:45.300> for

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
so it took a little trial and error for

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.740 
so it took a little trial and error for
me<00:00:46.160> this<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.399> only<00:00:47.760> set<00:00:48.059> up<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.390> need

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
me this is the only set up that you need

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.630 
me this is the only set up that you need
um<00:00:50.180> so<00:00:51.180> what<00:00:51.300> we<00:00:51.390> got<00:00:51.570> here<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:52.250> on<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.399> side

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
um so what we got here is on this side

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.209 
um so what we got here is on this side
we<00:00:54.059> have<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.210> button<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.739> sends<00:00:55.739> redstone

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
we have a button that sends redstone

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.209 
we have a button that sends redstone
power<00:00:56.430> up<00:00:56.670> these<00:00:56.850> torches<00:00:57.449> right<00:00:58.020> here<00:00:58.219> to

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
power up these torches right here to

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.580 
power up these torches right here to
this<00:00:59.399> redstone<00:00:59.760> which<00:01:00.149> turns<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.109> torch<00:01:01.410> off

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
this redstone which turns this torch off

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.380 
this redstone which turns this torch off
which<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.550> know<00:01:02.640> just<00:01:02.940> like<00:01:03.000> involved

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
which you know just like involved

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.740 
which you know just like involved
tutorial<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.930> cycles<00:01:04.350> all<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:05.330> it<00:01:06.330> updates

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
tutorial it cycles all this it updates

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.469 
tutorial it cycles all this it updates
this<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.110> retracts<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:08.369> these<00:01:08.580> swap

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
this this retracts in these swap

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.649 
this this retracts in these swap
position<00:01:10.460> replacing<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.790> blue<00:01:11.939> block<00:01:12.150> it's

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
position replacing the blue block it's

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.690 
position replacing the blue block it's
right<00:01:12.750> there<00:01:13.100> where<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.159> red<00:01:14.310> one<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.580> then

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
right there where the red one and then

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.359 
right there where the red one and then
when<00:01:15.140> the<00:01:16.140> circuit<00:01:16.470> completes<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:17.100> pushes

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
when the circuit completes it pushes

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.149 
when the circuit completes it pushes
down<00:01:17.490> blue<00:01:18.119> block<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.450> up<00:01:18.830> the<00:01:19.830> way<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:19.979> is

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
down blue block is up the way it is

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.880 
down blue block is up the way it is
right<00:01:20.280> now<00:01:20.340> if<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.060> press<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.799> there's<00:01:22.799> a

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
right now if you press it there's a

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.149 
right now if you press it there's a
slight<00:01:23.310> delay<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.600> took<00:01:24.750> me<00:01:24.810> forever<00:01:25.200> to

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
slight delay and it took me forever to

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.890 
slight delay and it took me forever to
figure<00:01:26.970> out<00:01:27.150> how<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.299> get<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.540> delay<00:01:27.780> out

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
figure out how to get the delay out

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.140 
figure out how to get the delay out
because<00:01:28.110> with<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.530> one<00:01:28.740> all<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.759> have<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.000> do

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
because with this one all you have to do

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.450 
because with this one all you have to do
is<00:01:30.390> put<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.869> repeater<00:01:31.530> facing<00:01:32.310> there<00:01:34.040> and<00:01:35.040> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
is put a repeater facing there and the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.590 
is put a repeater facing there and the
delay<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:36.420> removed<00:01:36.900> see<00:01:37.200> because<00:01:37.470> without<00:01:37.710> it

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
delay is removed see because without it

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.319 
delay is removed see because without it
without<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:40.880> you're<00:01:41.880> going<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.030> wait<00:01:42.150> for<00:01:42.299> the

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
without it you're going to wait for the

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.350 
without it you're going to wait for the
button<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.840> finish<00:01:43.259> its<00:01:43.560> its<00:01:44.040> process<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:45.149> put

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
button to finish its its process you put

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.060 
button to finish its its process you put
that<00:01:45.420> repeater<00:01:45.720> there<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.020> what<00:01:46.619> happens<00:01:46.890> as

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
that repeater there is what happens as

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.800 
that repeater there is what happens as
soon<00:01:47.130> as<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.369> press<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.329> signal<00:01:48.720> gets

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
soon as you press this the signal gets

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.999 
soon as you press this the signal gets
sent<00:01:49.049> back<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.470> which<00:01:49.649> updates

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
sent back to it which updates

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.700 
sent back to it which updates
automatically<00:01:50.700> um<00:01:51.290> but<00:01:52.290> yeah<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.530> took<00:01:52.649> me

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
automatically um but yeah it took me

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.310 
automatically um but yeah it took me
forever<00:01:53.390> this<00:01:54.390> right<00:01:54.600> here<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.840> where<00:01:54.990> you'd

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
forever this right here is where you'd

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.789 
forever this right here is where you'd
normally<00:01:55.500> put<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:57.229> that<00:01:58.229> repeater<00:01:58.560> if<00:01:58.710> you

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
normally put that that repeater if you

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.230 
normally put that that repeater if you
wanted<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.100> have<00:01:59.280> exactly<00:01:59.700> like<00:01:59.850> that<00:01:59.880> but

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
wanted to have exactly like that but

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.810 
wanted to have exactly like that but
obviously<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.930> can't<00:02:01.200> do<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.770> can't<00:02:02.610> do

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
obviously you can't do it you can't do

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.499 
obviously you can't do it you can't do
it<00:02:02.850> like<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.229> so<00:02:04.229> um<00:02:04.920> what<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:05.790> came<00:02:06.360> up<00:02:06.479> with

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
it like that so um what I came up with

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:13.140 
it like that so um what I came up with
is<00:02:06.930> putting<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:08.030> block<00:02:09.030> on<00:02:09.060> top<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:10.530> um

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
is putting a block on top of that so um

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.009 
is putting a block on top of that so um
torch<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:13.750> then<00:02:13.900> another<00:02:14.079> block<00:02:14.409> there<00:02:16.019> but

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
torch and then another block there but

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.569 
torch and then another block there but
before<00:02:17.379> I<00:02:17.530> get<00:02:17.620> ahead<00:02:17.739> of<00:02:17.829> myself<00:02:17.920> let<00:02:18.340> me<00:02:18.459> go

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.229 
torch here by torch here with dust on
top<00:04:07.870> of<00:04:08.199> both<00:04:08.349> of<00:04:08.500> them<00:04:08.620> look<00:04:08.769> like<00:04:08.919> that<00:04:09.239> all

go across like so you put repeaters like

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.680 
go across like so you put repeaters like
that<00:04:22.789> a<00:04:24.190> torch<00:04:25.190> here<00:04:25.430> to<00:04:25.759> push<00:04:25.970> it<00:04:26.120> down<00:04:26.240> all

you see press the button errs resets it
and<00:04:46.129> um<00:04:47.110> you<00:04:48.110> could<00:04:48.229> have<00:04:48.470> your<00:04:48.770> wire<00:04:49.009> rent

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
and um you could have your wire rent

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.800 
and um you could have your wire rent
however<00:04:49.969> you<00:04:50.090> want<00:04:50.270> you<00:04:50.360> don't<00:04:50.509> have<00:04:50.629> to<00:04:50.690> put

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
however you want you don't have to put

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.180 
however you want you don't have to put
it<00:04:50.900> on<00:04:50.990> the<00:04:51.080> wall<00:04:51.229> like<00:04:51.469> this<00:04:51.620> you<00:04:51.830> put<00:04:52.009> on<00:04:52.069> the

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
it on the wall like this you put on the

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.649 
it on the wall like this you put on the
floor<00:04:52.400> in<00:04:52.520> a<00:04:52.610> pressure<00:04:52.909> plate<00:04:53.120> you<00:04:53.449> have<00:04:53.599> to

00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:53.659 
floor in a pressure plate you have to

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:55.570 
floor in a pressure plate you have to
switch<00:04:53.930> don't<00:04:54.680> think<00:04:54.800> about<00:04:54.919> switches<00:04:55.310> is<00:04:55.430> you

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
switch don't think about switches is you

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.980 
switch don't think about switches is you
have<00:04:55.699> to<00:04:55.759> flip<00:04:55.940> it<00:04:56.030> twice<00:04:56.270> to<00:04:56.300> be<00:04:56.690> able<00:04:56.750> to

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
have to flip it twice to be able to

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.189 
have to flip it twice to be able to
complete<00:04:57.409> the<00:04:57.560> cycle<00:04:58.479> but<00:04:59.479> yeah<00:04:59.659> thats<00:04:59.990> how

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 
complete the cycle but yeah thats how

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:01.899 
complete the cycle but yeah thats how
you<00:05:00.259> you<00:05:00.800> actually<00:05:00.979> build<00:05:01.219> this<00:05:01.370> very<00:05:01.610> simple

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:01.909 
you you actually build this very simple

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:04.450 
you you actually build this very simple
um<00:05:02.330> it's<00:05:02.629> pretty<00:05:02.690> much<00:05:03.139> exactly<00:05:03.919> the<00:05:04.250> same

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
um it's pretty much exactly the same

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.499 
um it's pretty much exactly the same
setup<00:05:04.669> as<00:05:04.789> that<00:05:05.030> makes<00:05:05.270> just<00:05:05.539> is<00:05:06.050> rotated<00:05:07.509> 180

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:08.509 
setup as that makes just is rotated 180

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:12.339 
setup as that makes just is rotated 180
degrees<00:05:09.159> so<00:05:10.159> the<00:05:10.659> bud<00:05:11.659> switch<00:05:11.780> II<00:05:11.930> I<00:05:12.050> going<00:05:12.289> on

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:12.349 
degrees so the bud switch II I going on

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:14.499 
degrees so the bud switch II I going on
here<00:05:12.560> I<00:05:12.770> think<00:05:13.460> that's<00:05:13.580> what<00:05:13.729> it<00:05:13.849> is<00:05:13.879> I<00:05:14.180> don't

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:14.509 
here I think that's what it is I don't

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:16.089 
here I think that's what it is I don't
know<00:05:14.569> but<00:05:14.780> what<00:05:15.229> you<00:05:15.319> got<00:05:15.440> going<00:05:15.590> here<00:05:15.770> just<00:05:16.009> a

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
know but what you got going here just a

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:17.430 
know but what you got going here just a
little<00:05:16.370> bit<00:05:16.460> different<00:05:16.819> instead<00:05:16.969> of<00:05:17.090> it<00:05:17.210> being

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
little bit different instead of it being

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.980 
little bit different instead of it being
like<00:05:18.440> that<00:05:19.120> where<00:05:20.120> you're<00:05:20.270> coming<00:05:20.690> the

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
like that where you're coming the

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.469 
like that where you're coming the
Pistons<00:05:21.680> what's<00:05:22.219> up<00:05:22.370> diagonal<00:05:23.180> it's<00:05:23.360> the

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
Pistons what's up diagonal it's the

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.659 
Pistons what's up diagonal it's the
actual<00:05:23.599> block<00:05:23.990> and<00:05:24.259> you<00:05:24.319> got<00:05:24.469> that<00:05:24.669> anyways

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
actual block and you got that anyways

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:29.350 
actual block and you got that anyways
you<00:05:26.569> know<00:05:26.599> it's<00:05:26.930> simple<00:05:27.319> and<00:05:28.130> then<00:05:28.699> to<00:05:29.060> make<00:05:29.240> it

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
you know it's simple and then to make it

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.550 
you know it's simple and then to make it
instant<00:05:29.719> if<00:05:29.810> you<00:05:29.930> want<00:05:30.080> to<00:05:30.139> make<00:05:30.229> an<00:05:30.349> instant

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
instant if you want to make an instant

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.379 
instant if you want to make an instant
how<00:05:30.800> you<00:05:30.860> gonna<00:05:31.069> do<00:05:31.250> is<00:05:31.490> you're<00:05:32.180> gonna<00:05:32.270> be

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:32.389 
how you gonna do is you're gonna be

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:33.909 
how you gonna do is you're gonna be
pulling<00:05:32.750> power<00:05:32.870> from<00:05:33.199> that<00:05:33.229> torch<00:05:33.710> right

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
pulling power from that torch right

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:36.249 
pulling power from that torch right
there<00:05:34.130> so<00:05:34.340> put<00:05:34.520> a<00:05:34.550> block<00:05:34.759> on<00:05:34.789> top<00:05:35.020> and<00:05:36.020> put

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:36.259 
there so put a block on top and put

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:37.689 
there so put a block on top and put
torch<00:05:36.529> and<00:05:36.740> you<00:05:36.800> see<00:05:36.949> it<00:05:37.039> goes<00:05:37.159> off<00:05:37.340> and<00:05:37.580> then

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:37.699 
torch and you see it goes off and then

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:40.269 
torch and you see it goes off and then
you'll<00:05:37.819> cap<00:05:38.090> that<00:05:38.360> and<00:05:39.229> then<00:05:39.860> you<00:05:39.979> want<00:05:40.190> to

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:40.279 
you'll cap that and then you want to

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:46.510 
you'll cap that and then you want to
come<00:05:40.610> out<00:05:40.729> like<00:05:40.759> that<00:05:41.680> from<00:05:42.680> that<00:05:45.520> repeater

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
come out like that from that repeater

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.420 
come out like that from that repeater
there<00:05:48.009> the<00:05:49.009> repeater<00:05:49.310> is<00:05:49.400> important<00:05:49.849> um<00:05:51.430> the

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
there the repeater is important um the

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.760 
there the repeater is important um the
reason<00:05:52.729> you<00:05:52.940> want<00:05:53.180> put<00:05:53.360> a<00:05:53.389> repeater<00:05:53.750> is<00:05:54.080> if<00:05:54.620> you

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
reason you want put a repeater is if you

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.559 
reason you want put a repeater is if you
don't<00:05:55.009> set<00:05:55.340> it<00:05:55.370> to<00:05:55.610> one<00:05:55.819> tick<00:05:56.060> delay<00:05:56.360> you're

00:05:56.559 --> 00:05:56.569 
don't set it to one tick delay you're

00:05:56.569 --> 00:05:58.330 
don't set it to one tick delay you're
gonna<00:05:56.690> burn<00:05:56.870> your<00:05:57.020> torches<00:05:57.500> out<00:05:57.650> I<00:05:57.889> mean

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
gonna burn your torches out I mean

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.800 
gonna burn your torches out I mean
you're<00:05:58.400> going<00:05:58.520> to<00:05:58.610> have<00:05:58.699> this<00:05:58.849> awful<00:05:59.569> sound

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
you're going to have this awful sound

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:00.580 
you're going to have this awful sound
and<00:05:59.960> I<00:05:59.990> thought<00:06:00.110> that<00:06:00.169> thought<00:06:00.349> thought<00:06:00.469> that

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
and I thought that thought thought that

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.230 
and I thought that thought thought that
it<00:06:00.710> just<00:06:00.889> keeps<00:06:01.069> going<00:06:01.159> and<00:06:01.490> then<00:06:01.639> you<00:06:02.120> might

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
it just keeps going and then you might

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.140 
it just keeps going and then you might
not<00:06:02.360> get<00:06:02.479> the<00:06:02.629> desired<00:06:03.259> effect<00:06:03.879> so<00:06:04.879> you<00:06:04.940> want

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
not get the desired effect so you want

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.629 
not get the desired effect so you want
to<00:06:05.210> use<00:06:05.330> a<00:06:05.360> repeater<00:06:05.960> here<00:06:06.050> set<00:06:06.860> the<00:06:06.979> one<00:06:07.190> tick

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:07.639 
to use a repeater here set the one tick

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:10.029 
to use a repeater here set the one tick
delay<00:06:08.029> and<00:06:08.409> if<00:06:09.409> we<00:06:09.529> done<00:06:09.680> that<00:06:09.800> right<00:06:09.889> we

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039 
delay and if we done that right we

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:11.499 
delay and if we done that right we
should<00:06:10.190> press<00:06:10.400> the<00:06:10.430> button<00:06:10.729> and<00:06:10.909> it<00:06:11.150> does<00:06:11.389> it

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:11.509 
should press the button and it does it

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:14.879 
should press the button and it does it
instantly<00:06:12.400> yep

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:14.889 
instantly yep

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:17.070 
instantly yep
so<00:06:15.430> yeah<00:06:15.699> that's<00:06:15.909> how<00:06:16.449> you<00:06:16.509> put<00:06:16.749> a<00:06:16.780> block

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
so yeah that's how you put a block

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.129 
so yeah that's how you put a block
swapper<00:06:17.469> on<00:06:17.620> the<00:06:17.740> ceiling<00:06:18.129> of<00:06:18.909> course<00:06:19.240> this<00:06:19.990> is

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:20.139 
swapper on the ceiling of course this is

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:22.140 
swapper on the ceiling of course this is
probably<00:06:20.289> not<00:06:20.409> the<00:06:20.499> most<00:06:20.620> ideal<00:06:21.150> setting

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
probably not the most ideal setting

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.670 
probably not the most ideal setting
right<00:06:22.389> here<00:06:22.449> this<00:06:22.689> is<00:06:22.749> as<00:06:23.050> small<00:06:23.259> as<00:06:23.409> I<00:06:23.499> could

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
right here this is as small as I could

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.409 
right here this is as small as I could
make<00:06:23.800> it<00:06:23.949> myself<00:06:24.400> if<00:06:24.669> you<00:06:24.729> guys<00:06:25.060> can<00:06:25.270> figure

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:25.419 
make it myself if you guys can figure

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:26.820 
make it myself if you guys can figure
out<00:06:25.539> how<00:06:25.659> to<00:06:25.749> make<00:06:25.870> it<00:06:25.990> smaller<00:06:26.110> go<00:06:26.499> for<00:06:26.740> it

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
out how to make it smaller go for it

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.980 
out how to make it smaller go for it
