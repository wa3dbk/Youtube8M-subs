two to three hours if I tried to run it

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.459 
two to three hours if I tried to run it

would feel like I left my legs at home

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.889 
would feel like I left my legs at home
and<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:53.670> wasn't<00:00:53.879> until<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.300> started

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
and it wasn't until I started

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.840 
and it wasn't until I started
significantly<00:00:55.739> decreasing<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.579> amount<00:00:56.670> of

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
significantly decreasing the amount of

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.310 
significantly decreasing the amount of
nuts<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.180> seeds<00:00:57.239> in<00:00:57.480> my<00:00:57.570> diet<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.109> was

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
nuts and seeds in my diet that I was

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.139 
nuts and seeds in my diet that I was
able<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.620> train<00:00:59.160> two<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.489> three<00:00:59.670> times<00:00:59.820> a<00:01:00.000> day

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
able to train two to three times a day

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.080 
able to train two to three times a day
easily<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:00.989> effortlessly<00:01:01.760> not<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:02.969> have

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
easily and effortlessly not that I have

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.350 
easily and effortlessly not that I have
a<00:01:03.120> problem<00:01:03.359> with<00:01:03.719> nuts<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.080> seeds<00:01:04.290> as<00:01:05.360> a

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
a problem with nuts and seeds as a

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.270 
a problem with nuts and seeds as a
dietary<00:01:07.140> component<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.799> think<00:01:08.010> they're<00:01:08.130> very

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
dietary component I think they're very

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.679 
dietary component I think they're very
beneficial<00:01:08.460> they<00:01:08.970> contain<00:01:09.240> quite<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.540> few

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
beneficial they contain quite a few

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.929 
beneficial they contain quite a few
minerals<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.950> are<00:01:11.100> not<00:01:11.250> found<00:01:11.520> in<00:01:11.760> abundance

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
minerals that are not found in abundance

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.510 
minerals that are not found in abundance
in<00:01:12.420> many<00:01:12.780> fruits<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.229> vegetables<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.220> think

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
in many fruits and vegetables so I think

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.999 
in many fruits and vegetables so I think
they're<00:01:14.640> definitely<00:01:15.150> necessary<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:17.130> diet

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
they're definitely necessary in the diet

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.450 
they're definitely necessary in the diet
for<00:01:20.009> me<00:01:20.159> if<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.520> were<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.850> consume<00:01:22.280> nuts<00:01:23.280> and

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
for me if I were to consume nuts and

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.130 
for me if I were to consume nuts and
seeds<00:01:23.670> on<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:23.970> regular<00:01:24.299> basis<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.750> would<00:01:24.810> do<00:01:24.990> so

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
seeds on a regular basis I would do so

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.320 
seeds on a regular basis I would do so
in<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.350> evening<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:25.979> not<00:01:26.820> for<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.060> rest<00:01:27.240> of

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
in the evening and not for the rest of

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.800 
in the evening and not for the rest of
the<00:01:27.420> day<00:01:27.740> and<00:01:28.740> for<00:01:29.430> me<00:01:29.520> fat<00:01:30.090> consumption<00:01:30.509> is

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
the day and for me fat consumption is

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.480 
the day and for me fat consumption is
something<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.229> generally<00:01:31.829> limit<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
something I generally limit to the

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.319 
something I generally limit to the
evening<00:01:33.079> so<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.770> can<00:01:35.159> actually<00:01:36.119> take

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
evening so that I can actually take

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.600 
evening so that I can actually take
advantage<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.810> being<00:01:36.990> slowed<00:01:37.380> down<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.920> don't

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
advantage of being slowed down I don't

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.069 
advantage of being slowed down I don't
want<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.820> be<00:01:38.909> all<00:01:39.030> revved<00:01:39.299> up<00:01:39.479> at<00:01:39.659> night<00:01:39.840> I

don't want to be you know carved up as

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.050 
don't want to be you know carved up as

and slow and fats and nuts and seeds
will<00:01:48.030> definitely<00:01:48.390> put<00:01:48.540> me<00:01:48.659> in<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.810> state<00:01:49.020> and

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
will definitely put me in that state and

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.260 
will definitely put me in that state and
help<00:01:49.590> me<00:01:49.710> ease<00:01:50.100> into<00:01:50.340> sleep<00:01:50.670> which<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.090> have

help me ease into sleep which I have

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.380 
help me ease into sleep which I have
problems<00:01:51.720> enough<00:01:51.840> with<00:01:52.110> already<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:53.390> that

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
problems enough with already so that

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.880 
problems enough with already so that
would<00:01:54.509> be<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.750> advantage<00:01:55.170> but<00:01:55.380> or<00:01:55.530> not<00:01:55.680> since

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
would be the advantage but or not since

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.429 
would be the advantage but or not since
he's<00:01:56.040> bad<00:01:56.280> no<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.670> don't<00:01:56.939> think<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.240> but<00:01:58.200> they

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
he's bad no I don't think so but they

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.219 
he's bad no I don't think so but they
definitely<00:01:59.040> slowed<00:01:59.310> me<00:01:59.430> down<00:01:59.780> when<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.990> eat

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
definitely slowed me down when you eat

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.219 
definitely slowed me down when you eat
nuts<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:01.950> seeds<00:02:02.189> do<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.119> eat<00:02:03.299> them<00:02:03.509> raw<00:02:03.869> and

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
nuts and seeds do you eat them raw and

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.410 
nuts and seeds do you eat them raw and
sprouted<00:02:06.140> ideally<00:02:07.140> yes<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:08.160> when<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:08.849> do<00:02:09.000> eat

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
sprouted ideally yes and when I do eat

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.200 
sprouted ideally yes and when I do eat
them<00:02:09.629> raw<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.020> sprouted<00:02:10.649> the

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
them raw and sprouted the

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.820 
them raw and sprouted the
negative<00:02:13.210> effect<00:02:13.630> on<00:02:13.900> digestion<00:02:14.500> is

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
negative effect on digestion is

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.510 
negative effect on digestion is
minimized<00:02:15.550> I<00:02:16.530> still<00:02:17.530> wouldn't<00:02:17.770> go<00:02:17.920> run<00:02:18.220> after

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
minimized I still wouldn't go run after

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.890 
minimized I still wouldn't go run after
doing<00:02:18.940> so<00:02:19.180> but<00:02:20.170> eating<00:02:20.709> them<00:02:20.860> unspotted<00:02:21.900> or

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
doing so but eating them unspotted or

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.500 
doing so but eating them unspotted or
germinated<00:02:23.650> is<00:02:24.100> definitely<00:02:24.640> problematic

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
germinated is definitely problematic

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.750 
germinated is definitely problematic
now<00:02:26.050> do<00:02:26.110> I<00:02:26.410> always<00:02:26.620> have<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:26.980> opportunity<00:02:27.520> to

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
now do I always have the opportunity to

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.170 
now do I always have the opportunity to
eat<00:02:28.000> them<00:02:28.150> that<00:02:28.270> way<00:02:28.420> no<00:02:29.310> but<00:02:30.310> ideally<00:02:30.670> yes<00:02:31.000> I

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
eat them that way no but ideally yes I

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.520 
eat them that way no but ideally yes I
would<00:02:31.330> always<00:02:31.480> sprout<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.080> germinate<00:02:32.410> them

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
would always sprout and germinate them

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.420 
would always sprout and germinate them
before<00:02:32.830> eating<00:02:33.010> them

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
before eating them

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.180 
before eating them
I<00:02:33.900> definitely<00:02:34.900> feel<00:02:35.260> much<00:02:35.440> better<00:02:35.500> after

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
I definitely feel much better after

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.730 
I definitely feel much better after
having<00:02:36.280> done<00:02:36.550> that
