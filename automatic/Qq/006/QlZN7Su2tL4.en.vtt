alright<00:00:03.000> couple<00:00:03.600> of<00:00:03.750> points<00:00:04.290> I<00:00:04.350> want<00:00:04.500> to

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
alright couple of points I want to

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.549 
alright couple of points I want to
mention<00:00:04.740> is<00:00:05.100> that<00:00:05.730> a<00:00:06.120> couple<00:00:07.049> of<00:00:07.259> people<00:00:07.500> on

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559 
mention is that a couple of people on

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.959 
mention is that a couple of people on
YouTube<00:00:11.090> recommended<00:00:12.090> that<00:00:12.269> I<00:00:12.330> use<00:00:12.719> primer

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:13.969 
YouTube recommended that I use primer

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.540 
YouTube recommended that I use primer
before<00:00:14.969> applying<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:16.080> PVC<00:00:16.980> cement<00:00:17.190> and

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
before applying the PVC cement and

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.950 
before applying the PVC cement and
assembling<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.539> components<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:20.160> tubes

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
assembling the components of the tubes

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.620 
assembling the components of the tubes
probably<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:21.990> good<00:00:22.199> idea<00:00:22.609> the<00:00:23.609> consequence<00:00:24.449> of

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
probably a good idea the consequence of

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.980 
probably a good idea the consequence of
that<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.939> adhesive<00:00:26.939> inside<00:00:27.539> deep

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
that is that the adhesive inside deep

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.169 
that is that the adhesive inside deep
inside<00:00:28.109> here<00:00:28.740> will<00:00:29.250> take<00:00:29.429> much<00:00:29.699> longer<00:00:29.730> to

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
inside here will take much longer to

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.209 
inside here will take much longer to
cure<00:00:30.570> than<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.050> otherwise<00:00:31.230> would<00:00:31.560> with<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
cure than it otherwise would with the

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.600 
cure than it otherwise would with the
primer<00:00:32.690> I<00:00:33.690> don't<00:00:34.290> believe<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.620> mechanical

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
primer I don't believe that mechanical

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.150 
primer I don't believe that mechanical
integrity<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.600> very<00:00:36.930> large<00:00:37.230> factor<00:00:37.860> here

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
integrity is is a very large factor here

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.220 
integrity is is a very large factor here
so<00:00:38.430> I'm<00:00:38.940> not<00:00:39.180> going<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.360> worry<00:00:39.629> about<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:40.050> too

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
so I'm not going to worry about it too

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.529 
so I'm not going to worry about it too
much<00:00:40.790> I<00:00:41.790> also<00:00:42.210> wanted<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.940> point<00:00:44.940> out<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.390> i'm

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
much I also wanted to point out that i'm

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.240 
much I also wanted to point out that i'm
taking<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.960> suggestion<00:00:46.379> from<00:00:46.680> another<00:00:47.010> user

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
taking a suggestion from another user

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.939 
taking a suggestion from another user
I've<00:00:48.230> taken<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.770> electrode<00:00:50.610> bolts<00:00:51.890> that<00:00:52.890> were

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
I've taken the electrode bolts that were

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.520 
I've taken the electrode bolts that were
originally<00:00:53.640> just<00:00:54.420> going<00:00:54.750> through<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.079> straps

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
originally just going through the straps

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.340 
originally just going through the straps
in<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.860> end<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.340> corner<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.210> strap<00:00:57.539> right

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
in the end the corner of the strap right

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.650 
in the end the corner of the strap right
up<00:00:58.530> against<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.949> bottom<00:00:59.190> surface<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.000> PVC

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
up against the bottom surface of the PVC

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.450 
up against the bottom surface of the PVC
and<00:01:00.899> then<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.770> top<00:01:01.980> knot<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.430> secure

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
and then the top knot to secure

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.329 
and then the top knot to secure
everything<00:01:03.120> together<00:01:03.680> the<00:01:04.680> problem<00:01:05.189> with

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
everything together the problem with

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.070 
everything together the problem with
that<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.820> if<00:01:06.090> there's<00:01:06.299> any<00:01:06.479> heating<00:01:06.960> that

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
that is if there's any heating that

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.039 
that is if there's any heating that
takes<00:01:07.380> place<00:01:07.710> at<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:08.850> connection<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.840> will

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
takes place at this connection it will

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.320 
takes place at this connection it will
soften<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.619> PVC<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.250> loosen<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.880> connection

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
soften the PVC and loosen the connection

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.070 
soften the PVC and loosen the connection
even<00:01:12.450> further<00:01:13.640> so<00:01:14.640> what<00:01:15.119> I've<00:01:15.270> done<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.540> I've

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
even further so what I've done is I've

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.830 
even further so what I've done is I've
taken<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.850> out<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.090> equation<00:01:18.119> by

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
taken that out of the equation by

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.380 
taken that out of the equation by
putting<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.860> bolt<00:01:20.159> with<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> nut<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.210> lock

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
putting a bolt with a nut and a lock

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.179 
putting a bolt with a nut and a lock
washer<00:01:21.659> on<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.350> socking<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:22.979> down

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
washer on it and socking that down

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.399 
washer on it and socking that down
really<00:01:23.610> tight<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.259> this

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
really tight so that the so that this

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.920 
really tight so that the so that this
can't<00:01:25.770> loosen<00:01:26.159> up<00:01:26.340> over<00:01:26.640> time<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.600> metal

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
can't loosen up over time this is metal

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.289 
can't loosen up over time this is metal
to<00:01:28.080> metal<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.500> then<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.520> also<00:01:29.670> gives<00:01:29.970> me<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
to metal and then it also gives me the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.530 
to metal and then it also gives me the
option<00:01:30.479> now<00:01:30.869> putting<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.650> nut<00:01:32.189> on<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
option now putting a nut on the on the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.600 
option now putting a nut on the on the
bolt<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.460> can<00:01:35.610> level<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.979> cap<00:01:38.189> our

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
bolt so that I can level the cap our

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.670 
bolt so that I can level the cap our
level<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.840> plates<00:01:40.110> hanging<00:01:40.500> down

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
level the the plates hanging down

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.499 
level the the plates hanging down
underneath<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.100> cap<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.729> little<00:01:42.270> bit<00:01:42.360> better

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
underneath the cap a little bit better

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.730 
underneath the cap a little bit better
so<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:42.990> gives<00:01:43.140> me<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.320> little<00:01:43.409> bit<00:01:43.560> more

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
so that gives me a little bit more

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.710 
so that gives me a little bit more
adjustment<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.759> can<00:01:44.909> also<00:01:45.060> adjust<00:01:45.390> the

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
adjustment and I can also adjust the

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.249 
adjustment and I can also adjust the
depth<00:01:46.110> inside<00:01:46.770> inside<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.520> cell<00:01:48.079> this<00:01:49.079> is

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
depth inside inside the cell this is

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.690 
depth inside inside the cell this is
actually<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.680> little<00:01:49.829> bit<00:01:50.070> closer<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.549> where<00:01:50.670> I

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
actually a little bit closer to where I

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.030 
actually a little bit closer to where I
want<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.119> which<00:01:51.299> we<00:01:51.420> get<00:01:51.570> even<00:01:51.840> closer<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.920> the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
want it which we get even closer to the

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.740 
want it which we get even closer to the
bottom<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:54.450> tank<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.490> also<00:01:56.750> I'm

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
bottom of the of the tank so also I'm

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.550 
bottom of the of the tank so also I'm
going<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.110> be<00:01:58.369> drilling<00:01:59.369> with<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.180> hole<00:02:00.420> saw

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
going to be drilling with a hole saw

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.020 
going to be drilling with a hole saw
hole<00:02:01.560> right<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.159> very<00:02:02.280> top<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:02.759> cap

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
hole right in the very top of this cap

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.209 
hole right in the very top of this cap
and<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:04.020> stopped<00:02:04.320> at<00:02:04.469> home<00:02:04.500> depot<00:02:04.890> today<00:02:05.100> I

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
and I stopped at home depot today I

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.169 
and I stopped at home depot today I
picked<00:02:05.610> up<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.880> one-inch<00:02:06.299> PVC<00:02:06.570> end<00:02:07.110> cap<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.740> a
