00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.609 

now<00:00:13.320> with<00:00:13.500> these<00:00:13.710> all-in-one<00:00:14.870> um<00:00:15.870> aquariums

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
now with these all-in-one um aquariums

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.160 
now with these all-in-one um aquariums
that<00:00:16.830> come<00:00:17.010> with<00:00:17.190> these<00:00:17.400> top<00:00:17.760> filters<00:00:18.240> it's

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
that come with these top filters it's

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.320 
that come with these top filters it's
really<00:00:19.740> really<00:00:20.100> important<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:21.210> you

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
really really important that you

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.570 
really really important that you
understand<00:00:21.750> how<00:00:21.930> they<00:00:22.109> work<00:00:22.140> basically<00:00:23.130> the

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
understand how they work basically the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.029 
understand how they work basically the
water<00:00:23.789> comes<00:00:24.119> through<00:00:24.240> this<00:00:24.660> spray<00:00:24.960> bar<00:00:25.199> it

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
water comes through this spray bar it

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.670 
water comes through this spray bar it
goes<00:00:26.220> past<00:00:26.580> this<00:00:26.760> poly<00:00:27.029> filter<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.630> insist<00:00:28.529> on

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
goes past this poly filter I insist on

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.320 
goes past this poly filter I insist on
using<00:00:28.859> poly<00:00:29.250> filter<00:00:29.580> cause<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.760> won't<00:00:29.970> clog<00:00:30.150> up

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
using poly filter cause I won't clog up

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.350 
using poly filter cause I won't clog up
and<00:00:30.510> underneath<00:00:31.500> there's<00:00:31.890> some<00:00:32.070> noodles<00:00:32.430> if

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
and underneath there's some noodles if

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.580 
and underneath there's some noodles if
this<00:00:33.540> was<00:00:33.690> my<00:00:33.870> tank<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.290> would<00:00:34.410> absolutely

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
this was my tank I would absolutely

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.250 
this was my tank I would absolutely
change<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.610> marine<00:00:35.850> pure<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.020> about

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
change it to marine pure this is about

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.830 
change it to marine pure this is about
twenty<00:00:37.559> times<00:00:37.800> more<00:00:37.890> effective<00:00:38.690> then<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
twenty times more effective then the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.280 
twenty times more effective then the
water<00:00:40.020> goes<00:00:40.230> down<00:00:40.590> underneath<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:42.290> little

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
water goes down underneath of the little

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.910 
water goes down underneath of the little
divider<00:00:43.649> here<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.550> into<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.059> side<00:00:45.800> this<00:00:46.800> is

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
divider here and into this side this is

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.619 
divider here and into this side this is
once<00:00:47.129> again<00:00:47.399> but<00:00:47.610> some<00:00:47.789> poly<00:00:48.000> filter<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.480> some

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
once again but some poly filter and some

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.779 
once again but some poly filter and some
noodles<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.350> then<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.219> waters<00:00:50.489> got<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.700> be

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
noodles and then the waters got to be

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.450 
noodles and then the waters got to be
able<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.090> exit<00:00:51.600> over<00:00:51.809> here<00:00:52.100> to<00:00:53.100> actually<00:00:53.399> go

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
able to exit over here to actually go

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.360 
able to exit over here to actually go
back<00:00:53.670> into<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.030> aquarium<00:00:54.270> again<00:00:54.800> now<00:00:55.800> if<00:00:56.100> you

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
back into the aquarium again now if you

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.549 
back into the aquarium again now if you
have<00:00:57.120> got<00:00:57.390> media<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.140> second

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
have got media in this second

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.279 
have got media in this second
compartment<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.550> you<00:01:00.180> push<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.660> poly<00:01:00.899> filter

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
compartment and you push the poly filter

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.799 
compartment and you push the poly filter
to<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.559> end<00:01:01.710> there<00:01:02.059> after<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> period<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.600> time

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
to the end there after a period of time

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.730 
to the end there after a period of time
it's<00:01:04.379> inevitable<00:01:05.129> but<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.659> dirt<00:01:06.930> is

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
it's inevitable but that the dirt is

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.420 
it's inevitable but that the dirt is
going<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:07.979> put<00:01:08.189> pressure<00:01:08.490> on<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.780> outlet

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
going to put pressure on the outlet

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.100 
going to put pressure on the outlet
therefore<00:01:11.430> it's<00:01:11.670> going<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.030> rise<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.900> water

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
therefore it's going to rise the water

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.859 
therefore it's going to rise the water
level<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.530> here<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.369> such<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.659> can

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
level in here and such that it can

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.649 
level in here and such that it can
actually<00:01:16.380> leak<00:01:16.590> out<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.759> it's<00:01:17.909> very<00:01:18.090> important

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
actually leak out so it's very important

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.630 
actually leak out so it's very important
with<00:01:18.720> these<00:01:18.900> filters<00:01:19.380> number<00:01:20.189> one<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.549> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
with these filters number one that the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.730 
with these filters number one that the
filters<00:01:21.000> are<00:01:21.119> actually<00:01:21.479> level<00:01:21.840> because<00:01:22.619> if

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
filters are actually level because if

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.440 
filters are actually level because if
they're<00:01:22.890> not<00:01:22.920> level<00:01:23.549> they<00:01:23.850> can<00:01:23.880> cause<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.270> a

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
they're not level they can cause you a

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.789 
they're not level they can cause you a
problem<00:01:24.840> because<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.140> water<00:01:25.320> has<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.650> be<00:01:25.680> able

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
problem because the water has to be able

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.090 
problem because the water has to be able
to<00:01:25.920> flow<00:01:26.250> via<00:01:26.610> gravity<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.680> make<00:01:28.680> sure<00:01:28.920> that

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
to flow via gravity and make sure that

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.450 
to flow via gravity and make sure that
the<00:01:29.420> side<00:01:30.420> piece<00:01:30.840> here<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.350> totally<00:01:32.100> free

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
the side piece here is totally free

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.149 
the side piece here is totally free
because<00:01:33.420> if<00:01:33.600> this<00:01:33.750> clogs<00:01:34.110> up<00:01:34.350> you're<00:01:35.070> gonna

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
because if this clogs up you're gonna

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.609 
because if this clogs up you're gonna
get<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.400> backlog<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.840> water<00:01:37.049> can<00:01:37.229> leak<00:01:37.439> out

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
get a backlog and the water can leak out

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.649 
get a backlog and the water can leak out
of<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:37.950> side

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
of this side

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.209 
of this side
so<00:01:40.229> that's<00:01:40.409> why<00:01:40.560> I'm<00:01:40.680> against<00:01:40.979> those

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:41.219 
so that's why I'm against those

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:42.709 
so that's why I'm against those
cartridges<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.909> come<00:01:42.180> with<00:01:42.329> them<00:01:42.509> too

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719 
cartridges that come with them too

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:44.420 
cartridges that come with them too
because<00:01:43.409> they're<00:01:43.590> running<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:43.950> filter<00:01:44.310> wall

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
because they're running on filter wall

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.510 
because they're running on filter wall
and<00:01:44.640> filter<00:01:45.000> bubble<00:01:45.299> inevitably<00:01:46.020> clogged

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
and filter bubble inevitably clogged

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.800 
and filter bubble inevitably clogged
that's<00:01:47.520> why<00:01:47.670> I'd<00:01:47.759> rather<00:01:47.820> use<00:01:48.210> poly<00:01:48.479> filter

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
that's why I'd rather use poly filter

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.870 
that's why I'd rather use poly filter
and<00:01:48.930> I'd<00:01:48.990> rather<00:01:49.140> use<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.439> piece<00:01:49.860> that's<00:01:50.520> cut

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
and I'd rather use a piece that's cut

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.260 
and I'd rather use a piece that's cut
short<00:01:51.240> it's<00:01:51.990> not<00:01:52.289> going<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.770> create<00:01:53.130> any<00:01:53.820> sort

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
short it's not going to create any sort

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.560 
short it's not going to create any sort
of<00:01:54.679> backlog<00:01:55.679> here<00:01:55.950> which<00:01:56.820> can<00:01:57.000> caught<00:01:57.299> which

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
of backlog here which can caught which

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.179 
of backlog here which can caught which
is<00:01:57.750> going<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:57.960> hamper<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.590> water<00:01:58.799> coming<00:01:59.039> out

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
is going to hamper the water coming out

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.020 
is going to hamper the water coming out
of<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.460> outlet<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.649> cause<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.679> bank<00:02:02.039> up<00:02:02.250> at

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
of the outlet and cause a bank up at

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.330 
of the outlet and cause a bank up at
this<00:02:03.240> end<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.840> can<00:02:04.530> actually<00:02:04.679> cause<00:02:05.100> the

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
this end the can actually cause the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.330 
this end the can actually cause the
water<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:06.409> come<00:02:07.409> out<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.619> here<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.190> actually

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
water to come out of here and actually
