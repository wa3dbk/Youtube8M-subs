00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.370
 yes 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.000
 sun 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.069

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.529
 today ana santamarÃ­a we are going to know a swimming course for babies 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.570
 we have apan carlos fernandez here that the professor 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:21.579
 the little ones in this entity a little in what it consists is accused of swimming 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:25.599
 for babies to pluck the Tongans peace yes how good what we do is 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.359
 a cd activity of swimming for babies 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.060
 that the program moss throughout the year 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.530
 be it the parents go in principle they go looking for a bit 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.579
 well, a shy for the children 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.240
 will roll in 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.680
 per cent the motor schema 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.450
 and at the same time learn to swim 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.100
 so what happens a little is that the work we do a job 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.580
 of stimulation 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.630
 then in that stimulation work we get the babies 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.820
 we do the work based on the 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.860
 four months we have some with three months 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.320
 2 we get post in a month about a month and a half babies 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.080
 begin to dominate the middle to be autonomous each fruit 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.540
 we do this a little 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.360
 taking advantage of the reflexes that stop him in the womb when babies 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.260
 are born 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.870
 of a series of reflections 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.020
 that favor flotation 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.120
 everything we do is for the baby to discover it 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.920
 and be totally autonomous 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.259
 that phase lasts approximately eight nine ten months depending on whether you start 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.940
 at four months or at 8 to 10 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.170
 and approximately a baby who is coming at 18 since he was five months old 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.710
 months 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.720
 he's just going around 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.170
 I'll try to move to swim to put the little head in development is a bit 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.490
 then the important thing of swimming networks 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.480
 is that the baby though 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.650
 learn to swim even if you float by yourself 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.799
 Has to follow 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.269
 p as if we said a little maintaining that level because 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.060
 because the first three years of life of 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.350
 our 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.020
 the development of the human being 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.840
 are the ones that change the most shape we transform ourselves so that we 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.210
 duplicate uat imply our weight and our size 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.450
 then the baby once we get it to hold so matter 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.749
 of the water floating 

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:11.940
 then you must continue those classes 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.639
 as reinforcement once a week once finished 15 days 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:17.619
 that way we get that 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:20.809
 six months later one year later when summer arrives 

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:24.289
 and the parents take the children to the pool, the baby maintains that quality 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:28.249
 that this is very important and it is a commitment that you have when you are given 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:31.249
 class to the day 

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:49.649
 10 

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:56.339
 are you counting 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.650
 it even has offices between three and four months 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.679
 There is some risk to 

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:03.419
 to the CDs 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:06.110
 good always existing risks 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.089
 we can say that there is a risk what happens is that the class 

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:13.189
 we eliminate that risk as good the class that side and I 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:14.669
 there is a student 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:16.499
 with me exclusively 

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:20.419
 and then there are a series of elements that we have to value and that is 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:21.669
 the babies 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:25.059
 in the womb have developed a reflection that is the most important 

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:27.019
 has that glottis reflex 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.440
 the baby in another 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.339
 even 

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:31.880
 percent although I got him in the background 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.279
 the baby would leave would have paid 

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:35.659
 percent that happens 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:38.809
 that what we do is develop that reflection 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:41.819
 and that the baby discovers was reflected and the self 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.559
 that way we get the baby although you can see that he or she 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:48.679
 face that we make turn we submit to the fund 

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:52.109
 them to the lungs does not get any water at all 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:56.059
 for that reflection that logically had to the maternal breast in water 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:04:00.329
 and the lungs did not work but they do not work because the athletic has 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.199
 closed the presence of water theses maintain that 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:05.099
 that reflection is losing 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.369
 and if you lose when they start walking unless you let them come to 

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:09.539
 the pool and that nobody 

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:12.939
 It is important that children before they start walking 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:15.889
 so the role of the fleet to and manage in the water to stay 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:16.599
 reflexes 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:19.649
 that is why many of the accidents are the majority of domestic accidents 

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:20.949
 at home 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:24.139
 a lid of two years three years are produced 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.280
 two and a half years that is when it is to start walking and expensive than in aragua and 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.819
 that reflex has been lost others immediately bring water and the accident in 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:32.680
 the middle 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.909
 aquatic is very fast really 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:39.029
 not the thing that has particularly struck me is that I have 

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.699
 viewed 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:43.990
 who puts them floating and the strips of hair and windows is one that is a 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.680
 technique for what 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.860
 good that the baby 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.979
 percent in the water 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.300
 has a much larger development scheme than outside 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.510
 just in the baby what I do the work I do with them is a job 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:57.380
 of stimulation 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.919
 that is, the tumbles 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.910
 and there was even someone who lost a little balance 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.440
 and I give them part of the balance that is missing but not all for them 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.059
 develop 

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:10.509
 per 100 what it lacks 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:14.800
 that it comes a moment that I put my finger on my hand and I notice how 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.759
 their muscles press towards those areas to support themselves 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:21.479
 is that we get with the hair 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.830
 with the hair we get that the baby can not send orders of support to the hair 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.009
 we got them that must work balance and I with him but I give him the 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:33.300
 just force you need until I get them to go floating 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.250
 so thank you very much 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.310
 let's see those kids floating in the thesis 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.680
 A) Yes 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.229
 let's introduce one of the moms who usually brings her baby 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:51.069
 certainly did not know this 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:54.169
 this injection system 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:57.169
 for children so big that the thing you do is not going 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.210
 this ere as it is called 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.449
 this beautiful 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:04.050
 how much time does Adriana have a year? 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.150
 how long it has been swimming these was to be the fourth class 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.020
 to the fourth class as Brazil this system of 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.189
 in tena songs 

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:15.189
 Christmas stand and now 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.229
 I find it very interesting 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:21.069
 we have true 

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:24.069
 she wants to say something here 

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:39.659
 the afternoon 

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:41.840
 this thing so divine as it is called 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.339
 Roberto street 

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:46.399
 my open javier has telenovela name 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.869
 there is the team and it has an advantage and it is in excess of 

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:52.449
 when nothing 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:55.289
 two months of the year 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:56.550
 he loved 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:57.800
 the water loves it very much 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.680
 denied that he brought her today that you bring her what is the reason that the average age 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.610
 in which he was also encouraged that with so much water he has to learn to swim 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.729
 so that if it is not provoked to carry out 

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:11.729
 it will be necessary to see how the water likes so much 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.069
 thank you very much carli 

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:16.229
 there are many practices giahsa roberto javier
