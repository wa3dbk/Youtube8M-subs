and then the instructions for the kit so

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.520 
and then the instructions for the kit so
the<00:00:38.550> first<00:00:38.760> thing<00:00:38.940> we're<00:00:39.090> gonna<00:00:39.210> do<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.780> just

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
the first thing we're gonna do is just

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.229 
the first thing we're gonna do is just
read<00:00:40.860> over<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.160> instructions<00:00:41.489> real<00:00:41.940> quick

good idea of what's going to go on and

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.380 
good idea of what's going to go on and
then<00:00:44.940> we'll<00:00:45.450> start<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.719> process<00:00:47.090> so<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
then we'll start the process so the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.819 
then we'll start the process so the
first<00:00:48.629> thing<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.989> would<00:00:49.110> want<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.469> do<00:00:49.620> would

way and so the first thing you'll notice
that<00:01:05.960> this<00:01:06.960> kit<00:01:07.290> only<00:01:07.650> works<00:01:07.890> with<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.280> wiper

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
that this kit only works with a wiper

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.600 
that this kit only works with a wiper

and the next thing we're gonna do is is
start<00:01:24.659> mounting<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.020> bracket<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:25.890> those<00:01:26.790> of

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
start mounting the bracket so those of

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.359 
start mounting the bracket so those of
you<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.270> had<00:01:27.450> factory<00:01:28.110> electric<00:01:28.890> wipers<00:01:29.220> on

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
you that had factory electric wipers on

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.270 
you that had factory electric wipers on
here<00:01:29.960> the<00:01:30.960> headliner<00:01:31.350> screw<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.130> center

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
here the headliner screw in the center

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.170 
here the headliner screw in the center
I've<00:01:32.549> painted<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:33.030> red<00:01:33.240> here<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:34.470> will<00:01:34.619> be<00:01:35.180> one

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
I've painted it red here it will be one

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.149 
I've painted it red here it will be one
of<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.390> mounting<00:01:36.689> points<00:01:37.110> for<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.890> middle

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
of the mounting points for the middle

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.950 
of the mounting points for the middle
bracket<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.960> we'll<00:01:39.960> use<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.549> as<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.610> jig<00:01:42.060> to

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
bracket and we'll use that as a jig to

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.929 
bracket and we'll use that as a jig to
produce<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.710> location<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.340> our<00:01:44.460> secondary

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
produce the location of our secondary

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.300 
produce the location of our secondary
mounting<00:01:45.420> hole<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:46.320> we've<00:01:46.619> already<00:01:46.860> drilled

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
mounting hole and we've already drilled

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.530 
mounting hole and we've already drilled
it<00:01:47.490> out<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:47.909> now<00:01:48.030> we're<00:01:48.180> going<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.329> go<00:01:48.479> ahead

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
it out so now we're going to go ahead

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.320 
it out so now we're going to go ahead
and<00:01:48.810> install<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.530> bracket

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.380 

when<00:01:53.960> installing<00:01:54.470> this<00:01:54.650> middle<00:01:55.490> bracket<00:01:55.970> it's

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
when installing this middle bracket it's

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.990 
when installing this middle bracket it's
easier<00:01:56.840> to<00:01:57.080> insert<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.590> screw<00:01:57.970> through<00:01:58.970> the

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
easier to insert the screw through the

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.480 
easier to insert the screw through the
bracket<00:01:59.120> and<00:01:59.810> then<00:02:00.320> put<00:02:00.650> the<00:02:00.740> bracket<00:02:01.160> up<00:02:01.280> into

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
bracket and then put the bracket up into

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.300 
bracket and then put the bracket up into
place<00:02:01.730> and<00:02:02.540> snug<00:02:02.990> it<00:02:03.170> up<00:02:03.260> and<00:02:03.710> that<00:02:04.010> will<00:02:04.160> give

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
place and snug it up and that will give

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.690 
place and snug it up and that will give
you<00:02:04.430> the<00:02:04.580> location<00:02:05.180> for<00:02:05.540> your<00:02:05.600> secondary

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
you the location for your secondary

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.270 
you the location for your secondary
mounting<00:02:07.700> hole<00:02:08.530> so<00:02:09.530> you<00:02:09.619> would<00:02:09.830> just<00:02:09.860> go<00:02:10.130> ahead

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
mounting hole so you would just go ahead

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.550 
mounting hole so you would just go ahead
and<00:02:10.520> drill<00:02:10.760> it<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.030> then<00:02:11.810> run<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.380> sheet

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
and drill it and then run the sheet

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.060 
and drill it and then run the sheet
metal<00:02:12.800> screw<00:02:13.100> in<00:02:13.760> place<00:02:14.060> to<00:02:14.570> hold<00:02:14.720> it<00:02:14.900> in<00:02:17.680> once

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
metal screw in place to hold it in once

give<00:04:39.360> it<00:04:39.389> a<00:04:39.509> little<00:04:39.599> trim<00:04:40.020> and<00:04:40.620> then<00:04:40.770> go<00:04:41.009> ahead

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
give it a little trim and then go ahead

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.180 
give it a little trim and then go ahead
and<00:04:41.280> reinstall<00:04:41.720> and<00:04:42.720> check<00:04:43.050> for<00:04:43.080> fitment

you<00:04:46.820> can<00:04:47.000> see<00:04:47.240> we've<00:04:47.480> trimmed<00:04:47.840> off<00:04:48.080> about<00:04:48.860> a

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
you can see we've trimmed off about a

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.640 
you can see we've trimmed off about a
quarter<00:04:50.210> of<00:04:50.240> an<00:04:50.360> inch<00:04:50.450> 3/8<00:04:51.020> of<00:04:51.140> an<00:04:51.260> inch<00:04:51.320> from
