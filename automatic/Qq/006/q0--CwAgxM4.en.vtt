00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 very good guys sure more than one 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.700
 occasion we have left or we have been caught 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.410
 our phone to someone who is and 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.690
 we have been waiting to see 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.309
 what they did if they entered watts 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.500
 less well some conversations and for 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.480
 if they entered the gallery and could see 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.340
 certain things that we did not want 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.020
 that they would have in this new video is going to 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.240
 be an application which is going to 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.369
 allow to block applications 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.869
 that we want with a pattern of 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.550
 this way I can not leave you our 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.289
 phone that we want these 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.939
 people can use the phone to 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.230
 perfection but simply 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.000
 we will put the password in the 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.160
 applications that we want 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.489
 do not enter so if you want to know how 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.489
 do what 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.650
 good guys the application with use 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.990
 to do this to be able to block 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.030
 certain applications is called a block or 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.100
 Lock have more than 100 million 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.260
 downloads a score of 4 to 4 on 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.680
 5 stars in the play store and if 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.300
 down we have a weight of 4.4 meg and 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.790
 that is quite light we are going to access 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.410
 to the application I enjoyed it and the 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.210
 back installed so you can see all the 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.830
 process that asks us to install it by 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.900
 first time the first time we started the 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.250
 application or to ask for the code which is going 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.390
 to be going to convert into the code that 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.340
 let's use to block the 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.759
 applications that we want for example to 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.990
 put him 1234 we give him to accept us 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.350
 they ask that we reintroduce it 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.420
 new 1234 the new one between accepting and us 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.979
 they would ask for an email to which if there is any 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.259
 problem when accessing some 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.320
 application then that with that mail 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.610
 we can recover the password so 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.670
 this way I recommend you to put 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.840
 your original mail once what 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.610
 we have put simply we give in 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.560
 save 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.290
 we get this notice with the different 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.840
 updates and it would be an application 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.760
 very simple and very intuitive we are going to 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.700
 look for any application that we want 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.230
 block for example one that we use 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.730
 habitually or not to work at 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.380
 whatsapp that is still one of the most 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.570
 conflictive the most interesting 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.640
 block from here we always touch on 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.700
 the icon and the 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.530
 quasar application we left we go to 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.440
 try to access our application of 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.050
 whatsapp and as you can see before accessing 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.970
 the application what it asks us is our 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.100
 password just knows you a two 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.630
 three four and as you see then we already 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.370
 would access our application of 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.660
 whatsapp no â€‹â€‹problem without a doubt its 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.980
 application that I believe should be 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.600
 be on all smartphones since 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.850
 occupies very little I have already seen that it occupies 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.530
 only four megabytes and new functions 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.140
 quite interesting because just by 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.640
 you do not have to hide anything and for 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.290
 you do not usually have to put 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.030
 password to any application but 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.190
 same at some particular moment yes 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.630
 that you would be interested in this option and how 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.940
 I say you can have it either 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.170
 occupy a lot so short video 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.550
 I hope you liked it under the 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.140
 comments as always I tell you 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.700
 love it and if it has seemed like the 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.390
 video and similar thing is the application 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.760
 what do you 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.560
 shown the same way you liked it 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.050
 in has served we would love it to put 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.370
 a like to this video and nothing this would be 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.780
 all remember after follow us on
