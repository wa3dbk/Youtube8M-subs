what<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:41.850> was<00:01:41.970> recommended<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.570> me<00:01:42.659> when<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.049> had

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
what it was recommended to me when I had

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.530 
what it was recommended to me when I had
surgery<00:01:43.649> on<00:01:43.680> my<00:01:43.799> shoulder<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.579> had<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.030> slap<00:01:45.270> tear

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
surgery on my shoulder I had a slap tear

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.289 
surgery on my shoulder I had a slap tear
and<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.740> some<00:01:47.250> praying<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:47.759> my<00:01:47.880> subscapularis

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
and and some praying in my subscapularis

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.580 
and and some praying in my subscapularis
which<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.840> one<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:48.960> my<00:01:49.049> rotator<00:01:49.380> cuff<00:01:49.560> muscles

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
which is one of my rotator cuff muscles

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.920 
which is one of my rotator cuff muscles
so<00:01:50.070> if<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:50.939> have<00:01:51.030> something<00:01:51.060> similar<00:01:51.600> might

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
so if you have something similar might

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.200 
so if you have something similar might
be<00:01:52.020> something<00:01:52.200> for<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.590> consider<00:01:53.210> as

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
be something for you to consider as

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.480 
be something for you to consider as
yours<00:01:54.630> as<00:01:54.840> your<00:01:55.200> shoulder<00:01:55.590> gets<00:01:55.680> better<00:01:55.979> you

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
yours as your shoulder gets better you

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.399 
yours as your shoulder gets better you
can<00:01:56.640> still<00:01:56.909> start<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.270> do<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.960> know<00:01:58.049> all<00:01:58.229> your

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
can still start to do you know all your

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.899 
can still start to do you know all your
body<00:01:58.619> weight<00:01:58.740> movements<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.610> know<00:01:59.700> air

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
body weight movements you know air

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.480 
body weight movements you know air
squats<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.540> bodyweight<00:02:00.930> lunges<00:02:01.490> eventually

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
squats and bodyweight lunges eventually

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.859 
squats and bodyweight lunges eventually
you<00:02:02.549> can<00:02:02.640> start<00:02:02.790> doing<00:02:03.030> things<00:02:03.180> like<00:02:03.390> sit<00:02:03.719> ups

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
you can start doing things like sit ups

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.050 
you can start doing things like sit ups
and<00:02:03.960> then<00:02:04.880> eventually<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.180> can

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
and then eventually you can

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.940 
and then eventually you can
start<00:02:07.540> holding<00:02:07.720> dumbbells<00:02:08.020> either<00:02:08.709> in<00:02:08.920> your

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
start holding dumbbells either in your

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.859 
start holding dumbbells either in your
opposite<00:02:09.429> hand<00:02:09.459> and<00:02:09.940> doing<00:02:10.149> lunges<00:02:10.330> like<00:02:10.630> that

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
opposite hand and doing lunges like that

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.260 
opposite hand and doing lunges like that
you<00:02:11.709> can<00:02:11.830> start<00:02:12.069> doing<00:02:12.250> you<00:02:12.790> know<00:02:12.880> one<00:02:13.120> on

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
you can start doing you know one on

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.080 
you can start doing you know one on
deadlifts<00:02:13.870> you<00:02:14.739> can<00:02:14.890> put<00:02:15.069> a<00:02:15.099> bar<00:02:15.400> on<00:02:15.430> your<00:02:15.849> back

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
deadlifts you can put a bar on your back

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.850 
deadlifts you can put a bar on your back
or<00:02:16.390> maybe<00:02:16.569> a<00:02:16.690> safety<00:02:17.140> bar<00:02:17.290> would<00:02:17.470> even<00:02:17.770> be

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
or maybe a safety bar would even be

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.500 
or maybe a safety bar would even be
better<00:02:17.890> if<00:02:18.340> you<00:02:18.459> have<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.700> safety<00:02:18.970> bar<00:02:19.180> that<00:02:19.360> way

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
better if you have a safety bar that way

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.870 
better if you have a safety bar that way
the<00:02:19.959> pads<00:02:20.200> will<00:02:20.530> go<00:02:21.160> down<00:02:21.280> either<00:02:21.459> side<00:02:21.580> as

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
the pads will go down either side as

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.640 
the pads will go down either side as
long<00:02:22.000> as<00:02:22.120> doesn't<00:02:22.420> irritate<00:02:22.630> her<00:02:23.020> or

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
long as doesn't irritate her or

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.910 
long as doesn't irritate her or
exacerbate<00:02:24.280> your<00:02:24.640> your<00:02:25.560> painful<00:02:26.560> shoulder

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
exacerbate your your painful shoulder

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.580 
exacerbate your your painful shoulder
from<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.370> surgery<00:02:28.019> eventually<00:02:29.019> the<00:02:29.290> safety

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
from the surgery eventually the safety

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.170 
from the surgery eventually the safety
bar<00:02:29.739> is<00:02:29.890> a<00:02:29.920> good<00:02:30.099> option<00:02:30.280> that<00:02:30.550> way<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:31.060> don't

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
bar is a good option that way you don't

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.699 
bar is a good option that way you don't
have<00:02:31.209> to<00:02:31.330> really<00:02:31.569> if<00:02:32.140> you<00:02:32.290> don't<00:02:32.470> have<00:02:32.560> a<00:02:32.590> good

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
have to really if you don't have a good

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:33.990 
have to really if you don't have a good
range<00:02:32.860> of<00:02:32.980> motion<00:02:33.099> you're<00:02:33.340> not<00:02:33.459> but<00:02:33.580> reach<00:02:33.760> any

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
range of motion you're not but reach any

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.729 
range of motion you're not but reach any
far<00:02:34.209> there's<00:02:34.420> been<00:02:34.450> about<00:02:34.630> here<00:02:35.200> you<00:02:35.620> don't

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
far there's been about here you don't

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:36.870 
far there's been about here you don't
have<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:35.890> grab<00:02:36.099> a<00:02:36.130> bar<00:02:36.400> behind<00:02:36.550> your<00:02:36.760> back

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
have to grab a bar behind your back

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.670 
have to grab a bar behind your back
you're<00:02:37.060> not<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.269> support<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.840> load<00:02:38.110> on<00:02:38.319> your

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
you're not to support the load on your

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
you're not to support the load on your
shoulders<00:02:38.980> for<00:02:39.130> something<00:02:39.340> like<00:02:39.400> a<00:02:39.489> front

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
shoulders for something like a front

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.920 
shoulders for something like a front
squat<00:02:39.790> obviously<00:02:40.299> not<00:02:40.390> going<00:02:40.510> to<00:02:40.600> be<00:02:40.660> overhead

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
squat obviously not going to be overhead

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.690 
squat obviously not going to be overhead
squatting<00:02:41.350> so<00:02:41.830> a<00:02:41.860> safety<00:02:42.250> bar<00:02:42.370> is<00:02:42.459> a<00:02:42.489> great

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
squatting so a safety bar is a great

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.880 
squatting so a safety bar is a great
option<00:02:42.940> it<00:02:43.510> sits<00:02:43.720> on<00:02:43.900> your<00:02:43.989> shoulders<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:44.530> you

option it sits on your shoulders and you

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.289 
option it sits on your shoulders and you

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
don't have to even hold it off you don't

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.720 
don't have to even hold it off you don't
want<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.569> you<00:02:46.780> can<00:02:46.900> safety<00:02:47.230> bar<00:02:47.440> with<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.250> with

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
want to you can safety bar with a with

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.490 
want to you can safety bar with a with
your<00:02:48.850> arms<00:02:49.090> still<00:02:49.269> in<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.450> sling<00:02:49.720> if<00:02:50.350> it

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
your arms still in the sling if it

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.620 
your arms still in the sling if it
doesn't<00:02:50.769> exacerbate<00:02:51.400> any<00:02:51.610> any<00:02:52.030> pain<00:02:52.330> that<00:02:52.360> you

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
doesn't exacerbate any any pain that you

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.780 
doesn't exacerbate any any pain that you
already<00:02:52.750> have<00:02:53.019> so<00:02:53.860> that's<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.430> great<00:02:54.610> option

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
already have so that's a great option

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.100 
already have so that's a great option
until<00:02:55.120> you<00:02:55.360> get<00:02:55.510> all<00:02:55.630> your<00:02:55.660> range<00:02:55.930> of<00:02:56.049> motion

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
until you get all your range of motion

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.610 
until you get all your range of motion
back<00:02:56.410> first<00:02:57.040> starting<00:02:57.370> to<00:02:57.489> squat<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.930> if<00:02:59.530> you

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
back first starting to squat and if you

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.479 
back first starting to squat and if you
want<00:02:59.769> to<00:02:59.830> do<00:02:59.890> something<00:03:00.040> heavy<00:03:00.250> that's

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
want to do something heavy that's

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.030 
want to do something heavy that's
probably<00:03:00.880> your<00:03:01.360> best<00:03:01.569> bet<00:03:01.750> so<00:03:02.170> there's<00:03:02.769> a<00:03:02.830> few

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
probably your best bet so there's a few

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.160 
probably your best bet so there's a few
ideas<00:03:03.160> we<00:03:03.610> could<00:03:03.730> go<00:03:03.790> on<00:03:03.970> and<00:03:04.090> on<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.299> on<00:03:04.390> but

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
ideas we could go on and on and on but

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.750 
ideas we could go on and on and on but
we'll<00:03:05.799> cut<00:03:05.920> it<00:03:05.950> off<00:03:06.099> the<00:03:06.190> air<00:03:06.250> for<00:03:06.280> today<00:03:06.670> if

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
we'll cut it off the air for today if

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
we'll cut it off the air for today if
you<00:03:06.819> have<00:03:06.910> more<00:03:07.030> questions<00:03:07.090> about<00:03:07.569> how<00:03:07.720> to

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
you have more questions about how to

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.750 
you have more questions about how to
