00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:05.370
 we are on the beach of piÃ©manson 11km from salins de giraud we are 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.880
 in the park of camargue 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.690
 seven days a week the eco-guards as they are called are on tour for 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.940
 inform the beach is a wild camping place very popular with people 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.550
 from the magali vivien region which, since childhood, has made us free to 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.390
 sensors 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.660
 % still managed to keep because she is I assure you we are there 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.579
 for money 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.289
 to preserve what can be preserved in fact no harm in crystal and aso in 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.809
 I do not pay or we do not cheat we pay attention we are really there 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.180
 we like it and when we meet with friends 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.800
 this beach that drives us camping cars all vehicles are 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.969
 tolerated there are about 3000 caravans and motorhomes right now 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:49.829
 and several thousand people between the dunes weakened by everything 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:50.820
 passage 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.010
 and some forgotten garbage or improvised toilets 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.970
 when we tell them see your trash bag you do not have the case 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.980
 he dissolves him quite 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.450
 so that's what I mean it's won 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.680
 somewhere it's already stone that are for them to win 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.180
 but it must be repeated this task a project that is% repetitive it takes 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.980
 every time every time every morning it is necessary to say it must be ironed 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.470
 to go back and that's it's our mission in the main 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.040
 every day the ass dabo tour a few miles away another 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.229
 fragile space very busy 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.000
 holidaymakers come here to feel a taste of freedom there too 

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:32.770
 the spacers protect the camping vehicles tolerated 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.760
 it's the cord of dunes that you have in front of you 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.170
 to interest you in the grounds of cause heard toral 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.479
 when we have a management 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.479
 of all you have to watch his ratings 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.340
 for me it's just completely 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.990
 a good part 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.409
 in the offenses are very serious and ecogards calls for a 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.520
 Coast Guard has apparently taken to verbalize 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.830
 Fabien is also of the opinion that long-term awareness will 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:00.590
 its fruits 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.320
 but for now he finds that environmental offenses is a 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.300
 concept a little 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.900
 difficult to pass 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.110
 in France we have the impression that is happening on a strong sense 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:15.069
 two hours of press conference at the center of this new front in a 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.670
 space of freedom not very long anyway because of the short 

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:22.289
 I do not understand at all not to give up 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:25.659
 thousands of hectares and five mediators to raise awareness 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.419
 thousands of users it is little 

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:31.439
 but at the park how conservatory it is estimated that this is a start to make 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:32.079
 change practices
