00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
sides right after the speed arm I got

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.830 
sides right after the speed arm I got
two<00:02:12.540> point<00:02:12.780> two<00:02:12.959> six<00:02:13.140> units<00:02:13.740> called<00:02:14.310> TDI<00:02:14.840> for

is a really really fast computer even
though<00:02:23.819> it<00:02:23.970> certainly

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
though it certainly

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.420 
though it certainly
2.26<00:02:26.270> it<00:02:27.270> shuts<00:02:27.569> down<00:02:27.660> on<00:02:27.959> five<00:02:28.349> seconds<00:02:28.830> it's

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
2.26 it shuts down on five seconds it's

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.350 
2.26 it shuts down on five seconds it's
incredibly<00:02:30.270> fast<00:02:30.450> boot<00:02:30.900> up<00:02:31.080> time<00:02:31.319> and<00:02:32.090> yeah

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
incredibly fast boot up time and yeah

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.420 
incredibly fast boot up time and yeah
in<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.020> two<00:02:34.200> weeks<00:02:34.230> it<00:02:34.739> hasn't<00:02:35.040> gotten<00:02:35.220> any

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
in the two weeks it hasn't gotten any

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.880

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
slower some people say that it over time

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:46.039 
slower some people say that it over time
gets<00:02:38.160> slower<00:02:38.370> but<00:02:38.670> it's<00:02:39.660> exactly<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.140> same

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
the audio jack - two USB ports there

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.369 
the audio jack - two USB ports there
more<00:03:24.340> than<00:03:24.489> enough<00:03:24.670> me<00:03:24.909> I<00:03:25.209> don't<00:03:25.989> really<00:03:26.079> need

besides for like you know USB storage

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:35.609 
besides for like you know USB storage
but<00:03:29.470> yeah<00:03:30.510> Ethernet<00:03:31.510> and<00:03:32.250> display<00:03:33.250> ports
