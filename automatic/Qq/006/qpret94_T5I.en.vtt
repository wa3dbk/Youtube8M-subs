00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 what's up with friends eggs and their stefan 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.170
 welcome to another 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.730
 squad pictures yes friends today in advance must 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.440
 actually should say very short 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.360
 last line first league come today 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.250
 Will definitely be there tomorrow 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.509
 I could not pick up a video yesterday 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.830
 there were problems again but that 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.420
 I will then pack you in the next one 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.250
 explain the road to glory because he 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.779
 like that already recorded and 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.220
 then it's just this whole material 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.800
 packaged but that should not now 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.320
 be like he died today with 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.880
 a fancy team of five nations 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.279
 Of course there are four leagues again 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.800
 are freshman on kate start two in form 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.649
 also there when the rauslässt would 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.750
 you actually about 10,000 15,000 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.430
 so coins perhaps even 20,000 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.379
 it's actually quite cheap 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.570
 if you put the two in shape with it 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.920
 We are taking exactly 100,000 coins 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.480
 on both consoles 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.860
 but i have to say the inform sloane 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.780
 then in any case the 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.460
 striker at the central midfield 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.719
 you could possibly omit but that 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.610
 So you can go right now 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.800
 We start with the goalkeeper 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.230
 Here we have a Brazilian and 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.000
 though julio cesar i have to say for the 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.690
 82er rating he has really good 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.880
 like 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.369
 great positional game otherwise too 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.900
 really strong reflexes as the only one say 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.210
 I can not tee off so well and 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.460
 ball safety but that is of course there 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.049
 I'll never say that again 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.030
 let's go with the right-back here 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.350
 we have a turntable on the same 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.810
 the other side but still the two 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.630
 single or player else we have 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.210
 All that player is Raphael and 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.189
 the costs I think so 1000 coins and 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.890
 It really would have been a great player 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.650
 not thought that goes off like that 83er 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.329
 otherwise everything from fit up to speed 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.040
 Of course, physically does not have to be like that now 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.689
 strong but right-back we can 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.000
 there again a bit out of consideration 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.549
 let us like strong values 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.460
 I'm really good the left-back 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.270
 a Turk and that is the rg of 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.970
 fenerbahce 82 has been fast in terms of things 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.799
 otherwise simply bombastic values 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.329
 who shoot no hot free kicks though 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.680
 that made me another but 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.600
 I once scored a with which 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.130
 otherwise look at these values 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.930
 have that for a new player has there 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.299
 I really like it 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.979
 really good with the whole better 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.750
 keep up and then come directly 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.430
 for internal defense here we have 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.430
 two brazilians 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.349
 the first one is our friend 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.239
 We already had a spot 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.379
 Will he still believe I'm an informer? 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.819
 Of course you can also find the in 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.890
 mold but I had your goal so 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.780
 Somehow, somehow, it tries to do that 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.239
 Make sure that looks reasonably good 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.099
 from all the cards and soja naldo 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.420
 an outstanding man for the price can 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.280
 we do not do anything wrong there 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.709
 Go away to the second defender 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.299
 Here we are in his colleague 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.480
 Schalke 04 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.219
 santa ana 80s tempo defense too 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.780
 pretty strong is so great 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:43.670
 So good for the head 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.319
 Home defense all gave friends 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.010
 at that time ready for you in the central 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.109
 midfield 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.689
 Here we have the first and that is 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:52.489
 ramsey of arsenal london in 83 of the 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:53.930
 overall rating has one for me 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.000
 horny longchamp from ghana since me 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.650
 was not thought final 78 okay 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.519
 you can already suspect a few but that 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.769
 it has on it 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.569
 but really everything can be forward 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.090
 can work backwards if I have 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.769
 also heike trades so that possible 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.079
 perfect for the central midfield 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.000
 Let's continue with our first in shape 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.950
 that's wild cherry I have in again 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.659
 form brought there is just right 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.980
 I want to try it out 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:18.530
 moment we can meet so to 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.209
 70,000 80,000 already coins 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.129
 little something was worth but the need 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.629
 You can not do that right now either 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.760
 like to shape the nun and I believe that 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.690
 costs only 3000 so you have to yes 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.159
 and we were pretty good too 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.840
 fallen is a similar type of player 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:31.459
 how would I say brake and now 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.949
 let's get to another player type 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.060
 and here we have diego of 

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:37.010
 fenerbahce 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.199
 but here we have two defensive sag 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.639
 I really really hard 

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:42.169
 can answer and yes actually one 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.239
 playmaker who can horny passports 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:45.889
 can initiate the front here with nice 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.449
 Feeding horny passports and he has me 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:48.979
 really liked, of course, a 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:50.840
 awesome triple an awesome matching game and 

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:53.090
 pace of 75 is not too bad either 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.680
 then we go with our left 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.040
 striker here we have a left 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:01.019
 flügelflitzer and that is where is 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.879
 your mother because 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:06.129
 we have your brother 91 tempo four 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:08.049
 star sg star weak foot moments 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.969
 and makes four star pregnant foot 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:12.040
 So it was really awesome 

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:14.019
 goes off like a suppository I plug 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.000
 you an entrepreneur is allowed to go like lutz 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.870
 So you friends are really good at that too 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.699
 only thing he can not do it 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.620
 defend but that is not at all 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:22.000
 important can fit for the position he 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.830
 can shoot, he actually quite 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.539
 had a good graduation for me yes and 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.060
 then it went on to the right wing 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.919
 or to the right striker us 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.070
 Here we have a really fast one 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:35.139
 me but more link from liverpool 93 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.610
 Tempo friends of the skin here again 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.530
 a shovel on it always quickly 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.210
 at the is just so outstanding again 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.099
 thus, a good pace pulls good ones 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.960
 friends so that has me too outstanding 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:45.460
 like 84 dribbling what do you want 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.410
 more four stars it goes on of course 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.030
 start and then we can also go directly to 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.849
 us and striker that's like you all 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.520
 Muscle is probably already burma 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:57.699
 from galatasaray 84s pace otherwise 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.590
 really good shot of 83 72 successful 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.940
 Feet of 82 also has so he is 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.070
 actually such a real mix 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.560
 thoroughbred striker good graduation 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.150
 Then I'll say dribbelstark 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.409
 okay, maybe you can do it three times 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.580
 sternen there it goes but he has to make 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:11.650
 just the pace 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.729
 He has the body and can resist it 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.860
 very many defenders 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:16.060
 yes friends enforce that was it then 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.050
 as far as the script images here 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.340
 sees at the end now still a few scenes 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.960
 if you like it of course 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.639
 Of course, thumbs were free upwards 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.460
 an otherwise important tomorrow's 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:26.500
 continue with lätz green first league 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.150
 or last linden tenth 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.990
 league as well as he never know yes friends that 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.159
 was so far from me 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.159
 pure and pure
