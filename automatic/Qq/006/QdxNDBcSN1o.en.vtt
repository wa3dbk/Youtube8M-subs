interesting fast forwarding to nightfall
we<00:04:11.440> can<00:04:11.470> see<00:04:11.740> Freddie<00:04:12.040> is<00:04:12.220> more<00:04:12.460> active<00:04:12.790> than

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
we can see Freddie is more active than

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.270 
we can see Freddie is more active than

to<00:04:19.450> possess<00:04:19.570> so<00:04:20.350> would<00:04:20.530> it<00:04:20.620> be<00:04:20.650> safe<00:04:20.920> to<00:04:20.950> say

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
to possess so would it be safe to say

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.800 
to possess so would it be safe to say
that<00:04:21.310> the<00:04:21.640> puppet<00:04:21.850> resides<00:04:22.300> in<00:04:22.510> the<00:04:22.630> five

we do not truly know the answer there is
