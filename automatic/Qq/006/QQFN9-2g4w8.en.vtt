00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
tool loops well you know with modern

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.670 
tool loops well you know with modern
tools<00:00:23.820> they've<00:00:24.300> got<00:00:24.480> pretty<00:00:24.689> small<00:00:25.019> heads<00:00:25.289> so

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
tools they've got pretty small heads so

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.519 
tools they've got pretty small heads so
tulips<00:00:26.369> don't<00:00:26.640> always<00:00:26.820> work<00:00:27.210> what<00:00:28.140> we've<00:00:28.289> done

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
tulips don't always work what we've done

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.620 
tulips don't always work what we've done
is<00:00:28.769> developed<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.250> new<00:00:29.369> system<00:00:29.820> that's<00:00:30.060> quite

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
is developed a new system that's quite

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.359 
is developed a new system that's quite
different<00:00:30.990> than<00:00:31.260> everybody<00:00:31.590> else's<00:00:32.099> in<00:00:32.279> a

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
different than everybody else's in a

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.430 
different than everybody else's in a
couple<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.759> ways<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.719> I'll<00:00:33.930> just<00:00:34.140> show<00:00:34.410> you

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
couple of ways and I'll just show you

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.270 
couple of ways and I'll just show you
one<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.950> ways<00:00:35.070> right<00:00:35.820> now<00:00:36.440> the<00:00:37.440> fabric<00:00:37.950> is

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
one of the ways right now the fabric is

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.130 
one of the ways right now the fabric is
not<00:00:38.579> attached<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.239> buckle<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.840> so<00:00:40.050> you

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
not attached to the buckle and so you

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.680 
not attached to the buckle and so you
get<00:00:40.260> an<00:00:40.350> extra<00:00:40.469> degree<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:40.950> freedom<00:00:41.690> because

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
get an extra degree of freedom because

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.569 
get an extra degree of freedom because
then<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.290> can<00:00:43.440> do<00:00:43.590> what<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:43.860> need<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.340> with

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
then you can do what you need to with

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.569 
then you can do what you need to with
the<00:00:44.760> buckle<00:00:45.120> for<00:00:45.360> example<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.960> just<00:00:46.829> wrap<00:00:47.250> this

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
the buckle for example I just wrap this

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.450 
the buckle for example I just wrap this
around<00:00:48.170> because<00:00:49.170> I'm<00:00:49.320> scared<00:00:49.710> because<00:00:50.100> here

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
around because I'm scared because here

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.639 
around because I'm scared because here

where the degrees of freedom come into

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.520 
where the degrees of freedom come into
play<00:01:41.700> again<00:01:42.950> because<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.909> tool<00:01:45.320> holster<00:01:46.320> is

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530

whooping<00:03:51.249> dog<00:03:51.430> woven<00:03:51.819> regular<00:03:52.420> 30<00:03:52.719> liter<00:03:52.959> or

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
whooping dog woven regular 30 liter or

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.910 
whooping dog woven regular 30 liter or
for<00:03:54.340> that<00:03:54.430> matter<00:03:55.170> it's<00:03:56.170> basically<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.739> same

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
for that matter it's basically the same

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.959 
for that matter it's basically the same
thing<00:03:57.219> here<00:03:57.519> with<00:03:57.579> a<00:03:57.670> 45<00:03:58.239> with<00:03:58.950> one<00:03:59.950> caveat<00:04:00.219> if

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:00.969 
thing here with a 45 with one caveat if

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:04.830 
thing here with a 45 with one caveat if
you<00:04:01.120> want<00:04:01.299> to<00:04:01.389> do<00:04:01.510> with<00:04:01.689> 45<00:04:02.200> with<00:04:03.329> just<00:04:04.329> a<00:04:04.480> strap

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
you want to do with 45 with just a strap

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.559 
you want to do with 45 with just a strap
you<00:04:05.170> could<00:04:05.590> do<00:04:05.739> that<00:04:05.889> too<00:04:06.189> because<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.329> 30

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
you could do that too because the 30

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.589 
you could do that too because the 30
liter<00:04:07.810> is<00:04:07.959> so<00:04:08.139> small<00:04:08.620> it's<00:04:09.459> a<00:04:09.519> lot<00:04:09.700> easier<00:04:10.200> to

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
liter is so small it's a lot easier to

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.170 
liter is so small it's a lot easier to
