00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.990
 hello everyone is sacha 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.809
 hi to all and mathis is holding today 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.699
 we end up for a tutorial a tutorial 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.640
 how to make a passage in minecraft 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.140
 so can minecraft well why because 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.029
 we do not have a network in minecraft 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.039
 can even with the new modification 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.260
 we still do not have good I find it a 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.849
 little boring but hey we'll do with when 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.489
 even then we will present you with 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.620
 secret passages business to achieve 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.000
 very simply and then it's not very 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.739
 expensive so it's convenient for survival 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.739
 so that's it looking for all pointed the 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.170
 first down so the first one then 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.750
 it's very simple so there you see it 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.489
 is in a living room a small living room and there 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.610
 hop we have a painting we pass in 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.840
 and there we can not upstream a 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:58.140
 little secret passage really not seeing 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.530
 it's nice enough to make twelve 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.030
 hardship 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.100
 we will have to put signs in 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.480
 done on the sides and after to put 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.170
 of time trying to make you I'm going 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.950
 show you 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.060
 I'll take a picture once 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.280
 to click on it 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.890
 but you're open but sonisphere 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.150
 the other side we have to find the right 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.580
 after that takes a doctorate in threat 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.710
 noisy so that's how we go 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.790
 you click on the side of the panel 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.130
 because otherwise it will not work if you 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.830
 click on the hero so today we 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.320
 you presented two types finally 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.420
 represented 2 secret passages are only 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.840
 not very showy that this second 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.880
 that one is enough but it is less 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.990
 known but I find very well too 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.570
 good here in a living room 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.710
 a modern living room I even like that 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.110
 do I think it does not fit so 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.119
 knowing that the bar yeah we are good 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.119
 taste a kid su 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.270
 1 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:59.200
 we are then we arrive in the room 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:02:00.700
 chests indeed we were presented 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.320
 two secret passages after if you 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.610
 do you want to go on the internet 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.679
 possible it's really one of the 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.939
 best we found without redstone 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.349
 I specify because it's enough 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.750
 complicated to find things without 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.709
 redstone so that's it you'll have 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.709
 more rain deficit
