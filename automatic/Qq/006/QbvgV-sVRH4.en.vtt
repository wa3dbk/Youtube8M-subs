apples<00:00:30.840> next<00:00:31.109> big<00:00:31.260> thing<00:00:32.239> I<00:00:33.239> seriously<00:00:33.960> doubt

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
apples next big thing I seriously doubt

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.549 
apples next big thing I seriously doubt
that<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.770> exact<00:00:35.370> iteration<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.630> going<00:00:37.440> to

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
that this exact iteration is going to

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.299 
that this exact iteration is going to
make<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.219> cutie<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.270> store<00:00:39.809> shelves<00:00:40.309> we

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
make it to a cutie in store shelves we

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.900 
make it to a cutie in store shelves we
may<00:00:41.489> see<00:00:41.960> facets<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.320> perhaps<00:00:44.129> but<00:00:44.399> it's<00:00:44.789> a

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
may see facets of it perhaps but it's a

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.970 
may see facets of it perhaps but it's a
really<00:00:45.120> radical<00:00:45.390> design<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:45.930> mean<00:00:46.289> you've<00:00:46.710> got

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
really radical design I mean you've got

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.930 
really radical design I mean you've got
a<00:00:47.940> full<00:00:48.899> wraparound<00:00:49.320> display<00:00:51.800> flexible

a full wraparound display flexible
flexible<00:00:53.940> parts<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:55.100> lot<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.430> lot<00:00:56.550> of

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
flexible parts a lot of a lot of

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.400 
flexible parts a lot of a lot of
different<00:00:56.730> things<00:00:57.059> going<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.379> know

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
different things going on that you know

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.220 
different things going on that you know
technology<00:00:59.070> right<00:00:59.520> now<00:00:59.730> I<00:01:00.149> don't<00:01:00.329> think<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:01.050> at

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
technology right now I don't think is at

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.219 
technology right now I don't think is at
the<00:01:01.379> point<00:01:01.590> where<00:01:01.980> Apple<00:01:02.850> can<00:01:03.229> realistically

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
the point where Apple can realistically

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.160 
the point where Apple can realistically
rule<00:01:04.619> something<00:01:04.949> out<00:01:05.720> you<00:01:06.720> know<00:01:06.810> within<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
rule something out you know within the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.580 
rule something out you know within the
next<00:01:07.760> six<00:01:08.760> months<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.270> year<00:01:09.299> but<00:01:10.110> um<00:01:10.290> but

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
next six months a year but um but

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.940 
next six months a year but um but
definitely<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:12.119> know<00:01:12.240> parts<00:01:13.200> are<00:01:13.380> going<00:01:13.650> to

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
definitely you know parts are going to

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.120 
definitely you know parts are going to
make<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.430> think<00:01:15.170> well<00:01:16.170> John<00:01:16.439> that's<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.040> good
