00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 beautiful all the guys here orgasms that 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.759
 I'm here to welcome you in this 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.059
 new series on my channel that will cover 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.130
 the potential transfers of fifa 15 mi 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.559
 I'll explain better then I 'll explain 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.710
 how this series will be structured 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.480
 so in this period many are both 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.400
 in Italy, however, the British 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.800
 they are doing prediction videos 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.650
 I always had always wanted to do 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.320
 from the beginning of this of fifa 14 I wanted 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.730
 do the prediction of fifa 15 however the 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.859
 what can't be done because anyway 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.600
 that is, it could be done, however, then the thing 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.969
 it would be boring because they are 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.200
 doing practically everyone then I have 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.670
 decided to do something a little more 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.640
 original that here in Italian stands 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.489
 making nobody that is to speak 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.160
 of the market forecasts that is of the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.700
 potential transfers of some 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.309
 players in other teams so that 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.050
 so can we say the new card 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.809
 concerning the new team in which the 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.609
 player then will move mica said 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.050
 which will however transfer us anyway 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.809
 we will talk so as to speak even a little 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.339
 of the real football market and discuss 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.110
 also some of the paper that will come later 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.540
 out in fifa 15 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.580
 I hope you like the idea because 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.830
 at least in something different than 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.290
 what everyone is doing a little bit 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.720
 I hope to give you the best quality e 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.130
 professionalism possible while you can 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.740
 note the graphics that it really is 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.979
 splendid made by sfax 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.619
 the spaak graphic I invite you all for 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.049
 thank you achieve perhaps on 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.270
 facebook or twitter to follow it 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.460
 because he is really very good at it 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.049
 to a casino and I think there isn't a 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.590
 best thanks if not this i 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.689
 links of his of all that of everything 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.880
 You can find facebook and twitter of course 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.100
 in description, however, the series will be 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.409
 formed we say each episode will have three 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.360
 players we will discuss and the first one 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.340
 player we 're going to go to 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.610
 talk today it's about hads 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.990
 rodriguez is a fancy triggers of the monk 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.810
 so here you can see the map of 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.890
 fifa 14 with his is obviously a 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.429
 player who this year has played 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.920
 a phenomenal phenomenal season both 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:12.390
 in the league doing anyway different 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:16.180
 goals and many assists that in the world 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:19.150
 although I don't know how much it may vary 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.730
 the world can influence your card 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.290
 however , in any case, you are scoring six goals 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.319
 therefore being the top scorer of the 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.599
 worldwide there is a real interest 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.910
 very strong on the part of the blancos of the 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:33.370
 real madrid that as we know they do not have 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.989
 no money problem since 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.130
 they collect so much money that they do 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.750
 they can even come out of the ass and talk 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.480
 precisely of a transfer to the real 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:47.440
 madrid of ames rodriguez for about 85 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.120
 million 70 million cash and 15 million euro 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.190
 casemiro card maybe a little 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.780
 casemiro rating too high 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.350
 however, for what concerns me 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.959
 this is the card that would come out 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.769
 in fifa 15 the card of rodriguez of 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.139
 real Madrid 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.299
 meanwhile we see we can see the 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:06.430
 beauty of the fifa 15 card that 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.440
 obviously only a prediction, however, like 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.030
 I really like design 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.579
 much much more beautiful than that 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.150
 by fifa 14 also made by spaak 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:18.130
 and let's talk a little about the variations of the 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.940
 parameters of speed shooting etcetera 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.980
 etc 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.569
 we note a sharp increase in speed 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.650
 which I think is there because it is a 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.829
 player who has proven to be 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.959
 quite fast and above all we can 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.660
 also note a change in role 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.370
 because he originally to of al 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.989
 monaco, however, I played often and 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.680
 gladly like cc then like 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:41.109
 playmaker and probably will come out 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.670
 obviously it will go to the real madrid but 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:46.269
 however, the next card certainly 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.560
 will coc will come out point coc shot 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.450
 obviously it has to be 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.519
 the increase only for the goal he did 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.680
 at the world championship, the beautiful one on the fly 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.900
 left and could not not 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.250
 as the shot does not even pass 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.049
 because anyway an assist man 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.480
 absurd makes a casino of assis this year 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:04.390
 he made type 13 and then dribbled 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.060
 oh well dutiful defense does not vary because 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.650
 however a role in which the defense does not 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.810
 counts practically nothing but maybe 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.189
 maybe it could even lessen 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.219
 head increased by one so a little 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:16.449
 random we go instead to see the 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:17.949
 second player 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.810
 the second player is 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:22.449
 alessio cerci alessio cerci is a 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.810
 player on the mouth of let's say many 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:29.139
 but above all the teams here milan 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:32.410
 let's talk a little bit about milan then look for it 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:34.509
 an assessment of around 18 million 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.830
 the turin so evaluates a player 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:37.840
 which in any case played a very good one 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.979
 season scoring so much also doing 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:45.070
 many assists play in 4 3 3 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:47.530
 he basically role he will use 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.509
 also inzaghi in the new milan so yes 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.220
 think some may be a 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:53.440
 player that can be adapted 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.080
 very well to this role 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.800
 let's go immediately to see the fifa card 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.590
 so there is a really well made card 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:06.849
 in my opinion is much in my opi 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:10.030
 look for an increase of 2 in overall duty 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:12.430
 as a name that is a variation of the 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.849
 role because attention if it went to 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:18.060
 Milan will probably go to Milan 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:20.349
 the card in version a of will be released 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.240
 otherwise it could also exit deeds 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:24.430
 as a second striker because he has anyway 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.770
 it is not even known how it is played in Turin 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.539
 it then depends on the team in which it is 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.009
 will transfer cerci 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:31.180
 we notice a speed increase because 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:33.039
 however proved to be a 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.690
 really fast player 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:36.789
 an increase in shooting because it is a duty done 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.650
 to have so many goals this year passes 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:42.370
 also it is the same for the assists 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:44.460
 dribbling and defense that is dribbling 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.840
 which increases by a defense point than 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.300
 decreases by two precisely because with 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.060
 this more offensive role change 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.639
 serves little compared to the right outside 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.229
 the defense as well as the blow 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:58.930
 of head 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:01.830
 let's go to galliani i think i'm there 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.430
 knowing Gallians will want to tear it up for 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.230
 certainly 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.390
 a lower figure than the 18 that 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.740
 asks the Turin anyway we go with the 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.800
 third and last player of this 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.270
 episode it is arturo vidal 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.000
 player on the mouth too many 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.680
 multi-billion dollar teams as per 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.750
 example manchester united and real 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.730
 madrid is spoken here however exclusively 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.200
 of manchester united because perhaps the 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.540
 team most interested in the player 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.760
 Chilean juventus player who 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:30.760
 will probably move though 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:33.550
 in the last few days there are some doubts 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.980
 especially marotta to work if you keep it 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.620
 narrow and those who do not would vote closely 

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:40.600
 however vidal is a player who plays 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.240
 always good there is no need to talk 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.700
 of vidal because we know all the 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:48.250
 its evaluation rather the offer it is 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:50.710
 was made by manchester united e 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:53.080
 about 40 million euros a figure 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:56.170
 really important very high 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:59.230
 this is the vidal card to the united 

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:00.790
 an 87 of or therefore an increase of 1 

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.730
 all over all 

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:06.400
 and to an increase in all its stars 

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:07.390
 speed plus 1 shot plus two whys 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.770
 however a player who scores 

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:11.350
 so much to be a midfielder 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:13.030
 that is defends great that attacks 

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:15.750
 all the better 

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:18.430
 an increase in passing an increase of 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:20.020
 dribbling defense plus two and shots of 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.610
 there are two because he did anyway 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.070
 also a few goals from the head gives you then 

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:27.100
 I think if you deserve it anyway 

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:30.060
 prediction were these here I do not have 

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:32.620
 then nothing else to add I think 

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.480
 let me know in the comments if this 

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.370
 series if you liked this episode 

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.290
 because I will wait to do if not episode 

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:42.970
 I'd like to see what you think first 

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:46.360
 you of this series so I will continue if 

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:47.440
 we tell you like it here I invite you as 

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.690
 I usually like to leave a nice one 

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:52.590
 300 boys I like a new one will come out 

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:54.490
 video that will then think of the silver slip 

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:56.170
 over leave a comment maybe 

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:58.030
 advise me of the players to do in the 

00:07:56.170 --> 00:08:00.550
 next episode if you like the series
