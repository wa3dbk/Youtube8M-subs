00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.530 
then makes it drop in very easily
there's<00:03:11.650> no<00:03:11.709> resistance<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.579> attach<00:03:13.030> it<00:03:13.269> and

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
there's no resistance to attach it and

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.000 
there's no resistance to attach it and
then<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:13.780> get<00:03:13.870> that<00:03:13.989> nice<00:03:14.230> Ottoman<00:03:14.680> click<00:03:14.889> to

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
then you get that nice Ottoman click to

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.099 
then you get that nice Ottoman click to
know<00:03:15.130> that<00:03:15.310> you're<00:03:15.489> good<00:03:16.060> to<00:03:16.180> go<00:03:16.209> integrated

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
know that you're good to go integrated

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:20.039 
know that you're good to go integrated
unit<00:03:17.410> so<00:03:17.739> with<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.459> batteries<00:03:18.880> on<00:03:19.180> both<00:03:19.810> sides

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
unit so with the batteries on both sides

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.509 
unit so with the batteries on both sides
it's<00:03:20.230> also<00:03:20.350> great<00:03:20.709> because<00:03:20.859> now<00:03:21.100> I<00:03:21.160> can<00:03:21.400> be

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
it's also great because now I can be

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.940 
it's also great because now I can be
productive<00:03:21.819> say<00:03:22.630> I'm<00:03:22.780> typing<00:03:23.500> away<00:03:23.709> for<00:03:23.920> a

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
productive say I'm typing away for a

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.099 
productive say I'm typing away for a
couple<00:03:24.099> hours<00:03:24.370> and<00:03:25.239> then<00:03:25.420> I<00:03:25.510> decide<00:03:25.810> I<00:03:25.840> maybe

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
couple hours and then I decide I maybe

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:27.479 
couple hours and then I decide I maybe
want<00:03:26.380> to<00:03:26.440> go<00:03:26.500> down<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.769> street<00:03:26.980> to<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.220> to<00:03:27.400> the

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
want to go down the street to the to the

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.729 
want to go down the street to the to the
coffee<00:03:27.670> shop<00:03:27.790> it<00:03:28.569> drains<00:03:29.109> the<00:03:29.230> battery<00:03:29.410> in<00:03:29.709> the

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
coffee shop it drains the battery in the

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.830 
coffee shop it drains the battery in the
base<00:03:29.950> first<00:03:30.280> before<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:31.090> battery<00:03:31.480> and<00:03:31.720> the

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
base first before the battery and the

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.089 
base first before the battery and the
tablets<00:03:32.260> and<00:03:32.319> now<00:03:32.440> I'm<00:03:32.500> still<00:03:32.709> got<00:03:32.829> a<00:03:32.859> fully

great battery life and it's gonna allow
you<00:04:01.730> then<00:04:02.030> that<00:04:02.210> nice<00:04:03.130> sleek<00:04:04.130> slim<00:04:04.910> fanless

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
you then that nice sleek slim fanless

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.720 
you then that nice sleek slim fanless
design<00:04:06.260> that<00:04:06.560> everybody's<00:04:07.280> wanting<00:04:07.550> in<00:04:07.640> their

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
design that everybody's wanting in their

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.460 
design that everybody's wanting in their
tablets<00:04:08.150> and<00:04:08.540> then<00:04:08.780> it<00:04:08.930> also<00:04:09.050> has<00:04:09.230> two

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
tablets and then it also has two

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.530 
tablets and then it also has two
gigabytes<00:04:09.620> of<00:04:10.040> RAM<00:04:10.280> okay<00:04:10.910> and<00:04:11.120> that<00:04:11.210> we<00:04:11.330> think

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
gigabytes of RAM okay and that we think

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.760 
gigabytes of RAM okay and that we think
that's<00:04:11.660> good<00:04:11.870> to<00:04:12.020> run<00:04:12.170> all<00:04:12.320> your<00:04:12.440> basic

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
that's good to run all your basic

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.290 
that's good to run all your basic
Windows<00:04:13.010> apps<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:13.520> then<00:04:13.910> in<00:04:14.030> terms<00:04:14.180> of

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
Windows apps and then in terms of

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.420 
Windows apps and then in terms of
storage<00:04:14.690> what<00:04:14.960> we<00:04:15.050> did<00:04:15.200> was<00:04:15.410> since<00:04:16.100> this<00:04:16.310> is

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
storage what we did was since this is

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.920 
storage what we did was since this is
really<00:04:16.670> meant<00:04:16.820> to<00:04:16.880> be<00:04:16.970> a<00:04:17.030> notebook<00:04:17.329> that<00:04:17.540> can

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
really meant to be a notebook that can

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.960 
really meant to be a notebook that can
also<00:04:18.049> be<00:04:18.290> a<00:04:18.320> tablet<00:04:18.769> it<00:04:18.950> has<00:04:18.980> 64<00:04:19.579> gigs<00:04:19.790> of

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
also be a tablet it has 64 gigs of

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.300 
also be a tablet it has 64 gigs of
storage<00:04:20.060> built<00:04:20.600> in<00:04:20.810> standard<00:04:21.470> and<00:04:21.739> then<00:04:22.190> if

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
storage built in standard and then if

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.740 
storage built in standard and then if
you<00:04:22.400> want<00:04:22.580> to<00:04:22.670> expand<00:04:23.090> that<00:04:23.120> you<00:04:23.510> can<00:04:23.630> actually

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
you want to expand that you can actually

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.420 
you want to expand that you can actually
do<00:04:23.960> that<00:04:24.050> one<00:04:24.230> of<00:04:24.320> two<00:04:24.470> ways<00:04:24.590> you've<00:04:25.250> got<00:04:25.400> a

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
do that one of two ways you've got a

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.850 
do that one of two ways you've got a
standard<00:04:25.910> SD<00:04:26.120> card<00:04:26.510> slot<00:04:26.750> right<00:04:26.780> here<00:04:26.990> on<00:04:27.380> the

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
standard SD card slot right here on the

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.100 
standard SD card slot right here on the
side<00:04:28.070> so<00:04:28.400> you<00:04:28.430> can<00:04:28.610> expand<00:04:28.970> it<00:04:29.090> in<00:04:29.180> the<00:04:29.270> base<00:04:29.450> or

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
side so you can expand it in the base or

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.900 
side so you can expand it in the base or
if<00:04:30.590> you<00:04:30.710> want<00:04:30.860> to<00:04:30.920> have<00:04:31.010> expansion<00:04:31.550> ready<00:04:31.760> to

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
if you want to have expansion ready to

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.730 
if you want to have expansion ready to
go<00:04:32.000> anywhere<00:04:32.360> you<00:04:32.420> want<00:04:32.510> to<00:04:32.870> you've<00:04:33.410> got<00:04:33.560> right

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
go anywhere you want to you've got right

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.140 
go anywhere you want to you've got right
here<00:04:33.770> it's<00:04:34.250> hard<00:04:34.430> to<00:04:34.520> see<00:04:34.670> but<00:04:34.850> if<00:04:34.940> we've<00:04:35.030> got<00:04:35.120> a

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
here it's hard to see but if we've got a

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.820 
here it's hard to see but if we've got a
teeny<00:04:35.450> little<00:04:35.570> micro<00:04:36.080> SD<00:04:36.380> card<00:04:36.590> slot<00:04:36.800> right

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
teeny little micro SD card slot right

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.310 
teeny little micro SD card slot right
here<00:04:37.130> so<00:04:37.280> you<00:04:37.400> also<00:04:37.700> put<00:04:38.570> it<00:04:38.660> in<00:04:38.690> the<00:04:38.810> micro<00:04:39.080> SD
