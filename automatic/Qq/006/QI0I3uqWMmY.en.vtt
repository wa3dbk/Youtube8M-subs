00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.960 
just runs so smooth and there really
aren't<00:02:06.690> any<00:02:06.870> issues<00:02:07.380> with<00:02:07.530> how<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.830> looks<00:02:07.970> now

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
aren't any issues with how it looks now

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.360 
aren't any issues with how it looks now
going<00:02:09.239> back<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.840> bed<00:02:10.019> company<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.739> field

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
going back to bed company to the field

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.550 
going back to bed company to the field
of<00:02:11.519> view<00:02:11.670> is<00:02:11.849> really<00:02:12.299> low<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:12.510> it's<00:02:12.959> very<00:02:13.260> hard

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
of view is really low and it's very hard

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.960 
of view is really low and it's very hard
to<00:02:13.590> get<00:02:13.799> used<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:14.129> looking<00:02:14.250> at<00:02:14.519> a<00:02:14.549> game<00:02:14.790> like

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
to get used to looking at a game like

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.809 
to get used to looking at a game like
that<00:02:15.209> now<00:02:16.080> if<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.379> started<00:02:16.830> on<00:02:16.950> bad<00:02:17.220> company<00:02:17.400> 2

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
that now if you started on bad company 2

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.030 
that now if you started on bad company 2
you<00:02:18.000> can<00:02:18.180> probably<00:02:18.450> play<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:19.019> non-stop<00:02:19.470> but<00:02:19.890> as

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
you can probably play it non-stop but as

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.589 
you can probably play it non-stop but as
for<00:02:20.310> me<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.459> don't<00:02:20.790> really<00:02:20.940> like<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.420> too<00:02:21.569> much

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
for me I don't really like it too much

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.140 
for me I don't really like it too much
now<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.530> mean<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:22.830> gameplay<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.370> very<00:02:23.459> solid

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
now I mean the gameplay is very solid

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.360 
now I mean the gameplay is very solid
and<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.780> destruction<00:02:25.170> is<00:02:25.440> probably<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:26.069> best

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
and the destruction is probably the best

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.490 
and the destruction is probably the best
I've<00:02:26.580> seen<00:02:26.610> in<00:02:26.909> a<00:02:27.150> battlefield<00:02:27.480> title<00:02:28.019> but

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
I've seen in a battlefield title but

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.740 
I've seen in a battlefield title but
again<00:02:28.709> it's<00:02:28.920> just<00:02:29.190> not<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.519> game<00:02:29.670> for<00:02:29.940> me<00:02:30.090> so

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
again it's just not the game for me so

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.050 
again it's just not the game for me so
if<00:02:30.989> dice<00:02:31.290> were<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.799> make<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:31.950> bad<00:02:32.310> company<00:02:32.760> 3

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
if dice were to make a bad company 3

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.210 
if dice were to make a bad company 3
game<00:02:33.269> I'd<00:02:33.510> buy<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:33.840> nonetheless<00:02:34.170> but<00:02:34.830> i<00:02:34.860> really

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
game I'd buy it nonetheless but i really

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.550 
game I'd buy it nonetheless but i really
liked<00:02:35.430> some<00:02:35.640> changes<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.090> be<00:02:36.299> made<00:02:36.349> first<00:02:37.349> off

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
liked some changes to be made first off

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.170 
liked some changes to be made first off
I'd<00:02:37.739> like<00:02:37.769> a<00:02:37.950> field<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.549> view<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:38.969> how<00:02:39.120> that

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
I'd like a field of view and how that

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.030 
I'd like a field of view and how that
works<00:02:39.389> too<00:02:39.930> kind<00:02:40.109> of<00:02:40.200> function<00:02:40.560> like<00:02:40.739> it<00:02:40.889> did

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
works too kind of function like it did

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.740 
works too kind of function like it did
in<00:02:41.069> battlefield

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
in battlefield

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.260 
in battlefield
three<00:02:42.020> or<00:02:42.230> battlefield<00:02:42.620> 4<00:02:43.130> now<00:02:43.790> I<00:02:43.820> think<00:02:43.910> those

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
three or battlefield 4 now I think those

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.790 
three or battlefield 4 now I think those
two<00:02:44.300> games<00:02:44.600> have<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.020> best<00:02:45.260> field<00:02:45.560> of<00:02:45.710> view

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
two games have the best field of view

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.350 
two games have the best field of view
settings<00:02:46.070> that<00:02:46.400> allow<00:02:46.520> you<00:02:46.700> a<00:02:46.880> lot<00:02:47.210> of

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
settings that allow you a lot of

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.600 
settings that allow you a lot of
customization<00:02:47.810> now<00:02:48.800> I<00:02:48.830> just<00:02:48.920> can't<00:02:49.340> stand

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
customization now I just can't stand

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.190 
customization now I just can't stand
playing<00:02:49.940> on<00:02:50.090> like<00:02:50.240> 80<00:02:50.450> field<00:02:50.780> of<00:02:50.900> view<00:02:51.020> because

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
playing on like 80 field of view because

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.080 
playing on like 80 field of view because
the<00:02:51.440> gun<00:02:51.650> is<00:02:51.680> huge<00:02:52.160> and<00:02:52.310> I<00:02:52.400> can't<00:02:52.670> see<00:02:52.850> a<00:02:52.880> lot<00:02:53.060> of

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
the gun is huge and I can't see a lot of

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.090 
the gun is huge and I can't see a lot of
my<00:02:53.240> screen<00:02:53.570> but<00:02:54.170> say<00:02:54.380> they<00:02:54.560> bumped<00:02:54.860> it<00:02:54.950> up<00:02:55.040> to

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
my screen but say they bumped it up to

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.340 
my screen but say they bumped it up to
how<00:02:55.400> it<00:02:55.550> is<00:02:55.670> in<00:02:55.850> battlefield<00:02:56.300> 4<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.900> max<00:02:57.140> would

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
how it is in battlefield 4 the max would

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.080 
how it is in battlefield 4 the max would
be<00:02:57.470> like<00:02:57.620> 120<00:02:58.250> or<00:02:58.370> something<00:02:58.640> along<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:58.940> lines

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
of that now for me that is a major

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.890 
of that now for me that is a major

3's<00:03:32.780> was<00:03:32.989> a<00:03:33.020> lot<00:03:33.290> better<00:03:33.530> than<00:03:33.770> BF<00:03:33.950> fours<00:03:34.400> but

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
3's was a lot better than BF fours but

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.430 
3's was a lot better than BF fours but
it<00:03:34.910> definitely<00:03:35.090> needs<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.720> same<00:03:35.989> funny

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
they are a prequel and sequel to one

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.660 
they are a prequel and sequel to one
another<00:03:41.870> this<00:03:42.410> is<00:03:42.590> easy<00:03:42.830> just<00:03:42.950> get<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.400> same

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
team that wrote bad company 2 story line

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.650 
team that wrote bad company 2 story line
and<00:03:46.100> have<00:03:46.280> them<00:03:46.310> write<00:03:46.670> bad<00:03:46.820> company<00:03:47.269> three's

and have them write bad company three's
now<00:03:48.530> I<00:03:48.560> think<00:03:48.890> that<00:03:49.010> is<00:03:49.130> one<00:03:49.310> of<00:03:49.340> the<00:03:49.430> main

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
now I think that is one of the main

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.400 
now I think that is one of the main
reasons<00:03:50.120> why<00:03:50.360> battlefield<00:03:50.930> 3<00:03:51.200> and

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
reasons why battlefield 3 and

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.410 
reasons why battlefield 3 and
battlefield<00:03:51.860> 4<00:03:52.100> were<00:03:52.340> kind<00:03:52.580> of<00:03:52.700> average<00:03:52.850> games

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
battlefield 4 were kind of average games

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.390 
battlefield 4 were kind of average games
people<00:03:54.049> kill<00:03:54.290> for<00:03:54.350> those<00:03:54.650> long<00:03:54.920> lasting

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
people kill for those long lasting

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.490 
people kill for those long lasting
campaigns<00:03:55.940> they<00:03:56.180> can<00:03:56.360> just<00:03:56.570> sit<00:03:56.810> and<00:03:56.840> play<00:03:57.230> for

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
campaigns they can just sit and play for

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.070 
campaigns they can just sit and play for
hours<00:03:57.769> on<00:03:57.890> end<00:03:57.950> now<00:03:58.910> I<00:03:58.940> can<00:03:59.269> definitely<00:03:59.570> relate

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
hours on end now I can definitely relate

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.440 
hours on end now I can definitely relate
to<00:04:00.410> this<00:04:00.560> since<00:04:00.950> I<00:04:01.130> played<00:04:01.190> the<00:04:01.580> entire<00:04:01.970> metro

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
to this since I played the entire metro

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.140 
to this since I played the entire metro
2033<00:04:02.709> single<00:04:03.709> player<00:04:03.890> through<00:04:04.310> in<00:04:04.519> a<00:04:04.610> day<00:04:04.640> I

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
2033 single player through in a day I

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.060 
2033 single player through in a day I
think<00:04:05.780> dice<00:04:05.959> is<00:04:06.170> trying<00:04:06.440> to<00:04:06.530> focus<00:04:06.680> all<00:04:07.010> of

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
think dice is trying to focus all of

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.039 
think dice is trying to focus all of
their<00:04:07.250> time<00:04:07.400> and<00:04:07.850> energy<00:04:08.150> on<00:04:08.420> multiplayer

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
their time and energy on multiplayer

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:10.720 
their time and energy on multiplayer
while<00:04:09.440> there<00:04:09.620> still<00:04:09.709> are<00:04:10.100> a<00:04:10.130> lot<00:04:10.459> of<00:04:10.489> those

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
while there still are a lot of those

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.000 
while there still are a lot of those
veteran<00:04:11.239> battlefield<00:04:11.720> players<00:04:12.049> that<00:04:12.799> love

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
veteran battlefield players that love

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.590 
veteran battlefield players that love
playing<00:04:13.220> the<00:04:13.430> campaign<00:04:13.640> and<00:04:14.209> missed<00:04:14.450> the

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
playing the campaign and missed the

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.180 
playing the campaign and missed the
campaign<00:04:15.019> because<00:04:15.230> it<00:04:15.500> really<00:04:15.709> isn't<00:04:15.980> a

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
campaign because it really isn't a

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.759 
campaign because it really isn't a
single<00:04:16.459> player<00:04:16.790> story<00:04:17.180> anymore<00:04:17.600> like<00:04:18.410> seven

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
single player story anymore like seven

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.440 
single player story anymore like seven
missions<00:04:18.950> is<00:04:19.280> not<00:04:19.489> a<00:04:19.519> campaign<00:04:20.180> a

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
missions is not a campaign a

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.420 
missions is not a campaign a
well-thought<00:04:21.109> single-player<00:04:21.739> story<00:04:21.769> that<00:04:22.340> is

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
well-thought single-player story that is

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.640 
well-thought single-player story that is
actually<00:04:22.820> good<00:04:23.060> is<00:04:23.330> about<00:04:23.570> 10<00:04:23.870> hours<00:04:24.110> of<00:04:24.410> play

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
actually good is about 10 hours of play

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.830 
actually good is about 10 hours of play
time<00:04:24.680> now<00:04:25.550> I<00:04:25.610> think<00:04:25.729> that's<00:04:26.060> why<00:04:26.240> people<00:04:26.270> loved

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
time now I think that's why people loved

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.750 
time now I think that's why people loved
bad<00:04:27.080> company<00:04:27.470> 2<00:04:27.680> so<00:04:27.890> much<00:04:28.070> at<00:04:28.250> an<00:04:28.490> awesome
