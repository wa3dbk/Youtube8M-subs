00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello friends my name is maxim 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.250
 good and we continue to broadcast with 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.860
 exhibition mvc 2014 that in barcelona 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.929
 it ate background and no matter how it does not seem 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.219
 just a new brand but also a new one 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.100
 operating system 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.380
 sailfish is built on linux base with 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.900
 Fedor and this logical continuation and with 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.130
 mega and and with mine 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.769
 Naturally the phone is interesting before 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.300
 just how it works and is managed by him 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.730
 no action buttons needed 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.500
 occur thanks to the gesture for 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.430
 Yolo needs to unlock twice 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.079
 tap the screen 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.149
 and in order to disable and 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.219
 block need to hold from the top 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.110
 edge to bottom when unblocking 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.700
 lock screen is initially shown 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.469
 if vertical flipping then further 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.450
 there will be a multitasking window which 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.820
 reminds more ubuntu touch than 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.680
 megu they are all this 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.930
 installed applications management 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.670
 unusual but there is another cool and 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.680
 principle handy thing switching 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.079
 modes for this you need to return to 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.270
 top screen lockscreen us here 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.850
 whether we bet right or left and will 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.979
 modes let's know sound loud and so 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.540
 then these modes at one time and with 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.760
 sound related to wallpaper 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.750
 you can at least 20 of these making expose 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.090
 customization 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.460
 viola ff he is generally a special feature 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.950
 associated with these modes on the phone 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.380
 replaceable panel to let's say it now stands 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.600
 simple blue panel let's change 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.640
 and instead put a redhead in this 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.619
 The panels are firstly wireless 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.990
 charging standard than a second 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.810
 installed nfc chip with your data 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.549
 then immediately changed the mode let's say 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.860
 if you put a brand socket here 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.140
 Engry Birds then the application is automatic 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.329
 download all angry birds for free 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.820
 And now imagine how many such panels 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.530
 maybe with what functions of course 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.180
 all this will not be free but how 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.310
 it is interesting here a lot of others 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.409
 capabilities let's say developers 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.630
 such open is available if the application 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.030
 hanging in multitasking they can 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.979
 you can manage without going into it like this 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.810
 flipping music or pause 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.909
 And in the application of SMS if you hold 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.840
 a new dialog opens from right to left 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.030
 window 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.219
 to go back you need to do 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.119
 swipe from left to right is not a thing for you 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.970
 comfortable 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.160
 and the idea is unusual but with unusual here 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.170
 not all have every sentence 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.940
 your settings if android is needed 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.459
 press a special button for this in 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.620
 in the form of three points and at samsung lg from in general 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.360
 separate button here it is 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.670
 implemented even more brilliant 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.010
 you just need in any application and even 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.930
 Here on lokskrine pull down and from above 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.180
 a list of available settings will open 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.590
 By the way, you probably noticed that the axis 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.989
 almost fully translated into Russian 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.060
 his language is perfectly calm 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.519
 put the developers settings 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.110
 selfish for all those who are young belt 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.420
 won't like cooked 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.180
 specially a surprise she supports 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.370
 android application all here even index 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.110
 top is set by default and if 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.239
 make a little fact about will rise and 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.489
 google play can be set which 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.769
 please application from any program to 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.530
 Games are important to the power of the phone 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.269
 missed himself yav love he has the following 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.670
 dual-core snapdragon specifications 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.940
 400 display by 45 inches with resolution 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.970
 960 by 540 points 1 gigabyte operational 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.549
 memory and 16 gigabytes of built-in 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.170
 adreno 305 and really cool what with 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.019
 such weak system characteristics 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.120
 this phone works perfect autumn 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.670
 All is not and the smoothness of the interface is amazing 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.889
 I think selfish has a future. 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.840
 beautiful and comfortable we will manage 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:28.040
 hope that she will not be allowed to die than 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.040
 more choice the better
