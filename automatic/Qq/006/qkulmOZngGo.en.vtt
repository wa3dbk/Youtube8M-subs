even<00:02:05.860> then<00:02:05.980> I<00:02:06.010> knew<00:02:06.430> that<00:02:06.640> we<00:02:06.790> only<00:02:06.880> needed<00:02:07.090> one

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
even then I knew that we only needed one

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
wicket and new batsman coming in were

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.200 
wicket and new batsman coming in were
going<00:02:09.040> down<00:02:09.190> to<00:02:09.220> all<00:02:09.429> sorts<00:02:09.670> of<00:02:09.730> pressure<00:02:09.940> a

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
going down to all sorts of pressure a

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.820 
going down to all sorts of pressure a
job<00:02:10.810> that<00:02:10.960> Andrew<00:02:11.200> Symonds<00:02:11.590> did<00:02:11.680> with<00:02:11.770> the

job that Andrew Symonds did with the

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.760 
job that Andrew Symonds did with the
ball<00:02:11.980> today<00:02:12.220> was<00:02:12.430> was<00:02:12.700> amazing<00:02:13.660> for<00:02:13.840> us<00:02:13.960> and<00:02:14.140> we

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
ball today was was amazing for us and we

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.350 
ball today was was amazing for us and we
tried<00:02:15.010> every<00:02:15.310> option<00:02:15.340> towards<00:02:15.940> in<00:02:16.030> there<00:02:16.240> and

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
tried every option towards in there and

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.480 
tried every option towards in there and
I<00:02:16.420> bought<00:02:16.630> all<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:17.050> quicks<00:02:17.290> back<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:17.740> they

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
I bought all the quicks back and they

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.070 
I bought all the quicks back and they
were<00:02:18.610> probably<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:19.060> little<00:02:19.360> bit<00:02:19.570> less

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
were probably a little bit less

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.080 
were probably a little bit less
effective<00:02:20.500> in<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.680> spinners<00:02:21.010> were<00:02:21.130> so<00:02:21.400> last

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
effective in the spinners were so last

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.610 
effective in the spinners were so last

more widgets and runs just going done

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.410 
more widgets and runs just going done
but<00:02:26.980> here<00:02:27.610> look<00:02:27.760> I've<00:02:27.910> been<00:02:28.060> asked<00:02:28.240> and

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
but here look I've been asked and

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.940 
but here look I've been asked and
funneled<00:02:28.780> 88<00:02:29.080> of<00:02:29.170> all<00:02:29.290> before<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.680> game<00:02:29.830> the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
funneled 88 of all before the game the

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.310 
funneled 88 of all before the game the
chance<00:02:30.190> so<00:02:30.400> obviously<00:02:30.910> again<00:02:31.180> a<00:02:31.450> lot<00:02:32.080> of<00:02:32.170> ass

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
chance so obviously again a lot of ass

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.910 
chance so obviously again a lot of ass
but<00:02:32.650> I'm<00:02:33.100> certainly<00:02:33.430> taking<00:02:33.790> it<00:02:34.920> three

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
but I'm certainly taking it three

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.949 
but I'm certainly taking it three
wickets<00:02:36.250> in<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.790> last<00:02:37.000> one<00:02:37.209> turned<00:02:37.720> out<00:02:37.780> to<00:02:37.870> be

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
wickets in the last one turned out to be

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.750 
wickets in the last one turned out to be
the<00:02:38.050> last<00:02:38.200> over<00:02:38.470> but<00:02:38.770> did<00:02:39.220> you<00:02:39.340> think<00:02:39.489> when<00:02:39.640> you

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
the last over but did you think when you

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.920 
the last over but did you think when you
came<00:02:40.000> on<00:02:40.030> that<00:02:40.300> you<00:02:40.390> could<00:02:40.510> still<00:02:40.690> win<00:02:40.780> the

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
came on that you could still win the

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.590 
came on that you could still win the
game<00:02:41.489> honestly<00:02:42.489> not<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.730> chance<00:02:43.030> in<00:02:43.180> hell<00:02:43.330> and<00:02:43.510> I

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
game honestly not a chance in hell and I

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.699 
game honestly not a chance in hell and I
think<00:02:43.810> that's<00:02:43.930> why<00:02:44.050> partly<00:02:44.350> through<00:02:44.440> middle

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
think that's why partly through middle

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.470 
think that's why partly through middle
ball<00:02:44.830> that<00:02:45.010> was<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.220> real<00:02:45.790> classical
