Center<00:00:19.800> Wisconsin<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.849> we're<00:00:21.000> at<00:00:21.060> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
Center Wisconsin and we're at the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.609 
Center Wisconsin and we're at the
research<00:00:21.450> facility<00:00:21.480> today<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.410> we're<00:00:22.500> going

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
research facility today and we're going

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.560 
research facility today and we're going
to<00:00:22.680> talk<00:00:22.860> about<00:00:23.009> proper<00:00:23.700> missing<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.240> gopher

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
to talk about proper missing a gopher

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.820 
to talk about proper missing a gopher
Glaser<00:00:25.610> let<00:00:26.610> me<00:00:26.700> just<00:00:26.910> start<00:00:27.090> by<00:00:27.240> saying<00:00:27.450> that

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
Glaser let me just start by saying that

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.740 
Glaser let me just start by saying that
mixing<00:00:28.830> milk<00:00:29.070> replacer<00:00:29.369> on<00:00:29.609> farms<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.269> unique

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
mixing milk replacer on farms is unique

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.240 
mixing milk replacer on farms is unique
because<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.320> depends<00:00:31.740> on<00:00:31.800> how<00:00:31.949> you're<00:00:32.129> going

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
because it depends on how you're going

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.560 
because it depends on how you're going
to<00:00:32.340> feed<00:00:32.519> it<00:00:32.669> what<00:00:32.820> equipment<00:00:33.269> that<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.540> have

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
to feed it what equipment that you have

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.840 
to feed it what equipment that you have
facilities<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.129> have<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.519> number<00:00:35.760> of

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
facilities that you have the number of

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.369 
facilities that you have the number of
calves<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.330> you're<00:00:36.420> going<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.629> feed<00:00:36.840> are<00:00:37.199> you

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
calves and you're going to feed are you

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:38.689 
calves and you're going to feed are you
going<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.559> feed<00:00:37.710> nipple<00:00:38.040> bottles<00:00:38.460> you're

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
going to feed nipple bottles you're

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:40.670 
going to feed nipple bottles you're
going<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.910> feed<00:00:39.059> open<00:00:39.390> pails<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:40.350> all<00:00:40.440> those

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
going to feed open pails so all those

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.340 
going to feed open pails so all those
things<00:00:40.890> factor<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:41.690> mixing<00:00:42.690> limper<00:00:42.989> placer

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
things factor in mixing limper placer

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.780 
things factor in mixing limper placer
and<00:00:43.589> we<00:00:43.830> need<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.040> make<00:00:44.220> sure<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.550> we<00:00:44.670> get

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
and we need to make sure that we get

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.610 
and we need to make sure that we get
done<00:00:45.000> we<00:00:45.600> don't<00:00:45.750> replace<00:00:45.930> or<00:00:46.140> mixed<00:00:46.350> properly

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
done we don't replace or mixed properly

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.319 
done we don't replace or mixed properly
so<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.160> calves<00:00:47.399> can<00:00:47.610> have<00:00:47.850> proper

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
so that the calves can have proper

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.270 
so that the calves can have proper
nutrition<00:00:48.540> at<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.290> research<00:00:49.590> facility<00:00:49.620> we

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
nutrition at the research facility we

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.790 
nutrition at the research facility we
have<00:00:50.399> two<00:00:50.610> pads<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.270> house<00:00:51.480> 72<00:00:52.050> calves<00:00:52.440> each

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
have two pads that house 72 calves each

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.830 
have two pads that house 72 calves each
and<00:00:53.129> for<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.789> most<00:00:53.969> part<00:00:54.239> we<00:00:54.360> use<00:00:54.510> are<00:00:54.660> trying

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
and for the most part we use are trying

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.180 
and for the most part we use are trying
to<00:00:54.899> get<00:00:55.020> at<00:00:55.110> least<00:00:55.140> three<00:00:55.320> treatments<00:00:55.950> per

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
to get at least three treatments per

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.639 
to get at least three treatments per
test<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.570> we'll<00:00:57.870> be<00:00:57.960> making<00:00:58.260> three<00:00:58.469> different

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
test so we'll be making three different

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.170 
test so we'll be making three different
mixes<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.340> today<00:00:59.610> we're<00:00:59.879> going<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.059> make<00:01:00.149> a

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
mixes and today we're going to make a

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.260 
mixes and today we're going to make a
mix<00:01:00.449> for<00:01:01.110> 24<00:01:01.559> cans<00:01:01.920> we'll<00:01:02.699> show<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:02.969> how<00:01:03.090> we

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
mix for 24 cans we'll show you how we

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.270 
mix for 24 cans we'll show you how we
make<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.809> mix<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.589> how<00:01:04.680> we<00:01:04.739> make<00:01:05.039> sure<00:01:05.250> that

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
make that mix and how we make sure that

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.950 
make that mix and how we make sure that
it's<00:01:05.789> mixed<00:01:06.090> properly

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.070 

you<00:01:09.590> mix<00:01:10.130> milk<00:01:10.580> replacer<00:01:11.060> two<00:01:11.600> things<00:01:11.870> that

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
you mix milk replacer two things that

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.740 
you mix milk replacer two things that
need<00:01:12.110> to<00:01:12.380> be<00:01:12.440> taken<00:01:13.220> in<00:01:13.340> consideration<00:01:13.750> every

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
need to be taken in consideration every

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.300 
need to be taken in consideration every
manufacturer<00:01:15.590> has<00:01:15.800> a<00:01:15.860> different

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
manufacturer has a different

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.850 
manufacturer has a different
manufacturing<00:01:17.060> process<00:01:17.570> so<00:01:17.810> their<00:01:18.350> product

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
manufacturing process so their product

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.560 
manufacturing process so their product
is<00:01:18.980> going<00:01:19.160> to<00:01:19.220> be<00:01:19.340> different<00:01:19.940> than<00:01:20.360> other

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
is going to be different than other

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.650 
is going to be different than other
people's<00:01:21.020> so<00:01:21.640> when<00:01:22.640> you<00:01:22.760> mix<00:01:22.940> milk<00:01:23.210> replacer

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
people's so when you mix milk replacer

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.140 
people's so when you mix milk replacer
use<00:01:23.870> the<00:01:24.080> cups<00:01:24.350> that<00:01:24.560> they<00:01:24.770> supply<00:01:25.160> and<00:01:25.670> the

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
use the cups that they supply and the

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.840 
use the cups that they supply and the
measurements<00:01:26.660> that<00:01:26.780> they<00:01:26.930> supply<00:01:27.550> and<00:01:28.550> do<00:01:28.760> it

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
measurements that they supply and do it

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.820 
measurements that they supply and do it
to<00:01:28.970> their<00:01:29.119> directions<00:01:29.690> because<00:01:30.350> you<00:01:30.590> want<00:01:30.770> to

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
to their directions because you want to

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.320 
to their directions because you want to
do<00:01:30.920> it<00:01:31.010> consistently<00:01:31.610> and<00:01:31.729> you<00:01:31.970> want<00:01:32.150> that

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
do it consistently and you want that

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.750 
do it consistently and you want that
that<00:01:32.720> particular<00:01:32.869> product<00:01:33.350> to<00:01:33.560> perform<00:01:34.010> it's

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
that particular product to perform it's

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.420 
that particular product to perform it's
always<00:01:35.270> best<00:01:35.570> to<00:01:35.720> weigh<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.350> product<00:01:36.830> don't

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
always best to weigh the product don't

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.830 
always best to weigh the product don't
just<00:01:37.670> guess<00:01:37.880> that<00:01:37.910> it's<00:01:38.210> eight<00:01:38.330> ounces<00:01:38.690> or

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
just guess that it's eight ounces or

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.150 
just guess that it's eight ounces or
towels<00:01:39.080> is<00:01:39.410> depending<00:01:39.740> on<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:39.920> number<00:01:40.130> of

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
towels is depending on the number of

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.070 
towels is depending on the number of
camps<00:01:40.640> so<00:01:41.030> we<00:01:41.149> always<00:01:41.390> weigh<00:01:41.720> the<00:01:41.930> Miller

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
camps so we always weigh the Miller

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.650 
camps so we always weigh the Miller
patient<00:01:42.530> before<00:01:42.830> we<00:01:43.360> put<00:01:44.360> it<00:01:44.450> in<00:01:44.710> also<00:01:46.660> because

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
patient before we put it in also because

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.389 
patient before we put it in also because
fat<00:01:47.960> has<00:01:48.200> a<00:01:48.229> melting<00:01:48.560> point<00:01:48.619> somewhere<00:01:49.310> around

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
fat has a melting point somewhere around

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.490 
fat has a melting point somewhere around
90<00:01:49.729> degrees<00:01:49.850> we<00:01:50.690> got<00:01:50.840> to<00:01:50.930> make<00:01:50.990> sure<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.290> water

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
90 degrees we got to make sure the water

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.620 
90 degrees we got to make sure the water
is<00:01:51.649> well<00:01:52.100> above<00:01:52.430> that<00:01:52.460> so<00:01:53.090> that<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:53.300> milk<00:01:53.450> goes

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
is well above that so that the milk goes

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:07.389 
is well above that so that the milk goes
into<00:01:53.840> solution

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.760 

spending<00:02:08.399> ten<00:02:08.700> ounces<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.179> camps<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.750> 24<00:02:10.229> camps

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
spending ten ounces of camps of 24 camps

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.100 
spending ten ounces of camps of 24 camps
about<00:02:11.670> 15<00:02:12.150> pounds<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.660> we<00:02:12.720> laid<00:02:12.900> out<00:02:13.080> the

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
about 15 pounds and we laid out the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.170 
about 15 pounds and we laid out the
power<00:02:13.980> people<00:02:14.640> go<00:02:14.970> into<00:02:15.330> these<00:02:16.880> 2<00:02:17.880> quart

power people go into these 2 quart
bottle<00:02:18.510> tears<00:02:18.810> we<00:02:18.930> like<00:02:19.110> that<00:02:19.350> at<00:02:19.470> the

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
bottle tears we like that at the

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.810 
bottle tears we like that at the
research<00:02:19.770> farm<00:02:20.130> bottles<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:20.760> nipples

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
research farm bottles and nipples

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.120 
research farm bottles and nipples
because<00:02:21.480> we<00:02:21.780> can<00:02:21.930> actually<00:02:22.260> measure<00:02:22.470> exactly

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
because we can actually measure exactly

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.490 
because we can actually measure exactly
how<00:02:23.310> much<00:02:23.459> motivation<00:02:23.970> each<00:02:24.270> calf<00:02:24.570> gets<00:02:24.900> will

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
how much motivation each calf gets will

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.560 
how much motivation each calf gets will
put<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:25.860> 24<00:02:26.340> out<00:02:26.520> we'll<00:02:26.820> take<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.180> off<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.450> the

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
put the 24 out we'll take it off to the

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.630 
put the 24 out we'll take it off to the
hutches<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.140> we'll<00:02:28.230> feed<00:02:28.410> each<00:02:28.560> calf<00:02:28.830> if<00:02:29.520> the

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
hutches and we'll feed each calf if the

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.000 
hutches and we'll feed each calf if the
calf<00:02:29.850> refuses<00:02:30.239> to<00:02:30.600> drink<00:02:30.840> all<00:02:31.020> of<00:02:31.050> it<00:02:31.290> we<00:02:31.770> bring

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
calf refuses to drink all of it we bring

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.470 
calf refuses to drink all of it we bring
that<00:02:32.190> back<00:02:32.250> in<00:02:32.640> we<00:02:32.790> measure<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.239> amount<00:02:33.420> of

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
that back in we measure the amount of

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.479 
that back in we measure the amount of
milk<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:33.750> he<00:02:33.840> doesn't<00:02:34.170> drink<00:02:34.320> so<00:02:34.920> this<00:02:35.370> is

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
milk that he doesn't drink so this is

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:36.800 
milk that he doesn't drink so this is
how<00:02:35.610> we<00:02:35.670> do<00:02:35.880> things<00:02:35.910> at<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.570> research

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
how we do things at the research

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.710 
how we do things at the research
facility<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.739> this<00:02:37.890> milk<00:02:38.160> is<00:02:38.430> ready<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:39.600> be

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
facility so this milk is ready to to be

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.360 
facility so this milk is ready to to be
fed

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.300

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
we've run tests at eight ounces we've

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.210 
we've run tests at eight ounces we've
run<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:17.540> tests<00:03:17.750> at<00:03:17.959> ten<00:03:18.170> ounces<00:03:18.530> but<00:03:19.040> this
