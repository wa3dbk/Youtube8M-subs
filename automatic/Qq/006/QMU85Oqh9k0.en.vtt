00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.630
 Well, that's thinner 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.629
 born now we 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.830
 play in the world of tanks 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:19.020
 charging tablet by the way 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:22.640
 and about three hours 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.640
 from 0 to 100 percent 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.280
 if you remember how a couple of years ago on may 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.230
 a year ago 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:36.510
 the chinese started using advertising 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:40.130
 posters on tablets 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:45.360
 world of tanks but then he has not yet a show 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:52.070
 Now, as you can see the world of tanks 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.070
 goes on the tablet it's actually a drag 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:59.010
 see how it goes just 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.579
 fine now let's go into settings i 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.739
 show you what are the settings here 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.720
 the settings are modest of course 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.399
 minimal 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:16.770
 but no less so show resolution 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:20.509
 1280 by 800 points here in principle 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:25.560
 nothing else is all turned off 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:29.100
 smoothing stuff like that further more 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.640
 detailed as you can see are minimal 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.660
 extra effects settings only 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:40.470
 slightly raised the rest at a minimum 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:47.720
 everything is at a minimum well and dynamic 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.720
 change and quality of effects is worth it 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:56.100
 that is, the minimum settings for those 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:00.720
 less as you can see the game works and 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:06.240
 working just let's see 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:09.320
 try to run a ride on my 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.320
 beloved christmas tree 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:17.040
 Well, of course the tree is not my favorite 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:19.380
 she is one of my favorites one of my favorites 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.660
 tanks I love all tanks except 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.120
 artillery 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:29.640
 as developers who are from artillery 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:36.019
 did not understand that but the tree is one of 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:40.280
 the most interesting of such unusual tanks 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.280
 here comes the download 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:49.200
 as always, the tree is at the bottom 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:53.950
 firefly tables 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:03:00.330
 smartly look 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:09.700
 hours frames about 20 fps 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:13.920
 nevertheless the lessons are quite quite 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:17.489
 real chased 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.489
 just another 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:27.470
 I do not know what I can do, I think 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.410
 the boss will be fast as the tree is enough 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.890
 on one hit 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:36.580
 let's try out a dowry 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.580
 devote 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.400
 birds 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:51.420
 picture spotted a run they also have 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:55.110
 find out 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.110
 reach new iphone 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:12.220
 those who could 22 frames of secular face of course 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:15.209
 not a fountain but to play fashionable 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:18.570
 it seemed fantastic 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:22.930
 finally became a reality 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:29.200
 banks work on the key and so after all 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:31.810
 covered remember this is not a video broadcast 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:38.470
 This is me playing with the mouse to 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:42.690
 which are connected to the tablet tank 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.690
 installed on external hard drives 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:51.600
 can continue to go to the memory card 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:56.919
 I did not say anything to write down 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:05:00.550
 copied but the winchester is so fast so 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:09.090
 something they don’t kill me for a while i'm not 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:09.090
 so I caught it 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:22.229
 , the sound I brought the office with the principle here 

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:25.709
 such a layout, see what graphics 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:30.719
 my speed tankers 

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:35.489
 You can safely take or as a gift tanker 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:41.469
 that is, if a child likes hair tanks 

00:05:35.489 --> 00:05:46.959
 not bad and I’ll say it before 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:50.559
 I played one fight on the Christmas tree and got 

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:53.129
 master and destroyed there almost dry 

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:53.129
 won 

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:59.639
 so play more than possible on 

00:05:58.299 --> 00:06:04.799
 this tablet 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:10.439
 Here are the things here I will try to remove 

00:06:04.799 --> 00:06:10.439
