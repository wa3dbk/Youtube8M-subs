where you can shut the gate and it

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.510 
where you can shut the gate and it
actually<00:00:42.629> acts<00:00:43.320> as<00:00:43.620> if<00:00:43.829> it's<00:00:44.010> like<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.190> prison

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
actually acts as if it's like a prison

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.819 
actually acts as if it's like a prison
and<00:00:44.879> they<00:00:45.210> can't<00:00:45.480> really<00:00:45.660> get<00:00:45.780> out<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.170> that's

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
and they can't really get out and that's

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.740 
and they can't really get out and that's
a<00:00:47.010> cool<00:00:47.129> thing<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.370> implement<00:00:47.820> too<00:00:48.030> along<00:00:48.719> with

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
look like guys but here are some

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.830 
look like guys but here are some
examples<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.309> what<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.640> may<00:01:05.939> look<00:01:06.180> like<00:01:06.240> these

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
examples of what it may look like these

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.480 
examples of what it may look like these
are<00:01:07.020> some<00:01:07.170> ideas<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.010> dev<00:01:08.250> team

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
are some ideas that the dev team

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.490 
are some ideas that the dev team
throughout<00:01:08.909> on<00:01:09.210> Twitter<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:10.229> kind<00:01:10.439> of

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
throughout on Twitter so this kind of

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.530 
throughout on Twitter so this kind of
gives<00:01:10.680> us<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.920> little<00:01:11.130> idea<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.820> what<00:01:11.909> they've

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
gives us a little idea of what they've

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.260 
gives us a little idea of what they've
been<00:01:12.810> thinking<00:01:13.140> about<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.650> what<00:01:14.189> maybe<00:01:14.580> to

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
been thinking about and what maybe to

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.520 
been thinking about and what maybe to
come<00:01:15.509> here<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.900> game<00:01:16.080> but<00:01:16.200> like<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.470> said

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
come here in the game but like I said

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.429 
come here in the game but like I said
this<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.040> crafted<00:01:17.790> armor<00:01:18.210> first<00:01:18.689> pass<00:01:18.990> so

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
this is the crafted armor first pass so

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.570 
this is the crafted armor first pass so
I'm<00:01:19.530> sure<00:01:19.740> they're<00:01:19.890> gonna<00:01:19.979> be<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.430> know

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
I'm sure they're gonna be you know

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.969 
I'm sure they're gonna be you know
implementing<00:01:21.540> new<00:01:21.570> armor<00:01:22.200> as<00:01:22.380> well<00:01:22.799> as

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
implementing new armor as well as

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.440 
implementing new armor as well as
probably<00:01:23.250> changing<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.790> up<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.970> little<00:01:24.119> bit<00:01:24.299> and

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
probably changing it up a little bit and

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.810 
probably changing it up a little bit and
adding<00:01:25.020> new<00:01:25.170> armor<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.710> future<00:01:26.340> but

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
adding new armor in the future but

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.370 
adding new armor in the future but
moving<00:01:27.210> on<00:01:27.330> guys<00:01:27.540> they<00:01:27.720> have<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.900> grouping

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
moving on guys they have a grouping

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.410 
moving on guys they have a grouping
system<00:01:28.799> now<00:01:28.979> which<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.520> already<00:01:29.820> thought<00:01:30.210> they

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
system now which I already thought they

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.749 
system now which I already thought they
had<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> grouping<00:01:30.990> system<00:01:31.439> as<00:01:31.590> far<00:01:31.770> as<00:01:31.890> /<00:01:32.250> squad

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
had a grouping system as far as / squad

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.700 
had a grouping system as far as / squad
invite<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.570> then<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.720> can<00:01:33.869> invite<00:01:34.560> your
