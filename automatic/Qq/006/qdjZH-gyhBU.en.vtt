just<00:00:38.730> pause<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:38.969> where<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.360> need<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:40.550> here<00:00:41.550> we

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
just pause it where you need to here we

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.540 
just pause it where you need to here we
have<00:00:41.850> more<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.300> write<00:00:42.510> up<00:00:42.690> about<00:00:42.840> both<00:00:43.739> TPU

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
have more of a write up about both TPU

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.389 
have more of a write up about both TPU
and<00:00:45.980> EPU<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:48.000> basically<00:00:48.960> TPU<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.920> the

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
from there you can see a heatsink

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.340 
from there you can see a heatsink
this<00:04:10.980> is<00:04:11.130> calling<00:04:11.519> the<00:04:11.700> Intel<00:04:12.239> zd68<00:04:12.870> chip

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
this is calling the Intel zd68 chip

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.000 
this is calling the Intel zd68 chip
Center<00:04:13.970> now<00:04:14.970> for<00:04:15.239> a<00:04:15.269> look<00:04:15.420> at<00:04:15.570> the<00:04:15.660> CPU<00:04:16.260> socket

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
Center now for a look at the CPU socket

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.779 
Center now for a look at the CPU socket
so<00:04:17.850> this<00:04:18.060> is<00:04:18.209> sup<00:04:18.419> at<00:04:18.539> 1155<00:04:19.440> this<00:04:20.430> motherboard

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
so this is sup at 1155 this motherboard

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:24.830 
so this is sup at 1155 this motherboard
has<00:04:21.239> a<00:04:21.539> 4<00:04:21.900> +<00:04:22.169> 2<00:04:22.470> phase<00:04:22.770> power<00:04:23.160> design<00:04:23.780> so<00:04:24.780> you

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
has a 4 + 2 phase power design so you

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.200 
has a 4 + 2 phase power design so you
can<00:04:25.020> see<00:04:25.260> it<00:04:25.380> has<00:04:25.590> a<00:04:25.860> small<00:04:26.550> muffs<00:04:26.910> that

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
can see it has a small muffs that

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.840 
can see it has a small muffs that
heatsink<00:04:27.949> looking<00:04:28.949> at<00:04:29.039> this<00:04:29.160> heatsink<00:04:29.699> from

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
heatsink looking at this heatsink from

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.100 
heatsink looking at this heatsink from
the<00:04:29.970> side<00:04:30.210> you<00:04:30.419> can<00:04:30.449> see<00:04:30.780> that<00:04:30.960> it's

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
the side you can see that it's

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.290 
the side you can see that it's
low-profile<00:04:31.919> so<00:04:32.160> CPU<00:04:32.940> cool<00:04:33.180> the

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
low-profile so CPU cool the

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.960 
low-profile so CPU cool the
compatibility<00:04:33.840> won't<00:04:34.320> be<00:04:34.470> a<00:04:34.500> problem<00:04:34.759> now<00:04:35.759> for

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
compatibility won't be a problem now for

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.010 
compatibility won't be a problem now for

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
a look at the backside of the

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.320 
a look at the backside of the
motherboard<00:04:37.440> so<00:04:38.100> you<00:04:38.160> can<00:04:38.340> see<00:04:38.580> that<00:04:38.759> the<00:04:38.970> mop

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
motherboard so you can see that the mop

there's<00:05:30.990> also<00:05:31.320> 8<00:05:31.740> mid<00:05:32.280> board<00:05:32.520> USB<00:05:33.210> 2<00:05:33.419> ports<00:05:33.840> so

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
there's also 8 mid board USB 2 ports so

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.460 
there's also 8 mid board USB 2 ports so
this<00:05:34.680> motherboard<00:05:35.159> has<00:05:35.310> a<00:05:35.370> total<00:05:35.820> of<00:05:35.940> 12<00:05:36.419> USB<00:05:37.260> 2

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
this motherboard has a total of 12 USB 2

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.830 
this motherboard has a total of 12 USB 2
ports<00:05:37.919> then<00:05:38.789> we<00:05:38.940> have<00:05:39.090> the<00:05:39.210> 8<00:05:39.360> channel<00:05:39.720> audio

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
ports then we have the 8 channel audio

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.589 
ports then we have the 8 channel audio
this<00:05:40.740> runs<00:05:40.979> off<00:05:41.130> a<00:05:41.250> real<00:05:41.430> tech<00:05:41.729> LC<00:05:42.449> 8<00:05:42.720> 9<00:05:42.990> 2<00:05:43.349> chip

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:44.599 
this runs off a real tech LC 8 9 2 chip

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:47.360 
this runs off a real tech LC 8 9 2 chip
