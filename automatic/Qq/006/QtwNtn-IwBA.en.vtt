1<00:00:11.170> board<00:00:11.440> which<00:00:11.830> I'll<00:00:12.070> cut<00:00:12.280> in<00:00:12.370> half<00:00:12.750> for<00:00:13.750> the

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:13.809 
1 board which I'll cut in half for the

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.140 
1 board which I'll cut in half for the
two<00:00:14.050> for<00:00:14.500> the<00:00:14.590> ends<00:00:15.010> and<00:00:15.219> going<00:00:15.670> to<00:00:15.730> make<00:00:15.820> it<00:00:15.940> 5

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150 
two for the ends and going to make it 5

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.420 
two for the ends and going to make it 5
foot<00:00:16.390> wide<00:00:16.599> and<00:00:16.900> then<00:00:17.710> the<00:00:17.830> other<00:00:17.890> boards<00:00:18.279> are

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
foot wide and then the other boards are

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.439 
foot wide and then the other boards are
2<00:00:18.580> by<00:00:18.759> 6<00:00:18.790> 5<00:00:19.570> 14<00:00:20.080> foot<00:00:20.800> long<00:00:21.010> so<00:00:22.000> it's<00:00:22.090> doesn't<00:00:22.390> be

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:22.449 
2 by 6 5 14 foot long so it's doesn't be

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.080 
2 by 6 5 14 foot long so it's doesn't be
a<00:00:22.539> real<00:00:22.779> long<00:00:22.990> bed<00:00:23.230> and<00:00:23.830> then<00:00:24.550> I<00:00:24.640> just<00:00:24.880> bought

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
a real long bed and then I just bought

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.509 
a real long bed and then I just bought
same<00:00:25.539> with<00:00:25.840> 3-inch<00:00:26.199> screws<00:00:26.500> and<00:00:26.890> the<00:00:27.250> total

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:27.519 
same with 3-inch screws and the total

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.689 
same with 3-inch screws and the total
was<00:00:27.609> 3324<00:00:28.539> after<00:00:28.779> taxes<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:30.310> this<00:00:30.460> is<00:00:30.580> a<00:00:30.609> big

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:30.699 
was 3324 after taxes so this is a big

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.750 
was 3324 after taxes so this is a big
bad<00:00:31.029> for<00:00:31.359> not<00:00:31.779> a<00:00:31.840> bad<00:00:32.019> press<00:00:32.260> at<00:00:32.410> all<00:00:32.559> so<00:00:33.430> the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
bad for not a bad press at all so the

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.000 
bad for not a bad press at all so the
first<00:00:33.940> thing<00:00:34.000> you<00:00:34.180> want<00:00:34.360> to<00:00:34.390> do<00:00:34.540> is<00:00:34.840> cut<00:00:35.680> the<00:00:35.710> 10

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
first thing you want to do is cut the 10

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.000 
first thing you want to do is cut the 10
foot<00:00:36.670> board<00:00:37.000> in<00:00:37.149> half<00:00:37.180> for<00:00:38.140> your<00:00:38.290> two<00:00:38.440> ends<00:00:38.829> and

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
foot board in half for your two ends and

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.770 
foot board in half for your two ends and
then<00:00:39.190> pre-drill<00:00:39.550> your<00:00:39.969> holes<00:00:40.149> at<00:00:40.390> the<00:00:40.510> ends

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
then pre-drill your holes at the ends

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.680 
then pre-drill your holes at the ends
this<00:00:41.649> makes<00:00:41.920> it<00:00:42.040> easier<00:00:42.370> on<00:00:42.460> you<00:00:42.760> and<00:00:43.120> plus<00:00:43.480> the

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
this makes it easier on you and plus the

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.750 
this makes it easier on you and plus the
makes<00:00:44.590> it<00:00:44.739> where<00:00:44.890> you<00:00:45.040> don't<00:00:45.340> have<00:00:45.460> a<00:00:45.550> chance

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
makes it where you don't have a chance

00:00:45.760 --> 00:01:08.130 
makes it where you don't have a chance
of<00:00:45.969> splitting<00:00:46.180> the<00:00:46.420> wood

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.060
