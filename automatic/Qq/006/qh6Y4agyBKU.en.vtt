00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
I think the records at 70 right now so

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.370 
I think the records at 70 right now so
my<00:01:07.980> goal<00:01:08.160> is<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.310> at<00:01:08.640> least<00:01:08.730> beat<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.090> record

wind<00:01:43.740> tunnel<00:01:43.800> and<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.520> put<00:01:44.700> him<00:01:44.820> in<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.970> wind

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
wind tunnel and I put him in a wind

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.120 
wind tunnel and I put him in a wind
tunnel<00:01:45.240> we<00:01:45.540> made<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.750> metal<00:01:46.500> bar<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.950> wind

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
tunnel we made a metal bar in the wind

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.980 
tunnel we made a metal bar in the wind
tunnel<00:01:47.430> at<00:01:47.580> a<00:01:47.640> certain<00:01:47.940> height<00:01:48.120> he<00:01:48.720> was<00:01:48.840> able

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
tunnel at a certain height he was able

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.230 
tunnel at a certain height he was able
to<00:01:49.110> use<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.620> to<00:01:49.740> hold<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.940> we<00:01:51.180> were

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
to use that to hold on to that we were

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.270 
to use that to hold on to that we were
able<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.479> set<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.900> designs<00:01:52.320> for<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.070> bars

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
able to set the designs for the bars

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.160 
able to set the designs for the bars
that<00:01:53.490> we<00:01:53.550> have<00:01:53.729> on<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.970> car<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.780> was<00:01:54.900> really

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
that we have on the car so it was really

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.600 
that we have on the car so it was really
powerful<00:01:55.500> as<00:01:55.860> far<00:01:56.070> as<00:01:56.160> a<00:01:56.190> learning<00:01:56.430> experience

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
powerful as far as a learning experience

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.300 
powerful as far as a learning experience
and<00:01:57.540> keep<00:01:57.720> him<00:01:57.900> safe<00:01:58.170> they<00:01:58.830> don't<00:01:58.979> want<00:01:59.130> to

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
and keep him safe they don't want to

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.900 
and keep him safe they don't want to
find<00:01:59.850> out<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.180> wrong<00:02:00.360> thing<00:02:00.660> here<00:02:00.690> you<00:02:01.110> know

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
find out the wrong thing here you know

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.280 
find out the wrong thing here you know
coming<00:02:02.910> at<00:02:03.060> these<00:02:03.240> speeds<00:02:03.570> were<00:02:03.810> proved<00:02:04.080> more

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
coming at these speeds were proved more

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.070 
coming at these speeds were proved more
than<00:02:04.470> just<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.800> technical<00:02:05.250> challenge<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:06.080> think

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
than just a technical challenge I think

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.969 
than just a technical challenge I think
when<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.259> get<00:02:07.380> into<00:02:07.500> place<00:02:07.680> where<00:02:07.830> you<00:02:07.890> know

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
when you get into place where you know

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.350 
when you get into place where you know
you<00:02:08.040> can<00:02:08.190> die<00:02:08.369> it's<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.729> battle<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.030> fear<00:02:09.270> and

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
you can die it's a battle of fear and

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.180 
you can die it's a battle of fear and
confidence<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.020> then<00:02:10.140> obviously<00:02:10.770> the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
confidence and then obviously the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.470 
confidence and then obviously the
confidence<00:02:11.610> has<00:02:11.700> got<00:02:11.850> to<00:02:11.940> win<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.150> battle

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
confidence has got to win the battle

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.360 
confidence has got to win the battle
doesn't<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.870> let<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.500> fear<00:02:13.830> win<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.070> battle

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
doesn't you let the fear win the battle

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.729 
doesn't you let the fear win the battle
then<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.910> fear<00:02:15.120> will<00:02:15.209> probably<00:02:15.480> let<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.750> kill

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
then the fear will probably let you kill

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.400 
then the fear will probably let you kill
I<00:02:17.120> think<00:02:18.120> there's<00:02:18.270> going<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.450> be<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.600> bunch<00:02:19.290> of

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
I think there's going to be a bunch of

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.720 
I think there's going to be a bunch of
factors<00:02:19.770> that<00:02:19.800> are<00:02:20.010> going<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.160> play<00:02:20.430> out<00:02:20.610> today

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
factors that are going to play out today

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.160 
factors that are going to play out today
they're<00:02:21.000> gonna<00:02:21.120> make<00:02:21.300> this<00:02:21.450> thing<00:02:21.600> successful

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
they're gonna make this thing successful

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.530 
they're gonna make this thing successful
or<00:02:22.260> not<00:02:22.320> not<00:02:23.130> letting<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.489> wind<00:02:23.670> blow<00:02:24.330> me

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
or not not letting the wind blow me

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.970 
or not not letting the wind blow me
around<00:02:24.870> which<00:02:25.080> in<00:02:25.200> return<00:02:25.350> will<00:02:25.530> put<00:02:25.830> energy

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
around which in return will put energy

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.170 
around which in return will put energy
into<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.400> board<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:26.700> then<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.940> board<00:02:26.970> will

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
into the board and then the board will

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.080 
into the board and then the board will
start<00:02:27.510> potentially<00:02:28.440> getting<00:02:28.590> wobbles<00:02:29.100> that's

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
start potentially getting wobbles that's

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.729 
start potentially getting wobbles that's
the<00:02:30.270> worst<00:02:30.450> thing<00:02:30.989> that<00:02:31.050> can<00:02:31.260> happen<00:02:31.320> is

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
the worst thing that can happen is

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.380 
the worst thing that can happen is
getting<00:02:32.250> speed<00:02:32.459> wobbles<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.000> getting<00:02:33.209> thrown

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
getting speed wobbles and getting thrown

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.870 
getting speed wobbles and getting thrown
off<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.660> board<00:02:33.870> after<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:35.010> morning<00:02:35.310> of<00:02:35.370> testing

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
off the board after a morning of testing

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.220 
off the board after a morning of testing
there<00:02:36.030> were<00:02:36.120> concerns<00:02:36.600> that<00:02:36.750> 40

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
there were concerns that 40

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.930 
there were concerns that 40
mile-per-hour<00:02:37.410> winds<00:02:38.070> will<00:02:38.519> make<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.700> new

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
mile-per-hour winds will make a new

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.570 
mile-per-hour winds will make a new
record<00:02:39.180> difficult<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.870> achieve<00:02:40.250> just<00:02:41.250> warming

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
record difficult to achieve just warming

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.430 
record difficult to achieve just warming
up<00:02:41.670> just<00:02:41.730> went<00:02:42.090> up<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.269> like<00:02:42.420> 60<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:43.140> was<00:02:43.230> a

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
up just went up to like 60 and it was a

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.710 
up just went up to like 60 and it was a
little<00:02:43.650> bit<00:02:43.739> wobbly<00:02:43.950> so<00:02:44.450> making<00:02:45.450> some

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
little bit wobbly so making some

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.280 
little bit wobbly so making some
adjustments<00:02:46.200> so<00:02:46.799> many<00:02:47.010> variables<00:02:47.549> it's<00:02:48.060> like

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
adjustments so many variables it's like

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.210 
adjustments so many variables it's like
hopefully<00:02:49.290> we'll<00:02:49.590> put<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.769> right<00:02:49.890> formula

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
hopefully we'll put the right formula

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.920 
hopefully we'll put the right formula
together<00:02:50.489> but<00:02:50.730> we're<00:02:51.390> gonna<00:02:51.480> try<00:02:51.720> everything

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
together but we're gonna try everything

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.979 
together but we're gonna try everything
we<00:02:52.860> had<00:02:53.010> sort<00:02:53.280> of<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.400> long<00:02:53.700> wobble<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.840> what

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
we had sort of a long wobble and what

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.720 
we had sort of a long wobble and what
happens<00:02:55.380> at<00:02:55.500> higher<00:02:55.650> speeds<00:02:56.070> it<00:02:56.250> starts<00:02:56.580> the

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
happens at higher speeds it starts the

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.430 
happens at higher speeds it starts the
board<00:02:56.940> starts<00:02:57.299> to<00:02:57.420> wobble<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:58.019> then<00:02:58.290> it's

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
board starts to wobble and then it's

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.570 
board starts to wobble and then it's
going<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.650> get<00:02:58.769> quicker<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.250> quicker<00:02:59.400> and

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
going to get quicker and quicker and

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.160 
going to get quicker and quicker and
then<00:02:59.790> it's<00:02:59.940> going<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.150> lose<00:03:00.269> control<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:00.930> so

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
then it's going to lose control of it so

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.500 
then it's going to lose control of it so
we<00:03:01.650> feel<00:03:01.950> if<00:03:02.370> we<00:03:02.489> kind<00:03:02.700> of<00:03:02.790> thin<00:03:02.970> up<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.269> tires

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
we feel if we kind of thin up the tires

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.820 
we feel if we kind of thin up the tires
a<00:03:03.660> bit<00:03:03.959> we're<00:03:04.110> not<00:03:04.230> gonna<00:03:04.350> have<00:03:04.560> so<00:03:04.709> much

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
a bit we're not gonna have so much

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.729 
a bit we're not gonna have so much
traction<00:03:05.330> with<00:03:06.330> adjustments<00:03:06.900> made<00:03:07.110> why<00:03:07.410> went

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
traction with adjustments made why went

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.590 
traction with adjustments made why went
back<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.220> runway<00:03:08.610> but<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:09.030> wind<00:03:09.269> stayed

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
back to the runway but the wind stayed

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.780 
back to the runway but the wind stayed
