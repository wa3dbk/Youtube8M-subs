00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:54.230
 embroider and so they are very for me 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:59.850
 such road here it's ring frame 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:05.070
 very soft cloth covered 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.979
 I once saw a picture frame and and 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.860
 video how to use I for now only 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.630
 I imagine 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:18.600
 theoretically here such which points went 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.640
 carnations pulled you can 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.390
 using these here pins 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.420
 carnations also such here 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.740
 Scottish candy I have not tried 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.939
 honestly my husband's son already 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.110
 tried to say what is very 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.900
 interesting taste 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.600
 I understand the smell of wood 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.240
 plants which is shown here by 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.610
 some traditional 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:53.210
 recipe such sweets sweets 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:56.840
 Scottish also so I have long wanted 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:01.500
 I don't use this kind 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.630
 organizers and I would like to somehow my 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.289
 strings sort a little let's say 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.030
 if I embroider some painting then 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:12.390
 strings necessary here put 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.580
 so hung on the eyelet on the machine or 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.850
 then where do i need to eat nearby 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.549
 the thing is very convenient because the last 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.519
 time I keep threads in such 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:27.030
 tea bags so for me it is very 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:29.640
 By the way, yes, I would have more threaded such a moment 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.819
 it turns out that I am free, as if I do not know 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.160
 how but I get it 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.190
 sent exactly what I have here now 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.849
 it was actually necessary that 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.610
 I wanted to guess that we are so secret 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:47.750
 I wish for a long time about this 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:51.959
 I wanted everything she looked like 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:55.170
 naborchiki with such a convoy in principle 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:03:00.060
 the plot is so simple 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:03.450
 but I like these kind of sets 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:07.560
 like so much else, and letters of the alphabet 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.459
 different ie in such a design in 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.519
 this style 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:15.269
 for a long time we unfortunately sell such 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.870
 I did not see sets but orders somehow 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:21.239
 did not order such strings on such 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:24.750
 paper is obtained which is named 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:27.150
 while I admire so much I do not want 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.579
 I wait for you to say 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.000
 embroider but I still can not figure it out and 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:35.850
 I understand it is equal to me, I never 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.130
 I did not try to sew it such a canvas therefore 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:42.210
 I do not know what size to make crosses 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.100
 so if you know thats I think 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.890
 that someone of you knows and 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.870
 shell so tell me how she 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.209
 use what size do 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:55.920
 crosses and how is all that is 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:04:00.780
 calculate it so much 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:05.430
 Scottish dog also sea view 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:09.180
 signed here for 2014 too 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.970
 I think, too, the calendars will go find 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.390
 worthy place for children probably soon 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.970
 the whole room here are the hoops too 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.890
 Many thanks to the sea ​​for the calf because 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:24.300
 what have I got with the hoop lately 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:26.490
 how tense the plan is that they somehow 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.340
 we do not have a very high quality are the same 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:32.120
 very interesting, that is, to mount everything 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:37.919
 really such more 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:46.500
 inspiring let's say confidence and here 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:54.120
 such eggs and also interesting is obtained 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:56.000
 then fastened the canvas of Madeira and the hell of a letter 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:01.440
 here too 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:06.030
 the sea sent me such a very gentle 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:11.669
 a card that didn’t sign us either 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:15.169
 so very nice very nice and that he 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:18.240
 let's say it crowned 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:22.860
 parcel that I was particularly pleased with it 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:25.610
 here is such a golden needle here 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:28.350
 it is written that 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:34.260
 the embroidery process you can feel 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:36.720
 yourself like a real princess from england 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.990
 that is, I probably still probably not 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.230
 I will be it and I think that in general it would not 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:46.310
 I plan to use this checkmark 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:49.920
 I want a golden thread here and 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:54.030
 somehow here draw a frame that's decorated 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:56.960
 I will definitely show you here 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:02.460
 I understand this kind of thing 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:04.470
 Basically everything here will remain as 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:08.700
 memory and embroidery 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:12.570
 it is also so nice i am it at all 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:14.130
 as regarded as a sign that is all 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:18.330
 not just happening and what 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:21.780
 really i like this thing 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:28.820
 which I do embroidery that is 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:32.630
 here so that's all that's so me 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:35.330
 unexpected unexpected joy occurred 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:38.610
 replenishment in my needlework 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:40.890
 things I will try you 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:44.280
 I will show my own 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:48.230
 impressions stay with me to whom 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.230
 interesting to new meetings
