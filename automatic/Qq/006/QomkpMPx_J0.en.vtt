00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.259
 hello everyone this is the fourth lesson on 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.440
 analysis of songs for playing guitar for 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.799
 newbies and now we will analyze the movie song 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.859
 eighth grader the song is pretty simple 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:21.090
 played on chords and pretty light 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:25.260
 pain why gathering how to play yourself 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.619
 four movements down nose started like him 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.619
 looks like 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:45.180
 and so on that is up-down 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:45.180
 stub gently down up stub right 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:58.700
 down 2 cap up down up 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.700
 idle 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.340
 Here basically we will save everything just on 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:22.869
 throughout the song is played like this 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:24.159
 the intro in the song is played like this 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.390
 it is played 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:33.729
 only one chord is played once 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:36.090
 circle the pain and put cartier I am also one 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.090
 a circle 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.530
 hot 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:48.820
 again again 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:53.759
 again someone showed me a long time 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.759
 without a cord n that is the whole map to them and 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:03.759
 open strings I don't know who can 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:08.259
 I personally like it so much 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:13.840
 I like to leave the caps and play 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:15.519
 through chord e a m c o n a m e if you 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.860
 do not like can play and they 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:23.760
 m open and open since accession 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.760
 so we know 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:35.160
 start drinking 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:40.770
 desert cord 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:46.560
 where qi go on your with you when 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:53.660
 battle go to my somewhere we go we 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:57.380
 on we go on well we go we I this 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.380
 chord f i 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:08.689
 on laugh over etc 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:11.720
 candy conti nafig go to the site 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:15.070
 candy with 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:19.670
 there is no transition there is a chord c 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:23.660
 candy right up to the very end someone 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.680
 Goes over here to eat sweets 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.260
 moves on i 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.170
 but this is fundamentally wrong because in 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.930
 original and I i was generally looking for chords for 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.810
 this song and everywhere it says that after 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.420
 center field on i but actually in 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.120
 the original song in the first verse only 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:45.709
 in the first verse and the merchants remain 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:49.640
 eat candy niches and light and only then 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:54.260
 but in general here are the chords you can find there 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.310
 it will be written everywhere then competitors eat me 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.970
 don't know go to 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.660
 play as you like, but here is the original 1 1 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.370
 the verse is always the original 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:11.890
 is played 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:21.220
 and lights shine a view of the light and a bath on 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:22.930

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.259
 and here here is the transition to 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:58.250
 portal to them after c 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:58.250
 outwardly chord and 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:08.340
 8 graders

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:12.879
 Well, that's something like that, but 

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:15.449
 I think you can do this in principle 

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:16.629
 add can repair and so in short 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:22.449

 we are an eighth grade student 

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:06.669
 but 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:20.880
 and so on the next training will be 

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:23.910
 it is written a movie when your girlfriend is sick 

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.860

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:28.760
