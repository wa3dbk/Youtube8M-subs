 and it showed then a thousand that was a dear 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:40.570
 because his position is very important but 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.360
 that we go with fatal meetings and already 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.880

 all this faith in a training 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.610
 here does not meet that running machine 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.930
 Well, that is already a sack 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.360
 we will be perfect after there will be two 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:08.130
 commissions or classes that was like that 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:10.440
 and I was super it is important that yes 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.750
 it worked with my experimental cousins 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.610
 more primary because that was in the month 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.500
 fast and good we have here to ride 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.220
 all that inner part the sides 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.690
 bags that are just covered and are also 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.810
 White 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.810
 the outside and with a little thing 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.420
 with the votes of yes and later those that 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.420
 were 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.720
 with bullet chopin 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.130
 place an 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.130
 the capon bag 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.040
 hundred 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.040
 I thought 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.980
 a botany 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:07.210
 after knowing to 15 rite because we 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:09.910
 it remains to be able to follow the classes here 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.640
 nor to every day another half wild 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.070
 insured of these classes are three golds 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.010
 dollars and a half and not the limit of 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.080
 existence or for mónica of the day are 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.150
 free classes the only one pays for 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.010
 these materials these people that 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.440
 they make us happy and participate 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:31.960
 in our workshops and to understand us 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:33.760
 more telephone 976 the 27 or directly in 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.610
 the workshop our steinman is that 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.800
 King Alfonso the Magnanimous Number 67 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.680
 multiple more conservative and a little more 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.600
 common in cold porcelain of many 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.600
 decoupage I notice nobody 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.200
 than taking pictures 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.350
 everything that came back is always moving 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.120
 everything to follow normally when we see a 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.400
 very clear idea of what advocates what 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.600
 visual learns directly what is 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.150
 technique 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.700
 puri hard decoupage sirloin put in 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.770
 cars to restore also all kinds 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.290
 of people asks us to be good genius is 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.080
 in drops ends of the ones we 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:16.340
 also debutantes in times that we do 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:18.440
 and donuts and passing mold because I wanted 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:22.490
 mol relation 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:24.890
 for the issue of mobility of their hands 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.310
 we continue together with the young man and back 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:31.190
 of losing it is a challenge to which you 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:34.220
 they matter more evo life because they do not throw 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:37.340
 May for that question that follows and in 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:41.470
 As things get lower, they become more 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:44.030
 insurance to ships passing effects 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:48.170
 I undertook that this video where he said no 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:51.260
 they have to prove because no one is teaching 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:53.960
 is pending and such and we will continue now 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:57.740
 as an ease when existing by 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:00.370
 because those things would be said to them 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:03.190
 they matter 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.830
 of serenity that have fines lowered 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:08.229
 that mine gave him something and is in the other 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.570
 world of that concentration that sleeps 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:13.660
 with our satisfaction of the following 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:16.660
 how it evolves and how they thank you 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:20.710
 all these things and looking for that is capable 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:23.020
 of doing things thanks to everyone from the 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:26.669
 final beep of channel morin we had a 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:29.320
 incense artist who is exploited and 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:31.360
 next multi believed because it's convenient 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.939
 neither deum looks at you maite or a thousand errors that 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.469
 I'm with you 

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:37.870
 when we went here so we forgot 

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:41.620
 of everything 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:45.580
 if we are missing if an estellés do not know that 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:48.370
 would happen to us and that's mold 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:51.460
 why our great bread 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:53.920
 because they are the end of the day 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:57.090
 I intend for the next witness to like 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.090
 and they have another Argentine
