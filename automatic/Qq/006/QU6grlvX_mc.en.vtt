few days now and so this is just my only

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.359 
few days now and so this is just my only
some<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.220> worries<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:33.229> the<00:01:34.229> office<00:01:35.220> have

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
some of the worries that the office have

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.679 
some of the worries that the office have
been<00:01:35.400> experiencing<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.240> last<00:01:36.390> few<00:01:36.509> days

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
been experiencing in the last few days

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.420 
been experiencing in the last few days
so<00:01:37.320> we've<00:01:37.439> been<00:01:37.500> taking<00:01:37.680> advantage<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.310> this

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.890 
so we've been taking advantage of this
and<00:01:38.490> guess<00:01:39.119> we<00:01:39.210> can<00:01:39.360> read<00:01:39.509> them<00:01:39.630> out<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.840> let

of<00:03:01.580> hug<00:03:02.270> ability<00:03:03.100> he<00:03:04.100> definitely<00:03:04.430> wins<00:03:05.530> and

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
of hug ability he definitely wins and

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.060 
of hug ability he definitely wins and
usability<00:03:07.910> but<00:03:08.660> when<00:03:09.200> I<00:03:09.230> want<00:03:09.410> you<00:03:09.470> works<00:03:09.739> or

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
usability but when I want you works or

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.990 
usability but when I want you works or
not<00:03:11.739> I'm<00:03:12.739> not<00:03:12.800> sure<00:03:12.980> it's<00:03:13.430> a<00:03:13.459> bit<00:03:13.610> of<00:03:13.760> an<00:03:13.850> old

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
not I'm not sure it's a bit of an old

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.550 
not I'm not sure it's a bit of an old
thing<00:03:14.270> isn't<00:03:14.570> it<00:03:14.600> I<00:03:14.720> guess<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:14.989> idea<00:03:15.170> is<00:03:15.530> that

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
thing isn't it I guess the idea is that

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.979 
thing isn't it I guess the idea is that
it's<00:03:15.950> getting<00:03:16.520> children<00:03:17.090> to<00:03:17.239> like<00:03:17.510> write<00:03:17.780> down

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
it's getting children to like write down

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.330 
it's getting children to like write down
things<00:03:18.200> I've<00:03:18.440> worried<00:03:18.680> about<00:03:18.860> so<00:03:19.070> it<00:03:19.130> doesn't

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
things I've worried about so it doesn't

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.640 
things I've worried about so it doesn't
stay<00:03:19.489> inside<00:03:19.850> and<00:03:19.910> and<00:03:20.390> maybe<00:03:20.900> then<00:03:21.260> like<00:03:21.470> if

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
stay inside and and maybe then like if

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.050 
stay inside and and maybe then like if
they<00:03:21.770> were<00:03:21.800> writing<00:03:22.220> their<00:03:22.340> parents<00:03:22.730> can<00:03:22.880> look

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
they were writing their parents can look

they were writing their parents can look
and<00:03:23.239> see<00:03:23.420> what<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:23.630> kids<00:03:23.720> worried<00:03:24.080> about<00:03:24.260> them

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
and see what the kids worried about them

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.540 
and see what the kids worried about them
it's<00:03:25.970> just<00:03:26.390> bit<00:03:26.540> weird<00:03:26.780> really<00:03:27.110> gets<00:03:27.860> it<00:03:28.280> looks
