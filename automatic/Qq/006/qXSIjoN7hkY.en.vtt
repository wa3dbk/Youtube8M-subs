00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.649
 one of the fundamental aspects for the 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.260
 success of a more stop and the 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.200
 preparation of team members 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.049
 the preparation is very articulated and 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:19.529
 involves both mental and physical training 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.080
 specific training in tasks that 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.360
 every said must coat during 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.160
 execution of the quests same maddox 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.450
 the medical partner studying ferrari that 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.850
 follows the racing team and for many years 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.710
 also follows all ferrari employees 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.530
 that are part of the formula project 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.440
 wellness today we are here in the gym a 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.080
 they flourish to make the monthly evaluation 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.350
 to the members of the racing team 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:50.370
 the tests consist of a part of 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.190
 head for muscle power for the 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.910
 aerobic capacity for flexibility and 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.910
 for coordination 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.660
 usually at the end of the championship then a 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.310
 November 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.010
 we make clinical visits all 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.410
 team members ran in January 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.210
 before the start of the season yes 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.840
 make the true and functional value texts 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.280
 own that are repeated monthly 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.250
 we work according to two purposes 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.410
 one concerns and well-being of the boys who 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.360
 take care of the pit stop and 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.090
 the other regards the performance aspect 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.610
 so we can't forget that 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.150
 we are working on numbers at the end 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.710
 of the tests 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.600
 we take all our data e 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.660
 they are then inserted into this grid 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.310
 which reproduces the position of each 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.280
 single component compared to 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.410
 car and also their job for each 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.570
 team member is established 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.600
 a training program and they come 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.730
 identify the areas where it is important 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.920
 that each component 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.810
 must optimize its qualities 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.030
 we have the personalized training 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.830
 marked in a very functional way 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.650
 so let us go to work 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.560
 the circuit with most i 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.990
 guys we have groups of 67 people that 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.000
 participate in training sessions 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.920
 and we can work on all the 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.680
 trucks and kinetics that are involved 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.820
 in the top piece in recent years we have 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.110
 reached a good compromise 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.750
 identifying at least three days 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.180
 weekly to dedicate at least 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.520
 partially during the day ai 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.870
 workouts both around the car and 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.780
 then with real sessions 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.780
 of chris ware practice both in the gym
