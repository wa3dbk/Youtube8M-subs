Scarlet Spider and I already opened in
one<00:00:10.050> pack<00:00:10.320> it<00:00:10.590> didn't<00:00:10.800> work<00:00:10.950> out

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
one pack it didn't work out

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.270 
one pack it didn't work out
but<00:00:11.880> hopefully<00:00:12.330> two<00:00:13.019> more<00:00:13.230> packs<00:00:13.530> would<00:00:13.889> do<00:00:14.099> it

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
but hopefully two more packs would do it

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.369 
but hopefully two more packs would do it
as<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:15.059> can<00:00:15.179> see<00:00:15.240> really<00:00:15.599> cool<00:00:15.960> looking

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
as you can see really cool looking

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.590 
as you can see really cool looking
character<00:00:16.830> you<00:00:17.130> know<00:00:17.250> we'll<00:00:17.880> open<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.300> first

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
character you know we'll open it first

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.040 
character you know we'll open it first
to<00:00:18.840> see<00:00:19.020> what<00:00:19.050> happens<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.800> then<00:00:20.039> we<00:00:20.430> will

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
to see what happens and then we will

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.670 
to see what happens and then we will
analyze<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.590> design<00:00:24.140> all<00:00:25.140> right<00:00:25.320> we<00:00:25.470> didn't

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
analyze the design all right we didn't

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.759 
analyze the design all right we didn't
get<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:25.949> come<00:00:26.640> on<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:26.820> wasn't<00:00:27.180> even<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.840> was<00:00:28.500> even

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
get it come on I wasn't even I was even

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.820 
get it come on I wasn't even I was even
tapping<00:00:29.310> on<00:00:29.460> silk<00:00:30.230> it's<00:00:31.230> like<00:00:31.439> how<00:00:31.619> does<00:00:31.679> that

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
tapping on silk it's like how does that

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.420 
tapping on silk it's like how does that
even<00:00:32.009> work<00:00:32.570> all<00:00:33.570> right

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
even work all right

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.860 
even work all right
we<00:00:35.430> only<00:00:35.579> have<00:00:35.820> one<00:00:36.090> more<00:00:36.270> chance<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:36.809> I

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
we only have one more chance so I

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.850 
we only have one more chance so I
actually<00:00:37.110> just<00:00:37.469> bought<00:00:37.850> some<00:00:38.850> ISO<00:00:39.329> eight<00:00:39.860> and

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
actually just bought some ISO eight and

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.040 
actually just bought some ISO eight and
if<00:00:41.340> we<00:00:41.520> don't<00:00:41.670> get<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.210> then<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.600> guess<00:00:42.840> there's

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
if we don't get it then I guess there's

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.260 
if we don't get it then I guess there's
nothing<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.620> can<00:00:43.800> do<00:00:44.059> which<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.239> really

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
nothing I can do which is really

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.529 
nothing I can do which is really
unfortunate<00:00:45.750> because<00:00:46.500> it's<00:00:47.100> only<00:00:47.309> based<00:00:47.789> on

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:52.790 

it<00:00:51.539> looks<00:00:51.750> like<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.020> can<00:00:52.140> only<00:00:52.260> get<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.649> the

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
it looks like you can only get in the

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.680 
it looks like you can only get in the
pack<00:00:54.649> and<00:00:55.649> I'm<00:00:55.800> trying<00:00:56.329> you<00:00:57.329> know<00:00:57.360> I'm<00:00:57.539> gonna

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
a.m. but um I really like this design

a.m. but um I really like this design
the<00:03:11.590> only<00:03:11.769> thing<00:03:11.980> is<00:03:12.220> I<00:03:12.549> can't<00:03:12.940> get<00:03:13.090> it<00:03:13.269> which

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
the only thing is I can't get it which

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.600 
the only thing is I can't get it which
really<00:03:13.900> stinks<00:03:14.290> because<00:03:14.680> going<00:03:14.920> on<00:03:15.130> in<00:03:15.280> here

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
really stinks because going on in here

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.890 
really stinks because going on in here
you<00:03:16.030> would<00:03:16.120> think<00:03:16.180> that<00:03:16.420> there<00:03:16.630> would<00:03:16.780> be<00:03:16.810> a

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
you would think that there would be a

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.500 
you would think that there would be a
vent<00:03:17.290> maybe<00:03:17.620> afterwards<00:03:18.370> yeah<00:03:18.850> they're<00:03:19.330> gonna

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
vent maybe afterwards yeah they're gonna

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.500 
vent maybe afterwards yeah they're gonna
probably<00:03:19.959> have<00:03:20.500> one<00:03:20.799> afterwards<00:03:21.430> I<00:03:21.820> shouldn't

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
probably have one afterwards I shouldn't

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.650 
probably have one afterwards I shouldn't
be<00:03:22.720> buying<00:03:23.650> all<00:03:23.920> these<00:03:24.070> facts<00:03:24.430> then<00:03:24.820> because

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
be buying all these facts then because

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.509 
be buying all these facts then because
right<00:03:25.900> now<00:03:26.140> you<00:03:26.200> notice<00:03:26.709> it<00:03:26.890> gives<00:03:27.190> you<00:03:27.370> an

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
right now you notice it gives you an

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.880 
right now you notice it gives you an
event<00:03:27.910> portal<00:03:28.420> of<00:03:28.930> course<00:03:29.200> you<00:03:29.320> can<00:03:29.470> compete

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
event portal of course you can compete

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.870 
event portal of course you can compete
and<00:03:30.870> get<00:03:31.870> it<00:03:32.019> early<00:03:32.350> or<00:03:32.560> you<00:03:33.250> can<00:03:33.430> wait<00:03:33.580> for<00:03:33.610> the

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
and get it early or you can wait for the

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.900 
and get it early or you can wait for the
milestone<00:03:34.540> kind<00:03:34.989> of<00:03:35.080> thing<00:03:35.350> I'm<00:03:36.340> pretty<00:03:36.640> sure

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
milestone kind of thing I'm pretty sure

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.410 
milestone kind of thing I'm pretty sure
after<00:03:37.140> this<00:03:38.140> event<00:03:38.910> well<00:03:39.910> I'm<00:03:40.000> not<00:03:40.120> pretty

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
after this event well I'm not pretty

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.000 
after this event well I'm not pretty
sure<00:03:40.480> but<00:03:41.130> I'm<00:03:42.130> guessing<00:03:42.820> there<00:03:43.750> is<00:03:44.019> a<00:03:44.049> 90%

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
sure but I'm guessing there is a 90%

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.970 
sure but I'm guessing there is a 90%
chance<00:03:45.400> or<00:03:45.970> maybe<00:03:46.000> let's<00:03:46.810> say<00:03:46.959> 60<00:03:47.350> to<00:03:47.620> 90%

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
chance or maybe let's say 60 to 90%

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.630 
chance or maybe let's say 60 to 90%
chance<00:03:48.400> they<00:03:48.940> will<00:03:49.090> make<00:03:49.390> it<00:03:49.660> into<00:03:50.470> event<00:03:51.190> for

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
chance they will make it into event for

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.180 
chance they will make it into event for
you<00:03:51.760> to<00:03:51.790> get<00:03:52.920> after<00:03:53.920> this<00:03:54.130> event<00:03:54.310> which

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
you to get after this event which

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.280 
you to get after this event which
after<00:03:55.610> two<00:03:55.760> days<00:03:55.910> anyways<00:03:56.900> that's<00:03:57.140> what<00:03:57.260> I

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
after two days anyways that's what I

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.250 
after two days anyways that's what I
think<00:03:57.730> hopefully<00:03:58.730> they<00:03:59.270> do<00:03:59.330> and<00:03:59.900> then<00:04:00.080> I'll

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
think hopefully they do and then I'll

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.740 
think hopefully they do and then I'll
try<00:04:00.440> to<00:04:00.560> get<00:04:00.800> it<00:04:00.950> because<00:04:01.130> I<00:04:01.250> try<00:04:02.150> buying<00:04:02.510> the
