move and it will boil about a cup and a
half<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.560> two<00:01:16.590> cups<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.040> water<00:01:17.250> what<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:17.970> do<00:01:18.090> is

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
half to two cups of water what you do is

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.420 
half to two cups of water what you do is
you<00:01:18.210> put<00:01:18.390> an<00:01:18.509> ounce<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.840> fuel<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.320> here<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:20.369> you

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
you put an ounce of fuel in here and you

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.249 
you put an ounce of fuel in here and you
put<00:01:20.610> just<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.820> few<00:01:21.000> drops<00:01:21.240> around<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.689> edge<00:01:21.840> and

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
put just a few drops around the edge and

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.469 
put just a few drops around the edge and
then<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.920> light<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.340> outside<00:01:23.759> wick<00:01:24.060> with

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
then you light the outside wick with

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.249 
then you light the outside wick with
that<00:01:24.659> what<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.110> causes<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.979> causes<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
that what that causes is it causes the

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.690 
that what that causes is it causes the
alcohol<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.350> start<00:01:28.560> boiling<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.250> then<00:01:29.579> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
alcohol to start boiling and then the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.370 
alcohol to start boiling and then the
flames<00:01:30.000> will<00:01:30.240> come<00:01:30.420> shooting<00:01:30.869> out<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.049> side

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
flames will come shooting out the side

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.950 
flames will come shooting out the side
once<00:01:31.710> it's<00:01:31.920> primed<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.640> then<00:01:33.090> they'll<00:01:33.270> like<00:01:33.750> a

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
once it's primed and then they'll like a

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.499 
once it's primed and then they'll like a

the drawback with the system like that
just<00:01:52.950> carry<00:01:53.399> all<00:01:53.549> your<00:01:53.579> fuel<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.450> canister

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
just carry all your fuel in a canister

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.499 
just carry all your fuel in a canister
like<00:01:55.200> this<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.740> one<00:01:56.549> ounce<00:01:56.729> would<00:01:57.270> basically

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
like this and one ounce would basically

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.899 
like this and one ounce would basically
equal<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.170> one<00:01:58.530> cooking<00:01:58.979> session<00:01:59.460> if<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.700> will

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
equal a one cooking session if you will

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.530 
equal a one cooking session if you will
so<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.469> have<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.979> four<00:02:02.490> ounce<00:02:02.640> bottle<00:02:03.180> here<00:02:03.360> so

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
so so I have a four ounce bottle here so

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.539 
so so I have a four ounce bottle here so
4<00:02:03.750> ounces<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.200> can<00:02:04.380> run<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:04.649> stove<00:02:04.920> four<00:02:05.250> times

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
4 ounces I can run this stove four times

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.910 
4 ounces I can run this stove four times
or<00:02:05.909> basically<00:02:06.840> if<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.170> was<00:02:07.290> using<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.649> twice<00:02:07.770> a

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
or basically if I was using it twice a

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.359 
or basically if I was using it twice a
day<00:02:08.450> this<00:02:09.450> would<00:02:09.629> be<00:02:09.660> enough

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
day this would be enough

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.930 
day this would be enough
or<00:02:10.459> one<00:02:10.940> day<00:02:11.209> so<00:02:11.989> again<00:02:12.470> you<00:02:13.459> know<00:02:13.580> if<00:02:13.670> you<00:02:13.790> had

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
or one day so again you know if you had

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.309 
or one day so again you know if you had
to<00:02:14.030> carry<00:02:14.209> a<00:02:14.269> lot<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:14.780> wouldn't<00:02:15.019> want<00:02:15.140> to<00:02:15.170> take

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
to carry a lot you wouldn't want to take

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.949 
to carry a lot you wouldn't want to take
the<00:02:15.470> stove<00:02:15.709> for<00:02:16.010> many<00:02:16.849> days<00:02:17.090> in<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:17.510> row<00:02:17.659> you<00:02:17.810> be

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
the stove for many days in a row you be

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.649 
the stove for many days in a row you be
carrying<00:02:18.230> a<00:02:18.319> large<00:02:18.530> container<00:02:19.159> of<00:02:19.340> alcohol<00:02:19.659> so

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:20.659 
carrying a large container of alcohol so

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.770 
carrying a large container of alcohol so
but<00:02:20.840> that's<00:02:20.959> yet<00:02:21.230> another<00:02:21.319> option<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:23.569> last

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
but that's yet another option the last

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.500 
but that's yet another option the last
one<00:02:23.989> I'll<00:02:24.080> show<00:02:24.290> you<00:02:24.349> is<00:02:24.680> more<00:02:25.610> of<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:25.879> survival

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
one I'll show you is more of a survival

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.680 
one I'll show you is more of a survival
type<00:02:26.690> stove<00:02:27.310> this<00:02:28.310> is<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.579> new<00:02:28.730> stove<00:02:29.260> from

type stove this is the new stove from
from<00:02:32.690> ultimate<00:02:33.079> survival<00:02:33.530> technologies<00:02:33.560> I'm

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
from ultimate survival technologies I'm

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.949 
from ultimate survival technologies I'm
a<00:02:34.430> fan<00:02:34.700> of<00:02:34.730> a<00:02:34.849> lot<00:02:34.970> of<00:02:35.090> products<00:02:35.720> like<00:02:35.840> the

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
a fan of a lot of products like the

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.009 
a fan of a lot of products like the
blast<00:02:36.319> match<00:02:36.680> and<00:02:37.040> whatnot<00:02:37.599> this<00:02:38.599> is<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:38.870> new

blast match and whatnot this is the new

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.050 
blast match and whatnot this is the new
titanium<00:02:39.799> stove<00:02:40.370> that<00:02:40.579> they've<00:02:40.730> come<00:02:40.940> out

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
titanium stove that they've come out

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.140 
titanium stove that they've come out
with<00:02:41.120> extremely<00:02:42.049> lightweight<00:02:42.640> weighs<00:02:43.640> like<00:02:44.090> a

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
with extremely lightweight weighs like a

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.020 
with extremely lightweight weighs like a
half<00:02:44.540> of<00:02:44.959> an<00:02:45.230> ounce<00:02:45.379> point<00:02:46.069> five<00:02:46.519> or<00:02:46.819> point

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
half of an ounce point five or point

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.089 
half of an ounce point five or point
four<00:02:47.239> ounces<00:02:47.599> when<00:02:47.810> I<00:02:47.900> get<00:02:48.109> it<00:02:48.230> it<00:02:48.709> looks<00:02:48.950> like

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
four ounces when I get it it looks like

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.640 
four ounces when I get it it looks like
way<00:02:49.459> it's<00:02:49.640> actually<00:02:49.970> very<00:02:50.000> strong<00:02:50.660> get<00:02:51.260> it<00:02:51.349> set

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
way it's actually very strong get it set

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.220 
way it's actually very strong get it set
up<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:52.519> it<00:02:52.730> will<00:02:52.849> easily<00:02:53.299> hold<00:02:53.540> you<00:02:54.140> know

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
up and it will easily hold you know

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.690 
up and it will easily hold you know
pretty<00:02:54.590> much<00:02:54.620> any<00:02:54.890> type<00:02:55.129> of<00:02:55.159> cooking<00:02:55.579> two

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
pretty much any type of cooking two

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.690 
pretty much any type of cooking two
pockets<00:02:56.120> you<00:02:56.239> have<00:02:56.920> it'll<00:02:57.920> get<00:02:58.069> wider<00:02:58.459> or

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
pockets you have it'll get wider or

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.569 
pockets you have it'll get wider or
smaller<00:02:59.030> and<00:02:59.530> it's<00:03:00.530> designed<00:03:00.950> to<00:03:01.099> use<00:03:01.340> some

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
smaller and it's designed to use some

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.789 
smaller and it's designed to use some
type<00:03:01.819> of<00:03:01.849> a<00:03:02.090> fuel<00:03:02.359> source<00:03:02.599> in<00:03:02.900> here<00:03:03.109> solid<00:03:03.560> fuel

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
type of a fuel source in here solid fuel

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.509 
type of a fuel source in here solid fuel
source<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:05.150> they<00:03:05.500> they<00:03:06.500> primarily<00:03:06.890> market

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
source and they they primarily market

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.479 
source and they they primarily market
their<00:03:07.730> wet<00:03:08.090> fire<00:03:08.390> cubes<00:03:09.079> it's<00:03:09.440> a<00:03:09.530> waxy<00:03:10.220> tight

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
their wet fire cubes it's a waxy tight

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.030 
their wet fire cubes it's a waxy tight
cubes<00:03:10.940> you<00:03:11.510> can<00:03:11.629> also<00:03:11.780> use<00:03:11.900> tri-ox<00:03:12.409> bars<00:03:12.799> or

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
cubes you can also use tri-ox bars or

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.849 
cubes you can also use tri-ox bars or
whatnot<00:03:13.900> and<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.049> director<00:03:15.349> will<00:03:15.410> say<00:03:15.530> one

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
whatnot and the director will say one

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:17.710 
whatnot and the director will say one
cube<00:03:16.250> they<00:03:16.579> come<00:03:16.760> in<00:03:16.849> these<00:03:16.940> little<00:03:17.120> packets

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
cube they come in these little packets

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.890 
cube they come in these little packets
and<00:03:18.040> so<00:03:19.040> one<00:03:19.370> cube<00:03:19.730> is<00:03:19.940> supposed<00:03:20.180> to<00:03:20.329> burn<00:03:20.480> for

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
and so one cube is supposed to burn for

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.830 
and so one cube is supposed to burn for
three<00:03:20.959> to<00:03:21.380> five<00:03:21.530> minutes<00:03:22.010> and<00:03:23.000> boil<00:03:23.389> a<00:03:23.599> cup<00:03:23.780> of

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
three to five minutes and boil a cup of

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.580 
three to five minutes and boil a cup of
water<00:03:24.310> in<00:03:25.310> my<00:03:25.489> experience<00:03:26.030> it's<00:03:26.269> you<00:03:26.930> get<00:03:27.169> it

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
water in my experience it's you get it

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.330 
water in my experience it's you get it
will<00:03:27.739> boil<00:03:27.980> just<00:03:28.609> about<00:03:29.269> a<00:03:29.329> cup<00:03:29.720> of<00:03:29.840> water<00:03:30.340> also

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
will boil just about a cup of water also

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.580 
will boil just about a cup of water also
it's<00:03:31.489> hard<00:03:31.760> to<00:03:31.879> keep<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.209> flame<00:03:32.480> on<00:03:32.810> target

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
it's hard to keep the flame on target

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.289 
it's hard to keep the flame on target
because<00:03:33.709> it's<00:03:33.919> more<00:03:34.099> it<00:03:34.370> burns<00:03:34.579> like<00:03:34.700> a<00:03:34.849> candle

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
because it's more it burns like a candle

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.309 
because it's more it burns like a candle
so<00:03:35.810> you<00:03:35.870> want<00:03:36.169> to<00:03:36.290> use<00:03:36.769> some<00:03:37.040> type<00:03:37.310> of<00:03:37.340> a

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
so you want to use some type of a

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.599 
so you want to use some type of a
windbreak<00:03:39.319> around<00:03:39.829> the<00:03:39.949> device<00:03:40.220> to<00:03:40.400> really

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
windbreak around the device to really

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:41.979 
windbreak around the device to really
keep<00:03:40.760> it<00:03:40.940> so<00:03:41.030> you've<00:03:41.120> got<00:03:41.150> to<00:03:41.329> keep<00:03:41.419> that<00:03:41.480> thick

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
keep it so you've got to keep that thick

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.770 
keep it so you've got to keep that thick
that<00:03:42.139> in<00:03:42.290> consideration<00:03:42.470> as<00:03:43.069> well<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:44.540> since

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
that in consideration as well and since

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.780 
that in consideration as well and since
it<00:03:44.900> only<00:03:45.019> since<00:03:45.769> one<00:03:45.980> cube<00:03:46.280> will<00:03:46.489> pretty<00:03:46.669> much

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
it only since one cube will pretty much

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.599 
it only since one cube will pretty much
do<00:03:47.090> just<00:03:47.900> barely<00:03:48.079> a<00:03:48.199> cup<00:03:48.440> of<00:03:48.470> water<00:03:48.799> just<00:03:49.069> meet

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
do just barely a cup of water just meet

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.569 
do just barely a cup of water just meet
my<00:03:49.849> requirements<00:03:50.060> for<00:03:50.930> the<00:03:51.250> making<00:03:52.250> of<00:03:52.370> pro

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
my requirements for the making of pro

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:54.789 
my requirements for the making of pro
packs<00:03:52.879> and<00:03:53.329> making<00:03:53.959> enough<00:03:54.199> water<00:03:54.440> for<00:03:54.530> coffee

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
packs and making enough water for coffee

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.030 
packs and making enough water for coffee
and<00:03:55.160> whatnot<00:03:55.519> however<00:03:56.299> I<00:03:56.629> would<00:03:57.019> throw<00:03:57.859> it<00:03:57.949> in

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
and whatnot however I would throw it in

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.250 
and whatnot however I would throw it in
the<00:03:58.129> pack<00:03:58.310> it's<00:03:58.489> a<00:03:58.549> good<00:03:58.780> emergency<00:03:59.780> stove<00:04:00.049> I

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
the pack it's a good emergency stove I

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.619 
the pack it's a good emergency stove I
just<00:04:00.440> wouldn't<00:04:00.650> use<00:04:00.799> it<00:04:00.829> as<00:04:01.040> my<00:04:01.160> primary<00:04:01.419> is<00:04:02.419> my

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:02.629 
just wouldn't use it as my primary is my

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:06.189 
just wouldn't use it as my primary is my
primary<00:04:02.959> stove<00:04:03.459> so<00:04:04.750> basically<00:04:05.750> there<00:04:06.049> you

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:06.199 
primary stove so basically there you

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:08.830 
primary stove so basically there you
have<00:04:06.440> the<00:04:06.790> four<00:04:07.790> different<00:04:08.180> types<00:04:08.329> you<00:04:08.660> got

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
have the four different types you got

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.159 
have the four different types you got
starting<00:04:09.530> from<00:04:09.560> size<00:04:10.180> small<00:04:11.180> a<00:04:11.480> little<00:04:12.079> bit

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:12.169 
starting from size small a little bit

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:14.770 
starting from size small a little bit
larger<00:04:12.340> consider<00:04:13.340> the<00:04:13.549> size<00:04:13.730> now<00:04:14.329> the<00:04:14.389> fuel

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
larger consider the size now the fuel

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:15.789 
larger consider the size now the fuel
you're<00:04:14.959> going<00:04:15.139> to<00:04:15.230> need<00:04:15.349> though<00:04:15.560> with

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
you're going to need though with

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:16.210 
you're going to need though with
something

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
something

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.370 
something
that<00:04:17.079> stepping<00:04:18.079> up<00:04:18.350> to<00:04:18.620> the<00:04:19.750> the<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:21.170> one

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
that stepping up to the the the one

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.770 
that stepping up to the the the one
that's<00:04:21.590> more<00:04:21.829> of<00:04:22.120> more<00:04:23.120> along<00:04:23.330> the<00:04:23.360> lines<00:04:23.630> of

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
that's more of more along the lines of

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.910 
that's more of more along the lines of
what<00:04:23.840> I<00:04:23.990> would<00:04:24.080> consider<00:04:24.320> to<00:04:24.830> be<00:04:24.950> a<00:04:26.920> pretty

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
what I would consider to be a pretty

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.650 
what I would consider to be a pretty
much<00:04:28.160> a<00:04:28.190> really<00:04:28.610> good<00:04:28.790> all<00:04:28.970> around<00:04:29.000> the

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
much a really good all around the

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.760 
much a really good all around the
backpacking<00:04:30.140> stove<00:04:30.350> and<00:04:30.950> these<00:04:31.040> Styles<00:04:32.770> open

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
backpacking stove and these Styles open

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.430 
backpacking stove and these Styles open
that<00:04:33.890> up<00:04:34.100> there<00:04:34.280> so<00:04:34.430> you<00:04:34.550> get<00:04:34.700> more<00:04:34.850> of<00:04:34.970> an<00:04:35.060> idea

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
that up there so you get more of an idea

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.680 
that up there so you get more of an idea
screws<00:04:36.440> on<00:04:36.680> stays<00:04:37.010> in<00:04:37.160> place<00:04:40.390> sim<00:04:41.390> one<00:04:41.420> all<00:04:41.660> the

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
screws on stays in place sim one all the

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.110 
screws on stays in place sim one all the
way<00:04:41.840> one<00:04:42.500> like<00:04:42.650> that<00:04:42.890> or<00:04:43.460> then<00:04:43.670> of<00:04:43.760> course<00:04:44.000> you

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
way one like that or then of course you

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.030 
way one like that or then of course you
can<00:04:44.300> step<00:04:44.570> up<00:04:44.690> all<00:04:44.930> the<00:04:45.080> way<00:04:45.200> if<00:04:45.410> you<00:04:45.530> have<00:04:45.710> if

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
can step up all the way if you have if

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.380 
can step up all the way if you have if
you<00:04:46.190> have<00:04:46.340> any<00:04:46.580> to<00:04:46.760> something<00:04:47.090> much<00:04:47.180> larger

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
you have any to something much larger

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.690 
you have any to something much larger
like<00:04:47.720> that<00:04:47.990> but<00:04:48.590> also<00:04:48.710> consider<00:04:49.190> all<00:04:49.340> the<00:04:49.460> size

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
like that but also consider all the size

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.810 
like that but also consider all the size
so<00:04:50.690> that's<00:04:51.320> roughly<00:04:51.560> this<00:04:51.980> types<00:04:52.250> of<00:04:52.460> systems

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
so that's roughly this types of systems

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.420 
so that's roughly this types of systems
i<00:04:52.970> use<00:04:53.180> and<00:04:53.450> again<00:04:53.720> I<00:04:54.020> kind<00:04:54.590> of<00:04:54.650> focus<00:04:54.980> on<00:04:55.160> this

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
i use and again I kind of focus on this

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.580 
i use and again I kind of focus on this
one<00:04:55.640> is<00:04:55.760> my<00:04:55.880> primary<00:04:56.180> one<00:04:56.630> but<00:04:57.140> i<00:04:57.170> still<00:04:57.260> keep

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
one is my primary one but i still keep

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.340 
one is my primary one but i still keep
this<00:04:57.770> system<00:04:58.220> handy<00:04:59.020> depending<00:05:00.020> on<00:05:00.020> the<00:05:00.140> type

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
this system handy depending on the type

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.860 
this system handy depending on the type
of<00:05:00.380> trip<00:05:00.710> i'm<00:05:00.830> going<00:05:01.040> to<00:05:01.130> take<00:05:01.310> and<00:05:01.870> these

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
of trip i'm going to take and these

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.080 
of trip i'm going to take and these
fuels<00:05:03.230> will<00:05:03.380> last<00:05:03.560> quite<00:05:03.890> a<00:05:03.950> long<00:05:04.040> time<00:05:04.190> so

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
fuels will last quite a long time so

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.120 
fuels will last quite a long time so
there<00:05:05.450> you<00:05:05.480> have<00:05:05.600> it<00:05:05.720> i'll<00:05:06.020> probably<00:05:06.830> do<00:05:07.100> a

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
there you have it i'll probably do a

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.880 
there you have it i'll probably do a
more<00:05:07.490> in-depth<00:05:07.880> video<00:05:08.810> on<00:05:09.140> maybe<00:05:09.500> watching

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
more in-depth video on maybe watching

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.770 
more in-depth video on maybe watching
each<00:05:10.160> of<00:05:10.310> these<00:05:10.400> operate<00:05:10.910> thank<00:05:11.660> you<00:05:11.720> very
