one ICS rom I was running that the whole

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.160 
one ICS rom I was running that the whole
week<00:03:21.160> but<00:03:21.430> I<00:03:21.459> might<00:03:21.670> I<00:03:21.940> might<00:03:22.390> run<00:03:22.720> this<00:03:22.900> for<00:03:23.110> a

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
week but I might I might run this for a

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.289 
week but I might I might run this for a
while<00:03:23.290> but<00:03:24.190> i<00:03:24.250> think<00:03:24.549> this<00:03:24.700> one<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:25.090> that<00:03:25.180> one

while but i think this one and that one

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.440 
while but i think this one and that one
is<00:03:25.480> probably<00:03:26.410> the<00:03:26.530> two<00:03:26.860> best<00:03:27.160> ICS<00:03:27.849> realms<00:03:28.239> I've

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
is probably the two best ICS realms I've

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.009 
is probably the two best ICS realms I've
tried<00:03:29.040> definitely<00:03:30.040> give<00:03:30.190> this<00:03:30.220> one<00:03:30.580> a<00:03:30.610> try

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.009 
tried definitely give this one a try
you'll<00:03:32.019> probably<00:03:32.260> like<00:03:32.530> it<00:03:32.790> I'm<00:03:33.790> sure<00:03:34.090> and<00:03:34.330> let

should be able to foster squash the
radios<00:03:45.519> over<00:03:45.910> if<00:03:46.060> you're<00:03:46.209> using<00:03:46.360> TMO<00:03:48.030> just

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
radios over if you're using TMO just

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.350 
radios over if you're using TMO just
flash<00:03:49.420> your<00:03:49.890> modems<00:03:50.890> over<00:03:51.129> it<00:03:51.190> as<00:03:51.430> usual<00:03:52.090> and
