00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
thing and you just squeeze it in right

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.959 
thing and you just squeeze it in right
there<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:40.440> pivot<00:00:40.590> point<00:00:40.949> and<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.820> work

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
there and the pivot point and you work

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:49.970 
there and the pivot point and you work
it<00:00:42.089> in<00:00:44.870> I'm<00:00:45.870> more<00:00:46.019> squeak<00:00:48.559> and<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.679> makes<00:00:49.829> it

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
it in I'm more squeak and it makes it

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.319 
it in I'm more squeak and it makes it
makes<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.219> pivot<00:00:50.489> point<00:00:50.670> come<00:00:50.820> back<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.089> zero

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
makes the pivot point come back to zero

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.049 
makes the pivot point come back to zero
easier<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.199> your<00:00:53.010> Floyd<00:00:53.249> Rose<00:00:53.429> stays<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.850> tune

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:55.499 
so I mean even though I'm double locked

00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:56.840 
so I mean even though I'm double locked
it's<00:00:55.769> still<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.219> know<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.399> still<00:00:56.670> have

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:58.499 
friction problems so I mean that's a you

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:00.259 
friction problems so I mean that's a you
know<00:00:58.530> big<00:00:58.980> misconception<00:00:59.820> you<00:00:59.940> know<00:01:00.059> if<00:01:00.179> you
