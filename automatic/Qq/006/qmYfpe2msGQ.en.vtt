00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.950 
so I feel very comfortable in that but
again<00:01:43.950> like<00:01:44.670> most<00:01:44.939> kids<00:01:45.180> he's<00:01:45.390> got<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.600> lot<00:01:45.780> to

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
again like most kids he's got a lot to

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.649 
again like most kids he's got a lot to
learn<00:01:45.990> about<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.560> NBA<00:01:46.860> game<00:01:47.119> but<00:01:48.119> he<00:01:48.210> has<00:01:48.360> one

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
learn about the NBA game but he has one

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.710 
learn about the NBA game but he has one
skill<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.020> transfers<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.130> carries<00:01:50.490> over<00:01:50.720> to

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
skill that transfers and carries over to

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.580 
skill that transfers and carries over to
all<00:01:52.320> levels<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.829> basketball<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.460> shooting

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.649 

gary-da<00:01:57.590> know<00:01:57.710> Jared<00:01:58.280> right<00:01:58.520> right<00:01:58.880> a<00:01:58.909> lot<00:01:59.420> of

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
gary-da know Jared right right a lot of

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.899 
gary-da know Jared right right a lot of
those<00:01:59.869> right<00:02:00.439> and<00:02:00.920> we<00:02:01.070> do<00:02:01.219> but<00:02:01.520> you<00:02:01.670> can<00:02:01.820> never

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
those right and we do but you can never

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.819 
those right and we do but you can never
get<00:02:02.149> too<00:02:02.180> many<00:02:02.420> shooters<00:02:03.079> we<00:02:03.289> found<00:02:03.530> that<00:02:03.680> out

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
get too many shooters we found that out

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.639 
get too many shooters we found that out
this<00:02:04.070> year<00:02:04.369> share<00:02:05.119> makers<00:02:05.630> I<00:02:05.869> think<00:02:06.470> that's

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
this year share makers I think that's

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.169 
this year share makers I think that's
much<00:02:06.979> more<00:02:07.189> important<00:02:07.579> than<00:02:07.640> anything<00:02:07.850> else

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
much more important than anything else

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.870 
much more important than anything else
Doug<00:02:08.500> he<00:02:09.500> is<00:02:09.769> a<00:02:09.800> little<00:02:10.069> bit<00:02:10.160> different<00:02:10.580> I<00:02:10.700> mean

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
Doug he is a little bit different I mean

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.470 
Doug he is a little bit different I mean
he's<00:02:11.060> more<00:02:11.330> of<00:02:11.450> a<00:02:12.190> more<00:02:13.190> of<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.370> shooter<00:02:13.849> more<00:02:14.269> so

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
he's more of a more of a shooter more so

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.380 
he's more of a more of a shooter more so

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
being second half cut how big a maker

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.720 
being second half cut how big a maker
wants<00:03:32.540> the<00:03:32.780> ball<00:03:32.990> at<00:03:33.110> the<00:03:33.200> end<00:03:33.230> of<00:03:33.440> games

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.160 
wants the ball at the end of games
that's<00:03:34.730> huge<00:03:35.000> and<00:03:35.030> that's<00:03:35.360> where<00:03:35.600> I<00:03:35.630> think<00:03:36.080> he

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
that's huge and that's where I think he

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.900 
that's huge and that's where I think he
