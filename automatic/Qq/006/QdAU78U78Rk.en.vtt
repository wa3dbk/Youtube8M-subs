taking the time and effort because if

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.520

this<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.420> real<00:01:48.630> time<00:01:48.899> I'm<00:01:49.079> going<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.259> show

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
this is in real time I'm going to show

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.580 
this is in real time I'm going to show
you<00:01:49.530> how<00:01:49.740> fast<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.630> I've<00:01:51.630> connected<00:01:52.229> a

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
you how fast this is I've connected a

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.789 
you how fast this is I've connected a
jump<00:01:53.040> ring<00:01:53.280> right<00:01:53.700> here<00:01:54.090> on<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.689> end<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:55.350> my

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
jump ring right here on to the end of my

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.730 
jump ring right here on to the end of my
chain<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.659> jump<00:01:57.899> ring<00:01:58.079> first<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.560> all<00:01:58.649> you

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
chain and the jump ring first of all you

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.929 
chain and the jump ring first of all you
need<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:58.979> make<00:01:59.100> sure<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.310> jump<00:01:59.610> ring<00:01:59.759> is<00:01:59.909> a

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
need to make sure that jump ring is a

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.350 
need to make sure that jump ring is a
heavier<00:02:00.270> gauge<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:01.079> is<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.560> 16<00:02:02.009> gauge<00:02:02.280> but<00:02:03.240> I'd

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
heavier gauge this is a 16 gauge but I'd

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.560 
heavier gauge this is a 16 gauge but I'd
use<00:02:03.570> at<00:02:03.750> least<00:02:03.960> an<00:02:04.200> 18<00:02:04.770> gauge<00:02:05.100> jump<00:02:05.820> ring<00:02:06.090> for

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
use at least an 18 gauge jump ring for

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.969 
use at least an 18 gauge jump ring for
that<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:07.020> there<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.220> on<00:02:08.520> my<00:02:09.030> chain<00:02:09.739> now<00:02:10.739> all

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
that and there it is on my chain now all

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.150 
that and there it is on my chain now all
I<00:02:11.009> need<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.520> do

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
paste out put it on with my soldering

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.380 
paste out put it on with my soldering
pick<00:02:19.860> right<00:02:20.860> where<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.610> jump<00:02:21.850> ring<00:02:22.120> comes

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
pick right where the jump ring comes

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.660 
pick right where the jump ring comes
together<00:02:22.630> I've<00:02:23.560> made<00:02:23.920> sure<00:02:23.950> that<00:02:24.250> my<00:02:24.310> jump

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
together I've made sure that my jump

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.790 
together I've made sure that my jump
ring<00:02:24.820> is<00:02:24.970> super<00:02:25.360> closed<00:02:25.660> up<00:02:28.230> there<00:02:29.230> we<00:02:29.440> go<00:02:29.590> can

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
ring is super closed up there we go can

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.980 
ring is super closed up there we go can
you<00:02:29.860> see<00:02:30.070> I<00:02:30.100> didn't<00:02:30.430> even<00:02:30.550> need<00:02:30.760> much<00:02:31.090> I'm

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
you see I didn't even need much I'm

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.320 
you see I didn't even need much I'm
gonna<00:02:32.170> set<00:02:32.470> this<00:02:32.620> aside<00:02:32.680> now<00:02:33.280> this<00:02:34.060> is<00:02:34.180> our

smallest torch that we carry this is the

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.760 
smallest torch that we carry this is the
micro<00:02:36.370> torch<00:02:36.610> really<00:02:37.570> inexpensive<00:02:38.350> and<00:02:38.620> a

really<00:02:41.140> small<00:02:41.560> jump<00:02:41.890> ring<00:02:42.100> work<00:02:42.310> so<00:02:43.120> we're

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
really small jump ring work so we're

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.150 
really small jump ring work so we're
gonna<00:02:43.420> turn<00:02:43.660> it<00:02:43.810> on<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:47.470> I'm<00:02:47.590> just<00:02:47.710> gonna<00:02:47.830> come

gonna turn it on and I'm just gonna come

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.020 
gonna turn it on and I'm just gonna come
on<00:02:48.340> in<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:48.880> heat<00:02:49.720> it<00:02:50.700> make<00:02:51.700> sure<00:02:51.730> you're

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
on in and heat it make sure you're

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.330 
on in and heat it make sure you're
working<00:02:52.330> in<00:02:52.420> a<00:02:52.480> well-ventilated<00:02:52.840> area<00:02:53.830> and

working in a well-ventilated area and

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.600 
working in a well-ventilated area and
remember<00:02:54.880> I've<00:02:55.000> put<00:02:55.240> my<00:02:55.420> safety<00:02:55.600> glasses<00:02:55.930> on

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.190 
remember I've put my safety glasses on
see<00:02:57.610> how<00:02:57.730> I'm<00:02:57.820> just<00:02:57.880> heating<00:02:58.240> see<00:02:58.660> that<00:02:58.870> right

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
see how I'm just heating see that right

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.430 
see how I'm just heating see that right
there<00:02:59.230> there<00:02:59.800> it<00:02:59.950> goes<00:03:00.330> super<00:03:01.330> fast<00:03:01.440> and

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
there there it goes super fast and

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.280 
there there it goes super fast and
notice<00:03:03.340> since<00:03:03.760> I<00:03:03.880> concentrated<00:03:04.630> right<00:03:04.990> on

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
notice since I concentrated right on

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.860 
notice since I concentrated right on
that<00:03:05.590> ring<00:03:05.980> right<00:03:06.490> there<00:03:06.730> you<00:03:07.270> can<00:03:07.420> see<00:03:07.630> my

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
that ring right there you can see my

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.810 
that ring right there you can see my
chain<00:03:08.320> is<00:03:08.530> hardly<00:03:08.860> even<00:03:09.010> tarnished<00:03:09.520> at<00:03:09.700> all

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
chain is hardly even tarnished at all

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.940 
chain is hardly even tarnished at all
you<00:03:10.780> want<00:03:10.960> to<00:03:11.020> make<00:03:11.050> sure<00:03:11.200> that<00:03:11.530> you<00:03:11.650> do<00:03:11.830> this

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
you want to make sure that you do this

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.470 
you want to make sure that you do this
before<00:03:12.130> you<00:03:12.400> put<00:03:12.430> anything<00:03:12.820> else<00:03:13.090> on<00:03:13.330> your

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
before you put anything else on your

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.150 
before you put anything else on your
chain<00:03:13.750> because<00:03:14.170> you<00:03:14.380> know<00:03:14.500> you<00:03:14.560> don't<00:03:14.800> want<00:03:15.100> to

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
chain because you know you don't want to

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.140 
chain because you know you don't want to
recognize<00:03:16.000> your<00:03:16.150> pendants<00:03:16.600> or<00:03:16.810> anything<00:03:16.990> but

all<00:03:24.940> I<00:03:25.000> would<00:03:25.209> do<00:03:25.480> now<00:03:25.660> is<00:03:25.990> use<00:03:26.260> that<00:03:26.500> penny

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
all I would do now is use that penny

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.970 
all I would do now is use that penny
break<00:03:27.040> to<00:03:27.340> clean<00:03:27.580> it<00:03:27.730> up<00:03:27.850> and<00:03:28.120> I<00:03:28.630> am<00:03:29.050> good<00:03:29.350> to<00:03:29.380> go

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
break to clean it up and I am good to go

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.910 
break to clean it up and I am good to go
this<00:03:30.190> chain<00:03:30.580> is<00:03:30.850> not<00:03:31.360> and<00:03:31.750> going<00:03:31.959> anywhere

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
this chain is not and going anywhere

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.530 
this chain is not and going anywhere
that's<00:03:33.190> a<00:03:33.370> super<00:03:33.700> solid<00:03:33.940> joint<00:03:34.410> so<00:03:35.410> Jen<00:03:36.340> I<00:03:36.700> hope

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
that's a super solid joint so Jen I hope

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.030 
that's a super solid joint so Jen I hope
