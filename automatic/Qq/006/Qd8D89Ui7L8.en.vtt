00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.140 
by having the best equipment we're able
to<00:05:42.169> provide<00:05:42.469> the<00:05:42.770> patients<00:05:43.219> with<00:05:43.370> the<00:05:43.639> scans

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
to provide the patients with the scans

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.119 
to provide the patients with the scans
that<00:05:44.240> have<00:05:44.479> the<00:05:44.599> highest<00:05:44.780> resolution<00:05:45.199> the

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:46.129 
that have the highest resolution the

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:47.980 
that have the highest resolution the
fastest<00:05:46.669> scan<00:05:46.940> times<00:05:47.240> and<00:05:47.599> the<00:05:47.690> lowest

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
fastest scan times and the lowest

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.230 
fastest scan times and the lowest
radiation<00:05:48.530> dose<00:05:48.770> and<00:05:49.009> we<00:05:49.039> are<00:05:49.729> very<00:05:49.940> excited

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
radiation dose and we are very excited

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.149 
radiation dose and we are very excited
to<00:05:50.360> be<00:05:50.449> able<00:05:50.599> to<00:05:50.719> bring<00:05:51.110> those<00:05:51.530> capabilities

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.159 
to be able to bring those capabilities

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:53.529 
to be able to bring those capabilities
that<00:05:52.250> we<00:05:52.370> have<00:05:52.520> at<00:05:52.639> Stanford<00:05:53.030> down<00:05:53.180> here<00:05:53.419> to

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:53.539 
that we have at Stanford down here to

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:57.430 
that we have at Stanford down here to
the<00:05:53.629> South<00:05:53.810> Bay<00:05:55.150> so<00:05:56.150> there<00:05:56.690> you<00:05:56.900> have<00:05:56.930> it<00:05:57.319> a

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
the South Bay so there you have it a

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.350 
the South Bay so there you have it a
sneak<00:05:57.830> peek<00:05:58.099> at<00:05:58.279> the<00:05:58.400> new<00:05:58.550> Cancer<00:05:59.029> Center

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360

hopefully<00:06:15.740> we<00:06:15.830> can<00:06:15.979> make<00:06:16.099> rallying<00:06:16.580> the<00:06:16.669> bases

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
hopefully we can make rallying the bases

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:37.310 
hopefully we can make rallying the bases
just<00:06:17.900> a<00:06:17.990> little<00:06:18.289> bit<00:06:18.379> easier
