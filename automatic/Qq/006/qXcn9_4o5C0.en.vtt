00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.860
 zombies of the new map in the chosen one of 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.400

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.860
 few tutorials but hey this is one 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.380
 that discovered this morning giving me 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.350
 turns around the map and such is what 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.090
 next as you know that I thought that 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.730
 you could not get or put money in the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.030
 bank but it turns out that if I'm going to tell you 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.350
 how to do it and also how to catch 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.780
 your weapons those that you have saved 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.070
 in the fridge but I take this from here to 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.070
 make money to enter 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:53.010
 you see that for certain 2000 by placing 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.050
 every sketch on the wall ok we go out and 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.660
 we are in the town of agreement you have 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.840
 to pull in this direction you have to 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:06.040
 come here you have to come here 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:10.300
 and open this sofa that is worth 750 now 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.860
 you put in here and as you see here, it shines 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.020
 the other counter also if you approach 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:19.990
 put remove thousand and if you put here 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.430
 Sorry forgiveness here puts you give a thousand but 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.720
 As I do not have a thousand, it does not let me 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.869
 but look I'm going to remove it so that 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.810
 You see, they give me a thousand of money, you see 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:31.490
 I keep taking money so you can see and what 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.689
 I'm going to leave again 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.560
 that's where you can do that 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:41.650
 Now I'll show where to catch 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.690
 the gun in the fridge 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:48.320
 I come out here to escape from this house 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:51.409
 because everything is closed if it is not worth 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.560
 It is something worth and it is here already 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:57.680
 come out now how to get the gun of 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.290
 the fridge and killed this one to make a 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.550
 little money 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:06.920
 and it is also worth 750 costs to open the 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.490
 door that is here 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.130
 we open it 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.900
 and here it's good it's not a fridge it's a 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.300
 closet see as you see puts recover 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.270
 Arman I'm going to fuck you so you can see her 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.610
 you see as you see I have the hummer saved 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.950
 there 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.170
 so you can save any weapon 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.090
 while but the only ones that do not 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.000
 can save are the two weapons of 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.330
 rays the new one that has come out and the 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.180
 paralyzer that new big gun 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.770
 that disintegrates zombies 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.040
 you can save all the new revolver 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.050
 you can also save it so good 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.880

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.400

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.900

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.220
 doors quickly without having to 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.470
