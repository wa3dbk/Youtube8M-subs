00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.920
 Clients can also be modeled 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.560
 use yourself and make one for yourself 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.250
 cinema 4d a series of objects for 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.529
 disposal 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.520
 and these are the so-called apps 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.940
 Objects that we find up here in the menu 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:30.080
 on the one hand, that would be something extreme 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:32.119
 lasersoft maps and the sweep maps object 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.430
 and in this part we want to meet once 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.440
 look where for the extruder object 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.000
 suitable is 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.800
 let's choose the extreme apps so once 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.970
 and add it to our scene here 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.560
 in addition 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.170
 also have in our scene here 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.520
 a whimsy and a note that I 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.520
 formed here after 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.510
 and we want this note with now 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.859
 Help the extruder object in a 3d 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.559
 convert object 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:01.530
 this works so that we have the note 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.170
 Just put it into the extreme here 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.330
 because the extreme ups is a so-called 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.430
 generator that means we just have to go here 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.640
 once plan to assign object and from it 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.619
 then generated us a new object 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.720
 These generators can be over this 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.159
 little green hooks here and 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.509
 turn off 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.659
 we can turn it off and thereby 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.610
 we get the red ickx and see 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.560
 now also our spline object again 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.720
 or how to activate and see now 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.760
 what the generator makes of it 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.280
 Let's take a look at the attributes of 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:37.220
 extruder's object 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.540
 and select the object type here 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.850
 then we see that we are here 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.100
 attribut shift can adjust 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.640
 namely in three directions namely 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.590
 direction xy and z and is standard 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.110
 Here is a shift of 20 centimeters 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.680
 set in the direction of z so here 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.240
 along the blue axis 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.340
 That's why we see here too 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.440
 somehow such a double object 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.290
 which here in this direction 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.850
 is moved 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.659
 Let's do the shift 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.209
 undo by wearing 0 1 here 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.580
 then we fill that extruder object 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.430
 here our note or the outline of our 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.549
 note once out so that we are here now 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.849
 a flat 3d object of our note 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.849
 receive 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.959
 the extruder object can do even more 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:26.879
 it can extrude into one 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.469
 appropriate direction only is the 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.379
 Direction z not suitable here but 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:33.569
 in that case the direction is so choose 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:37.109
 We are worth a visit here in the first field 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:40.710
 and thus raise the outline of our 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:42.380
 note here in the iks direction 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.490
 So we get one now 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.070
 three-dimensional object here of ours 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:50.160
 note and this is internally with 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.680
 polygons formed so we see here 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.150
 at the edges again the polygons so 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.150
 the individual areas here 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.640
 and at the top or at the 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.890
 so-called deck areas here we have 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.960
 a large area and this covers area 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.790
 is usually depicted as a narrow 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.800
 So not in the subdivision with 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.960
 triangles and four corners but as 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.060
 a single area with many 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.710
 small points 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.900
 if we are here with an extruder apps 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.450
 work object then we have now 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.250
 big advantage that we play the game 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.860
 can still edit the object 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.560
 and then we see something directly ours 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.930
 extreme apps so the generator out of it 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.490
 Because he can do this in real time 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.100
 Update object 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.900
 So we can now in the points 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.090
 edit mode and go from this 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.840
 side we also see our spline object 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.290
 here still 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.780
 We can still select this and 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.300
 edit and in real time here is the 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.760
 generated 3d object here again 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.970
 presented as it is now reshaped 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.970
 is 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.330
 So that has a significant advantage 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.680
 compared to the polygon objects we 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.049
 have met so far 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.870
 that would be the form of a spline now 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:07.180
 can easily edit and 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:11.700
 At the same time it generates us that extreme 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.700
 object here a new 3d object from it 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.239
 sometimes it makes sense to do this extra 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.609
 deactivate tabs once and thereby 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.380
 only the path so our spline here 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.080
 to show then we can do this here 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.280
 see and edit more closely and then 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.110
 we can always go back and forth 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.970
 switch and look at us how does that look 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.250
 really whole again if that 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.730
 extra whether from our 3d objects 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.730
 tinkering 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.690
 if 1 plans is not closed in 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.180
 In that case we have a closed one 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.960
 object and if we close that once 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.910
 deactivate 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.979
 then we have ours up here 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.090
 spline suddenly not closed 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.340
 body more 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.229
 and for the reason we created here the 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.180
 extruder object even only the 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:58.759
 outlines and no longer the roof areas 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.680
 so we can both with it 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:03.110
 closed plans work and 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.330
 then get the roof areas or else 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.569
 outlined with simple and then get 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.490
 just the exploded outline to it 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:13.009
 these edges here so the 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.259
 Transitions from the outside to the 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:16.849
 Areas are very hard 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:18.770
 edge 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:20.659
 and this one can be a bit more accurate 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.969
 set in the attributes of the 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:25.219
 extruder's object 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:27.650
 We find the settings in 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:29.020
 the tip dec surfaces 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.120
 and here we have the opportunity 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.680
 select at start and end respectively 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.540
 whether we cover areas here at all 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.410
 because we want them too 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.410
 deactivate 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.139
 or whether we go to the dec areas 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:46.160
 additionally want to have rounding 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:48.110
 or just rounding off 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.140
 We now choose here for start and end 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:53.300
 once deck surfaces and curves out 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:55.760
 the home side each side 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:59.760
 is where the explode starts so the 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:01.680
 side where our spline is here 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.730
 and the ent side is the side the 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.730
 is lifted out 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.590
 we get one here now 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.380
 bevelled rounding or such a 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.330
 beveled edges and can this 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.100
 edge now with more levels 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.240
 provided and thus here one 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.039
 add actual rounding 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.990
 You can also do these curves through 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:25.240
 Define the radius so we can use it 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.900
 can make something smaller here as well 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.900
 on the back side 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.139
 and that is our object here now 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.000
 not quite as sharp on the edge 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:36.930
 and now get these beautiful ones here 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.930
 rounded corners 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.830
 that extreme object is therefore best 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:46.080
 suitable for when we outline of 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.940
 lift out and extrude splice 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.980
 want and with it we can do one 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:54.140
 Outline simple outline and one 

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.140
 Create three-dimensional object
