dark in the crease as always so next I'm

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.009 
dark in the crease as always so next I'm
going<00:02:11.280> in<00:02:11.640> with<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.850> little<00:02:11.970> bit<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.360> smolder

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
going in with a little bit of smolder

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.620 
going in with a little bit of smolder
this<00:02:13.590> show<00:02:13.830> you<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.070> satin<00:02:14.459> finish<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:15.090> it's

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
this show you is a satin finish so it's

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.090 
this show you is a satin finish so it's
going<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.989> be<00:02:16.049> a<00:02:16.079> little<00:02:16.260> bit<00:02:16.410> easier<00:02:16.739> to<00:02:16.799> blend

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
going to be a little bit easier to blend

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.480 
going to be a little bit easier to blend
in<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.400> previous<00:02:17.850> shade

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
in the previous shade

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.260 
in the previous shade
I<00:02:20.350> decided<00:02:21.350> to<00:02:21.620> go<00:02:21.770> for<00:02:22.100> a<00:02:22.130> great<00:02:22.610> smoky<00:02:23.240> eye

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
I decided to go for a great smoky eye

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.410 
I decided to go for a great smoky eye
today<00:02:23.600> so<00:02:24.320> I'm<00:02:24.470> using<00:02:24.710> password<00:02:25.430> next<00:02:25.730> and<00:02:26.150> I'm

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
today so I'm using password next and I'm

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.750 
today so I'm using password next and I'm
patting<00:02:26.840> this<00:02:26.990> all<00:02:27.230> over<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.680> eyelid<00:02:28.190> to<00:02:28.400> act

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
patting this all over the eyelid to act

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.450 
patting this all over the eyelid to act
as<00:02:28.910> a<00:02:28.940> base<00:02:29.180> for<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.540> shadows<00:02:29.900> coming<00:02:30.200> next

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
as a base for the shadows coming next

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.160 
as a base for the shadows coming next
again<00:02:31.460> this<00:02:31.790> is<00:02:31.970> another<00:02:32.150> math<00:02:32.480> shade<00:02:32.870> and

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
again this is another math shade and

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.050 
again this is another math shade and
that's<00:02:33.440> why<00:02:33.740> it's<00:02:33.920> so<00:02:34.100> important<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.790> press

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
that's why it's so important to press

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.210 
that's why it's so important to press
the<00:02:35.270> shadow<00:02:35.510> onto<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:35.990> lid<00:02:36.170> by<00:02:36.800> doing<00:02:37.100> this

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
the shadow onto the lid by doing this

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.250 
the shadow onto the lid by doing this
you'll<00:02:37.490> get<00:02:37.670> a<00:02:37.700> nice<00:02:37.940> even<00:02:38.270> coverage<00:02:38.630> under

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
you'll get a nice even coverage under

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.420 
you'll get a nice even coverage under
won't<00:02:39.470> be<00:02:39.650> a<00:02:39.680> passion<00:02:40.190> sight<00:02:40.490> I'm<00:02:42.310> going<00:02:43.310> to

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
work on that nice smoky smoldering

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.100 
work on that nice smoky smoldering
appearance<00:02:46.070> next<00:02:46.550> and<00:02:46.700> to<00:02:47.240> do<00:02:47.330> that<00:02:47.540> I'm<00:02:47.840> using

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
appearance next and to do that I'm using

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.350 
appearance next and to do that I'm using
black<00:02:48.470> markers<00:02:49.040> even<00:02:49.970> though<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.180> black

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
being quite precise with the blending

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.040 
being quite precise with the blending

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.590 
and that's because I want to keep the
pigmentation<00:03:12.560> on<00:03:12.920> that<00:03:13.250> outer<00:03:13.430> corner<00:03:13.580> if<00:03:14.510> I

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
it to be too obvious so I wasn't going

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.690 
it to be too obvious so I wasn't going
to<00:03:57.230> use<00:03:57.350> one<00:03:57.620> of<00:03:57.650> the<00:03:57.770> light<00:03:57.950> shimmery<00:03:58.430> shade

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
to use one of the light shimmery shade

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.210 
to use one of the light shimmery shade
from<00:03:58.850> the<00:03:58.940> palette<00:03:59.230> instead<00:04:00.230> keeping<00:04:01.070> with

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
from the palette instead keeping with

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.070 
from the palette instead keeping with
the<00:04:01.340> gray<00:04:01.520> theme<00:04:01.880> I<00:04:02.120> decided<00:04:02.690> to<00:04:02.990> apply

the gray theme I decided to apply
slanted<00:04:03.950> I<00:04:05.470> didn't<00:04:06.470> want<00:04:06.650> to<00:04:06.770> add<00:04:06.920> a<00:04:06.950> winged

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
slanted I didn't want to add a winged

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.220 
slanted I didn't want to add a winged
liner<00:04:07.400> because<00:04:08.120> I<00:04:08.150> felt<00:04:08.480> it<00:04:08.630> would<00:04:08.750> take<00:04:08.960> away

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
liner because I felt it would take away

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.200 
liner because I felt it would take away
from<00:04:09.530> the<00:04:09.620> shadows<00:04:10.040> but<00:04:10.610> I<00:04:10.670> needed<00:04:10.910> to<00:04:11.090> add

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
something to the upper lash line because

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.640 
something to the upper lash line because
I'm<00:04:13.490> applying<00:04:13.820> false<00:04:14.210> lashes<00:04:14.390> and<00:04:14.960> I<00:04:15.320> needed
