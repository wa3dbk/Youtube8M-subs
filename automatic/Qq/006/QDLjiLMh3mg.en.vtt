00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
is Marty O'Donnell which was the sound

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.650 
is Marty O'Donnell which was the sound
guy<00:02:35.110> who<00:02:35.170> had<00:02:35.500> previously<00:02:35.950> worked<00:02:36.250> on<00:02:36.700> Halo

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
guy who had previously worked on Halo

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.480 
guy who had previously worked on Halo
games<00:02:37.870> but<00:02:38.170> they<00:02:38.290> recently<00:02:38.680> canned<00:02:39.100> him<00:02:39.310> and

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
games but they recently canned him and

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.610 
games but they recently canned him and
he<00:02:39.580> no<00:02:39.730> longer<00:02:39.910> works<00:02:40.240> there<00:02:40.450> I<00:02:40.780> guess<00:02:41.440> they

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
he no longer works there I guess they

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.830 
he no longer works there I guess they
had<00:02:41.770> some<00:02:42.270> irreconcilable<00:02:43.270> differences<00:02:43.690> that

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
had some irreconcilable differences that

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.410 
had some irreconcilable differences that
they<00:02:43.960> couldn't<00:02:44.230> sort<00:02:44.560> out<00:02:44.770> and<00:02:45.150> so<00:02:46.150> that<00:02:46.300> was

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
they couldn't sort out and so that was

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.490 
they couldn't sort out and so that was
pretty<00:02:46.570> cool<00:02:46.690> hopefully<00:02:47.200> you<00:02:47.260> guys<00:02:47.350> had

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500
