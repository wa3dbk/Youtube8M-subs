00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.230
 harder than talking from the TV screen 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:36.690
 this voice should not annoy anyone 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.149
 but must also reach consciousness 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:44.070
 the passenger should not be so quiet 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.350
 indifferent monotonous intonation but not 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.660
 There must be speakers in the voice 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.850
 some colors intonation 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.370
 elevated because if the person is traveling 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.890
 subway several stations every day by 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.390
 several times and naturally he will be on 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.250
 it's paying attention 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.379
 change in the information system in 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.510
 Samara subway timed to the opening 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.580
 Metro stations and Labinsk and for 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.040
 months in the cars was technical 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.710
 the room according to reviews of social networks 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.360
 passengers were not happy about him 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.130
 hear the voice of Tatyana Dmitrievny speak 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.399
 much nicer I like 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.270
 heard well the sound is good everything is clear and 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.960

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.640
 normal voice growth rate clearly on 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.090
 the main thing to hear the announcement 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.310
 stops, I understand everything well 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.560
 all satisfied with the taste and subway passengers 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.729
 completely coincided with the opinion of the staff 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.700
 Samara subway 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:41.240
 I think that voice for many years 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.310
 I think it will be on subway cars 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.830
 but of course with the opening of the new station 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.880
 principle rewrite speech informant i 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.080
 I think that if the lead dmitry wants 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.500

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.929
 creative attitude then i think we and in 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.789
 next time, too, ask her employees 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.709

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:04.970
 changes in the information system 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.649
 Now Tatyana's voice will be Dmitry 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.019
 be followed by mars in on the way to 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:12.470
