think almost not nothing Amira thing or

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:44.900 
think almost not nothing Amira thing or
go<00:02:37.750> for<00:02:38.020> in<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.560> end<00:02:42.930> I'd<00:02:43.930> probably<00:02:44.260> say

go for in the end I'd probably say

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.060 
go for in the end I'd probably say
straightforward<00:02:45.910> dish<00:02:46.030> it<00:02:46.210> it<00:02:46.330> might<00:02:46.570> seem

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
straightforward dish it it might seem

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.310 
straightforward dish it it might seem
tricky<00:02:48.070> but<00:02:48.280> it's<00:02:48.460> not<00:02:48.730> but<00:02:49.030> it<00:02:49.090> would<00:02:49.240> be<00:02:49.420> Naza

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
tricky but it's not but it would be Naza

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.240 
tricky but it's not but it would be Naza
Koran<00:02:50.800> and<00:02:51.400> that's<00:02:51.670> just<00:02:52.290> fried<00:02:53.290> rice<00:02:53.650> but

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
Koran and that's just fried rice but

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.699 
Koran and that's just fried rice but
with<00:02:54.520> you<00:02:54.910> start<00:02:55.270> with<00:02:55.450> a<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.810> rem-pod<00:02:56.320> the

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
with you start with a a rem-pod the

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.820 
with you start with a a rem-pod the
spice<00:02:57.070> paste<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:58.390> you<00:02:58.570> fry<00:02:59.050> the<00:02:59.110> paste<00:02:59.500> and

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
spice paste and you fry the paste and

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.740 
spice paste and you fry the paste and
then<00:03:00.010> you<00:03:00.130> fry<00:03:00.370> previously<00:03:01.030> cooked<00:03:01.270> rice<00:03:01.540> and

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
then you fry previously cooked rice and

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.229 
then you fry previously cooked rice and
then<00:03:02.230> you<00:03:02.350> can<00:03:02.530> add<00:03:02.709> whatever<00:03:02.950> you<00:03:03.250> like<00:03:03.640> I

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
mean normally you'd add things like

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.670 
mean normally you'd add things like
spring<00:03:06.760> onion<00:03:07.150> maybe<00:03:07.330> cucumbers<00:03:08.080> thinly

spring onion maybe cucumbers thinly

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.280 
spring onion maybe cucumbers thinly
sliced<00:03:09.040> it's<00:03:09.730> a<00:03:09.850> bit<00:03:10.030> like<00:03:10.209> a<00:03:10.239> stir-fry<00:03:10.930> with

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
sliced it's a bit like a stir-fry with

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.640 
sliced it's a bit like a stir-fry with
rice<00:03:11.680> but<00:03:11.709> then<00:03:12.190> you<00:03:12.370> will<00:03:12.550> also<00:03:13.060> put<00:03:13.420> some

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
rice but then you will also put some

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.080 
rice but then you will also put some
protein<00:03:14.650> element<00:03:15.100> in<00:03:15.250> maybe<00:03:15.489> some<00:03:15.730> prawns

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
protein element in maybe some prawns

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.110 
protein element in maybe some prawns
maybe<00:03:16.450> some<00:03:16.720> chicken<00:03:16.989> maybe<00:03:17.860> I<00:03:17.980> like<00:03:18.580> actually

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120

fish I like making an a0 and then

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.670 
fish I like making an a0 and then
cooking<00:03:22.030> separately<00:03:22.720> something<00:03:23.110> is<00:03:23.290> simple

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
cooking separately something is simple

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.580 
cooking separately something is simple
like<00:03:23.709> a<00:03:23.910> mackerel<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:25.150> flaking<00:03:25.930> it<00:03:26.230> up<00:03:26.410> and

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
like a mackerel and flaking it up and

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.340 
like a mackerel and flaking it up and
putting<00:03:26.800> it<00:03:27.010> in<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.820> in<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.090> fried<00:03:28.360> rice<00:03:28.390> yeah

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
putting it in the in the fried rice yeah

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.460 
putting it in the in the fried rice yeah
I<00:03:29.380> think<00:03:29.560> I<00:03:29.860> think<00:03:30.100> does<00:03:30.370> it<00:03:30.900> for<00:03:31.900> home<00:03:32.110> cooking

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
I think I think does it for home cooking

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.130 
I think I think does it for home cooking
I<00:03:32.680> think<00:03:32.709> so<00:03:33.580> the<00:03:33.670> Nonya<00:03:34.090> food<00:03:34.360> comes<00:03:34.690> to<00:03:34.900> mind

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
I think so the Nonya food comes to mind

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.590 
I think so the Nonya food comes to mind
because<00:03:35.440> a<00:03:35.620> lot<00:03:35.860> of<00:03:36.010> a<00:03:36.250> lot<00:03:36.850> of<00:03:36.880> non<00:03:37.450> your

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
because a lot of a lot of non your

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.140 
because a lot of a lot of non your
dishes<00:03:37.810> are<00:03:38.170> sort<00:03:38.860> of<00:03:38.920> simple<00:03:39.400> stir<00:03:39.760> fries

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
dishes are sort of simple stir fries

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.500 
dishes are sort of simple stir fries
really<00:03:40.480> but<00:03:40.870> they<00:03:40.989> always<00:03:41.260> and<00:03:41.760> like<00:03:42.760> Nonya

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
really but they always and like Nonya

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.600 
really but they always and like Nonya
prawns<00:03:43.810> up<00:03:44.019> on<00:03:44.170> your<00:03:44.320> chicken<00:03:44.800> have<00:03:45.370> a<00:03:45.430> lot<00:03:45.580> of

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
prawns up on your chicken have a lot of

prawns up on your chicken have a lot of
chili<00:03:46.080> and<00:03:47.080> a<00:03:47.260> lot<00:03:47.620> of<00:03:47.650> lemongrass<00:03:48.430> terribly

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
chili and a lot of lemongrass terribly

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.330 
chili and a lot of lemongrass terribly
terribly<00:03:49.720> important<00:03:50.470> in<00:03:50.560> on<00:03:50.800> your<00:03:50.950> cooking

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
terribly important in on your cooking

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.110 
terribly important in on your cooking
and<00:03:51.489> of<00:03:52.590> course<00:03:53.590> plenty<00:03:53.830> of<00:03:54.100> chili<00:03:54.519> but

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
and of course plenty of chili but

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.000 
and of course plenty of chili but
they're<00:03:55.239> quite<00:03:55.480> easy<00:03:55.780> to<00:03:55.959> do<00:03:56.320> you<00:03:56.560> know

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
they're quite easy to do you know

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.940 
they're quite easy to do you know
generally<00:03:57.730> they're<00:03:57.880> just<00:03:58.060> stir-fried<00:03:58.690> with

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
generally they're just stir-fried with

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.400 
generally they're just stir-fried with
chili<00:03:59.950> and<00:04:00.160> lemon<00:04:00.490> grass<00:04:00.700> so<00:04:01.210> that's<00:04:01.720> probably

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
chili and lemon grass so that's probably

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.320 
chili and lemon grass so that's probably
if<00:04:02.920> I<00:04:03.130> wanted<00:04:03.550> to

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
if I wanted to

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.140 
if I wanted to
so<00:04:04.930> to<00:04:04.990> say<00:04:05.230> right<00:04:05.500> this<00:04:05.920> is<00:04:06.220> a<00:04:06.640> typical

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
so to say right this is a typical

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.840 
so to say right this is a typical
Malaysian<00:04:07.930> dish<00:04:08.230> of<00:04:08.440> it<00:04:08.560> and<00:04:08.770> it's<00:04:09.250> easy<00:04:09.430> to<00:04:09.670> do

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
Malaysian dish of it and it's easy to do

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:10.980 
Malaysian dish of it and it's easy to do
that's<00:04:10.450> where<00:04:10.660> I'd<00:04:10.780> go

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
that's where I'd go

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.200 
that's where I'd go
I<00:04:11.200> sort<00:04:11.440> of<00:04:11.470> stir<00:04:11.740> fried<00:04:12.040> prawns<00:04:12.400> or<00:04:12.670> we're

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.210 
I sort of stir fried prawns or we're

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.600 
I sort of stir fried prawns or we're
