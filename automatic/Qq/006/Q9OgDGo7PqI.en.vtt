hello<00:00:01.890> everybody<00:00:02.389> I'm<00:00:03.389> doing<00:00:03.689> a<00:00:03.750> review<00:00:04.049> of

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:04.580 
hello everybody I'm doing a review of

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.740 
hello everybody I'm doing a review of
two<00:00:05.580> headphones<00:00:06.089> sighs<00:00:06.990> are<00:00:08.480> imperior<00:00:09.480> and

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
two headphones sighs are imperior and

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.610 
two headphones sighs are imperior and
science<00:00:10.260> are<00:00:10.380> momentum<00:00:11.040> and<00:00:12.440> these<00:00:13.440> two

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
science are momentum and these two

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.499 
science are momentum and these two
headphones<00:00:13.950> are<00:00:14.250> in<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.580> similar<00:00:14.790> price<00:00:15.150> range

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
headphones are in a similar price range

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.930 
headphones are in a similar price range
so<00:00:15.650> I'm<00:00:16.650> mostly<00:00:17.160> going<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.369> talk<00:00:17.520> about<00:00:17.670> how

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
so I'm mostly going to talk about how

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.029 
so I'm mostly going to talk about how
they<00:00:18.119> fit<00:00:18.510> what<00:00:18.960> are<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.199> differences<00:00:19.590> and

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
they fit what are the differences and

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.590 
they fit what are the differences and
like<00:00:21.710> I'm<00:00:22.710> basically<00:00:23.220> which<00:00:24.090> one<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.420> should

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
like I'm basically which one you should

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:32.049 
like I'm basically which one you should
buy<00:00:25.880> okay<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:28.220> here<00:00:29.220> we<00:00:29.400> have<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.699> imperior

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
buy okay so here we have the imperior

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.680 
buy okay so here we have the imperior
dampier<00:00:34.010> the<00:00:35.010> quality<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.730> built<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.329> a

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
dampier the quality the built is a

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.410 
dampier the quality the built is a
little<00:00:37.079> bit<00:00:37.230> more<00:00:37.380> plasticky<00:00:38.300> it's<00:00:41.030> the<00:00:42.030> cops

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
little bit more plasticky it's the cops

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.110 
little bit more plasticky it's the cops
itself<00:00:43.020> are<00:00:43.200> aluminum<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.190> cable<00:00:44.640> itself<00:00:44.789> is

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
itself are aluminum the cable itself is

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.000 
itself are aluminum the cable itself is
pretty<00:00:45.300> thick<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.500> sense<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.980> very

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
pretty thick so in that sense a very

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.209 
pretty thick so in that sense a very
good<00:00:47.550> build<00:00:48.050> but<00:00:49.050> at<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.289> same<00:00:49.559> time<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:50.190> have

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
good build but at the same time you have

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.720 
good build but at the same time you have
these<00:00:50.700> little<00:00:51.539> things<00:00:51.719> here<00:00:52.260> which<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.800> don't

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
these little things here which I don't

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.139 
these little things here which I don't
know<00:00:54.180> like<00:00:54.210> if<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.840> will<00:00:55.020> break<00:00:55.230> or<00:00:55.500> not<00:00:56.149> also

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
know like if it will break or not also

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.060 
know like if it will break or not also
you<00:00:57.210> see<00:00:57.629> where<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.079> wire<00:00:58.289> goes<00:00:58.620> into<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
you see where the wire goes into the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:07.179 
you see where the wire goes into the
headphone<00:01:01.280> on<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.579> other<00:01:02.789> hand<00:01:04.580> momentum<00:01:05.580> is

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
headphone on the other hand momentum is

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.580 
headphone on the other hand momentum is
made<00:01:08.189> from<00:01:08.689> i'm<00:01:09.689> not<00:01:09.869> sure<00:01:09.930> if<00:01:10.080> they're<00:01:10.350> still

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
made from i'm not sure if they're still

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.690 
made from i'm not sure if they're still
or<00:01:10.860> aluminum<00:01:11.340> there<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:12.260> leather<00:01:13.700> padding

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
or aluminum there is leather padding

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.719 
or aluminum there is leather padding
here<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.470> there's<00:01:16.470> leather<00:01:16.920> but<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.460> ear

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
here and there's leather but the ear

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.910 
here and there's leather but the ear
copies<00:01:18.119> themselves<00:01:19.049> are<00:01:19.229> leather<00:01:20.060> but<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
copies themselves are leather but the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.560 
copies themselves are leather but the
this<00:01:22.920> part<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.340> headphone<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:24.060> made<00:01:24.450> out

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
this part of the headphone is made out

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.300 
this part of the headphone is made out
of<00:01:24.689> plastic<00:01:26.540> the<00:01:27.540> cable<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:27.990> also<00:01:28.409> quite<00:01:28.829> thick

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
of plastic the cable is also quite thick

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.920 
of plastic the cable is also quite thick
not<00:01:29.610> as<00:01:29.790> thick<00:01:30.119> as<00:01:30.650> the<00:01:31.650> amperior<00:01:32.400> but<00:01:32.880> i<00:01:33.150> mean

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
not as thick as the amperior but i mean

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.719 
not as thick as the amperior but i mean
as<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.140> can<00:01:34.380> see<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.710> amperior<00:01:35.070> itself<00:01:35.610> the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
as you can see the amperior itself the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.670 
as you can see the amperior itself the
cable<00:01:36.030> changes<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:36.570> it's<00:01:36.689> all<00:01:36.930> set<00:01:37.140> thick<00:01:37.439> and

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
cable changes so it's all set thick and

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.720 
cable changes so it's all set thick and
then<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.670> turns<00:01:39.210> into<00:01:39.390> a

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730 
then it turns into a

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.300 
then it turns into a
dinner<00:01:39.880> table<00:01:41.910> momentum<00:01:42.910> cut<00:01:43.300> the<00:01:43.420> cable<00:01:43.810> is

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
dinner table momentum cut the cable is

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.220 
dinner table momentum cut the cable is
slightly<00:01:45.310> thicker<00:01:45.730> than<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.060> thinner<00:01:46.870> part

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.230 
slightly thicker than the thinner part

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.870 
slightly thicker than the thinner part
of<00:01:47.320> the<00:01:47.380> interior<00:01:47.770> but<00:01:48.370> I<00:01:48.400> mean<00:01:48.580> it's<00:01:48.700> a<00:01:48.760> good

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
of the interior but I mean it's a good

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.360 
of the interior but I mean it's a good
cable<00:01:49.090> /<00:01:50.160> also<00:01:51.160> the<00:01:51.390> momentum<00:01:53.070> has<00:01:54.070> this

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
cable / also the momentum has this

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.580 
cable / also the momentum has this
microphone<00:01:55.210> part<00:01:55.480> that<00:01:55.630> works<00:01:55.810> for<00:01:56.080> iphone

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
microphone part that works for iphone

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.200 
microphone part that works for iphone
and<00:01:57.180> phones<00:01:58.180> in<00:01:58.420> general<00:01:59.760> damn<00:02:00.760> perry<00:02:01.000> has

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
and phones in general damn perry has

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.670 
and phones in general damn perry has
that<00:02:01.420> too<00:02:01.540> but<00:02:01.690> the<00:02:01.810> momentum<00:02:02.260> has<00:02:02.410> a<00:02:02.440> better

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
that too but the momentum has a better

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.220 
that too but the momentum has a better
bill<00:02:03.280> to<00:02:03.580> it<00:02:03.670> I<00:02:03.790> guess<00:02:03.820> it's<00:02:04.330> aluminum<00:02:04.900> it's<00:02:05.140> a

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
bill to it I guess it's aluminum it's a

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.070 
bill to it I guess it's aluminum it's a
little<00:02:05.440> bit<00:02:05.530> heavy<00:02:05.770> it's<00:02:06.430> very<00:02:06.670> nice<00:02:06.850> and<00:02:07.300> also

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
little bit heavy it's very nice and also

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.070 
little bit heavy it's very nice and also
the<00:02:08.320> the<00:02:08.619> jack<00:02:08.920> itself<00:02:09.520> is<00:02:09.760> quite<00:02:10.330> unique<00:02:10.660> it

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
the the jack itself is quite unique it

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.770 
the the jack itself is quite unique it
like<00:02:11.590> when<00:02:11.770> you<00:02:12.040> can<00:02:12.310> plug<00:02:12.670> it<00:02:12.820> in<00:02:12.970> and<00:02:13.480> you<00:02:13.630> can

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
like when you can plug it in and you can

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.080 
like when you can plug it in and you can
turn<00:02:14.320> it<00:02:14.410> into<00:02:14.530> an<00:02:14.710> L<00:02:14.890> type<00:02:15.160> jack<00:02:15.460> or<00:02:15.700> equal<00:02:15.940> to

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
turn it into an L type jack or equal to

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.570 
turn it into an L type jack or equal to
turn<00:02:16.540> turn<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.260> a<00:02:17.290> normal<00:02:17.740> giant<00:02:18.190> straight<00:02:18.400> job

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
turn turn to a normal giant straight job

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.880 
turn turn to a normal giant straight job
which<00:02:19.270> is<00:02:19.420> cool<00:02:19.630> I<00:02:19.870> guess<00:02:21.300> but<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:23.380> difference

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
which is cool I guess but the difference

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.600 
which is cool I guess but the difference
for<00:02:23.980> me<00:02:24.430> was<00:02:25.470> my<00:02:26.470> main<00:02:26.710> issue<00:02:26.890> between<00:02:27.190> them

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
for me was my main issue between them

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.670 
for me was my main issue between them
was<00:02:27.850> their<00:02:28.150> faith<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.110> their<00:02:29.170> comfort

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
was their faith and their comfort

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.310 
was their faith and their comfort
because<00:02:29.830> there's<00:02:30.220> sound<00:02:30.840> they're<00:02:31.840> actually

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
because there's sound they're actually

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.490 
because there's sound they're actually
very<00:02:32.350> similar<00:02:33.240> you<00:02:34.240> can<00:02:34.630> watch<00:02:34.960> other<00:02:35.200> videos

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
very similar you can watch other videos

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.800 
very similar you can watch other videos
like<00:02:36.010> from<00:02:36.430> audio<00:02:36.790> files<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:37.330> they<00:02:37.630> would

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
like from audio files and they would

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.470 
like from audio files and they would
like<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:39.370> can<00:02:39.490> find<00:02:39.760> it<00:02:39.880> yourself<00:02:39.970> and<00:02:40.390> they

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
like you can find it yourself and they

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.420 
like you can find it yourself and they
will<00:02:40.630> tell<00:02:40.810> you<00:02:40.930> like<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.620> specific

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
will tell you like the specific

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.670 
will tell you like the specific
differences<00:02:42.640> in<00:02:43.060> their<00:02:43.180> sound<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:43.780> I'm<00:02:44.440> not

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
differences in their sound and I'm not

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.110 
differences in their sound and I'm not
going<00:02:44.770> to<00:02:44.860> focus<00:02:45.040> on<00:02:45.280> that<00:02:45.459> a<00:02:45.520> lot<00:02:45.760> I'm<00:02:46.000> going

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
going to focus on that a lot I'm going

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.240 
going to focus on that a lot I'm going
to<00:02:46.209> focus<00:02:46.330> on<00:02:46.570> their<00:02:46.690> fit<00:02:46.990> mostly<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:47.709> their

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
to focus on their fit mostly and their

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.490 
to focus on their fit mostly and their
build<00:02:48.520> quality<00:02:48.760> but<00:02:49.510> sound<00:02:49.840> wise<00:02:50.050> i<00:02:50.170> can<00:02:50.320> tell

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
build quality but sound wise i can tell

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.030 
build quality but sound wise i can tell
you<00:02:50.590> they're<00:02:50.770> very<00:02:51.070> similar<00:02:51.310> but<00:02:52.620> I'm<00:02:53.620> period

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
you they're very similar but I'm period

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.720 
you they're very similar but I'm period
has<00:02:54.310> a<00:02:54.490> slightly<00:02:55.090> stronger<00:02:55.840> base<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:56.730> this

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
has a slightly stronger base and this

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.970 
has a slightly stronger base and this
sound<00:02:58.000> just<00:02:58.300> to<00:02:58.900> me<00:02:59.080> it<00:02:59.140> sounds<00:02:59.380> a<00:02:59.590> little<00:02:59.860> bit

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
sound just to me it sounds a little bit

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.220 
sound just to me it sounds a little bit
more<00:03:00.160> aggressive<00:03:00.510> meanwhile<00:03:01.510> momentum<00:03:02.050> is<00:03:02.200> a

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
more aggressive meanwhile momentum is a

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.670 
more aggressive meanwhile momentum is a
more<00:03:02.739> I<00:03:03.040> guess<00:03:03.550> slightly<00:03:04.090> more<00:03:04.270> neutral<00:03:04.690> in

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
more I guess slightly more neutral in

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.220 
more I guess slightly more neutral in
that<00:03:05.920> sense<00:03:06.160> but<00:03:07.060> there's<00:03:07.510> still<00:03:07.690> there<00:03:08.110> it

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
that sense but there's still there it

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.630 
that sense but there's still there it
sounds<00:03:08.620> amazing<00:03:08.860> both<00:03:09.250> of<00:03:09.430> them

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.530 

okay<00:03:13.640> so<00:03:14.000> momentum<00:03:14.630> they<00:03:15.320> claim<00:03:15.740> that<00:03:16.300> it<00:03:17.300> goes

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
okay so momentum they claim that it goes

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.840 
okay so momentum they claim that it goes
around<00:03:17.780> you<00:03:18.200> here<00:03:19.360> but<00:03:20.360> my<00:03:20.630> issue<00:03:20.870> was<00:03:21.230> that<00:03:21.850> my

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
around you here but my issue was that my

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.360 
around you here but my issue was that my
ears<00:03:23.210> are<00:03:23.480> six<00:03:24.170> months<00:03:24.470> of<00:03:24.650> six<00:03:25.040> point<00:03:25.220> seven

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
ears are six months of six point seven

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.430 
ears are six months of six point seven
centimeters<00:03:26.830> long<00:03:27.830> and<00:03:28.600> that's<00:03:29.600> slightly

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
centimeters long and that's slightly

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.340 
centimeters long and that's slightly
above<00:03:30.770> average<00:03:30.920> that's<00:03:31.430> not<00:03:31.600> huge<00:03:32.600> is<00:03:32.840> just

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
above average that's not huge is just

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.920 
above average that's not huge is just
like<00:03:33.620> slightly<00:03:33.890> above<00:03:34.190> average<00:03:34.340> but<00:03:35.209> I<00:03:35.480> had

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
like slightly above average but I had

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.470 
like slightly above average but I had
trouble<00:03:36.440> fitting<00:03:37.010> it<00:03:37.280> into<00:03:37.520> this<00:03:37.760> thing<00:03:38.060> like

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
trouble fitting it into this thing like

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.440 
trouble fitting it into this thing like
as<00:03:39.350> you<00:03:39.530> can<00:03:39.680> see<00:03:39.830> the<00:03:39.980> cops<00:03:40.250> are<00:03:40.400> not<00:03:40.550> that<00:03:41.150> big

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
as you can see the cops are not that big

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.540 
as you can see the cops are not that big
and<00:03:42.440> that<00:03:44.200> I<00:03:45.200> my<00:03:45.470> ear<00:03:45.680> was<00:03:45.860> literally<00:03:46.250> like

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
and that I my ear was literally like

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.010 
and that I my ear was literally like
squeezing<00:03:47.060> in<00:03:47.209> there<00:03:47.360> and<00:03:47.510> I<00:03:47.540> was<00:03:47.630> touching

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
squeezing in there and I was touching

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.010 
squeezing in there and I was touching
the<00:03:48.140> drive<00:03:48.440> and<00:03:48.739> I<00:03:49.520> also<00:03:49.760> wear<00:03:50.090> glasses<00:03:50.390> so

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
the drive and I also wear glasses so

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.290 
the drive and I also wear glasses so
like<00:03:51.739> this<00:03:51.980> part<00:03:52.250> of<00:03:52.370> it<00:03:52.459> was<00:03:52.640> slightly<00:03:53.000> like

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
like this part of it was slightly like

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.990 
like this part of it was slightly like
pushing<00:03:53.810> on<00:03:54.050> top<00:03:54.590> of<00:03:54.770> my<00:03:54.890> year<00:03:55.130> which<00:03:55.340> was<00:03:55.550> it

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
pushing on top of my year which was it

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.580 
pushing on top of my year which was it
which<00:03:56.630> was<00:03:56.780> pretty<00:03:56.989> bad<00:03:58.300> so<00:03:59.300> i<00:03:59.690> tried<00:04:00.560> the

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
which was pretty bad so i tried the

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.850 
which was pretty bad so i tried the
amperior<00:04:01.310> which<00:04:02.239> I<00:04:02.390> heard<00:04:02.720> it<00:04:03.350> could<00:04:03.560> also<00:04:03.709> be

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
amperior which I heard it could also be

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.640 
amperior which I heard it could also be
uncomfortable<00:04:04.489> with<00:04:04.610> glasses<00:04:05.290> but<00:04:06.290> the<00:04:06.440> thing

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
uncomfortable with glasses but the thing

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.770 
uncomfortable with glasses but the thing
is<00:04:06.680> that<00:04:06.830> drivers<00:04:07.760> themselves<00:04:07.940> are<00:04:08.390> kind<00:04:08.720> of

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
is that drivers themselves are kind of

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.770 
is that drivers themselves are kind of
smaller<00:04:09.200> and<00:04:10.000> therefore<00:04:12.430> you<00:04:13.430> could<00:04:13.640> miss<00:04:14.390> the

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
smaller and therefore you could miss the

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.860 
smaller and therefore you could miss the
top<00:04:15.050> part<00:04:15.320> of<00:04:15.380> your<00:04:15.440> ear<00:04:16.120> to<00:04:17.120> me<00:04:17.299> really

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
top part of your ear to me really

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.320 
top part of your ear to me really
honestly<00:04:18.080> it<00:04:18.560> all<00:04:18.830> depends<00:04:19.310> on<00:04:19.400> what<00:04:20.060> type<00:04:20.299> of

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
honestly it all depends on what type of

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.290 
honestly it all depends on what type of
you<00:04:20.570> what's<00:04:21.320> the<00:04:21.440> size<00:04:21.680> of<00:04:21.830> your<00:04:21.859> ear<00:04:22.250> if<00:04:23.150> you

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
you what's the size of your ear if you

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.210 
you what's the size of your ear if you
have<00:04:23.419> a<00:04:23.450> small<00:04:23.840> year<00:04:24.140> I<00:04:24.320> think<00:04:24.860> the<00:04:24.950> momentum

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
have a small year I think the momentum

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.800 
have a small year I think the momentum
will<00:04:25.580> be<00:04:25.700> fine<00:04:25.970> even<00:04:26.210> if<00:04:26.479> you<00:04:26.630> wear<00:04:26.780> glasses

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
will be fine even if you wear glasses

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.530 
will be fine even if you wear glasses
because<00:04:27.550> it's<00:04:28.550> gonna<00:04:28.700> miss<00:04:29.000> that<00:04:29.030> part<00:04:29.419> of

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
because it's gonna miss that part of

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.900 
because it's gonna miss that part of
your<00:04:29.660> ear<00:04:29.900> and<00:04:30.130> go<00:04:31.130> it's<00:04:31.370> going<00:04:31.640> to<00:04:31.700> go<00:04:31.790> around

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
your ear and go it's going to go around

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.460 
your ear and go it's going to go around
your<00:04:32.240> ear<00:04:32.390> but<00:04:32.630> if<00:04:32.750> you<00:04:32.870> have<00:04:33.050> a<00:04:33.080> slightly

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
your ear but if you have a slightly

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.710 
your ear but if you have a slightly
bigger<00:04:33.770> than<00:04:34.640> average<00:04:34.820> year<00:04:35.240> i<00:04:35.390> would<00:04:35.570> say

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
bigger than average year i would say

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.940 
bigger than average year i would say
anything<00:04:36.050> above<00:04:36.290> 6.5<00:04:36.680> or<00:04:37.400> above<00:04:38.240> that<00:04:38.950> then

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
anything above 6.5 or above that then

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.030 
anything above 6.5 or above that then
you<00:04:40.160> could<00:04:40.340> use<00:04:41.080> amperior<00:04:42.080> in<00:04:42.320> the<00:04:42.650> sense<00:04:42.919> that

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
you could use amperior in the sense that

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.490 
you could use amperior in the sense that
you<00:04:43.460> could<00:04:43.669> bring<00:04:43.850> it<00:04:44.030> lower<00:04:44.570> slightly<00:04:45.260> and

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
you could bring it lower slightly and

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.430 
you could bring it lower slightly and
you<00:04:45.710> will<00:04:45.860> miss<00:04:46.100> that<00:04:46.130> part<00:04:46.490> of<00:04:46.669> your<00:04:46.760> ear<00:04:46.970> that

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
you will miss that part of your ear that

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.250 
you will miss that part of your ear that
the<00:04:48.440> glass<00:04:48.620> is<00:04:48.680> touch<00:04:49.600> basically<00:04:50.600> the<00:04:50.900> top<00:04:51.110> of

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
the glass is touch basically the top of

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.690 
the glass is touch basically the top of
year

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:59.330 

and<00:04:56.570> yeah<00:04:57.570> other<00:04:57.780> than<00:04:57.900> that<00:04:58.050> there's<00:04:58.500> nothing

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
and yeah other than that there's nothing

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.610 
and yeah other than that there's nothing
else<00:04:59.670> I<00:04:59.820> guess<00:05:00.060> I<00:05:00.270> could<00:05:00.570> say<00:05:00.720> like<00:05:00.930> this

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
else I guess I could say like this

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.890 
else I guess I could say like this
completely<00:05:02.430> sits<00:05:02.760> on<00:05:03.000> your<00:05:03.180> ear<00:05:03.450> but<00:05:03.780> it's

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
completely sits on your ear but it's

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.610 
completely sits on your ear but it's
this<00:05:04.440> pretty<00:05:04.860> comfortable<00:05:05.340> and<00:05:05.460> breathable

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
this pretty comfortable and breathable

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.590 
this pretty comfortable and breathable
the<00:05:07.620> fit<00:05:08.040> is<00:05:08.250> a<00:05:08.310> little<00:05:08.700> bit<00:05:08.820> tighter<00:05:09.210> than

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
the fit is a little bit tighter than

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.030 
the fit is a little bit tighter than
momentum<00:05:10.200> it<00:05:10.940> presses<00:05:11.940> it<00:05:12.720> pushes<00:05:13.260> together<00:05:13.440> a

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
momentum it presses it pushes together a

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.160 
momentum it presses it pushes together a
slightly<00:05:14.580> stronger<00:05:15.060> than<00:05:15.630> the<00:05:15.900> momentum<00:05:18.170> but

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.170 
slightly stronger than the momentum but

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:24.500 
slightly stronger than the momentum but
I<00:05:19.410> identified<00:05:20.370> that<00:05:20.550> to<00:05:20.730> be<00:05:20.990> uncomfortable<00:05:23.510> so

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
I identified that to be uncomfortable so

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.120 
I identified that to be uncomfortable so
but<00:05:24.990> I<00:05:25.020> guess<00:05:25.260> we'll<00:05:25.440> just<00:05:25.470> have<00:05:25.710> to<00:05:25.830> wait<00:05:26.070> and

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
but I guess we'll just have to wait and

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.740 
but I guess we'll just have to wait and
see<00:05:26.310> for<00:05:26.640> them<00:05:27.620> if<00:05:28.620> if<00:05:29.340> I<00:05:29.610> had<00:05:29.790> smaller<00:05:30.180> ears<00:05:30.600> I

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
see for them if if I had smaller ears I

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.840 
see for them if if I had smaller ears I
would<00:05:30.990> be<00:05:31.110> more<00:05:31.410> than<00:05:31.440> happy<00:05:31.590> to<00:05:32.280> use<00:05:32.610> momentum

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
would be more than happy to use momentum

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.270 
would be more than happy to use momentum
because<00:05:33.270> it's<00:05:33.540> just<00:05:33.570> so<00:05:33.750> nice<00:05:34.110> in<00:05:34.350> the<00:05:34.500> quality

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
because it's just so nice in the quality

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.860 
because it's just so nice in the quality
the<00:05:35.940> build<00:05:36.210> quality<00:05:36.360> is<00:05:36.630> so<00:05:36.840> well<00:05:37.790> but<00:05:38.870> because

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
the build quality is so well but because

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.080 
the build quality is so well but because
it<00:05:40.230> bothers<00:05:41.100> my<00:05:41.250> ears<00:05:41.460> then<00:05:41.670> I<00:05:41.730> guess<00:05:41.910> I<00:05:41.940> have

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
it bothers my ears then I guess I have

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.180 
it bothers my ears then I guess I have
to<00:05:42.300> try<00:05:42.690> this<00:05:42.750> one<00:05:43.110> and<00:05:43.290> see<00:05:43.470> how<00:05:43.650> it<00:05:43.860> goes<00:05:44.010> with

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
to try this one and see how it goes with

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.580 
to try this one and see how it goes with
this<00:05:44.310> one<00:05:44.490> oh<00:05:44.670> also<00:05:45.180> and<00:05:45.420> one<00:05:45.570> more<00:05:45.750> thing<00:05:45.780> the

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
this one oh also and one more thing the

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.440 
this one oh also and one more thing the
momentum<00:05:46.800> comes<00:05:47.280> with<00:05:47.490> the<00:05:47.640> case<00:05:48.000> let<00:05:48.300> me

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.450 
momentum comes with the case let me

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:55.990 
momentum comes with the case let me
actually<00:05:48.750> bring<00:05:49.140> the<00:05:49.290> case

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.430 

yeah<00:05:57.000> this<00:05:57.210> is<00:05:57.360> the<00:05:57.479> case<00:05:57.690> that<00:05:57.720> the<00:05:58.139> momentum

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
yeah this is the case that the momentum

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:05.060 
yeah this is the case that the momentum
comes<00:05:58.889> with<00:05:59.190> it's<00:05:59.790> a<00:05:59.850> nice<00:06:00.030> case<00:06:03.380> but<00:06:04.380> yeah<00:06:04.800> the

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
comes with it's a nice case but yeah the

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.730 
comes with it's a nice case but yeah the
Empire<00:06:05.669> doesn't<00:06:05.789> come<00:06:06.180> with<00:06:06.330> any<00:06:06.389> cases<00:06:06.930> which

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
Empire doesn't come with any cases which

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.340 
Empire doesn't come with any cases which
is<00:06:07.949> bad<00:06:08.550> I<00:06:08.850> guess<00:06:09.090> but<00:06:09.720> it's<00:06:09.900> just<00:06:10.080> the<00:06:10.139> case

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
is bad I guess but it's just the case

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.310 
is bad I guess but it's just the case
you<00:06:10.470> could<00:06:10.620> get<00:06:10.770> a<00:06:10.800> case<00:06:11.009> for<00:06:11.190> my<00:06:11.280> new<00:06:11.310> and<00:06:12.320> that

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
you could get a case for my new and that

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.520 
you could get a case for my new and that
would<00:06:13.470> be<00:06:13.500> my<00:06:13.830> review<00:06:14.100> for<00:06:14.130> today
