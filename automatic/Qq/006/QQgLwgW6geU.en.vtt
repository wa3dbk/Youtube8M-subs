dip it in and then you're not supposed
to<00:01:46.710> shake<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.220> because<00:01:47.450> when<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:49.100> pull<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.250> out

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
to shake it because when you pull it out

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.780 
to shake it because when you pull it out

with the pink sulphur the white liquid

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.389 
with the pink sulphur the white liquid
is<00:01:54.060> what<00:01:54.329> kind<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.600> activates<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:56.340> don't

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
is what kind of activates it and I don't

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.130 
is what kind of activates it and I don't
know<00:01:56.610> how<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:56.939> works<00:01:57.149> that's<00:01:57.390> how<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.659> explain

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
know how it works that's how you explain

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.870 
know how it works that's how you explain
it<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.409> me<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.770> that's<00:01:59.340> when<00:01:59.549> you're<00:01:59.670> supposed

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
it to me and that's when you're supposed

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.450 
it to me and that's when you're supposed
to<00:01:59.939> put<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.240> on<00:02:00.420> your<00:02:00.630> blemishes<00:02:01.040> pink<00:02:02.040> when

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
to put it on your blemishes pink when

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.389 
to put it on your blemishes pink when
you<00:02:02.640> put<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.270> on<00:02:03.360> your<00:02:03.509> blemish<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.310> you

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
you put it on your blemish and so you

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.889 
you put it on your blemish and so you
can't<00:02:05.610> really<00:02:05.670> go<00:02:05.939> out<00:02:05.969> with<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.420> because<00:02:06.750> it

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
can't really go out with it because it

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.100 
can't really go out with it because it
does<00:02:07.049> dry<00:02:07.350> very<00:02:08.250> pink<00:02:08.789> now<00:02:09.420> my<00:02:09.569> experience

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
does dry very pink now my experience

they come to a head and then they

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.780 
they come to a head and then they
eventually<00:02:35.750> go<00:02:36.200> away<00:02:36.230> those<00:02:37.040> that<00:02:37.370> worked<00:02:37.579> on

not a dermatologist or anything but my
sister<00:03:02.120> works<00:03:02.299> with<00:03:02.419> the<00:03:02.510> dermatologist<00:03:02.780> and

those<00:03:06.680> huge<00:03:07.069> pimples<00:03:07.519> you<00:03:07.669> need<00:03:07.819> something

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
those huge pimples you need something

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.119 
those huge pimples you need something
you<00:03:08.900> need<00:03:09.139> to<00:03:09.260> treat<00:03:09.469> them<00:03:09.650> from<00:03:09.859> the<00:03:09.980> inside

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:10.129 
you need to treat them from the inside

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.920 
you need to treat them from the inside
so<00:03:10.879> you<00:03:10.969> need<00:03:11.120> to<00:03:11.180> take<00:03:11.359> something<00:03:11.569> like

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
so you need to take something like

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.319 
so you need to take something like
orally<00:03:12.500> that's<00:03:13.040> just<00:03:13.280> what<00:03:13.400> I've<00:03:13.489> heard<00:03:13.730> and

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
orally that's just what I've heard and

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.170 
orally that's just what I've heard and
it<00:03:15.230> makes<00:03:15.469> sense<00:03:15.680> so<00:03:16.489> is<00:03:16.609> it<00:03:16.730> a<00:03:16.760> good<00:03:16.819> product

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180
