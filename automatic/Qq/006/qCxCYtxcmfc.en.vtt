and<00:00:04.589> then<00:00:04.740> we'll<00:00:04.799> break<00:00:05.069> it<00:00:05.250> down<00:00:05.279> together

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.539 

those<00:00:12.690> are<00:00:12.900> scuffle<00:00:13.290> hop<00:00:13.440> steps<00:00:13.740> now<00:00:14.190> let's

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
those are scuffle hop steps now let's

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.720 
those are scuffle hop steps now let's
break<00:00:14.759> it<00:00:14.940> down<00:00:14.969> now<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:16.199> normal<00:00:16.680> scuffle<00:00:17.550> if

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
and you're learning how to do them when

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.310 
and you're learning how to do them when
you're<00:00:38.460> actually<00:00:39.000> doing<00:00:39.210> like<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.719> scuffle

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
you're actually doing like a scuffle

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.069 
you're actually doing like a scuffle
step<00:00:40.649> or<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> scuffle<00:00:41.670> hop<00:00:42.059> step<00:00:42.420> which<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:42.870> what

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
step or a scuffle hop step which is what

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.540 
step or a scuffle hop step which is what
we're<00:00:43.170> gonna<00:00:43.290> learn<00:00:43.440> right<00:00:43.680> now<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:44.370> do<00:00:44.520> a

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
we're gonna learn right now you do a

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.330 
we're gonna learn right now you do a
heel<00:00:45.000> dig<00:00:45.270> instead<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.050> scuff<00:00:46.410> so<00:00:47.039> instead

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
heel dig instead of the scuff so instead

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.020 
heel dig instead of the scuff so instead
of<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.640> sound<00:00:48.230> you're<00:00:49.230> just<00:00:49.440> getting<00:00:49.710> this

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
of this sound you're just getting this

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.549 
of this sound you're just getting this
so<00:00:51.030> it's<00:00:51.210> very<00:00:51.360> similar<00:00:51.840> but<00:00:52.079> you're<00:00:52.410> not

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
so it's very similar but you're not

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.350 
so it's very similar but you're not
getting<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.949> same<00:00:53.160> motion<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:53.969> there's<00:00:54.149> no

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
getting the same motion so there's no

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.060 
getting the same motion so there's no
like<00:00:54.570> you're<00:00:55.079> not<00:00:55.230> picking<00:00:55.559> your<00:00:55.649> leg<00:00:55.829> up<00:00:55.980> in

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
like you're not picking your leg up in

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.290

exaggerated<00:00:57.960> move<00:00:58.170> you're<00:00:59.070> just<00:00:59.340> doing<00:00:59.609> a

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
exaggerated move you're just doing a

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.080 
exaggerated move you're just doing a
heel<00:00:59.969> dig<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:00.359> front<00:01:00.629> heel<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.100> said

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
all those little noises that you get

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.080 
all those little noises that you get
when<00:01:59.070> your<00:01:59.189> heels<00:01:59.460> are<00:01:59.670> down<00:01:59.790> on<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.060> ground

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
it's a little harder to balance but when

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.709
