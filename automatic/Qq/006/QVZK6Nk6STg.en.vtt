you<00:02:21.590> don't<00:02:21.800> need<00:02:22.100> to<00:02:22.340> use<00:02:22.720> that's<00:02:23.720> but

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
you don't need to use that's but

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.699 
you don't need to use that's but
something<00:02:24.790> long<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:25.820> thin<00:02:26.239> and<00:02:26.510> great<00:02:27.440> made

something long and thin and great made

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.970 
something long and thin and great made
of<00:02:27.860> plastic<00:02:28.340> would<00:02:28.489> be<00:02:28.610> ideal<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.270> you<00:02:29.980> can

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
of plastic would be ideal and you can

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.190 
of plastic would be ideal and you can
see<00:02:31.190> around<00:02:31.550> there<00:02:32.060> is<00:02:32.209> hot<00:02:32.450> glue

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
see around there is hot glue

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.920 
see around there is hot glue
so<00:02:34.070> basically<00:02:34.400> I've<00:02:34.580> hot<00:02:34.820> glued<00:02:34.850> an<00:02:35.390> airtight

so basically I've hot glued an airtight
seal<00:02:36.430> around<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.959> conditioner<00:02:38.959> bottle<00:02:39.400> to

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.550 
you don't know how to clear it all
neatly<00:02:53.150> you<00:02:53.360> don't<00:02:53.510> need<00:02:53.690> it<00:02:53.840> because<00:02:54.320> you<00:02:54.410> can

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
neatly you don't need it because you can

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.340 
neatly you don't need it because you can
see<00:02:54.590> there's<00:02:54.950> just<00:02:55.010> a<00:02:55.220> hole<00:02:55.660> inside<00:02:56.660> but<00:02:57.200> it's

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
see there's just a hole inside but it's

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.160 
see there's just a hole inside but it's
easier<00:02:57.650> to<00:02:57.739> blow<00:02:57.950> through<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.340> spout<00:02:59.019> down<00:03:00.019> it

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
easier to blow through the spout down it

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.300 
easier to blow through the spout down it
is<00:03:00.850> directly<00:03:01.850> into<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.209> hole<00:03:02.829> so<00:03:03.829> you<00:03:03.920> put

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
is directly into the hole so you put

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.360 
is directly into the hole so you put
your<00:03:04.340> lips<00:03:04.640> to<00:03:04.820> the<00:03:04.850> spout<00:03:05.269> and<00:03:05.600> blow<00:03:06.370> what's

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
your lips to the spout and blow what's

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.100 
your lips to the spout and blow what's
inside<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.880> hole<00:03:08.090> and<00:03:08.329> see<00:03:08.480> inside<00:03:08.600> the<00:03:08.900> hole

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
inside the hole and see inside the hole

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.900 
inside the hole and see inside the hole
there's<00:03:09.410> a<00:03:09.470> little<00:03:09.799> chain<00:03:10.070> with<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.370> plastic

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
there's a little chain with the plastic

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.930 
there's a little chain with the plastic
the<00:03:11.570> plastic<00:03:11.620> bottle<00:03:12.620> is<00:03:14.500> transparent<00:03:15.500> so<00:03:15.940> you

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
the plastic bottle is transparent so you

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.910 
the plastic bottle is transparent so you
can<00:03:17.090> see<00:03:17.239> through<00:03:17.450> it<00:03:17.540> but<00:03:17.750> around<00:03:18.620> there

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
can see through it but around there

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.640 
can see through it but around there
that's<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.610> air<00:03:19.760> cavity<00:03:20.329> so<00:03:21.079> when<00:03:21.200> you<00:03:21.320> blow

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
that's the air cavity so when you blow

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.440 
that's the air cavity so when you blow
into<00:03:21.829> this<00:03:22.070> pipe<00:03:22.459> here<00:03:22.760> the<00:03:22.940> air<00:03:23.060> goes<00:03:23.269> in

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
into this pipe here the air goes in

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.900 
into this pipe here the air goes in
through<00:03:23.780> that<00:03:23.930> hole<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:24.530> was<00:03:25.430> it<00:03:25.579> doing<00:03:25.760> it

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
through that hole and was it doing it

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.590 
through that hole and was it doing it
lifts<00:03:26.360> up<00:03:26.510> the<00:03:26.630> balloon<00:03:27.290> and<00:03:27.910> this<00:03:28.910> allows<00:03:29.239> air

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
lifts up the balloon and this allows air

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.110 
lifts up the balloon and this allows air
into<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:29.989> hole<00:03:30.820> and<00:03:33.100> this<00:03:34.100> plastic<00:03:34.579> bottle<00:03:34.910> is

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
into the hole and this plastic bottle is

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.170 
into the hole and this plastic bottle is
resonant<00:03:35.690> because<00:03:36.140> its<00:03:36.500> length<00:03:36.820> actually<00:03:37.820> a

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
resonant because its length actually a

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.840 
resonant because its length actually a
quarter<00:03:38.630> raised<00:03:38.870> quarter<00:03:39.650> wave<00:03:39.890> resonance

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
quarter raised quarter wave resonance

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.520 
quarter raised quarter wave resonance
roughly<00:03:41.510> but<00:03:41.690> I<00:03:41.780> won't<00:03:41.989> bore<00:03:42.230> you<00:03:42.290> with<00:03:42.410> the

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
roughly but I won't bore you with the

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.800 
roughly but I won't bore you with the
geeky<00:03:42.950> science<00:03:43.160> of<00:03:43.489> it<00:03:43.640> and

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
geeky science of it and

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.160 
geeky science of it and
I'll<00:03:46.530> just<00:03:46.739> say<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.159> air<00:03:47.700> once<00:03:48.599> you<00:03:48.750> blow<00:03:49.019> it

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
I'll just say the air once you blow it

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.350 
I'll just say the air once you blow it
in<00:03:49.379> to<00:03:50.040> this<00:03:50.159> spout<00:03:50.459> here<00:03:50.730> it<00:03:50.879> lifts<00:03:51.180> up<00:03:51.299> the

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
in to this spout here it lifts up the

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.350 
in to this spout here it lifts up the
balloon<00:03:51.810> on<00:03:52.319> the<00:03:53.189> bottle<00:03:53.579> but<00:03:54.090> then<00:03:54.209> that

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
balloon on the bottle but then that

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.990 
balloon on the bottle but then that
creates<00:03:54.569> a<00:03:54.780> gap<00:03:55.189> so<00:03:56.189> then<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.459> balloon<00:03:56.730> can

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
creates a gap so then the balloon can

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.539 
creates a gap so then the balloon can
fall<00:03:57.269> back<00:03:57.569> down<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.349> cover<00:03:58.829> the<00:03:58.920> seal<00:03:59.250> and

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
fall back down and cover the seal and

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.289 
fall back down and cover the seal and
that<00:04:00.239> makes<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.689> air<00:04:00.870> filled<00:04:01.680> again<00:04:02.129> in<00:04:02.549> the

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
that makes the air filled again in the

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.750 
that makes the air filled again in the
chamber<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:04.620> balloon<00:04:04.860> gets<00:04:05.099> raising<00:04:05.489> up<00:04:05.610> and

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
chamber the balloon gets raising up and

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.680 
chamber the balloon gets raising up and
down<00:04:06.049> so<00:04:07.049> main<00:04:07.769> things<00:04:08.150> to<00:04:09.150> make<00:04:09.329> a<00:04:09.360> horn

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
down so main things to make a horn

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.080 
down so main things to make a horn
successfully<00:04:10.379> are<00:04:10.530> air<00:04:10.799> tight<00:04:10.829> seal<00:04:11.069> here<00:04:12.799> and

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
successfully are air tight seal here and

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.180 
successfully are air tight seal here and
here<00:04:15.090> kind<00:04:15.720> of<00:04:15.780> necessary<00:04:16.169> as<00:04:16.380> I<00:04:16.410> said<00:04:16.650> in

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
here kind of necessary as I said in

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.400 
here kind of necessary as I said in
order<00:04:17.340> air<00:04:17.609> tight<00:04:17.850> seal<00:04:17.880> here<00:04:18.570> on<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.139> balloon

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
order air tight seal here on the balloon

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.700 
order air tight seal here on the balloon
and<00:04:20.039> make<00:04:20.760> sure<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.479> bottle<00:04:22.049> neck<00:04:22.320> is<00:04:22.650> a

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
and make sure the bottle neck is a

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.570 
and make sure the bottle neck is a
little<00:04:23.520> bit<00:04:24.110> further<00:04:25.110> out<00:04:25.320> than<00:04:26.100> the<00:04:26.280> top<00:04:26.460> of

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
little bit further out than the top of

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.439 
little bit further out than the top of
the<00:04:26.669> bottle<00:04:27.090> but<00:04:28.430> there's<00:04:29.430> some<00:04:29.610> conditioner

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
the bottle but there's some conditioner

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:32.330 
the bottle but there's some conditioner
bottle<00:04:30.840> I<00:04:31.050> just<00:04:31.380> left<00:04:31.620> a<00:04:31.770> little<00:04:31.919> bit<00:04:32.160> of<00:04:32.250> a

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
bottle I just left a little bit of a

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.400 
bottle I just left a little bit of a
ridge<00:04:32.610> around<00:04:33.120> the<00:04:33.240> outside<00:04:33.630> so<00:04:33.960> it<00:04:34.110> doesn't

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
ridge around the outside so it doesn't

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.830 
ridge around the outside so it doesn't
bend<00:04:34.910> too<00:04:35.910> much<00:04:36.090> when<00:04:36.270> you<00:04:36.330> put<00:04:36.479> the<00:04:36.570> balloon

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
bend too much when you put the balloon

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.250 
bend too much when you put the balloon
on<00:04:36.990> that<00:04:37.199> because<00:04:37.410> that<00:04:37.860> will<00:04:38.010> weaken<00:04:38.280> it

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
on that because that will weaken it

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.689 
on that because that will weaken it
anyway<00:04:40.260> folks<00:04:40.590> hope<00:04:40.889> you<00:04:41.039> enjoyed<00:04:41.370> the<00:04:41.520> video

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
anyway folks hope you enjoyed the video

that's<00:04:42.449> the<00:04:42.630> horn

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
that's the horn

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.810 
that's the horn
and<00:04:43.460> just<00:04:44.460> so<00:04:44.729> you<00:04:44.789> can<00:04:44.940> see<00:04:45.500> the<00:04:46.500> balloon<00:04:46.949> and

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
and just so you can see the balloon and

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:56.839 
and just so you can see the balloon and
the<00:04:48.210> cavity<00:04:48.539> and<00:04:50.510> blow<00:04:51.510> in<00:04:51.690> here<00:04:55.400> move<00:04:56.400> on<00:04:56.669> to

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849 
the cavity and blow in here move on to

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:02.460 
the cavity and blow in here move on to
outside

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:12.840 

and<00:05:02.919> watch<00:05:03.220> the<00:05:03.550> diaphragm<00:05:04.270> on<00:05:04.419> it<00:05:04.540> vibrate

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.160 

for<00:05:13.850> that<00:05:14.240> bit<00:05:14.450> I've<00:05:14.570> tried<00:05:14.840> several

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
for that bit I've tried several

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.200 
for that bit I've tried several
different<00:05:15.350> diaphragms<00:05:16.100> first<00:05:16.880> of<00:05:17.030> all<00:05:17.180> I

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
different diaphragms first of all I

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.720 
different diaphragms first of all I
tried<00:05:17.600> cling<00:05:17.960> film<00:05:18.260> which<00:05:19.130> to<00:05:19.430> be<00:05:19.520> honest

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
tried cling film which to be honest

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.840 
tried cling film which to be honest
wasn't<00:05:20.120> actually<00:05:20.600> bad<00:05:20.840> but<00:05:21.230> it<00:05:21.320> kept<00:05:21.560> breaking

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
wasn't actually bad but it kept breaking

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.570 
wasn't actually bad but it kept breaking
after<00:05:22.850> a<00:05:22.910> while<00:05:23.090> I<00:05:23.360> also<00:05:23.810> tried<00:05:24.110> bits<00:05:24.350> of

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
after a while I also tried bits of

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.520 
after a while I also tried bits of
carrier<00:05:25.580> bag<00:05:25.820> but<00:05:26.720> they<00:05:26.870> weren't<00:05:27.080> quite

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
carrier bag but they weren't quite

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.700 
carrier bag but they weren't quite
elastic<00:05:27.950> enough<00:05:28.660> so<00:05:29.660> end<00:05:29.900> up<00:05:29.990> being<00:05:30.200> tight<00:05:30.500> and

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
elastic enough so end up being tight and

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.860 
elastic enough so end up being tight and
it<00:05:30.800> ended<00:05:31.040> up<00:05:31.160> making<00:05:31.220> a<00:05:31.580> squeaky<00:05:32.360> noise<00:05:32.540> in

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
it ended up making a squeaky noise in

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.690 
it ended up making a squeaky noise in
some<00:05:33.080> instances<00:05:33.500> instead<00:05:33.950> of<00:05:34.040> a<00:05:34.100> nice<00:05:34.250> sort<00:05:34.580> of

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
some instances instead of a nice sort of

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:41.890 
some instances instead of a nice sort of
horn<00:05:35.570> toot<00:05:37.150> so<00:05:38.150> that's<00:05:38.960> all<00:05:39.200> for<00:05:39.380> now<00:05:39.440> folks
