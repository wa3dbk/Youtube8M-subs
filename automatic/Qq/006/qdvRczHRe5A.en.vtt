00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.800
Opel Ampera is not just a technologically advanced car.
It is a car that makes the transition

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.110
from past to future, having under
the same hood philosophies of yesterday and tomorrow.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.150
But how about the present?
Is Ampera a car for our days? Is it a car for you? 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.980
The idea is simple. Ampera and its brother,
Chevrolet Volt, were created for those who

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.700
want an electric car - with all the advantages
deriving from here - but don’t want a limited range.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:50.220
The advantages are undeniable: there is no
need to buy two cars, an electric one for the city

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.000
and another one with
internal combustion engine for longer trips. 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.350
In terms of technology, Ampera is a masterpiece.
It has a total of three engines, connected in series:

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:09.970
One main engine of 150 PS/HP, an auxiliary electric one, 72 PS/HP, that

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:18.830
works as a generator when braking or when it
is spun by the third engine - an internal combustion

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.270
gasoline one, of 1.4-liter, with 86 PS/HP.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.500
If you want to get the best of Ampera, it is
recommended to recharge it overnight. If you live

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.600
in a house, with a yard, you shouldn’t have any problems.
Good news comes also from

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.130
the public parking, where it began to appear power outlets.
However, if you recharge it at home,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.370
for about 40-50 real kilometers you will
not need another power outlet.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:57.420
During the test I had some problems.
It seems that not only the gas and the diesel quality

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.180
are questionable in some refueling stations.
Also the power outlet’s quality of energy is bad

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.030
OR the way the infrastructure was designed is poor.
Specifically, after a few tens

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:14.200
of minutes of charging, Ampera refused to be
recharged, on the grounds that the amperage is too low,

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.210
a problem that was signaled on the
special charger.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.720
So you must be careful from where you
recharge your car, even if you have an electric one.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.550
The good part is that the gasoline in the tank
jumps the real range of Opel Ampera to over 400 km.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.690
During the test drive, the gasoline consumption fluctuated between

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.490
7 and 8 l/100 km - which are not bad for a 150 PS/HP car.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.270
The interior is very modern and ergonomic,
with individual seats both in front and in the back.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.250
The cabin is separated in two - left and right -
being crossed by the battery

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.030
package with a capacity of 16 kWh.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:10.640
The conventional instrument cluster is
replaced by a colour screen at Ampera

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.670
that shows you logically and legibly the important information.
An identical screen has also the

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.350
advanced multimedia system that allows you
to visualize the energy consumption,

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.080
the driving style, and, of course, the classical
music information on the CD, iPod or phone.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.730
Because the driving pleasure is not neglected
at all, Ampera allows you to choose between

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.560
four modes: Normal, Sport, Mountain and Hold.
It is pretty clear what the Normal and Sport

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.740
modes can do, but let's see what
Mountain and Hold is.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.190
Well, it is recommended to enable the Mountain mode
when the battery power is low and you are

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:56.110
about to approach a mountain route.
So the gasoline engine will work harder to charge

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.400
the battery faster, so that you will not
somehow run out of resources on top of the hill.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:08.580
The Hold mode is designed to conserve
the energy in the battery, if you want so.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.100
For example, you come from the periphery to the
center of the city and you want to drive in

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.060
the pure electric mode only through the busiest route.       

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:26.680
The 150 PS/HP send Ampera to 100 km/h in 9 seconds,
and the acceleration is done like this.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.790
From the dynamic point of view this car is
pretty close to Insignia, but the lack of

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.520
exhaust and engine sounds lead to a unique driving experience,
hardly comparable to anything else.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.660
Impressive are the very good start up in
electric mode, the quietness and the firm

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.450
driving position, well placed. 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:05.470
Ampera has also some obvious weak points.
One of them is that the front bumper is very low

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:11.000
and it is impossible not to scratch it at the
entrance of underground parking.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:17.670
Another one is that the quality level of the interior is
doubtful if you have in mind the price of Ampera

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.370
and what Insignia you can buy for the same amount of money.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:29.120
Ampera was launched in Romania with a
price of 44,500 Euros with VAT in 2012,

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:36.220
but now the price dropped to 39,900 Euros with VAT.
So here is a more attractive purchase price

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.710
that adds to some tax exemptions.
