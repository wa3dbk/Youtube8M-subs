00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
being as tall as you are for tennis the

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.200 
being as tall as you are for tennis the
f-first<00:01:25.450> intent<00:01:25.899> of<00:01:26.350> course<00:01:27.030> yeah<00:01:28.030> I<00:01:28.060> mean

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
f-first intent of course yeah I mean

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.350 
f-first intent of course yeah I mean
it's<00:01:28.270> I'm<00:01:28.899> not<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:30.340> quickest<00:01:30.729> guy<00:01:30.910> out<00:01:31.179> there

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
it's I'm not the quickest guy out there

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.850 
it's I'm not the quickest guy out there
and<00:01:31.539> I'm<00:01:31.630> never<00:01:32.020> gonna<00:01:32.259> be

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
and I'm never gonna be

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.600 
and I'm never gonna be
so<00:01:33.980> that<00:01:34.490> I<00:01:34.700> think<00:01:35.080> that's<00:01:36.080> probably<00:01:36.610> probably

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
so that I think that's probably probably

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.400 
so that I think that's probably probably
the<00:01:37.790> main<00:01:37.940> thing<00:01:37.970> where<00:01:38.540> my<00:01:38.660> opponents<00:01:39.200> can

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
the main thing where my opponents can

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.860 
the main thing where my opponents can
can<00:01:40.400> get<00:01:40.580> the<00:01:40.700> shots<00:01:40.940> that<00:01:41.090> I<00:01:41.180> you<00:01:41.420> know<00:01:41.540> I<00:01:41.630> I

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
can get the shots that I you know I I

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.640 
can get the shots that I you know I I
probably<00:01:42.200> can't<00:01:42.640> probably<00:01:43.640> can't<00:01:43.820> get<00:01:44.000> to<00:01:44.180> and

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
probably can't probably can't get to and

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.260 
probably can't probably can't get to and
as<00:01:45.650> well<00:01:45.890> as<00:01:46.010> that<00:01:46.220> you<00:01:46.580> know<00:01:46.730> not<00:01:46.880> only<00:01:46.910> might

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
as well as that you know not only might

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.030 
as well as that you know not only might
all<00:01:47.510> I<00:01:47.540> do<00:01:47.900> also<00:01:48.140> weigh<00:01:48.470> a<00:01:48.500> lot<00:01:48.740> and<00:01:49.690> so<00:01:50.690> I<00:01:51.260> feel

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
opponent switch which can be a

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.100
