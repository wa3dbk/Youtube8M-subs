that was released tonight on a market

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.250 
that was released tonight on a market
place<00:00:18.619> alongside<00:00:19.310> wise<00:00:19.699> old<00:00:19.850> glory<00:00:20.119> so<00:00:21.080> this

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
place alongside wise old glory so this

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.720 
place alongside wise old glory so this
is<00:00:21.410> a<00:00:21.439> fairly<00:00:21.680> simple<00:00:21.860> game<00:00:22.189> it's<00:00:22.369> a

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
is a fairly simple game it's a

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.390 
is a fairly simple game it's a
place<00:00:23.000> and<00:00:23.210> puzzle<00:00:23.420> game<00:00:24.009> so<00:00:25.009> I'm<00:00:25.099> just<00:00:25.279> gonna

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
place and puzzle game so I'm just gonna

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.370 
place and puzzle game so I'm just gonna
show<00:00:25.610> you<00:00:25.669> quickly<00:00:26.480> how<00:00:26.630> it<00:00:26.869> looks<00:00:27.050> like<00:00:27.230> so

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
show you quickly how it looks like so

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.089 
show you quickly how it looks like so
this<00:00:27.500> is<00:00:27.680> the<00:00:27.829> main<00:00:28.220> menu<00:00:28.430> it's<00:00:29.360> a<00:00:30.259> panoramic

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
this is the main menu it's a panoramic

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.600 
this is the main menu it's a panoramic
UI<00:00:32.380> and<00:00:33.380> as<00:00:33.590> you<00:00:33.710> can<00:00:33.829> see<00:00:33.860> it's<00:00:34.100> a<00:00:34.340> little<00:00:34.520> bit

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
UI and as you can see it's a little bit

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.750 
UI and as you can see it's a little bit
laggy<00:00:35.950> exactly<00:00:36.950> like<00:00:37.100> the<00:00:37.309> halo<00:00:37.640> waypoint

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
laggy exactly like the halo waypoint

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.430 
laggy exactly like the halo waypoint
application<00:00:38.480> so<00:00:38.660> I'm<00:00:38.750> guessing<00:00:38.899> that<00:00:39.170> this<00:00:39.290> is

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
application so I'm guessing that this is

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.780 
application so I'm guessing that this is
also<00:00:39.620> running<00:00:39.829> on<00:00:40.160> silverlight<00:00:40.579> and<00:00:41.000> not<00:00:41.149> XNA

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
also running on silverlight and not XNA

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.910 
also running on silverlight and not XNA
here<00:00:43.790> you<00:00:43.879> have<00:00:44.030> all<00:00:44.210> the<00:00:44.360> achievements<00:00:44.920> the

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
at how the game plays so we have to do

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.770 
at how the game plays so we have to do
is<00:00:56.150> just<00:00:56.390> solve<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.110> problem<00:00:58.540> just<00:00:59.540> like<00:00:59.690> I

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780

is just solve the problem just like I
did<00:00:59.930> work<00:01:00.110> ain't<00:01:00.350> nothing<00:01:00.680> too<00:01:00.860> fancy<00:01:01.300> nothing

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
did work ain't nothing too fancy nothing

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.569 
did work ain't nothing too fancy nothing
complicated<00:01:02.630> for<00:01:03.290> now<00:01:03.440> cuz<00:01:03.739> it<00:01:03.920> gets<00:01:04.339> a<00:01:04.460> little

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:04.579 
complicated for now cuz it gets a little

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:09.789 
complicated for now cuz it gets a little
bit<00:01:04.759> trickier<00:01:06.820> so<00:01:07.820> here<00:01:08.000> we<00:01:08.060> go<00:01:08.590> so<00:01:09.590> the<00:01:09.680> game

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
bit trickier so here we go so the game

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.760 
bit trickier so here we go so the game
is<00:01:10.210> available<00:01:11.210> right<00:01:11.720> now<00:01:11.780> for<00:01:12.110> two<00:01:12.530> dollars

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
is available right now for two dollars

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:20.640 
is available right now for two dollars
99<00:01:15.280> there<00:01:16.280> are<00:01:17.380> 75<00:01:18.380> levels<00:01:18.799> and<00:01:19.610> the<00:01:19.670> game

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
99 there are 75 levels and the game

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.820 
99 there are 75 levels and the game
actually<00:01:21.650> saves<00:01:23.260> every<00:01:24.260> time<00:01:24.440> you<00:01:24.560> finish<00:01:24.799> a

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
actually saves every time you finish a

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.240 
actually saves every time you finish a
level<00:01:25.010> so<00:01:25.540> you<00:01:26.540> can<00:01:26.870> safely<00:01:27.380> turn<00:01:28.070> off<00:01:28.220> the

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
level so you can safely turn off the

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:36.840 
level so you can safely turn off the
device<00:01:28.490> and<00:01:29.500> go<00:01:30.500> back<00:01:30.740> to<00:01:30.950> it

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.600 

so<00:01:37.850> once<00:01:38.060> again<00:01:38.180> really<00:01:38.900> good<00:01:39.080> game<00:01:39.320> I<00:01:39.620> only

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
so once again really good game I only

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.150 
so once again really good game I only
downside<00:01:41.060> is<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:41.360> performance<00:01:41.690> issues<00:01:42.350> but

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
downside is the performance issues but

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.490 
downside is the performance issues but
it<00:01:43.430> really<00:01:43.820> doesn't<00:01:44.030> take<00:01:44.180> away<00:01:44.420> from<00:01:44.720> the

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
it really doesn't take away from the

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.830 
it really doesn't take away from the
game<00:01:45.860> place<00:01:46.190> so<00:01:46.520> it's<00:01:46.700> not<00:01:46.940> really<00:01:47.479> a<00:01:47.510> big<00:01:47.780> deal

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840
