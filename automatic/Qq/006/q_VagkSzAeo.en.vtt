side you can see some of the ports that
we<00:01:28.650> have<00:01:28.860> now<00:01:29.100> up<00:01:29.280> here<00:01:29.310> as<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> DDI<00:01:30.680> then<00:01:31.680> we've

we have now up here as a DDI then we've

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.999 
we have now up here as a DDI then we've
got<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.340> networking<00:01:33.000> ethernet<00:01:33.780> port<00:01:34.079> you've

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
got a couple of firewire ports here and

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.910 
got a couple of firewire ports here and
we've<00:01:37.799> got<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.159> USB<00:01:38.729> now<00:01:39.450> when<00:01:39.689> i<00:01:39.720> did<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.259> on

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
we've got the USB now when i did the on

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.770 
we've got the USB now when i did the on
the<00:01:41.040> text<00:01:41.400> part<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.729> this<00:01:41.790> review<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.240> said<00:01:42.600> that

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
the text part of this review I said that

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.999 
the text part of this review I said that
I<00:01:42.840> didn't<00:01:43.049> really<00:01:43.170> like<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.380> placement<00:01:43.740> of

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
I didn't really like the placement of

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.920 
I didn't really like the placement of
this<00:01:44.100> USB<00:01:44.490> now<00:01:44.909> if<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.119> come<00:01:45.420> back<00:01:45.450> out<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.840> little

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
this USB now if I come back out a little

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.870 
this USB now if I come back out a little
bit<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.320> can<00:01:46.439> see<00:01:46.500> it's<00:01:46.829> right<00:01:47.070> basically<00:01:47.670> in

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
bit you can see it's right basically in

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.340 
bit you can see it's right basically in
the<00:01:47.970> middle<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.390> machine<00:01:48.810> on<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.079> right

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
the middle of the machine on the right

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.359 
the middle of the machine on the right
and<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:50.579> problem<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.509> if<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.810> plug<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.590> USB

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
and the problem is is if you plug a USB

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.910 
and the problem is is if you plug a USB
mouse<00:01:53.939> into<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.750> sticks<00:01:55.110> out<00:01:55.320> coming<00:01:55.890> out

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
mouse into this it sticks out coming out

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.380 
mouse into this it sticks out coming out
of<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.130> pork<00:01:56.520> coming<00:01:56.909> out<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.270> know

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
of this pork coming out of you know

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.420 
of this pork coming out of you know
maybe<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.689> didn't<00:01:58.020> have<00:01:58.320> two<00:01:58.530> inches<00:01:58.950> about

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
maybe you didn't have two inches about

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.030 
maybe you didn't have two inches about
the<00:01:59.790> out<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.240> hear<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:01.020> thing<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.350> those<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.920> us

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
the out to hear the thing is those of us

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.530 
the out to hear the thing is those of us
who<00:02:02.159> are<00:02:02.280> right-handed<00:02:02.969> are<00:02:03.270> going<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.479> be

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
who are right-handed are going to be

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.649 
who are right-handed are going to be
sitting<00:02:03.719> here<00:02:04.020> like<00:02:04.469> this<00:02:04.799> using<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:06.090> USB<00:02:06.360> now

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
sitting here like this using the USB now

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.719 
sitting here like this using the USB now
so<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.079> just<00:02:07.110> sticks<00:02:07.500> out<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.740> think<00:02:08.429> it's<00:02:08.610> in

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
so it just sticks out I think it's in

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.119 
so it just sticks out I think it's in
the<00:02:08.759> way<00:02:09.560> actually<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.590> think<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.890> would<00:02:10.979> be<00:02:11.099> a

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
the way actually I think it would be a

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.230 
the way actually I think it would be a
little<00:02:11.220> better

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
little better

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.780 
little better
to<00:02:12.900> put<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.260> poor<00:02:13.500> back<00:02:13.770> here<00:02:14.040> in<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.190> back<00:02:14.370> I

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
to put the poor back here in the back I

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.880 
to put the poor back here in the back I
can<00:02:15.360> see<00:02:15.570> right<00:02:15.780> here<00:02:16.020> but<00:02:16.230> with<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.530> design

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
can see right here but with the design

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.320 
can see right here but with the design
that<00:02:17.040> they<00:02:17.160> have<00:02:17.310> while<00:02:17.520> they<00:02:17.670> can't<00:02:17.940> because

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
that they have while they can't because

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.150 
that they have while they can't because
the<00:02:18.510> way<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.990> hinge<00:02:19.500> work<00:02:19.800> for<00:02:20.040> the

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
the way that the hinge work for the

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.100 
the way that the hinge work for the
screen<00:02:20.550> but<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.270> back<00:02:21.510> would<00:02:21.720> actually<00:02:22.020> be

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
screen but the back would actually be

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.300 
screen but the back would actually be
quite<00:02:22.320> nice<00:02:24.050> over<00:02:25.050> here<00:02:25.080> on<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.500> left<00:02:26.100> side<00:02:26.250> of

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
quite nice over here on the left side of

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.580 
quite nice over here on the left side of
the<00:02:26.400> machine<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:27.660> can<00:02:27.840> see<00:02:27.960> with<00:02:28.140> it<00:02:28.230> we<00:02:28.380> have

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
the machine you can see with it we have

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.170 
the machine you can see with it we have
where<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.890> power<00:02:29.160> goes<00:02:29.520> in<00:02:29.730> right<00:02:29.970> now<00:02:30.120> the

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
where the power goes in right now the

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.690 
where the power goes in right now the

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
placement of the USB port is completely

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.930 
placement of the USB port is completely
falling<00:02:40.260> because<00:02:40.440> may<00:02:41.130> bless<00:02:41.310> your<00:02:41.430> left<00:02:41.610> hand

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
ax the thing is even for a left-handed

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.250 
ax the thing is even for a left-handed
person<00:02:43.830> it's<00:02:44.730> further<00:02:45.120> up<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.630> unit<00:02:46.020> so<00:02:46.140> you

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
person it's further up the unit so you

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.820 
person it's further up the unit so you
can<00:02:46.410> always<00:02:46.560> use<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:48.080> USB<00:02:49.080> mouse<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.770> you

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
can always use the USB mouse and you

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.380 
can always use the USB mouse and you
have<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:49.950> little<00:02:50.100> bit<00:02:50.190> more<00:02:50.310> room<00:02:50.460> to<00:02:50.610> do<00:02:50.760> it<00:02:50.910> so

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
have a little bit more room to do it so

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.880 
have a little bit more room to do it so
it's<00:02:51.540> just<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.720> placement<00:02:52.080> of<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.620> one<00:02:52.800> on

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
it's just the placement of the one on

it's just the placement of the one on
the<00:02:52.980> other<00:02:53.070> side<00:02:53.400> that<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:53.700> find<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.180> be<00:02:54.210> a

the other side that I find to be a
little<00:02:54.510> bit<00:02:54.720> wonky<00:02:56.660> otherwise<00:02:57.660> it's<00:02:58.050> a<00:02:58.110> you
