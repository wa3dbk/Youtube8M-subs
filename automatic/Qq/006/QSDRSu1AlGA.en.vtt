figure<00:04:19.430> stained<00:04:19.640> included<00:04:20.090> I'm<00:04:20.420> always<00:04:20.690> a

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
figure stained included I'm always a

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.270 
figure stained included I'm always a
stickler<00:04:21.230> for<00:04:21.260> having<00:04:21.590> figure<00:04:21.859> stands<00:04:22.130> with

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
stickler for having figure stands with

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.560 
stickler for having figure stands with
my<00:04:22.430> three<00:04:22.700> and<00:04:22.790> three-quarter<00:04:23.120> inch<00:04:23.270> figures

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
my three and three-quarter inch figures

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.050 
my three and three-quarter inch figures
especially<00:04:23.950> when<00:04:24.950> we've<00:04:25.280> always<00:04:25.520> gotten<00:04:25.880> them

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
especially when we've always gotten them

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.910 
especially when we've always gotten them
in<00:04:26.180> the<00:04:26.300> past<00:04:26.510> so<00:04:26.840> I<00:04:26.870> think<00:04:27.140> it's<00:04:27.290> very<00:04:27.440> sad<00:04:27.740> to

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
in the past so I think it's very sad to

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.700 
in the past so I think it's very sad to
see<00:04:28.070> that<00:04:28.100> missing<00:04:28.640> here<00:04:32.170> but<00:04:33.170> all<00:04:33.320> in<00:04:33.440> all<00:04:33.560> I'd

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
see that missing here but all in all I'd

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.200 
see that missing here but all in all I'd
say<00:04:33.740> that<00:04:34.070> this<00:04:34.160> is<00:04:34.370> a<00:04:34.400> pretty<00:04:34.760> nice<00:04:35.000> looking

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
say that this is a pretty nice looking

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.450 
say that this is a pretty nice looking
figure<00:04:35.600> the<00:04:36.140> articulation<00:04:36.830> is<00:04:36.980> probably

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
figure the articulation is probably

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.220 
figure the articulation is probably
lacking<00:04:38.060> considering<00:04:38.570> where<00:04:38.750> we<00:04:38.780> are<00:04:38.900> now

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
lacking considering where we are now

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.080 
lacking considering where we are now
with<00:04:39.350> the<00:04:39.470> Marvel<00:04:39.740> Universe<00:04:39.770> figures<00:04:40.460> but<00:04:40.700> the

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
with the Marvel Universe figures but the

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.430 
with the Marvel Universe figures but the
paint<00:04:41.330> job<00:04:41.480> on<00:04:41.570> the<00:04:41.690> figure<00:04:41.960> is<00:04:42.020> really<00:04:42.260> good

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
paint job on the figure is really good

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.560 
paint job on the figure is really good
and<00:04:42.680> like<00:04:43.190> I<00:04:43.310> said<00:04:43.580> it's<00:04:44.090> the<00:04:44.180> first<00:04:44.270> time

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
and like I said it's the first time

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.000 
and like I said it's the first time
we've<00:04:44.690> had<00:04:44.810> a<00:04:44.870> Miles<00:04:45.169> Morales<00:04:45.650> version<00:04:45.950> of
