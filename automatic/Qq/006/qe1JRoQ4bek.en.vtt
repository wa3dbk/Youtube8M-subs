00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
think I've got my killstreak rewards I

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.180 
think I've got my killstreak rewards I
have<00:00:36.030> thought<00:00:36.300> harrier<00:00:36.660> pavelow<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:40.190> chopper

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
have thought harrier pavelow and chopper

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.619 
have thought harrier pavelow and chopper
gunner<00:00:41.989> that<00:00:42.989> those<00:00:43.230> are<00:00:43.530> what<00:00:44.100> I'm<00:00:44.629> pretty

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
gunner that those are what I'm pretty

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.110 
gunner that those are what I'm pretty
much<00:00:45.809> using<00:00:46.170> at<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.440> moment<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.579> think

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
much using at the moment and I think

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.940 
much using at the moment and I think
they're<00:00:48.300> they're<00:00:48.930> more<00:00:49.110> effective<00:00:49.620> for<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
they're they're more effective for the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.090 
they're they're more effective for the
way<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.250> I'm<00:00:50.340> playing<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:54.559> they<00:00:55.559> really<00:00:55.920> do

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
way that I'm playing and they really do

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.580 
way that I'm playing and they really do
a<00:00:56.300> really<00:00:57.300> good<00:00:57.480> job<00:00:57.510> like<00:00:57.840> once<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.230> get<00:00:58.410> them

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
a really good job like once you get them

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.290 
a really good job like once you get them
I<00:00:58.739> mean<00:00:58.980> it's<00:00:59.160> practically<00:00:59.640> going<00:00:59.850> over<00:01:00.120> sort

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
I mean it's practically going over sort

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.900 
I mean it's practically going over sort
of<00:01:00.390> things<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:01.190> that's<00:01:02.190> why<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.399> have<00:01:02.550> those<00:01:02.699> on

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
of things so that's why I have those on

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.980 
of things so that's why I have those on
um<00:01:03.650> so<00:01:04.650> my<00:01:05.460> style<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:05.939> general<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.510> mean<00:01:06.720> I'm

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
um so my style in general I mean I'm

bandolier of stopping power and steady
aim<00:01:43.130> bandolier<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.159> used<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.460> use<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.729> because<00:01:44.850> I

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
aim bandolier I used to use it because I

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.570 
aim bandolier I used to use it because I
used<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.890> shoot<00:01:47.100> from<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.310> hip<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.520> lot<00:01:47.790> or

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.520 
used to shoot from the hip a lot or
well<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:50.110> I<00:01:50.670> needed<00:01:51.670> a<00:01:51.850> lot<00:01:52.210> of<00:01:52.300> bullets<00:01:52.600> or<00:01:52.930> a

well so I needed a lot of bullets or a

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.200 
well so I needed a lot of bullets or a
lot<00:01:53.800> of<00:01:53.860> ammunition<00:01:54.040> was<00:01:54.370> advised<00:01:54.730> to<00:01:54.910> run<00:01:55.090> out

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
lot of ammunition was advised to run out

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.820 
lot of ammunition was advised to run out
quite<00:01:55.450> quickly<00:01:55.600> I<00:01:55.780> found<00:01:56.050> that<00:01:56.140> I<00:01:56.200> was<00:01:56.470> running

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
quite quickly I found that I was running

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.860 
quite quickly I found that I was running
out<00:01:56.920> quite<00:01:57.190> quickly<00:01:57.310> I<00:01:57.700> when<00:01:58.390> I<00:01:58.420> first<00:01:58.480> started

out quite quickly I when I first started
playing<00:01:58.990> it<00:01:59.290> so<00:01:59.500> bandolier<00:02:00.160> I<00:02:00.430> mean<00:02:00.670> that<00:02:01.000> I

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
playing it so bandolier I mean that I

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.810 
playing it so bandolier I mean that I
practically<00:02:01.900> couldn't<00:02:02.260> do<00:02:02.320> without<00:02:02.440> it

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
practically couldn't do without it

for<00:02:10.990> that<00:02:11.220> which<00:02:12.220> are<00:02:13.560> trying<00:02:14.560> touch<00:02:15.310> run

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
likes you from the hip a lot one of the

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.390 
likes you from the hip a lot one of the
things<00:02:21.040> about<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.370> p90x<00:02:22.090> I<00:02:22.420> mean<00:02:22.840> it's<00:02:23.020> so

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
things about the p90x I mean it's so

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.970 
things about the p90x I mean it's so
accurate<00:02:24.400> even<00:02:24.910> a<00:02:25.090> medium<00:02:25.750> range<00:02:25.960> so<00:02:26.500> I<00:02:26.740> mean

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
accurate even a medium range so I mean

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.690 
accurate even a medium range so I mean
he<00:02:27.190> personally<00:02:28.030> don't<00:02:28.240> even<00:02:28.480> need<00:02:28.570> to<00:02:28.690> aim<00:02:28.870> so

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
he personally don't even need to aim so

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.980 
he personally don't even need to aim so
with<00:02:30.700> steady<00:02:30.940> aim<00:02:31.120> on<00:02:31.330> it<00:02:31.480> it's<00:02:31.840> almost

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
with steady aim on it it's almost

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.750 
with steady aim on it it's almost

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
pinpoint precision from the hip so that

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.890 
pinpoint precision from the hip so that
was<00:02:36.850> what<00:02:36.970> I<00:02:37.000> used<00:02:37.209> to<00:02:37.300> using<00:02:37.420> footage<00:02:37.630> before

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
was what I used to using footage before

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.780 
was what I used to using footage before
but<00:02:38.230> since<00:02:38.440> then<00:02:38.590> I've<00:02:38.709> had<00:02:38.920> to<00:02:39.160> change<00:02:39.400> a<00:02:39.640> lot

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
but since then I've had to change a lot

I've<00:03:47.140> been<00:03:47.320> using<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.680> USP<00:03:48.010> 45<00:03:48.340> and<00:03:49.150> I

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
I've been using the USP 45 and I

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.510 
I've been using the USP 45 and I
currently<00:03:49.540> have<00:03:49.780> in<00:03:49.989> a<00:03:50.019> Kim

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
currently have in a Kim

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.110 
currently have in a Kim
bow<00:03:52.010> but<00:03:53.010> I<00:03:53.040> think<00:03:53.340> that's<00:03:53.760> one<00:03:53.940> of<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.090> things

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
bow but I think that's one of the things

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.460 
bow but I think that's one of the things
that<00:03:54.390> are<00:03:54.540> probably<00:03:54.750> going<00:03:54.870> to<00:03:54.960> change<00:03:55.200> them

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
that are probably going to change them

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.080 
that are probably going to change them
I'm<00:03:56.450> experimenting<00:03:57.450> with<00:03:57.780> it<00:03:57.870> but<00:03:58.200> I<00:03:59.090> think

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
I'm experimenting with it but I think

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.140 
I'm experimenting with it but I think
they're<00:04:00.420> probably<00:04:00.600> put<00:04:01.820> secondary<00:04:02.820> weapons

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
they're probably put secondary weapons

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:11.030 
they're probably put secondary weapons
too<00:04:04.190> and<00:04:05.190> for<00:04:05.730> me<00:04:05.880> anyway<00:04:07.940> so<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:10.620> reason<00:04:10.770> why

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
too and for me anyway so the reason why

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.310 
too and for me anyway so the reason why
I<00:04:11.430> don't<00:04:11.850> use<00:04:11.970> a<00:04:12.000> silenced<00:04:12.450> p90<00:04:12.750> anymore<00:04:13.140> it's

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
I don't use a silenced p90 anymore it's

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.930 
I don't use a silenced p90 anymore it's
basically<00:04:13.710> because<00:04:14.100> when<00:04:14.340> i<00:04:14.370> first<00:04:14.700> started

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
basically because when i first started

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.890 
basically because when i first started
playing<00:04:15.060> free-for-all<00:04:15.770> i<00:04:17.540> started<00:04:18.540> about

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
playing free-for-all i started about

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.190 
playing free-for-all i started about
four<00:04:19.170> or<00:04:19.230> five<00:04:19.290> days<00:04:19.470> after<00:04:19.950> everybody<00:04:20.430> else

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
four or five days after everybody else

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.140 
four or five days after everybody else
because<00:04:22.200> when<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:23.070> game<00:04:23.310> came<00:04:23.580> out<00:04:23.790> I<00:04:23.850> was

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
because when the game came out I was

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.990 
because when the game came out I was
still<00:04:24.420> waiting<00:04:24.660> for<00:04:24.690> my<00:04:24.900> internet<00:04:25.740> connection

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
still waiting for my internet connection

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.190 
still waiting for my internet connection
to<00:04:27.000> be<00:04:27.090> hooked<00:04:27.390> up<00:04:27.510> because<00:04:27.720> I<00:04:27.780> just<00:04:27.990> moved

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
to be hooked up because I just moved

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.070 
to be hooked up because I just moved
house<00:04:28.410> so<00:04:29.360> when<00:04:30.360> I<00:04:30.390> started<00:04:30.750> first<00:04:30.960> time

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
house so when I started first time

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.200 
house so when I started first time
playing<00:04:31.380> I<00:04:31.530> mean<00:04:31.710> I<00:04:31.950> found<00:04:32.190> that<00:04:32.310> most<00:04:32.970> of<00:04:33.120> the

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
playing I mean I found that most of the

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.300 
playing I mean I found that most of the
people<00:04:33.260> that<00:04:34.260> I<00:04:34.290> was<00:04:34.500> failing<00:04:34.680> us<00:04:34.920> they<00:04:35.130> knew

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
people that I was failing us they knew

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.620 
people that I was failing us they knew
the<00:04:35.460> layout<00:04:35.610> of<00:04:35.760> the<00:04:36.000> maps<00:04:36.210> they<00:04:36.360> knew<00:04:36.480> the

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
the layout of the maps they knew the

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.290 
the layout of the maps they knew the
maps<00:04:36.810> and<00:04:36.930> everything<00:04:37.200> and<00:04:37.290> I<00:04:37.380> was<00:04:37.560> still<00:04:37.770> just

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
maps and everything and I was still just

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.030 
maps and everything and I was still just
trying<00:04:39.300> to<00:04:39.510> figure<00:04:39.750> out<00:04:39.930> which<00:04:40.320> way<00:04:40.590> was<00:04:40.740> North

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
trying to figure out which way was North

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.140 
trying to figure out which way was North
sort<00:04:41.340> of<00:04:41.430> thing<00:04:41.610> so<00:04:41.910> I<00:04:43.310> had<00:04:44.310> a<00:04:44.340> lot<00:04:44.430> difficulty

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
sort of thing so I had a lot difficulty

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.810 
sort of thing so I had a lot difficulty
in<00:04:45.450> fine<00:04:46.110> actually<00:04:46.440> finding<00:04:46.950> players<00:04:47.190> is<00:04:47.580> just

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
in fine actually finding players is just

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.580 
in fine actually finding players is just
one<00:04:48.330> of<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:48.540> important<00:04:49.290> things<00:04:49.320> with

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
one of the important things with

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:50.690 
one of the important things with
run-and-gun<00:04:49.860> that's<00:04:50.100> obviously<00:04:50.400> that<00:04:50.580> you

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
run-and-gun that's obviously that you

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.120 
run-and-gun that's obviously that you
find<00:04:51.210> players<00:04:51.450> because<00:04:51.720> I<00:04:51.810> mean<00:04:52.010> you<00:04:53.010> don't

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
find players because I mean you don't

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.630 
find players because I mean you don't
just<00:04:53.280> rely<00:04:53.970> on<00:04:54.090> people<00:04:54.510> coming<00:04:54.780> to<00:04:54.900> you<00:04:55.080> so

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
just rely on people coming to you so

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.760 
just rely on people coming to you so
because<00:04:56.640> i<00:04:56.910> think<00:04:57.300> i<00:04:57.600> was<00:04:57.750> using<00:04:58.140> a<00:04:58.320> silencer<00:04:58.530> i

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
because i think i was using a silencer i

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:59.990 
because i think i was using a silencer i
went<00:04:58.980> straight<00:04:59.190> to<00:04:59.310> assign<00:04:59.550> answer<00:04:59.790> straight

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
went straight to assign answer straight

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.100 
went straight to assign answer straight
away<00:05:00.060> but<00:05:00.210> I<00:05:00.420> found<00:05:00.630> that<00:05:01.370> I<00:05:02.540> was<00:05:03.540> playing<00:05:03.930> it

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
away but I found that I was playing it

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.540 
away but I found that I was playing it
so<00:05:04.260> difficult<00:05:04.500> so<00:05:04.800> basically<00:05:05.220> I<00:05:05.250> just<00:05:05.490> took

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
so difficult so basically I just took

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.500 
so difficult so basically I just took
the<00:05:05.760> silencer<00:05:06.120> off<00:05:06.300> sort<00:05:07.260> of<00:05:07.320> slight<00:05:07.530> on<00:05:07.710> and

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
the silencer off sort of slight on and

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.640 
the silencer off sort of slight on and
people<00:05:09.510> basically<00:05:09.780> started<00:05:10.290> coming<00:05:10.530> to<00:05:10.620> me

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
people basically started coming to me

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.700 
people basically started coming to me
that<00:05:11.070> way<00:05:11.220> because<00:05:11.420> they<00:05:12.420> see<00:05:13.410> someone

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
that way because they see someone

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.030 
that way because they see someone
shooting<00:05:14.220> on<00:05:14.400> their<00:05:14.640> on<00:05:15.630> their<00:05:15.690> map<00:05:15.990> and<00:05:16.920> they

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
shooting on their on their map and they

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.970 
shooting on their on their map and they
come<00:05:17.250> to<00:05:17.400> me<00:05:17.550> so<00:05:18.500> it<00:05:19.500> makes<00:05:19.650> it<00:05:19.740> a<00:05:19.830> lot<00:05:19.920> easier

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
come to me so it makes it a lot easier

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.850 
come to me so it makes it a lot easier
for<00:05:20.370> me<00:05:20.460> to<00:05:20.490> find<00:05:20.790> people<00:05:21.090> now<00:05:21.270> I<00:05:21.740> suppose<00:05:22.740> I

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
for me to find people now I suppose I

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.230 
for me to find people now I suppose I
could<00:05:22.890> go<00:05:23.280> back<00:05:23.430> to<00:05:23.580> using<00:05:23.730> the<00:05:23.910> silence

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
could go back to using the silence

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.700 
could go back to using the silence
another<00:05:24.480> I<00:05:24.600> know<00:05:24.690> the<00:05:24.900> maps<00:05:25.110> a<00:05:25.230> lot<00:05:25.380> more<00:05:25.560> and

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
another I know the maps a lot more and

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.670 
another I know the maps a lot more and
where<00:05:25.800> people<00:05:26.070> are<00:05:26.160> likely<00:05:26.400> to<00:05:26.430> be<00:05:26.580> but<00:05:27.680> that's

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
where people are likely to be but that's

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.020 
where people are likely to be but that's
something<00:05:28.860> again<00:05:29.340> that's<00:05:29.520> something<00:05:29.610> that<00:05:29.820> i

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
something again that's something that i

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.740 
something again that's something that i
could<00:05:30.180> probably<00:05:30.600> tweak<00:05:30.840> in<00:05:30.990> the<00:05:31.050> future<00:05:31.350> um

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
could probably tweak in the future um

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.340 
could probably tweak in the future um
yeah<00:05:33.750> the<00:05:33.900> lightweight<00:05:34.320> pro<00:05:35.750> is<00:05:36.750> I've<00:05:37.080> just

von<00:06:19.640> hippel<00:06:19.910> rock<00:06:20.030> still<00:06:20.330> so<00:06:20.750> that's<00:06:21.740> quite

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
von hippel rock still so that's quite

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.790 
von hippel rock still so that's quite
necessary<00:06:22.580> and<00:06:23.090> it<00:06:23.930> works<00:06:24.350> very<00:06:24.440> well<00:06:24.620> with

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
necessary and it works very well with

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:31.210 
necessary and it works very well with
the<00:06:24.890> p90<00:06:25.310> anyway<00:06:25.610> I<00:06:25.790> found<00:06:26.090> so<00:06:30.220> that's

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:31.220 
the p90 anyway I found so that's

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.830 
the p90 anyway I found so that's
basically<00:06:31.400> my<00:06:31.730> style<00:06:32.150> especially<00:06:32.390> the<00:06:32.720> way

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 
basically my style especially the way

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.510 
basically my style especially the way
that<00:06:32.870> I<00:06:33.050> play<00:06:33.260> at<00:06:33.440> the<00:06:33.530> moment<00:06:33.950> as<00:06:34.100> i<00:06:34.250> said<00:06:34.430> i'm

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 
that I play at the moment as i said i'm

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.840 
that I play at the moment as i said i'm
still<00:06:34.760> developing<00:06:35.210> it<00:06:35.360> or<00:06:35.480> trying<00:06:35.720> to<00:06:36.850> and

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:37.850 
still developing it or trying to and

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.870 
still developing it or trying to and
it's<00:06:38.780> worked<00:06:39.410> out<00:06:39.730> quite<00:06:40.730> well<00:06:40.850> so<00:06:41.120> far<00:06:41.419> but

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.700 
it's worked out quite well so far but
this<00:06:43.880> game<00:06:44.090> i<00:06:44.150> mean<00:06:44.480> is<00:06:44.660> well<00:06:45.140> practically
