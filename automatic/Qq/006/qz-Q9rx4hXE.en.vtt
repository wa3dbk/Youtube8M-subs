 People will always meet someone and break up with others 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:53.000
 Like the foliage of trees that flow into the river, like the wind of the surrounding season ... 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:18.000
 Once-in-a-lifetime connection of the world (Enishi) Heart yarn connected with you 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:38.000
 I want to live alive crying and laughing 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:02:00.000
 If you look alone, even if it is just a dream, you may see a dream 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:16.000
 Chasing the wind and the swaying bird and the little dream I have to chase ... 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:41.000
 Do not forget the moment of once-in-a-lifetime encounters Tomorrow tomorrow 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:03:00.000
 I want to live with joy and sadness 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:25.000

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:46.000
 I want to live a pleasure and suffering
