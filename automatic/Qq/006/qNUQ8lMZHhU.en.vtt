00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.750
 dry so to the obnoxious sniper you go 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.160

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.080
 right but after I switched on the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.529
 ballista at the wii you'll see I'm going 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.699
 make a nice score in the end good 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.840

 regards the string schema and so we're going 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.920
 first of all start with the new 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.450
 large bin that ensure machine if you

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.420
 youtube you have probably noticed 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.540
 there is not a new high 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.789
 she this background was realized by a 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.680
 subscriber seems to me contacted me on skateboard 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.719
 then he moved me did it very quickly 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.280
 so we had very little time I was pretty 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.460
 satisfied with his work 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.050
 really it really wowed me it was 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.829

 yorkais maybe some modifications 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.180
 in progress brought since you could 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.510
 solo to notice that the end is not 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.750
 very low of the bench is not very 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.570
 how to say 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.580
 it 's not finished yet if it's 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.350
 finished but its simple and not much 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.409
 their but otherwise the rest is really 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.090

 very talking for rossi we can see this 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.950
 we think we can do to engrave 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.960
 for the background so I will also put 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.970
 his string in the description is also 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.439
 I add them in the sweat box of this 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.270
 that he made me a bavera we go there 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.380
 maybe make a logo and why not 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.799
 also an intro I have not yet 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.310

 and so here is a big thank you to you and 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.030
 that's it if you want to go do a 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.530
 little trick 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.630
 on his chain will do it extremely 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.280
 pleasure it will also make me really 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.250
 pleasure to me too 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.180
 so here we wait I'll talk to you 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.970
 of something 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.390
 the most important thing so we're going 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.869
 say the center of this video since that 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.119
 will be 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.920
 it's about the team so the 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.600
 hydro team what right now there has been 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.880
 some confusion in the team 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.500
 so here I do not want to I will not you 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.270
 tell the whole story follow the knowledge 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.850
 what happened to see them on the 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.269
 freeze channel he made a video 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.350
 especially for that so 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.739
 so there there were some shadows them I 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:23.290
 said then epci left the team and 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.630
 so that's for various reasons and 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.489
 so he left the team and that's 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.069
 why now we were 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.950
 need some members so why 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.870
 not your subscriber sides 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.720
 so you also have to know that we are not going 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.519
 like that so in one fell swoop if you 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.580
 do you want to be caught in the 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:45.610
 team so can send me a message on 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.470
 youtube on skype on the ps3 you want 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.769
 so the 300 g all the messages 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.360
 I try to answer to a maximum so 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.760
 already to be recruited in the team 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.700
 you must already have a good level that is 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.160
 to know how to manage several weapons 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.840
 different be competent over several 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.799
 game modes on different maps and 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:09.010
 all that and you also need to know 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:11.049
 as different if we can say that like 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.079
 that's his way of playing since what 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.549
 sometimes will not be in league with the team 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.950
 where I 'm not when we make matches 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.500
 low team we are four in the team 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.420
 before we were 4 then there were two 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.620
 attackers two defenders and sometimes 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.829
 we could not manage the 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.350
 part so we tried to exchange so 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.549
 the attacker was going in defense then if we 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.769
 put three attackers for one 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.359
 defender where we were three defenders 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.940
 then that's why you have to play 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.710
 not know how to handle multiple ways of 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.260
 to play 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.270
 since to attack you have to 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.170
 know rush and so we are strafed 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.060
 so you have to manage the 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.920
 submachine guns and to defend so he 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.270
 is easier to defend with a 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.930
 assault rifle so that's why it 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:54.630
 must you can be competent so on 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.940
 the different categories of weapons and 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.980
 also so on different maps and 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.470
 the different modes of play since 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.880
 know that 's the competition in league 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.410
 if we make it to steam matches 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.730
 takes place in three rounds and at each 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.710
 times we change maps and we change 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.260
 fashion 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:12.330
 so if you want to be recruited abba 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.980
 already we will have to go somewhere 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.920
 very important thing so in a 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.480
 team is communication so we are 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.670
 all the time by train appears in the 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.960
 team whether on skype yes we speak 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.420
 all the time on skype which one is 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:27.630
 that 24 hours a day and during 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.540
 parties and that we talk about together and 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.740
 it's really kiffed communication 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.320
 who really is the strength of the team 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.950
 so if you want to be later and he 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:40.830
 will really have to talk communicate with 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:44.760
 with us with our forgiveness and that's it 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.560
 also who goes that will allow without you 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.130
 allow maybe to return from their 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.990
 intimate and if you have a 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.550
 if you communicate well if you say 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.830
 moving enemies all that so 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.910
 this moment there is a message that's it 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:03.270
 speak it will settle down as and when 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:05.100
 of time so that's it if you want to be 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.700
 selected will not be to send me a 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.450
 message there's no problem so I know 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.590
 to answer you 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.060
 we will play with you so we will do 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.040
 some parts raised eyebrows in the party 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.720
 will therefore be part of you to be able to 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.040
 do not know I do not know with two three 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.770
 parts that we can recruit you so 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.690
 will really have to always know a lot 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.460
 together we see your level 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.440
 so I said I wanted to say 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.610
 also by so that's not the ratio that 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.370
 account for me so if you have a 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.850
 ratio of 3 50 years a ratio of 1.5 that 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.680
 I do not care 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.370
 so what matters is that you are 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.110
 hello you know 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.770
 did you show you know forgiveness 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:41.050
 manage several different weapons and that 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.360
 you know how to communicate in the team so 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.400
 that's it for me the most important is 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.650
 also that you send by the shade of 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.970
 VSAT and shouted the team is 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.229
 plays all the micro-stationation it will take 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.229
 play the VSAT so it will take 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:55.240
 not do not make his solo his 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:56.860
 personal and go play with groups 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.180
 of chassis all that is that really 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.810
 it's the organization of the team that will 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:04.330
 to make the force of the team and 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.280
 what if so he wanted even if 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.560
 you want to be recruited in the team 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:12.669
 do not hesitate to send me a message and 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.990
 I will answer you so here we go 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:16.370
 also right now I realized a lot 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.790
 of gameplay that will be posted on my 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.780
 chain so I realized a lot of 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.370
 gameplay so all of them including 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.360
 nuclear that I need to speak fast 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:23.750
 because the video will soon be 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.090
 finish 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.550
 so I did not really realize 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:31.100
 of a lot of nuclear especially with 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.680
 to the sniper so to the peace keeper without 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.900
 nothing on it so without anything so if you 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.870

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.789

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.090
 I also muc the hermitiere will you 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:45.260
 suggest if you like it 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.570
 they are just what else do I have 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.479
 nuclear attempt at snipe attempt 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:53.539
 clear to the multi nuclear peace keeper 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:55.130
 weapon a giant yes I have a forgiveness I

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.690
 team so express if we can call 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.789
 it's like that so the game is going soon 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:04.610
 coming to an end and I also wanted to 

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:06.620
 so addressed another little point sorry 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.660
 it's only on my hydro voltec account 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.830
 which I often play with the team but 

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.419
 his parents you are subscribers are going 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.419
 play it with me do not hesitate to 

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:15.710
 buy me on my account so voltex 

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:17.419
 youtube so I'll put that to you 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.740
 in the description so it's really 

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:19.370
 important that you read it the 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.340
 description 

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:23.930
 I will put everything in it so I created a
