about<00:00:39.550> releasing<00:00:40.020> we<00:00:41.020> have<00:00:41.199> the<00:00:41.350> sun<00:00:41.590> is<00:00:41.739> in

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
about releasing we have the sun is in

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.220 
about releasing we have the sun is in
Virgo<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:43.570> is<00:00:43.899> matter<00:00:44.800> that's<00:00:45.730> the<00:00:46.230> physical

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
Virgo that is matter that's the physical

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.410 
Virgo that is matter that's the physical
the<00:00:47.440> things<00:00:48.340> that<00:00:48.489> we<00:00:48.579> focus<00:00:48.730> on<00:00:49.120> in<00:00:49.300> our

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
the things that we focus on in our

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.049 
the things that we focus on in our
day-to-day<00:00:49.629> lives<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:51.190> opposite<00:00:51.640> energy

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
day-to-day lives the opposite energy

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.479 
day-to-day lives the opposite energy
where<00:00:52.329> the<00:00:52.449> moon<00:00:52.629> is<00:00:52.809> hence<00:00:53.379> the<00:00:53.800> full<00:00:54.100> moon<00:00:54.309> is

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
where the moon is hence the full moon is

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.599 
where the moon is hence the full moon is
in<00:00:55.149> the<00:00:55.239> sign<00:00:55.420> of<00:00:55.449> Pisces<00:00:56.019> that's<00:00:56.500> spirit<00:00:57.129> so

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
in the sign of Pisces that's spirit so

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:59.959 
in the sign of Pisces that's spirit so
what<00:00:57.789> we're<00:00:57.910> looking<00:00:57.940> at<00:00:58.390> is<00:00:58.750> energy<00:00:59.379> of

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
what we're looking at is energy of

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.029 
what we're looking at is energy of
combining<00:01:00.969> bringing<00:01:01.660> together<00:01:01.870> spirit<00:01:02.829> to

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
combining bringing together spirit to

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.150 
combining bringing together spirit to
matter<00:01:03.429> so<00:01:04.000> what<00:01:04.239> we<00:01:04.360> do<00:01:04.510> with<00:01:04.720> this<00:01:04.839> energy

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
matter so what we do with this energy

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.850 
matter so what we do with this energy
full<00:01:06.160> moon<00:01:06.400> wants<00:01:06.790> us<00:01:06.940> to<00:01:07.150> after<00:01:07.720> it<00:01:07.990> is<00:01:08.560> full

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
full moon wants us to after it is full
