00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
hi so this would just be a short video

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.579 
hi so this would just be a short video
with<00:00:02.909> my<00:00:03.090> predictions<00:00:03.959> and<00:00:04.609> just<00:00:05.609> news<00:00:05.910> and

00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:06.589 
with my predictions and just news and

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:08.629 
with my predictions and just news and
answering<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.680> few<00:00:07.830> questions<00:00:07.890> from<00:00:08.309> my<00:00:08.490> last

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
answering a few questions from my last

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.549 
answering a few questions from my last
video<00:00:10.250> so<00:00:11.250> we<00:00:11.370> had<00:00:11.490> Pedrosa<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.900> fastest<00:00:13.349> in

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
video so we had Pedrosa the fastest in

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.589 
video so we had Pedrosa the fastest in
the<00:00:13.860> second<00:00:14.190> free<00:00:14.309> practice<00:00:14.519> today<00:00:14.849> but

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
the second free practice today but

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.040 
the second free practice today but
there's<00:00:16.590> really<00:00:16.800> not<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.100> lot<00:00:17.160> you<00:00:17.550> can<00:00:17.869> you<00:00:18.869> can

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
there's really not a lot you can you can

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.570 
there's really not a lot you can you can
take<00:00:19.230> away<00:00:19.500> from<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.130> day<00:00:20.279> as<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.550> whole

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
take away from the day as a whole

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.060 
take away from the day as a whole
because<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.840> conditions<00:00:22.650> they<00:00:22.859> weren't

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
because the conditions they weren't

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.170 
because the conditions they weren't
completely<00:00:23.279> aware<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:23.910> they<00:00:24.000> weren't

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
completely aware and they weren't

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.679 
completely aware and they weren't
completely<00:00:24.779> dry<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:26.210> it's<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.539> know<00:00:27.660> it's

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
completely dry so it's you know it's

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.380 
completely dry so it's you know it's
hard<00:00:28.019> because<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.859> conditions<00:00:29.390> especially

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
hard because the conditions especially

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.830 
hard because the conditions especially
for<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.630> tires<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.820> conditions<00:00:32.820> are<00:00:33.000> not<00:00:33.420> so

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
for the tires the conditions are not so

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.380 
for the tires the conditions are not so
much<00:00:33.989> one<00:00:34.230> way<00:00:34.460> and<00:00:35.460> that's<00:00:35.579> just<00:00:36.090> chewing<00:00:36.360> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
much one way and that's just chewing the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.450 
much one way and that's just chewing the
tires<00:00:36.660> up<00:00:36.980> so<00:00:37.980> it's<00:00:38.100> going<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.250> be<00:00:38.370> an

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
tires up so it's going to be an

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.729 
tires up so it's going to be an
interesting<00:00:38.700> race<00:00:38.910> especially<00:00:39.570> if<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.809> stays

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
interesting race especially if it stays

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.080 
interesting race especially if it stays
like<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.399> it's<00:00:41.579> going<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.730> be<00:00:41.879> down<00:00:42.059> to

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
like that and it's going to be down to

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.720 
like that and it's going to be down to
whoever<00:00:42.690> conserves<00:00:43.410> their<00:00:43.590> tires<00:00:43.770> best<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.460> I

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
whoever conserves their tires best and I

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.330 
whoever conserves their tires best and I
think<00:00:45.390> we<00:00:45.629> all<00:00:45.750> know<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.020> us<00:00:46.620> Lorenzo<00:00:47.100> but

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
think we all know that us Lorenzo but

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.660 
think we all know that us Lorenzo but
we'll<00:00:48.030> see<00:00:48.149> what<00:00:48.239> happens<00:00:48.890> with<00:00:49.890> Valentino

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
we'll see what happens with Valentino

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.610 
we'll see what happens with Valentino
Rossi<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.059> second<00:00:51.390> place<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.899> was<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.140> great

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
Rossi in second place I was a great

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.569 
Rossi in second place I was a great
performance<00:00:53.039> from<00:00:53.219> him

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
performance from him

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.069 
performance from him
beside<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.910> man<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.300> asked<00:00:54.449> me<00:00:54.629> what<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:54.930> thought

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
beside a man you asked me what I thought

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.900 
beside a man you asked me what I thought
of<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:57.140> think<00:00:58.140> if<00:00:58.530> anything<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.640> going

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
of that and I think if anything is going

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.729 
of that and I think if anything is going
to<00:00:59.969> boost<00:01:00.329> his<00:01:00.539> confidence<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:01.140> lot<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.590> that's

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
to boost his confidence a lot and that's

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.700 
to boost his confidence a lot and that's
exactly<00:01:02.280> what<00:01:02.430> he<00:01:02.489> needed<00:01:02.670> after<00:01:03.500> round<00:01:04.500> one

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
exactly what he needed after round one

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.530 
exactly what he needed after round one
aquitar<00:01:07.100> when<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.189> comes<00:01:08.400> down<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.880> race<00:01:09.240> day<00:01:09.510> i

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
aquitar when it comes down to race day i

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.870 
aquitar when it comes down to race day i
think<00:01:09.900> if<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.140> rains<00:01:10.380> if<00:01:10.830> it's<00:01:10.979> slightly<00:01:11.610> wet

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
think if it rains if it's slightly wet

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.390 
think if it rains if it's slightly wet
it<00:01:12.150> Rossi<00:01:12.869> has<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> good<00:01:13.380> crack<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:14.010> podium

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
it Rossi has a good crack the podium

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.420 
it Rossi has a good crack the podium
because<00:01:15.200> you<00:01:16.200> know<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.650> Ducati<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.070> for

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
because you know the Ducati is for

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.520 
because you know the Ducati is for
whatever<00:01:17.580> reason<00:01:18.090> they<00:01:18.450> go<00:01:18.600> they<00:01:19.049> go<00:01:19.170> well<00:01:19.380> in

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
whatever reason they go they go well in

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.520 
whatever reason they go they go well in
the<00:01:19.619> way<00:01:19.770> people<00:01:20.130> are<00:01:21.060> still<00:01:21.240> I'm<00:01:21.900> confused

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
the way people are still I'm confused

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.960 
the way people are still I'm confused
about<00:01:22.650> why<00:01:23.040> they<00:01:23.159> go<00:01:23.280> well<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.640> wet<00:01:23.790> and

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
about why they go well in the wet and

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.840 
about why they go well in the wet and
not<00:01:24.119> willing<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.390> dry<00:01:24.630> but<00:01:24.960> they<00:01:25.680> do<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:26.520> that's

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
not willing to dry but they do so that's

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.969 
not willing to dry but they do so that's
an<00:01:27.000> advantage<00:01:27.299> for<00:01:27.630> them<00:01:29.990> but<00:01:30.990> yeah<00:01:31.470> like<00:01:31.799> I

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
an advantage for them but yeah like I

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:32.990 
an advantage for them but yeah like I
was<00:01:32.070> saying<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.280> think<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:32.759> could<00:01:32.970> really

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
was saying I think this could really

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.080 
was saying I think this could really
boost<00:01:33.450> Rossi's<00:01:33.900> confidence<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:35.250> for<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
boost Rossi's confidence so and for the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.219 
boost Rossi's confidence so and for the
rest<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.420> season<00:01:36.600> things<00:01:36.900> could<00:01:37.170> be

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
rest of the season things could be

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.590 
rest of the season things could be
looking<00:01:37.470> up<00:01:37.590> for<00:01:37.680> decay<00:01:38.060> but<00:01:39.060> they<00:01:39.180> do<00:01:39.240> need<00:01:39.479> to

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
looking up for decay but they do need to

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.880 
looking up for decay but they do need to
get<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:39.869> bike<00:01:40.049> sorted<00:01:40.470> for<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.710> dry

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
get that bike sorted for the dry

go<00:02:02.700> with<00:02:02.880> stoner<00:02:03.240> just<00:02:03.570> because<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:03.960> think<00:02:04.020> when

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
go with stoner just because I think when

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.499 
go with stoner just because I think when
it<00:02:04.799> comes<00:02:04.950> down<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.159> one<00:02:05.430> lap<00:02:05.610> he's<00:02:05.880> willing<00:02:06.479> to

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
it comes down to one lap he's willing to

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.290 
it comes down to one lap he's willing to
risk<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.990> most<00:02:07.399> bit<00:02:08.399> like<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:08.940> say<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.209> all

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
risk the most bit like I say it all

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.080 
risk the most bit like I say it all
depends<00:02:09.660> on<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.780> conditions<00:02:10.319> so

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
depends on the conditions so

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.920 
depends on the conditions so
we're<00:02:12.090> gonna<00:02:12.209> have<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.420> wait<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:12.720> see<00:02:12.810> what

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
we're gonna have to wait and see what

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.530 
we're gonna have to wait and see what
happens<00:02:12.990> but<00:02:13.410> I'm<00:02:13.560> I'll<00:02:14.310> be<00:02:14.550> quite<00:02:14.970> happy<00:02:15.000> to

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
happens but I'm I'll be quite happy to

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.180 
happens but I'm I'll be quite happy to
see<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.750> wet<00:02:16.230> race<00:02:16.410> just<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.830> see<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.130> know

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
see a wet race just to see you know

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.750 
see a wet race just to see you know
who's<00:02:18.060> willing<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.569> risk<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:18.959> and<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.760> think

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
who's willing to risk it and I think

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.979 
who's willing to risk it and I think
there's<00:02:21.000> gonna<00:02:21.090> be<00:02:21.180> some<00:02:21.360> great<00:02:21.450> racing<00:02:21.900> this

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.630 
there's gonna be some great racing this
weekend

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
weekend

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.780 
weekend
I<00:02:24.620> think<00:02:25.620> if<00:02:25.770> Rossi<00:02:26.580> can<00:02:26.819> get<00:02:27.030> himself<00:02:27.569> on<00:02:28.790> I'm

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
I think if Rossi can get himself on I'm

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.120 
I think if Rossi can get himself on I'm
the<00:02:30.150> first<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.630> rise<00:02:30.870> he<00:02:31.440> has<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.590> good<00:02:31.830> cracker

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
the first to rise he has a good cracker

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.010 
the first to rise he has a good cracker
that<00:02:32.340> podium<00:02:32.730> if<00:02:32.910> not<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.360> win<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.720> think

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
that podium if not the win I think

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:42.140 
that podium if not the win I think
that's<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.380> bit<00:02:34.590> too<00:02:36.110> well<00:02:40.459> be<00:02:41.459> I<00:02:41.489> think<00:02:41.670> this

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
that's a bit too well be I think this

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.759 
that's a bit too well be I think this
weekend's<00:02:42.480> gonna<00:02:42.569> be<00:02:42.690> great<00:02:42.930> for<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.350> for<00:02:43.709> the

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
race right now it will probably change

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.949 
race right now it will probably change
after<00:02:46.470> qualify<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.010> I'm<00:02:47.100> going<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.280> go<00:02:47.400> with

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
stoner Pedrosa and Rossi but it all

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.979 
stoner Pedrosa and Rossi but it all
depends<00:02:52.950> on<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.130> conditions<00:02:53.610> so<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.269> know<00:02:54.660> as
