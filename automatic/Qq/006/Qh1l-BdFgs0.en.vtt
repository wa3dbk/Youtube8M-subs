so<00:00:00.810> this<00:00:00.960> is<00:00:01.020> our<00:00:01.110> old<00:00:01.260> clawfoot<00:00:01.530> tub<00:00:02.129> and

00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:02.449 
so this is our old clawfoot tub and

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:04.190 
so this is our old clawfoot tub and
anyone<00:00:03.449> who's<00:00:03.570> tried<00:00:03.750> to<00:00:03.840> get<00:00:03.929> a<00:00:03.959> shower

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
anyone who's tried to get a shower

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.749 
anyone who's tried to get a shower
curtain<00:00:04.440> rod<00:00:04.740> that<00:00:05.040> works<00:00:05.279> with<00:00:05.460> a<00:00:05.520> clawfoot

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
curtain rod that works with a clawfoot

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.690 
curtain rod that works with a clawfoot
tub<00:00:06.150> knows<00:00:06.450> that<00:00:06.629> it's<00:00:06.810> not<00:00:06.870> easy<00:00:07.460> and<00:00:08.460> making

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
tub knows that it's not easy and making

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.240 
tub knows that it's not easy and making
it<00:00:08.910> more<00:00:09.090> difficult<00:00:09.360> for<00:00:10.050> me<00:00:10.530> here's<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.040> fact

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
it more difficult for me here's the fact

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.150 
it more difficult for me here's the fact
that<00:00:11.309> we<00:00:11.460> have<00:00:11.610> this<00:00:11.790> angled<00:00:12.330> ceiling<00:00:13.160> that

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
that we have this angled ceiling that

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.359 
that we have this angled ceiling that
comes<00:00:14.429> down<00:00:14.790> over<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.599> tub<00:00:15.809> so<00:00:16.740> it<00:00:17.010> was<00:00:17.130> very

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
comes down over the tub so it was very

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.279 
comes down over the tub so it was very
hard<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.789> find<00:00:17.880> one<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.449> would<00:00:18.630> fit<00:00:18.930> in<00:00:19.109> this

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
hard to find one that would fit in this

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.800 
hard to find one that would fit in this
situation<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.730> ones<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.119> could<00:00:21.510> find

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
situation and the ones that I could find

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.420 
situation and the ones that I could find
online<00:00:22.020> were<00:00:22.380> very<00:00:22.560> expensive<00:00:23.070> there<00:00:23.279> were

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
online were very expensive there were

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.660 
online were very expensive there were
like<00:00:23.550> three<00:00:23.820> or<00:00:23.910> $400<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:25.830> made<00:00:26.070> my<00:00:26.189> own<00:00:26.220> here

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
like three or $400 so I made my own here

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.479 
like three or $400 so I made my own here
this<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.949> 3/4<00:00:28.949> inch<00:00:29.160> heating<00:00:29.789> grade<00:00:30.150> copper

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
this is 3/4 inch heating grade copper

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.610 
this is 3/4 inch heating grade copper
this<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.550> what<00:00:32.700> they<00:00:32.820> use<00:00:33.030> for<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:34.320> know<00:00:34.350> hot

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
this is what they use for you know hot

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.360 
this is what they use for you know hot
water<00:00:34.829> baseboard<00:00:35.430> tubing<00:00:36.410> so<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.440> just<00:00:37.649> used<00:00:38.250> it

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
water baseboard tubing so I just used it

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.920 
water baseboard tubing so I just used it
here<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.760> make<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.000> shower<00:00:39.180> curtain<00:00:39.570> rod<00:00:39.690> it's

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
here to make the shower curtain rod it's

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.709 
here to make the shower curtain rod it's
a<00:00:39.989> pretty<00:00:40.170> simple<00:00:40.559> rectangle<00:00:41.480> this<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.570> about

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
a pretty simple rectangle this is about

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.979 
a pretty simple rectangle this is about
12<00:00:43.110> feet<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.590> copper<00:00:43.800> all<00:00:44.129> together<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:45.329> this

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
12 feet of copper all together so this

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.779 
12 feet of copper all together so this
piece<00:00:46.289> here<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.770> little<00:00:47.070> longer<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.700> this

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
piece here is a little longer and this

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.410 
piece here is a little longer and this
one<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.270> shorter<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.379> make<00:00:49.530> my<00:00:49.680> rectangle<00:00:50.420> I

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
one is shorter to make my rectangle I

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
one is shorter to make my rectangle I
just<00:00:52.050> needed<00:00:52.230> two<00:00:53.070> elbows<00:00:53.550> here<00:00:54.230> one<00:00:55.230> there

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
just needed two elbows here one there

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.060 
just needed two elbows here one there
one<00:00:56.370> here<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.940> then<00:00:57.530> I'll<00:00:58.530> show<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.800> this

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
one here and then I'll show you this

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.299 
one here and then I'll show you this
back<00:00:59.309> here<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.640> just<00:01:00.000> used<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.480> tee<00:01:01.320> right<00:01:01.890> here

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
back here I just used a tee right here

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.050 
back here I just used a tee right here
and<00:01:02.699> then<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.300> little<00:01:03.510> connector<00:01:04.110> which<00:01:04.680> had

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
and then a little connector which had

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.179 
and then a little connector which had
3/4<00:01:06.060> inch<00:01:06.210> thread<00:01:06.600> right<00:01:06.900> there<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.409> then<00:01:08.040> it

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
3/4 inch thread right there and then it

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.210 
3/4 inch thread right there and then it
goes<00:01:08.340> into<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:09.000> guy<00:01:09.270> this<00:01:09.840> steel<00:01:10.740> piece

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
goes into this guy this steel piece

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.359 
goes into this guy this steel piece
where<00:01:12.150> it's<00:01:12.299> screwed<00:01:12.630> into<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.930> wall<00:01:13.369> same

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
where it's screwed into the wall same

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.609 
where it's screwed into the wall same
deal<00:01:14.640> on<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.909> other<00:01:15.060> side<00:01:15.360> here<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:18.619> it's

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
deal on the other side here so it's

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.219 
deal on the other side here so it's
pretty<00:01:19.860> simple<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.460> do<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.880> only<00:01:21.299> difficult

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
pretty simple to do the only difficult

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.620 
pretty simple to do the only difficult
part<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.650> requires<00:01:22.770> some<00:01:23.340> some<00:01:23.970> experience

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
part that requires some some experience

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.280 
part that requires some some experience
is<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.930> soldering<00:01:25.670> of<00:01:26.810> these<00:01:27.810> guys<00:01:28.049> right

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
is the soldering of these guys right

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.520 
is the soldering of these guys right
here<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.829> all<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.670> connections<00:01:30.299> had<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.409> be

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
here so all the connections had to be

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.630 
here so all the connections had to be
soldered<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.759> I'm<00:01:33.000> sure<00:01:33.150> there's<00:01:33.360> plenty<00:01:33.540> of

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
soldered so I'm sure there's plenty of

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.460 
soldered so I'm sure there's plenty of
videos<00:01:35.640> on<00:01:35.880> YouTube<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.360> show<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.229> how<00:01:37.439> to

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
videos on YouTube to show you how to

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.370 
videos on YouTube to show you how to
solder<00:01:38.600> but<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.780> does<00:01:39.990> take<00:01:40.200> some

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
solder but that does take some

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.230 
solder but that does take some
experience<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.070> be<00:01:41.250> able<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.579> do<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.090> well

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
experience to be able to do it well

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.990 
experience to be able to do it well
there<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.229> another<00:01:43.259> option<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.130> wouldn't

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
there is another option that wouldn't

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.899 
there is another option that wouldn't
require<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.390> solder<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.960> could<00:01:46.140> use<00:01:46.439> iron<00:01:47.340> or

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
require you solder you could use iron or

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.210 
require you solder you could use iron or
steel<00:01:48.299> pipes<00:01:48.630> which<00:01:48.930> are<00:01:49.079> threaded<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.740> you

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
steel pipes which are threaded and you

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.950 
steel pipes which are threaded and you
can<00:01:50.369> get<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.610> same<00:01:50.820> all<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.210> pieces<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.810> need

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
can get the same all the pieces you need

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.940 
can get the same all the pieces you need
the<00:01:52.200> elbows<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.619> t's<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.460> only<00:01:54.240> reason<00:01:54.689> that

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
the elbows the t's the only reason that

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.880 
the elbows the t's the only reason that
that<00:01:55.950> wouldn't<00:01:56.310> be<00:01:56.399> good<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.409> when<00:01:58.740> you

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
that wouldn't be good is that when you

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.789 
that wouldn't be good is that when you
go<00:01:59.100> to<00:02:00.530> to<00:02:01.549> have<00:02:02.549> your<00:02:02.700> shower<00:02:02.909> curtain<00:02:03.299> hooks

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
go to to have your shower curtain hooks

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.080 
go to to have your shower curtain hooks
go<00:02:04.799> over<00:02:05.189> they<00:02:05.340> would<00:02:05.430> probably<00:02:05.729> get<00:02:05.850> caught

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
go over they would probably get caught

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.119 
go over they would probably get caught
whereas<00:02:06.420> these<00:02:06.570> rule<00:02:07.320> nice<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.799> smoothly

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
whereas these rule nice and smoothly

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.570 
whereas these rule nice and smoothly
