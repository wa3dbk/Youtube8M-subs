 Well , when I was going to listen to music on my PC today 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:23.300
 I received a question of what to do in order to or larger because the volume is small 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:26.060

 So splashed I will explain 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.340
 First of all, from where and where to say 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.950
 I of disk top 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.170
 Right lower right 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.829
 In place of here 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.699
 There is a Shoji area, but it is a place where this family line is coming out 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.699
 In here 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:51.000
 There is an icon like this in the beaker 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.000

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.239
 Then what is it like this 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:04.379

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:04.379
 Drag to make the sound louder Drag norther to make the sound smaller 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.630
 I put in the direction of 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.590
 Well, the technology is this surge in Chun-ho 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.859

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.580
 Speaker icon might I Nankai 

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:19.690
 In that aspect, what to do 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.510
 That voice is 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:28.300
 Here in the notification area 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:30.670
 Click here on the left of the notification area as it will be a triangle pointing up to such a small sound 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:35.409
 please 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:40.119
 Then and went I like this sound University box 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:42.420
 Since there is a radish there is that speakers in this by clicking on this 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.420
 Please give me 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.810
 Then it looks like 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.510
 Adjust the cat's volume 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:57.960
 Slider comes out 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:02:00.720
 The entire sound big two people in the slider PC notes at the I individual speakers is 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.480
 It's a small slider, so it's actually here 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:11.140
 You can adjust how to wear the volume for each application 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.140
 Click on an individual mixer to use its features 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:21.620
 In this way, the volume of each application that you are currently using 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:26.959
 It can be adjusted 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:31.300
 And here you are using cd media player if you are using a motion media player 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.300
 We will move the individual slider in the masu 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:41.250
 This will increase and lower down will reduce vomiting 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:46.740
 Have 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:49.830
 What is this but I have a the Tteyuu system Mon to such is the feeling Deato cat 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:53.160
 It has operated in that windows and say whether the notebook to use when 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.240
 When there is an error or a window goes, when the window is squirrel open 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.780
 Sound comes out 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.260
 It is like this 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.260
 I and autumn leaves 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:06.760
 If you set this too large, you will be suddenly surprised, so about 10% or less 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.900
 I think it would be better to stay 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:15.500
 Then one more 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:19.640
 Adjust the volume adjust the volume When did those of even in a little before and a laptop in addition to this 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:24.739
 The volume of the sound volume dial to go to sleep most from the keyboard after 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:28.890
 I can adjust the size at the desk and poker so there is an external 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:33.930
 I think that I think the speaker is flowing, so it is also 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:37.800
 As there is a tsunami of volume to adjust the volume, it is too much in balance with that side 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:41.730
 I think that it is good to adjust so that that big thing does not sound 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:45.110
 In most cases, it is recommended that the slider of the heart root speaker be approximately in the middle 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:49.430
 After that yeah that external sound yeah 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.980
 I think Fu that it is kana say to continue to adjust it volume on the speakers this 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:56.709
 Roughly 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.940
 I wonder if I could adjust this to a free amount and listen outside of it 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.970
 I think so 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:04.730
 This time is adjusting the volume 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:08.500
 Please try to refer to how it was 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.500
 Is one one one one one one one one 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.590
