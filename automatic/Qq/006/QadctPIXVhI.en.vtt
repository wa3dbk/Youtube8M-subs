way to get into it from footwork now and
then<00:02:05.750> I'll<00:02:05.930> demonstrate<00:02:06.110> a<00:02:06.440> few<00:02:06.619> others<00:02:07.039> just

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
then I'll demonstrate a few others just

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.889 
then I'll demonstrate a few others just
so<00:02:07.580> that<00:02:07.729> you<00:02:07.820> know<00:02:07.850> that<00:02:08.300> you<00:02:08.479> can<00:02:08.630> get<00:02:08.750> into
