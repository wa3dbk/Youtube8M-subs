I made during the actual review I added
annotations<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.060> original<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.600> fix<00:00:18.810> up

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
annotations to the original to fix up

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.330 
annotations to the original to fix up
the<00:00:19.080> errors<00:00:19.380> but<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:19.560> really<00:00:19.980> really<00:00:20.189> hate

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
the errors but I really really hate

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.160 
the errors but I really really hate
doing<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:20.730> almost<00:00:21.480> as<00:00:21.600> much<00:00:21.720> as<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:21.960> hate

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
doing that almost as much as I hate

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.050 
doing that almost as much as I hate
making<00:00:22.439> them<00:00:22.619> in<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.859> first<00:00:23.130> place<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
making them in the first place and the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.029 
making them in the first place and the
second<00:00:24.420> purpose<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.750> this<00:00:24.810> video<00:00:25.140> is<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.890> give

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
second purpose of this video is to give

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.589 
second purpose of this video is to give
people<00:00:26.070> who<00:00:26.460> don't<00:00:26.670> have<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.029> time<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.480> go

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
people who don't have the time to go

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.870 
people who don't have the time to go
through<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.930> 15<00:00:28.500> minute<00:00:28.740> video<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:29.189> shorter

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
through a 15 minute video a shorter

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.490 
through a 15 minute video a shorter
version<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.359> briefly<00:00:30.689> outlines<00:00:31.230> the

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
version that briefly outlines the

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.150 
version that briefly outlines the
important<00:00:32.099> bits<00:00:32.340> without<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.390> elaboration

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
important bits without the elaboration

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.530 
important bits without the elaboration
so<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.309> Nano<00:00:35.520> we've<00:00:35.700> armor<00:00:35.969> certification

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
so the Nano we've armor certification

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.970 
so the Nano we've armor certification
that<00:00:36.630> was<00:00:36.780> introduced<00:00:37.260> with<00:00:37.469> performance

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
that was introduced with performance

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.459 
that was introduced with performance
update<00:00:38.280> 2<00:00:38.489> has<00:00:38.730> been<00:00:38.760> extremely<00:00:39.480> revised

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
update 2 has been extremely revised

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.650 
update 2 has been extremely revised
instead<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.399> adding<00:00:41.579> 250<00:00:42.149> health<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.540> your

but the way that they affect your
playstyle<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.910> different<00:01:00.719> instead<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.859> having

a health pool of 500 shields and 750
health<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.189> you're<00:01:05.309> getting<00:01:05.489> an<00:01:05.700> effective

resistance<00:01:10.890> affects<00:01:11.369> both<00:01:11.610> pools<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.840> either
