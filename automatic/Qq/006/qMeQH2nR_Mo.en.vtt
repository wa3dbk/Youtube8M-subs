00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.185
 FELICIA: I'm here at the Third Street Dance Studio with 

00:00:20.185 --> 00:00:20.230
 my friend, Kevin. 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.020
 KEVIN: Hello, Felicia. 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:21.920
 FELICIA: Hello. 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.080
 KEVIN: I see you're wearing a poodle skirt. 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.240
 FELICIA: Yes, where is your poodle skirt? 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.970
 KEVIN: I have forgotten him. 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.430
 I know I left it at home. 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:27.775
 Next time. 

00:00:27.775 --> 00:00:28.322
 FELICIA: Or your 8-bit bow tie. 

00:00:28.322 --> 00:00:29.130
 KEVIN: Or the 8-bit bow tie. 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.770
 I also like your 8-bit bow tie. 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:31.165
 FELICIA: Yay. 

00:00:31.165 --> 00:00:31.560
 KEVIN: Yay. 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.630
 We are robots. 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:33.130
 FELICIA: OK. 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.150
 KEVIN: We're going to dance. 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.424
 FELICIA: This is Larisa and she is ours today 

00:00:36.424 --> 00:00:37.720
 swing teacher. 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.110
 Are we at risk here of being injured? 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.910
 is Kevin going to hurt me? 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.120
 LARISA: No, of course not. 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.480
 We are going to start with our feet under our shoulders. 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.860
 FELICIA: I have trouble with what is right and left. 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.440
 I want to make that clear in advance. 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.710
 I have to do this in my head. 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.640
 LARISA: But Kevin will take care of you. 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.420
 KEVIN: I'll take care of you. 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.460
 FELICIA: Is this a chauvinistic dance? 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.150
 Because-- 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.570
 LARISA: You know, this is the only place in the world where 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.560
 he may be in charge. 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.170
 So-- 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.986
 KEVIN: Whoa. 

00:00:59.986 --> 00:01:00.372
 LARISA: But this is good. 

00:01:00.372 --> 00:01:01.190
 This is good. 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.450
 We can take it easy. 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.920
 KEVIN: Whoa, I now have a dominant position. 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.900
 FELICIA: I don't know if I like this. 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.390
 Can I learn the role of the man? 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.097
 KEVIN: She can't be the man. 

00:01:06.097 --> 00:01:07.840
 She is wearing a poodle skirt. 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.270
 LARISA: I think you'll see the surrender later 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.394
 as something good. 

00:01:11.394 --> 00:01:12.302
 I know that sounds crazy. 

00:01:12.302 --> 00:01:12.756
 FELICIA: What the hell? 

00:01:12.756 --> 00:01:13.210
 KEVIN: Just do it. 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.050
 FELICIA: You will never earn a vagina with that. 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.660
 LARISA: OK. 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.850
 Slow, slow, and fast, fast, slow, slow, fast, fast. 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.040
 Easy, right? 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.230
 KEVIN: Very easy. 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.765
 LARISA: Whoa. 

00:01:25.765 --> 00:01:26.715
 KEVIN: Wait-- 

00:01:26.715 --> 00:01:27.665
 FELICIA: He did it wrong! 

00:01:27.665 --> 00:01:29.090
 He did it wrong! 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.515
 LARISA: We don't blame anyone! 

00:01:30.515 --> 00:01:31.465
 KEVIN: We don't blame anyone! 

00:01:31.465 --> 00:01:32.875
 We are a team and if she does not realize then 

00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:34.210
 I just push her. 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.190
 LARISA: Well, yes, actually. 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.660
 FELICIA: What? 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.498
 Wait, what? 

00:01:37.498 --> 00:01:37.976
 KEVIN: We are running. 

00:01:37.976 --> 00:01:40.844
 FELICIA: I tend to lead. 

00:01:40.844 --> 00:01:41.800
 KEVIN: Too bad then. 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.110
 FELICIA: I have to surrender. 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.048
 KEVIN: Too bad then, you have to be submissive now. 

00:01:45.048 --> 00:01:46.530
 FELICIA: I'm not submissive! 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.810
 KEVIN: Slow! 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:48.810
 Ah! 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.810
 No, don't hurt me. 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.310
 LARISA: Do we have to change roles now? 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.310
 KEVIN: I'm the man! 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.310
 FELICIA: Ow! 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.982
 LARISA: Ok, don't forget that we are working on a swing lesson, 

00:01:58.982 --> 00:02:00.145
 hence the poodle skirt. 

00:02:00.145 --> 00:02:02.470
 We are going back to a closed position. 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.410
 KEVIN: Hey, let me-- 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.320
 I'll make sure they-- 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.180
 FELICIA: I don't think so myself. 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.758
 I'm a submissive soda can, Kevin. 

00:02:09.758 --> 00:02:11.377
 LARISA: And then backwards with the left foot and 

00:02:11.377 --> 00:02:12.060
 tap with the right. 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.350
 This routine-- 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.636
 FELICIA: Oh, this is Charleston. 

00:02:13.636 --> 00:02:14.950
 My mother taught me this. 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.452
 LARISA: And forward, forward and kick and back and 

00:02:20.452 --> 00:02:23.650
 tap, and forward and kick and back and tap. 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.150
 Beautiful. 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.060
 And now-- 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.790
 KEVIN: What happened? 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.160
 FELICIA: I became enthusiastic! 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.460
 LARISA: And slowly, slowly-- 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.053
 FELICIA: Oh, I was waiting for you! 

00:02:33.053 --> 00:02:34.442
 KEVIN: What are you doing? 

00:02:34.442 --> 00:02:35.831
 Let me do this! 

00:02:35.831 --> 00:02:37.683
 FELICIA: This is me when I am 90. 

00:02:37.683 --> 00:02:38.880
 LARISA: I'll count for you. 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.670
 Here we go. 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.778
 Ready-- 

00:02:40.778 --> 00:02:41.594
 He goes-- 

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:43.275
 KEVIN: Hey I didn't turn you on! 

00:02:43.275 --> 00:02:43.760
 FELICIA: [BLEP] 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.853
 LARISA: I'll show you what to do and then I'll go 

00:02:45.853 --> 00:02:48.660
 then tell you what this is called. 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.140
 You go as stiff as a board all the way down. 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.760
 With your right knee bent. 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.250
 FELICIA: What? 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.720
 Something like that? 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.210
 LARISA: Look. 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.910
 FELICIA: I don't trust this at all. 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:58.700
 So more or less like that-- 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.200
 LARISA: Whoa! 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.700
 Whoa! 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.405
 And pull her up. 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.866
 FELICIA: I dropped my ass. 

00:03:06.866 --> 00:03:07.838
 LARISA: Over, over, over! 

00:03:07.838 --> 00:03:08.324
 KEVIN: I forgot to step. 

00:03:08.324 --> 00:03:10.754
 LARISA: Ah! 

00:03:10.754 --> 00:03:12.212
 I'll help you up. 

00:03:12.212 --> 00:03:12.698
 FELICIA: Thank you! 

00:03:12.698 --> 00:03:15.128
 He thinks, she's figuring it out! 

00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:17.810
 LARISA: Step with your left leg and pull her 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:18.480
 her up on the other side. 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.470
 Pop. 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.965
 KEVIN: Whoa 

00:03:19.965 --> 00:03:22.940
 LARISA: Ready! 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.290
 Now I tell you the name. 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.010
 FELICIA: What's it called? 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.910
 LARISA: Death trap. 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.600
 KEVIN: Death trap! 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.870
 LARISA: Well, are you ready for the final? 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:30.170
 FELICIA: Yes. 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.730
 KEVIN: Yes. 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.430
 LARISA: Maybe Kevin can just stay the cool guy. 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.610
 FELICIA: There we go. 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:38.800
 Hey cool guy. 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.080
 KEVIN: Hey, pop. 

00:04:24.275 --> 00:04:25.840
 LARISA: That was pretty good. 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.632
 FELICIA: Thank you very much. 

00:04:27.632 --> 00:04:30.087
 That was the best thing I have done in ages. 

00:04:30.087 --> 00:04:31.540
 KEVIN: That's the best workout I've had in ages. 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.770
 FELICIA: It was quite a task to let the man lead. 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:34.616
 KEVIN: I know it. 

00:04:34.616 --> 00:04:35.260
 Did you learn anything from that? 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.100
 FELICIA: I don't think it translated into real life. 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.350
 OK Bye.
