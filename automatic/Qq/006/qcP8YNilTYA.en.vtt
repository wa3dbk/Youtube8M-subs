written one wrote more a helmet she was
upset<00:02:38.450> and<00:02:39.100> wanted<00:02:40.100> to<00:02:40.130> wear<00:02:40.340> a<00:02:40.370> hat<00:02:40.580> and<00:02:40.850> I

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
upset and wanted to wear a hat and I

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.700 
upset and wanted to wear a hat and I
explained<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.660> her<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.870> dad<00:02:42.170> wore<00:02:42.440> a<00:02:42.470> helmet

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
when he was young as well and I think

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.740 
when he was young as well and I think
it's<00:02:45.050> very<00:02:45.110> very<00:02:45.530> important<00:02:46.040> she<00:02:46.790> was<00:02:46.970> Charlie

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
today a little bit about whether he

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.500 
today a little bit about whether he
arrived<00:04:35.930> with<00:04:36.080> two<00:04:36.110> hands<00:04:36.680> with<00:04:36.890> one<00:04:37.100> hand

she's keeping her horses shoulder
strength<00:04:39.980> I<00:04:40.160> think<00:04:40.190> it's<00:04:40.460> important<00:04:40.970> she<00:04:41.780> rode

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
strength I think it's important she rode

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.360 
strength I think it's important she rode
with<00:04:42.020> one<00:04:42.350> head<00:04:42.530> at<00:04:42.650> the<00:04:42.710> beginning<00:04:43.100> about<00:04:43.310> the

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
with one head at the beginning about the

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.180 
with one head at the beginning about the
hold<00:04:43.640> on<00:04:43.790> her<00:04:44.030> settle<00:04:44.480> and<00:04:44.630> now<00:04:44.750> she's<00:04:45.050> she<00:04:45.740> she

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
hold on her settle and now she's she she

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.310 
hold on her settle and now she's she she
learned<00:04:46.460> I<00:04:46.580> was<00:04:46.670> having<00:04:46.940> one<00:04:47.420> in<00:04:47.660> or<00:04:47.870> two<00:04:48.080> hands

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
learned I was having one in or two hands

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.440 
learned I was having one in or two hands
but<00:04:48.560> it<00:04:48.980> gets<00:04:49.220> a<00:04:49.370> balanced<00:04:49.790> body<00:04:50.060> that<00:04:50.360> her

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
but it gets a balanced body that her

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.420 
but it gets a balanced body that her
balance<00:04:50.870> and<00:04:50.990> rhythmic<00:04:51.470> mountains<00:04:51.920> very<00:04:52.100> very

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
balance and rhythmic mountains very very

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.610 
balance and rhythmic mountains very very
important<00:04:52.910> here<00:04:52.940> as<00:04:53.420> she<00:04:53.750> slides<00:04:54.110> and<00:04:54.410> rides

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
important here as she slides and rides

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:55.960 
important here as she slides and rides
with<00:04:54.860> the<00:04:54.920> horse<00:04:55.130> she<00:04:55.280> doesn't<00:04:55.610> go<00:04:55.700> against
