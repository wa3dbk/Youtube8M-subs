00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.519
 of custard custard we are going to 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:09.099
 need when you're a cup of milk 

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:13.089
 of sugar a spoonful of essence of 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:18.250
 vanilla 4 yolks 6 tablespoons of starch 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:22.420
 of corn 400 grams of straw puff and 6 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:25.300
 large natural plums and cut into 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.800
 We're ready slices first 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.869
 what is our pastry cream 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.839
 because if the pastry cream does not 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.309
 we have nothing but that's how in a pot 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:34.450
 I'm going to put the milk and I 'm going to 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.910
 remember what they are or some 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.920
 ingredient that happened to him when giving some 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.460
 step in the procedure do not worry 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.340
 can be the page www.zara.com 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.379
 want to find these recipes more if it is 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.270
 do not think more, go to the page 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.059
 and there you will find absolutely everything 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.859
 we have the milk that we are going to heat 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.329
 here along with the water along with the 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:01:00.019
 sugar I forgive the milk in the 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.519
 let's go moving and vanilla 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.309
 we put the milk the sugar the vanilla 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:07.619
 nothing else we are going to move here so that 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.740
 incorporate and let's wait for it to release 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.229
 the first light boil remember that 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.479
 if they leave milk here on the fire 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.430
 for a long time when letting the boil 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.590
 the only thing that happens is that it's going to 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.380
 overflowing like that is that eye with that if it's 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.119
 that you have to be very careful 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.700
 while it's frozen I'm going to incorporate 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.630
 the eggs with the starch I have here the 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.630
 buds we're just going to incorporate the 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.159
 the yolks with the corn starch 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.740
 that is well well incorporated all 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.719
 let's incorporate the perfectly if 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.850
 suddenly you feel it is very dry 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:46.490
 It's hard for him to put a trickle of 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.710
 minimal water nothing more and good 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.959
 is practically going to incorporate well not 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.549
 they remain liquid to be thick but 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:53.509
 we are going to reserve what I need is 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.850
 that the film dissolves 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.099
 perfectly well together with the yolks 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.439
 let's reserve the almonds there 

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:01.670
 powder and starch mixed with the yolks 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.610
 for it 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.970
 at the table our puff pastry swims 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.130
 more let's cover our base with a 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.560
 little bit of flour so we do not miss 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.620
 go to paste and we will turn on then 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.580
 our 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.810
 puff pastry we have here the list 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.840
 water that the pasta sheets of lÃ©ala 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.790
 find in any supermarket or in 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.350
 any bakery will easily 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.570
 find is pretty 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.240
 it is not so expensive and with the total lack of 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.280
 we can be empanadas we can know 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.560
 letters or we're not going today we can 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.350
 to be absolutely of everything and nothing else is 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.990
 issue of extending it from extending to what 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.730
 more even possible to count than to 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.860
 is more or less the same thickness what 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.210
 that I always recommend this has been 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.340
 the same force trying to do the 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.030
 same strength of half up and 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.030
 from the middle to the bottom 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.030
 both forward to below the 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.819
 life for one side of the cta for the other 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.590
 and in this way we will have the most 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:06.150
 possible partner but the cooking of 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:08.010
 suddenly it becomes difficult because a part 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.260
 My little ribs look good 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.970
 damn other creatures if that eye 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.370
 with that we are going to cover now this 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.780
 refractory that is refractory is already 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.180
 covered with butter and flour for 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.709
 that takes off with great ease and 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.569
 well actually happened to the stand has 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.690
 so much butter that there is not much 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:31.840
 problem we are going to cover our 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:35.319
 refractory or any cake mold 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.569
 let's just cut the edges the 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:41.910
 shores that we have 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:47.080
 we already have great appointments there is already 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:50.800
 let's cut the edges in this way 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.140
 so that it is well our dough sheet 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.430
 covering absolutely everything can be 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.690
 with a knife or it can also be with the 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.040
 roll as we have already done many other 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:06.720
 times pressing a little 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.850
 to shape this list 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.900
 we already have there then our base of 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.390
 puff pastry 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.720
 let's save the rest and go now to 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.280
 finish making our pastry cream 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.730
 then we have here the milk that is 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.720
 loose completely with sugar and 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.190
 vanilla 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.770
 we are already releasing the first boil since 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.380
 the solicitous is boiling if it's time 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.050
 then to add this mixture of 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.970
 cornstarch and yolks can now be 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.560
 one thing that we have here are already 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.520
 body and better that is pretty 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.560
 hot 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.600
 here we have buds so good then 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.490
 of course the time to incorporate them 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.650
 if we do not move quickly and 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.710
 continuously then surely 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:50.220
 we are going to curdle the yolks was up 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:53.610
 this fire a few minutes 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:56.129
 and I will add now then little to 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.040
 little our buds 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:02.190
 previously mixed with starch 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.490
 and I will move continuously with the 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:09.600
 balloon beater this way we're going to 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.880
 prevent the buds from curdling 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.340
 and we need the yolks in the cream 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.910
 pastry to take it for granted 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:19.500
 consistency and flavor the yolks of 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.190
 egg will give you consistency and flavor 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.190
 to the pastry cream 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:29.419
 let's finish adding everything we can 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.669
 also if they want to go tempering little to 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:34.310
 little is to say go adding a bit of the 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:36.410
 clear table hot to the yolks 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.830
 so that they go more or less equal 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.940
 the temperature and we are not going to cook 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.540
 then this also we can do 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:47.210
 nothing more with a ladle add a little 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:50.419
 of this hot mix here move 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.289
 also continuously whisk 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:56.339
 balloon 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:58.319
 and well, we just get incorporated 

00:05:56.339 --> 00:06:00.419
 then the yolks along with the milk 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:02.430
 you immediately feel the mixture a 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:05.309
 little heavier here we do not know 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.589
 they knew the yolks of ace is pretty 

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:09.479
 well let's leave them on fire 

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:12.300
 nothing else moving continuously so that 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:14.219
 do not look to sew there suddenly we 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.050
 the small groups will be left if 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:18.980
 nice gentlemen do not worry what 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:22.040
 pass is to pass it through a colander 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:25.520
 and we're going to let her go moving 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:27.080
 I constantly repeat so that I will thicken 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.710
 I have here a key a pastry cream 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.840
 list that already thick I give blades in this 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.370
 mixture is the almond I like 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.130
 create ease with almonds and that is 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:39.530
 let's go here add the almond powder 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:42.290
 also that it will help us to give flavor and 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:44.289
 consistency our pastry cream and 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:48.100
 she is ready 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:52.240
 so let's take out a fire to thicken 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:56.520
 here I have a cold one and let's go now 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:58.690
 then to fill our letters 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.490
 they may be trying to give pallets 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.190
 little ones or it can be a big one like 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:06.670
 is with the pastry cream 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:09.400
 let's cover it completely from nothing 

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:12.400
 more nothing more so I crave 

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.470
 we are going to put everything complete so that 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.630
 is well filled with custard I 

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:19.240
 I 'm going to take it to the oven 180 degrees 

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:21.789
 centigrade the furnace I'll take you here 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.020
 baked about 45 minutes already I have to 

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:28.400
 a list 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:30.830
 then with the plums we go home 

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:34.910
 That I have here 

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:36.530
 I 'm going to bring it to the table and I'm going to 

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:39.320
 cover with fresh plums that 

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:41.780
 I have here I'm accommodating my 

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.730
 plums on top and what about 

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:45.800
 yes while we just show all 

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:49.360
 Dancing dishes straight to the table and 

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.360
 reception we share
