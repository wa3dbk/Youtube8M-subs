reprap back in the spring I mean it's
just<00:00:03.449> so<00:00:03.840> many<00:00:04.529> things<00:00:04.560> it<00:00:04.950> does<00:00:05.130> I<00:00:05.160> mean

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
just so many things it does I mean

just so many things it does I mean
number<00:00:05.670> one<00:00:05.700> you<00:00:06.029> usually<00:00:06.180> always<00:00:06.480> got<00:00:06.720> a

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
number one you usually always got a

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.360 
number one you usually always got a
pretty<00:00:07.020> steep<00:00:07.290> drop<00:00:07.649> you<00:00:07.830> know<00:00:07.950> right<00:00:07.980> along

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
pretty steep drop you know right along

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.770 
pretty steep drop you know right along
the<00:00:08.490> edge<00:00:08.519> of<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:08.760> riprap<00:00:09.090> and<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.389> second

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
the edge of the riprap and the second

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.299 
the edge of the riprap and the second
thing<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:10.110> I<00:00:10.230> mean<00:00:10.410> when<00:00:10.530> that<00:00:10.650> Sun<00:00:10.920> beats<00:00:11.190> down

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
thing is I mean when that Sun beats down

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.150 
thing is I mean when that Sun beats down
on<00:00:11.460> that<00:00:11.730> rock<00:00:12.110> it'll<00:00:13.110> really<00:00:13.320> warm<00:00:13.679> up<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.070> I

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
on that rock it'll really warm up and I

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.410 
on that rock it'll really warm up and I
mean<00:00:14.309> that<00:00:14.429> water<00:00:14.670> right<00:00:14.910> up<00:00:14.940> against<00:00:15.330> the

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
mean that water right up against the

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.939 
mean that water right up against the
rock<00:00:15.630> could<00:00:15.839> be<00:00:16.049> you<00:00:16.199> know<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.350> degree<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:16.920> a

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
rock could be you know a degree and a

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.800 
rock could be you know a degree and a
half<00:00:17.130> two<00:00:17.340> degrees<00:00:17.640> warmer<00:00:18.060> than<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.390> main

half two degrees warmer than the main
body<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.260> water<00:00:19.500> especially<00:00:19.850> you<00:00:20.850> know

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
on that date at the same time mine's got

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.479 
on that date at the same time mine's got
a<00:00:39.390> mouthful<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.870> Mia<00:00:40.230> helping<00:00:40.530> down<00:00:41.399> the

Master the Bagan how about you 14 pound
test<00:01:09.090> line<00:01:09.210> bike<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:10.130> usually<00:01:11.130> use<00:01:11.400> 10<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.760> lot<00:01:12.090> I

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
test line bike I usually use 10 a lot I

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.150 
test line bike I usually use 10 a lot I
guess<00:01:12.450> man<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.080> don't<00:01:13.140> guess<00:01:13.440> it<00:01:13.470> makes

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
guess man and I don't guess it makes

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.190 
guess man and I don't guess it makes
much<00:01:14.400> difference<00:01:14.430> well<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.330> big<00:01:15.750> thing<00:01:15.990> there

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
much difference well the big thing there

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.050 
much difference well the big thing there
is<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.740> diameter<00:01:17.430> when<00:01:17.550> you<00:01:17.640> start<00:01:17.880> talking

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
is is diameter when you start talking

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.490 
is is diameter when you start talking
about<00:01:18.300> you<00:01:18.570> know<00:01:18.690> there's<00:01:18.869> everybody's

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
about you know there's everybody's

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.290 
about you know there's everybody's
diameters<00:01:20.070> vary<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.490> little<00:01:20.640> bit<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:21.119> know<00:01:21.150> I

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
diameters vary a little bit you know I

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.969 
diameters vary a little bit you know I
mean<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.630> want<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.050> use<00:01:22.200> something<00:01:22.229> that's<00:01:22.680> got

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
mean I want to use something that's got

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.830 
mean I want to use something that's got
a<00:01:23.040> fairly<00:01:23.340> small<00:01:23.490> diameter<00:01:24.150> i'm<00:01:24.210> using<00:01:24.570> son

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
a fairly small diameter i'm using son

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.650 
a fairly small diameter i'm using son
line<00:01:25.110> monofilament<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.250> that's<00:01:26.940> probably<00:01:27.180> in

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
line monofilament and that's probably in

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.300 
line monofilament and that's probably in
my<00:01:27.840> opinion<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.320> most<00:01:28.410> critical<00:01:28.740> thing<00:01:29.190> in

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
my opinion the most critical thing in

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.790 
my opinion the most critical thing in
the<00:01:29.400> springtime<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:30.300> using<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.350> monofilament

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
the springtime is using a monofilament

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.740 
the springtime is using a monofilament
over<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> fluorocarbon<00:01:32.880> because<00:01:33.270> fluorocarbon

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
over a fluorocarbon because fluorocarbon

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.530 
over a fluorocarbon because fluorocarbon
actually<00:01:34.350> will<00:01:34.500> sink<00:01:34.880> monofilament<00:01:35.880> floats

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
actually will sink monofilament floats

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.510 
actually will sink monofilament floats
or<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.930> basically<00:01:37.530> suspends<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.340> water

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
or it basically suspends in the water

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.010 
or it basically suspends in the water
column<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:39.090> you're<00:01:39.270> not<00:01:39.360> going<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.630> drag<00:01:39.840> your

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
column so you're not going to drag your

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.990 
column so you're not going to drag your
bait<00:01:40.229> down<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.770> mean<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.280> know<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.759> kind<00:01:41.940> of

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
bait down I mean I know that kind of

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.280 
bait down I mean I know that kind of
goes<00:01:42.149> against<00:01:42.600> what<00:01:42.630> i<00:01:42.750> was<00:01:42.960> saying<00:01:43.170> earlier

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
goes against what i was saying earlier

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.990 
goes against what i was saying earlier
about<00:01:43.590> wanting<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.009> get<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.310> bait<00:01:44.520> down<00:01:44.729> but

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
about wanting to get that bait down but

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.580 
about wanting to get that bait down but
i<00:01:45.060> don't<00:01:45.240> want<00:01:45.420> my<00:01:45.540> line<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.960> sink<00:01:46.229> below<00:01:46.350> my
