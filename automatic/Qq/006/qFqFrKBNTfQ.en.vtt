00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:08.880
 So now I want to join you 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.150
 find new receivers here with the 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.650
 Remote control 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.580
 We put the binding plug for that 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:21.300
 at the top of bmc 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.920
 why do not you care then we have to 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.439
 our car about because of 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.939
 power supply watch which cable that 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.029
 that's the first one 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.360
 practically at the top of a piece of mathis 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.790
 Let's take care of it now 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.329
 the polarity is on it what 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:43.850
 plus and what - is and is then 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.850
 Either in 12 340 no matter 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:52.309
 red is plus can be quite good instead of good times 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:56.210
 down here is that we have here now 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.210
 made the plug clean 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:04.399
 the remote control switches this 1 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:22.920
 Now we go to settings resp 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:26.800
 into the menu over here on eric setup 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:31.590
 and go to receiver bind receiver 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.590
 they are safe and then he wears 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.869
 then we give up even last me the 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.810
 Tying menu inside practically looks then 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:44.200
 so off and now we turn off completely 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.789
 just here the power supply 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.190
 or we have to first 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:52.929
 the battery connection without a battery, there's 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:55.590
 namely no electricity therefore Beck closes 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:55.590
 you can quickly reach 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.159
 at the rear is also connected and now 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.140
 Let's just turn it on for the current 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.769
 on 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.380
 and then there should be the menu here too 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:18.040
 go away again 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:18.850
 I once had a network sounds there now 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:25.870
 always tied 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:34.329
 turn it off now we pull 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:37.269
 make the binding plug good 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:40.209
 pick up and cover the 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.920
 So power supply from the channel 1 completely 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:50.040
 above at bmc approx 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:53.070
 where it belongs right now is now 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.840
 we can do a remote control here and 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.730
 now usually turn me on 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.620
 would have to be on the top right 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.190
 there must be red yellow now if we are 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:07.030
 turn on must change exactly and 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:13.859
 now also pointed us to internal 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:13.859
 voltages exactly 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.000
 it was the request actually already 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.450
 we can here again seems 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.450
 out 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.540
 and then do that with the change 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.060
 further from the old to the 9th 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:48.230
 then you look here this is channel 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:56.510
 2 he here is channel 2 and the 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:04:11.560
 cities will be two and here after the 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:11.560
 channel 1 purely in the first channel 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:21.680
 now we've put that around and 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:24.100
 now usually when we are now 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:29.570
 turn on 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:32.650
 again should actually should 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:48.190
 Servus now go again 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:51.860
 I'll put a properly installed 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:55.000
 ok now actually the cable stuff 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.000
 stow away again 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.840
 and here 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:18.819
 because a small plug in here 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:25.990
 practically risk the cable 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:25.990
 but we still have to do that 7 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.330
 and that was it already 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:39.259
 again then I thank you 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:41.410
 has watched and says to the next 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:41.410
 times
