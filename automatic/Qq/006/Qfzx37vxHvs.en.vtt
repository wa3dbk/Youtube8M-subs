Honduras are actually our second game

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.100 
Honduras are actually our second game
and<00:00:43.969> it<00:00:44.969> was<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.120> pretty<00:00:45.329> good<00:00:45.420> game<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.989> know

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
and it was a pretty good game you know

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.110 
and it was a pretty good game you know
balance<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.920> was<00:00:47.010> on<00:00:47.070> turf<00:00:47.280> field<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:47.730> he<00:00:47.760> can't

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
balance it was on turf field so he can't

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.520 
balance it was on turf field so he can't
really<00:00:48.360> get<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.570> best<00:00:48.690> passes<00:00:49.140> in<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.350> game

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
really get the best passes in that game

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.000 
really get the best passes in that game
but<00:00:50.219> uh<00:00:50.250> they<00:00:50.760> scored<00:00:51.059> first<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.480> then<00:00:52.230> we<00:00:52.920> had

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
but uh they scored first and then we had

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.410 
but uh they scored first and then we had
a<00:00:53.039> few<00:00:53.280> chances<00:00:53.309> early<00:00:53.730> on<00:00:54.030> could<00:00:54.239> actually

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
a few chances early on could actually

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.569 
a few chances early on could actually
started<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.289> scoring<00:00:55.649> first<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.219> then<00:00:56.309> we

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
started the scoring first and then we

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.340 
started the scoring first and then we
came<00:00:56.730> back<00:00:56.789> with<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.539> goal<00:00:57.750> from<00:00:57.870> Corey<00:00:58.140> bear

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
came back with a goal from Corey bear

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.049 
came back with a goal from Corey bear
that<00:00:58.590> game<00:00:58.739> was<00:00:58.859> pretty<00:00:59.160> tight<00:00:59.489> they're

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
that game was pretty tight they're

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.020 
that game was pretty tight they're
really<00:01:00.300> athletic<00:01:00.719> team<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.590> Costa<00:01:02.100> Rica<00:01:02.129> they

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
really athletic team in Costa Rica they

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.670 
really athletic team in Costa Rica they
had<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> big<00:01:03.570> number<00:01:03.719> nine<00:01:03.960> who<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.320> dangerous

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
had a big number nine who is dangerous

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.620 
had a big number nine who is dangerous
and<00:01:04.799> behind<00:01:05.129> but<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.030> think<00:01:06.270> we<00:01:06.360> were<00:01:06.420> able<00:01:06.510> to

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
and behind but I think we were able to

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.789 
and behind but I think we were able to
control<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.049> game<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.229> little<00:01:07.530> bit<00:01:07.619> better

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
control the game a little bit better

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:08.870 
control the game a little bit better
than<00:01:08.010> they<00:01:08.159> were<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.460> get<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.670> ball<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:08.850> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
than they were and get the ball in the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.780 
than they were and get the ball in the
ground<00:01:08.970> pass<00:01:09.299> 100<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.049> lot<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.409> abilities<00:01:10.860> we

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
ground pass 100 a lot of abilities we

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.359 
ground pass 100 a lot of abilities we
know<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:11.939> they're<00:01:12.150> really<00:01:12.270> athletic<00:01:12.420> but<00:01:13.260> uh

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
know that they're really athletic but uh

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.679 
know that they're really athletic but uh
personally<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.580> team-wise<00:01:15.270> we<00:01:15.479> don't<00:01:15.600> really

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
personally and team-wise we don't really

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:16.880 
personally and team-wise we don't really
don't<00:01:15.869> know<00:01:15.990> too<00:01:16.049> much<00:01:16.259> about<00:01:16.320> them<00:01:16.680> haven't

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
don't know too much about them haven't

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.980 
don't know too much about them haven't
played<00:01:17.040> too<00:01:17.159> much<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.909> once<00:01:18.540> again<00:01:18.659> we<00:01:18.869> have<00:01:18.960> to

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
played too much so once again we have to

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.719 
played too much so once again we have to
focus<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.409> ourselves<00:01:19.500> go<00:01:20.100> forward<00:01:20.369> with<00:01:20.520> what

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
focus on ourselves go forward with what

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.880 
focus on ourselves go forward with what
we<00:01:20.880> know<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.330> then<00:01:21.720> play<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.290> game<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.799> way

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
we know and then play that game the way

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.800 
we know and then play that game the way
we<00:01:23.009> play<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.369> well<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:23.939> think<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.240> also<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.630> helps

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
we play it well I think it also it helps

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.179 
we play it well I think it also it helps
because<00:01:25.170> we've<00:01:25.500> been<00:01:25.530> playing<00:01:25.860> together<00:01:25.950> for

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
because we've been playing together for

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.100

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
understanding each other's movements and

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.969 
understanding each other's movements and
we<00:01:30.150> know<00:01:30.329> what<00:01:31.110> someone<00:01:31.409> can<00:01:31.500> do<00:01:31.619> on<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.799> ball

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.859 
we know what someone can do on the ball
and<00:01:32.310> we<00:01:32.430> trust<00:01:32.970> each<00:01:33.060> other<00:01:33.180> with<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.509> ball<00:01:33.540> so

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
and we trust each other with the ball so

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:34.999 
and we trust each other with the ball so
I<00:01:33.930> think<00:01:34.049> we're<00:01:34.200> moving<00:01:34.320> better<00:01:34.590> at<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.860> ball

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
I think we're moving better at the ball

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.410 
I think we're moving better at the ball
we<00:01:35.189> know<00:01:35.310> how<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.880> get<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.299> good

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
we know how to get in the good

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.240 
we know how to get in the good
opportunities<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.020> get<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.259> goals<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.740> mean<00:01:38.100> on

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
opportunities to get the goals I mean on

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.859 
opportunities to get the goals I mean on
this<00:01:38.369> field<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.700> think<00:01:38.880> would<00:01:38.970> do<00:01:39.060> better<00:01:39.240> move

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
this field I think would do better move

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.390 
this field I think would do better move
the<00:01:39.960> ball<00:01:40.140> quickly<00:01:40.409> like<00:01:40.890> once<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.220> touch

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
the ball quickly like once you touch

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.730 
the ball quickly like once you touch

that Coach Richie says and as long as we
play<00:01:43.860> quick<00:01:44.159> we<00:01:44.759> get<00:01:45.000> our<00:01:45.240> forwards<00:01:45.600> up<00:01:45.750> there

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.590 
what you've always been doing the entire
life<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.770> choose<00:02:35.280> word<00:02:35.580> all<00:02:35.850> down<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.180> one<00:02:36.390> game

life I choose word all down to one game
but<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:36.930> think<00:02:37.260> after<00:02:37.440> like<00:02:37.860> 15<00:02:38.100> minutes<00:02:38.460> we'll

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.130 
but I think after like 15 minutes we'll
settle<00:02:38.880> down<00:02:39.060> inside<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.540> play<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.840> way<00:02:39.930> we<00:02:39.960> do

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
settle down inside to play the way we do

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.200 
settle down inside to play the way we do
