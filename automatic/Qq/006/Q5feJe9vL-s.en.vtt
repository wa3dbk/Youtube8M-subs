one you're more comfortable with the

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.000 
one you're more comfortable with the
next<00:02:57.870> thing<00:02:57.990> I<00:02:58.080> want<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.320> talk<00:02:58.500> about<00:02:58.560> is

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
next thing I want to talk about is

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.920 
next thing I want to talk about is
really<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.520> biggest<00:02:59.820> part<00:03:00.180> about<00:03:00.480> getting<00:03:00.690> a

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
really the biggest part about getting a

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.110 
really the biggest part about getting a
lot<00:03:01.140> of<00:03:01.170> kills<00:03:01.620> in<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:02.010> game<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.340> those<00:03:02.880> are<00:03:03.030> the

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
lot of kills in a game and those are the

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.910 
lot of kills in a game and those are the
score<00:03:03.630> streaks<00:03:03.960> generally<00:03:04.500> you'll<00:03:04.710> be

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
score streaks generally you'll be

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.650 
score streaks generally you'll be
getting<00:03:05.190> most<00:03:05.460> of<00:03:05.640> your<00:03:05.790> kills<00:03:06.060> from<00:03:06.210> a<00:03:06.360> score

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
getting most of your kills from a score

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.900 
getting most of your kills from a score
streak<00:03:06.960> every<00:03:07.290> single<00:03:07.530> game<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.250> I<00:03:08.640> can't

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
streak every single game and I can't

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.000 
streak every single game and I can't
stress<00:03:09.180> enough<00:03:09.330> this<00:03:09.780> enough<00:03:10.170> do<00:03:10.530> not<00:03:10.710> use

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
stress enough this enough do not use

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.160 
stress enough this enough do not use
scorestreaks<00:03:11.880> that<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.180> can't<00:03:12.570> get<00:03:12.900> maybe

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
scorestreaks that you can't get maybe

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.080 
scorestreaks that you can't get maybe
you<00:03:13.260> can<00:03:13.500> get<00:03:13.650> them<00:03:13.830> maybe<00:03:14.040> like<00:03:14.489> one<00:03:14.850> out<00:03:14.970> of

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
you can get them maybe like one out of

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.360 
you can get them maybe like one out of
every<00:03:15.209> ten<00:03:15.510> twenty<00:03:15.900> games<00:03:16.140> do<00:03:16.680> not<00:03:16.830> use<00:03:17.100> those

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
every ten twenty games do not use those

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.310 
every ten twenty games do not use those
use<00:03:17.580> scorestreaks<00:03:18.209> you<00:03:18.360> know<00:03:18.720> you<00:03:18.780> can<00:03:19.080> get<00:03:19.200> at

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
use scorestreaks you know you can get at

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.260 
use scorestreaks you know you can get at
least<00:03:19.350> one<00:03:19.770> two<00:03:19.950> three<00:03:20.190> times<00:03:20.370> every<00:03:20.730> single

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
game if you can't get a V set then don't

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.280 
game if you can't get a V set then don't
run<00:03:23.670> V<00:03:23.880> said<00:03:24.120> if<00:03:24.270> you<00:03:24.360> have<00:03:24.420> trouble<00:03:24.870> getting<00:03:25.080> a

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
run V said if you have trouble getting a

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.470 
run V said if you have trouble getting a
sentry<00:03:25.680> gun<00:03:25.860> maybe<00:03:26.400> have<00:03:26.670> century<00:03:27.090> gun<00:03:27.300> your

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
sentry gun maybe have century gun your

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.210

highest<00:03:27.840> killstreak<00:03:28.110> and<00:03:28.560> I<00:03:28.709> know<00:03:28.770> this<00:03:28.980> kind

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
highest killstreak and I know this kind

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.220 
highest killstreak and I know this kind
of<00:03:29.310> sounds<00:03:29.700> stupid<00:03:29.940> but<00:03:30.270> if<00:03:30.750> you<00:03:30.870> have<00:03:31.020> trouble

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
of sounds stupid but if you have trouble

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.160 
of sounds stupid but if you have trouble
getting<00:03:31.500> even<00:03:31.890> a<00:03:31.980> UAV<00:03:32.370> then<00:03:33.150> maybe<00:03:33.360> just<00:03:33.660> only

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
getting even a UAV then maybe just only

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.870 
getting even a UAV then maybe just only
run<00:03:34.410> UAV<00:03:34.890> I<00:03:34.920> know<00:03:35.100> you<00:03:35.250> can't<00:03:35.550> really<00:03:35.670> get

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
run UAV I know you can't really get

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.760 
run UAV I know you can't really get
kills<00:03:36.209> from<00:03:36.360> UAVs<00:03:36.900> but<00:03:37.140> at<00:03:37.230> least<00:03:37.350> you<00:03:37.530> know

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
kills from UAVs but at least you know

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.140 
kills from UAVs but at least you know
where<00:03:37.950> they<00:03:38.100> are<00:03:38.130> as<00:03:38.520> long<00:03:38.670> as<00:03:38.850> you're<00:03:38.940> using

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
where they are as long as you're using

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.900 
where they are as long as you're using
that<00:03:39.300> mini<00:03:39.720> map<00:03:39.989> and<00:03:40.260> yeah<00:03:41.010> just<00:03:41.489> make<00:03:41.880> sure

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
that mini map and yeah just make sure

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.490 
that mini map and yeah just make sure
you're<00:03:42.360> using<00:03:42.390> killstreaks<00:03:43.170> you<00:03:43.290> know<00:03:43.440> you

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
you're using killstreaks you know you

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.920 
you're using killstreaks you know you
can<00:03:43.739> get<00:03:43.920> every<00:03:44.190> single<00:03:44.370> game<00:03:44.820> a<00:03:45.120> couple<00:03:45.570> other

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
can get every single game a couple other

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.870 
can get every single game a couple other
things<00:03:46.020> about<00:03:46.410> scorestreaks<00:03:47.340> is<00:03:47.580> you're

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
things about scorestreaks is you're

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.790 
things about scorestreaks is you're
going<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.209> want<00:03:48.510> to<00:03:48.630> use<00:03:48.690> scorestreaks<00:03:49.560> that

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
going to want to use scorestreaks that

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.949 
going to want to use scorestreaks that
you<00:03:49.920> can<00:03:50.100> stack<00:03:50.489> up<00:03:50.730> pretty<00:03:51.030> easily<00:03:51.300> and<00:03:51.750> what

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
you can stack up pretty easily and what

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.690 
you can stack up pretty easily and what
I<00:03:51.989> mean<00:03:52.170> by<00:03:52.230> stacking<00:03:52.739> up<00:03:53.070> is<00:03:53.280> that<00:03:53.430> you<00:03:53.520> can

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
I mean by stacking up is that you can

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.400 
I mean by stacking up is that you can
get<00:03:53.820> one<00:03:54.090> kill<00:03:54.360> streak<00:03:54.660> from<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:54.959> previous

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
get one kill streak from the previous

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.870 
get one kill streak from the previous
kill<00:03:55.650> streak<00:03:55.890> that<00:03:56.040> you<00:03:56.160> just<00:03:56.400> got<00:03:56.610> for

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
kill streak that you just got for

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.180 
kill streak that you just got for
example<00:03:57.330> I'm<00:03:57.450> using<00:03:57.480> vsat<00:03:58.200> lodestar<00:03:58.709> swarm

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
example I'm using vsat lodestar swarm

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.340 
example I'm using vsat lodestar swarm
and<00:03:59.400> what<00:04:00.000> I<00:04:00.030> mean<00:04:00.270> is<00:04:00.420> you<00:04:00.600> can<00:04:00.750> easily<00:04:01.170> get

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
and what I mean is you can easily get

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.900 
and what I mean is you can easily get
that<00:04:01.530> lodestar<00:04:02.040> once<00:04:02.220> you<00:04:02.340> get<00:04:02.459> the<00:04:02.580> V<00:04:02.700> set

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
that lodestar once you get the V set

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.340 
that lodestar once you get the V set
because<00:04:03.090> you<00:04:03.270> get<00:04:03.360> a<00:04:03.420> ton<00:04:03.750> of<00:04:03.780> assist<00:04:04.200> with

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
because you get a ton of assist with

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.530 
because you get a ton of assist with
that<00:04:04.380> V<00:04:04.680> set<00:04:04.950> so<00:04:05.910> that's<00:04:06.090> what<00:04:06.209> i<00:04:06.239> mean<00:04:06.450> by

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
that V set so that's what i mean by

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.180 
that V set so that's what i mean by
stacking<00:04:06.930> up<00:04:07.260> you're<00:04:07.500> also<00:04:07.650> going<00:04:07.890> to<00:04:07.950> want<00:04:08.010> to

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
stacking up you're also going to want to

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.680 
stacking up you're also going to want to
have<00:04:08.340> kill<00:04:08.610> streaks<00:04:08.910> that<00:04:09.090> can<00:04:09.209> cycle<00:04:09.660> through

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
have kill streaks that can cycle through

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.270 
have kill streaks that can cycle through
each<00:04:09.989> other<00:04:10.200> easily<00:04:10.500> and<00:04:10.890> what<00:04:11.010> I<00:04:11.040> mean<00:04:11.220> by

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
each other easily and what I mean by

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.580 
each other easily and what I mean by
cycle<00:04:11.820> through<00:04:12.120> is<00:04:12.300> that<00:04:12.930> once<00:04:13.110> you<00:04:13.230> get<00:04:13.380> one

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
cycle through is that once you get one

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.110 
cycle through is that once you get one
set<00:04:13.800> of<00:04:13.890> killstreaks<00:04:14.310> you<00:04:14.430> can<00:04:14.580> easily<00:04:15.000> get

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
set of killstreaks you can easily get

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.729 
set of killstreaks you can easily get
the<00:04:15.239> next<00:04:15.510> set<00:04:15.630> of<00:04:15.690> killstreaks<00:04:16.140> for<00:04:16.350> example

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
the next set of killstreaks for example

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.289 
the next set of killstreaks for example
when<00:04:16.859> i<00:04:16.890> get<00:04:17.070> that<00:04:17.220> swarm<00:04:17.700> my<00:04:17.850> swarm

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
when i get that swarm my swarm

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.750 
when i get that swarm my swarm
contributes<00:04:19.289> a<00:04:19.470> ton<00:04:19.830> into<00:04:20.070> me<00:04:20.340> getting<00:04:20.609> that

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
contributes a ton into me getting that

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.250 
contributes a ton into me getting that
next

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
next
