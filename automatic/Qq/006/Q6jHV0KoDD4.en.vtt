Chima
the<00:03:34.850> wolf's<00:03:35.320> and<00:03:36.320> I<00:03:36.380> think<00:03:36.620> that's<00:03:36.769> probably

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
the wolf's and I think that's probably

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.350 
the wolf's and I think that's probably
why<00:03:37.340> they<00:03:38.120> matched<00:03:38.420> it<00:03:38.750> up<00:03:38.930> with<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.769> cragger

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
why they matched it up with the cragger

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.539 
why they matched it up with the cragger
ultra<00:03:41.360> build<00:03:41.570> so<00:03:42.079> you<00:03:42.140> can<00:03:42.410> Jack<00:03:43.070> these<00:03:43.280> guys

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
ultra build so you can Jack these guys

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.069 
ultra build so you can Jack these guys
up<00:03:43.790> it<00:03:43.970> kind<00:03:44.120> of<00:03:44.180> looks<00:03:44.390> like<00:03:44.450> they<00:03:44.780> got<00:03:44.959> the

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
up it kind of looks like they got the

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:46.539 
up it kind of looks like they got the
good<00:03:45.230> guys<00:03:45.410> but<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:45.829> good<00:03:45.980> guys<00:03:46.130> and<00:03:46.430> the<00:03:46.519> bad

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
makes sense so again these ultra builds

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.940 
makes sense so again these ultra builds
are<00:03:52.220> like<00:03:52.459> composable<00:03:53.150> models<00:03:53.630> they<00:03:54.530> do<00:03:54.590> look

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
are like composable models they do look

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.199 
are like composable models they do look
pretty<00:03:55.100> cool<00:03:55.430> on<00:03:57.190> display<00:03:58.190> like<00:03:58.700> on<00:03:58.850> a<00:03:58.880> shelf

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
pretty cool on display like on a shelf
