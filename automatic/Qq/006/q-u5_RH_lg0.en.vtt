00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.160 
the actual web design of the case it's
pretty<00:01:44.399> good<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.820> be<00:01:44.939> honest<00:01:45.119> with<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.420> okay

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
pretty good to be honest with you okay

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.020 
pretty good to be honest with you okay
so<00:01:46.229> let's<00:01:46.500> just<00:01:46.680> move<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.979> box<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.490> one<00:01:47.640> side

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
so let's just move the box to one side

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.420 
so let's just move the box to one side
and<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.689> do<00:01:48.750> have<00:01:49.049> my<00:01:49.229> iPad<00:01:49.680> Mini<00:01:49.950> here<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.369> we

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
and I do have my iPad Mini here that we

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.010 
and I do have my iPad Mini here that we
can<00:01:50.460> give<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.850> case<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.060> test<00:01:51.479> with<00:01:51.689> as<00:01:51.840> well

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
can give the case a test with as well

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.440 
can give the case a test with as well
okay<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.040> as<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.549> can<00:01:53.670> see<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:53.970> does<00:01:54.149> have<00:01:54.329> the

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
okay so as you can see it does have the

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.249 
okay so as you can see it does have the
grey<00:01:54.750> wool<00:01:55.020> felt<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:56.219> vegetable<00:01:56.820> dyed

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
grey wool felt and the vegetable dyed

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.719 
grey wool felt and the vegetable dyed
leather<00:01:58.259> here<00:01:58.619> which<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.070> obviously<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.490> think

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
leather here which is obviously I think

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.690 
leather here which is obviously I think
it's<00:01:59.850> handcrafted<00:02:00.890> and<00:02:01.890> on<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.250> back<00:02:02.369> we<00:02:02.549> do

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
it's handcrafted and on the back we do

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.520 
it's handcrafted and on the back we do
have<00:02:02.880> two<00:02:03.119> poppers<00:02:03.600> obviously<00:02:04.140> these<00:02:04.259> don't

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
have two poppers obviously these don't

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.289 
have two poppers obviously these don't
come<00:02:04.710> off<00:02:04.860> these<00:02:05.040> just<00:02:05.310> hold<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.790> strap<00:02:06.090> to

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
come off these just hold the strap to

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.570 
come off these just hold the strap to
the<00:02:06.509> actual<00:02:06.659> front<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.350> case<00:02:07.530> we<00:02:08.340> do<00:02:08.489> have

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
the actual front of the case we do have

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.430 
the actual front of the case we do have
some<00:02:08.759> hand<00:02:09.060> stitching<00:02:09.599> along<00:02:09.690> here<00:02:10.020> too<00:02:10.200> and

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
some hand stitching along here too and

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.800 
some hand stitching along here too and
also<00:02:10.709> on<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.129> wool<00:02:11.280> felt

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
also on the wool felt

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.110 
also on the wool felt
and<00:02:12.319> it's<00:02:12.470> also<00:02:12.709> hand<00:02:13.130> stitched<00:02:13.550> around<00:02:13.790> the

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
and it's also hand stitched around the

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.479 
and it's also hand stitched around the
sides<00:02:14.360> as<00:02:14.630> well<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:15.500> case<00:02:15.709> is<00:02:15.920> very<00:02:16.099> very

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
sides as well the case is very very

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.040 
sides as well the case is very very
light<00:02:16.730> okay<00:02:17.239> so<00:02:17.300> it<00:02:17.480> won't<00:02:17.630> add<00:02:17.750> a<00:02:17.780> lot<00:02:17.989> of

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
light okay so it won't add a lot of

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.080 
light okay so it won't add a lot of
weight<00:02:18.349> to<00:02:18.380> your<00:02:18.590> iPad<00:02:19.010> Mini<00:02:19.220> but<00:02:19.819> what<00:02:20.000> you

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
weight to your iPad Mini but what you

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.699 
weight to your iPad Mini but what you
must<00:02:20.270> realize<00:02:20.510> with<00:02:20.660> this<00:02:20.930> case<00:02:21.140> is<00:02:21.380> this<00:02:21.500> is

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
must realize with this case is this is

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.350 
must realize with this case is this is
more<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.040> protect<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.550> ipad<00:02:22.880> mini<00:02:22.910> rather

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
more to protect the ipad mini rather

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.610 
more to protect the ipad mini rather
than<00:02:23.599> use<00:02:23.840> it<00:02:23.989> with<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.200> case<00:02:24.349> because

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
than use it with the case because

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.430 
than use it with the case because
obviously<00:02:24.770> it's<00:02:25.670> just<00:02:26.060> a<00:02:26.270> flap<00:02:26.720> over<00:02:26.959> the<00:02:27.230> case

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
obviously it's just a flap over the case

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.110 
obviously it's just a flap over the case
you<00:02:27.709> won't<00:02:27.830> be<00:02:27.980> able<00:02:28.069> to<00:02:28.220> access<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:28.760> ipad

you won't be able to access the ipad

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.839 
you won't be able to access the ipad
mini<00:02:29.150> while<00:02:30.080> it's<00:02:30.290> in<00:02:30.440> its<00:02:30.620> case<00:02:30.860> so<00:02:31.670> if<00:02:31.819> we

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.330 
just got caught on the sides there you
go<00:03:16.940> basically<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:17.989> sides<00:03:18.290> of<00:03:18.560> these<00:03:18.680> pins<00:03:19.040> are

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
go basically the sides of these pins are

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.400 
go basically the sides of these pins are
pushed<00:03:19.670> in<00:03:19.970> and<00:03:20.329> what<00:03:20.720> this<00:03:20.840> does<00:03:20.900> is<00:03:21.200> gives

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
pushed in and what this does is gives

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.930 
pushed in and what this does is gives
you<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.650> actual<00:03:21.859> width<00:03:22.280> for<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:22.549> ipad<00:03:22.910> mini

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
you the actual width for the ipad mini

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.060 
you the actual width for the ipad mini
so<00:03:23.359> once<00:03:23.570> the<00:03:23.780> ipad<00:03:24.109> mini<00:03:24.170> is<00:03:24.440> in<00:03:24.590> the<00:03:24.709> case<00:03:24.890> it

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
so once the ipad mini is in the case it

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.670 
so once the ipad mini is in the case it
won't<00:03:25.190> move<00:03:25.430> around<00:03:25.790> at<00:03:26.150> all<00:03:26.180> and<00:03:26.420> then<00:03:27.380> what<00:03:27.650> i

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
won't move around at all and then what i

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.740 
won't move around at all and then what i
want<00:03:27.829> to<00:03:27.920> do<00:03:28.010> is<00:03:28.040> just<00:03:28.250> put<00:03:28.459> the<00:03:28.579> flap<00:03:28.850> down<00:03:28.880> so

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
want to do is just put the flap down so

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.420 
want to do is just put the flap down so
we<00:03:30.049> can<00:03:30.140> have<00:03:30.290> a<00:03:30.319> look<00:03:30.560> at<00:03:30.769> the<00:03:30.920> case<00:03:31.100> with<00:03:31.340> the

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
we can have a look at the case with the

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.759 
we can have a look at the case with the
ipad<00:03:31.790> mini<00:03:31.819> in<00:03:32.239> it<00:03:32.390> so<00:03:33.140> it<00:03:33.260> actually<00:03:33.410> does

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
ipad mini in it so it actually does

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.949 
ipad mini in it so it actually does
still<00:03:34.280> feel<00:03:34.549> really<00:03:35.090> really<00:03:35.299> light<00:03:35.569> and<00:03:35.810> the

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
still feel really really light and the

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.930 
still feel really really light and the
ipad<00:03:36.319> mini<00:03:36.350> is<00:03:36.709> secure<00:03:37.130> in<00:03:37.370> the<00:03:37.519> case<00:03:37.700> so

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
ipad mini is secure in the case so

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.910 
ipad mini is secure in the case so
