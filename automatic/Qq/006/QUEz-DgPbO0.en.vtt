 city ​​where the snow is falling near the 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.860
 There is no city where you fight. 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.020

 The Pokémon will face you 10 and you will see a 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.409
 Little house is where a caring one is 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.590

 doctor any scientist who researches 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.750
 about meteorites 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.180
 Do you have your box in the box?

 What do you do, click on 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.909
 meteorite and automatically your oxy 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.759
 was to change the random shape you did not 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.030

 with you, it shows me more 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.500
 I like more than speed after 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.400
 attack after the defense 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.530

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.190
 find meteorites if you click on it 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.670
 with the dnocs in front too 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.610
 I told him that they were just correcting 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.470
 are not falling snow just to tell you 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.780
 boys or gray of the volcano but it seems 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.440
 not accustomed to saying that kind of 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.950
 thing 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.380
 well now about the initials is from 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.480
 other regions is easy to achieve 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.330
 but you beat the elite 4 for the first time 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.239
 It 's only time for you to go again for the second time. 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.980
 you will already have access to these 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.230
 pokémons that happens when you win 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.330
 and 24 for the second time you go to your 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.709
 home is automatically you leave the 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.940
 teacher burti will be running 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.560
 again from some pokémon is wild 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.780
 He'll be carrying his backpack.

 You will be able to choose one that not earlier 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.000
 starting Pokemon you can not have the 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.890
 three ne 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.019

 first time you and you will be able to 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.769
 choose any Pokémon to join 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:24.150
 any of the initial three of youtube 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:26.400
 has already been chosen in the 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.000
 The second time, you'll be able to pick up your kids. 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.620
 new in its power to have access hostile note 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.560
 and the third time 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.000
 you will have access to the taught ep clamp 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.980
 and company 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.170
 here the edict now the problem is that 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.880
 to face him and 24 the second time 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.340
 You start the game now you go. 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.220
 have difficulty because even you already 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.510
 having captured the places and decreased 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.549
 56 your pokémons do not have strong 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.340
 enough will be difficult because they 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.750
 four is important rubial moment makes the 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.970
 daughter for the second time when you 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.030
 battle with her what'll 31,000 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.430
 seventy eighty and one of them always goes 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.040
 be mega evolved not be more myself 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.500
 why not fight for the first time 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.870
 so take pokémons strong be 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.720
 prepared with quite a revive full story 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.340
 and everything else so you can not take the body 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.560
 for them because I did not know and I 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.690
 I ended up going 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.540
 I had a hard time winning the 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.790
 steven in the end his metal pokémons 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.030
 because the sheik where he plants night takes 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:31.250
 Be careful there and do not go there and finish. 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.750
 losing snows because we're going strong is a 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.700
 great place to power 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:39.530

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:44.120

 I'm here in the club I picked up from there

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.700
 usually by playing in the best club 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.310
