once<00:00:03.659> you<00:00:03.780> have<00:00:03.810> an<00:00:04.080> idea<00:00:04.380> of<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.710> kind<00:00:05.009> of<00:00:05.130> car

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
once you have an idea of the kind of car

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.039 
once you have an idea of the kind of car
you<00:00:05.460> want<00:00:05.700> and<00:00:05.940> roughly<00:00:06.509> how<00:00:06.629> much<00:00:06.839> you're

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
you want and roughly how much you're

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.049 
you want and roughly how much you're
looking<00:00:07.290> to<00:00:07.379> spend<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:08.309> next<00:00:08.460> question<00:00:08.910> might

looking to spend the next question might

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.890 
looking to spend the next question might
be<00:00:09.240> new<00:00:09.840> or<00:00:10.110> used<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:11.240> used<00:00:12.240> car<00:00:12.480> will<00:00:12.630> often

be new or used a used car will often

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.110 
be new or used a used car will often
cost<00:00:13.139> less<00:00:13.440> than<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.740> new<00:00:13.889> one<00:00:14.099> but<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.700> new<00:00:14.880> car

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
cost less than a new one but a new car

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.120 
cost less than a new one but a new car
may<00:00:15.360> be<00:00:15.420> more<00:00:15.690> reliable<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.470> have<00:00:16.890> fewer

let's<00:00:22.020> take<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.710> look<00:00:22.949> at<00:00:23.070> two<00:00:23.279> cars<00:00:23.609> one<00:00:24.210> new

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
let's take a look at two cars one new

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.019 
let's take a look at two cars one new
and<00:00:24.779> one<00:00:25.170> used<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.740> then<00:00:26.369> compare<00:00:26.849> and

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
and one used and then compare and

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.150 
and one used and then compare and
contrast<00:00:27.119> all<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.930> variable<00:00:28.470> expenses<00:00:28.980> you

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
contrast all the variable expenses you

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.830 
contrast all the variable expenses you
might<00:00:29.310> encounter<00:00:29.609> with<00:00:29.939> each<00:00:30.060> car<00:00:30.330> over<00:00:30.720> the

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
might encounter with each car over the

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.770 
might encounter with each car over the
next<00:00:31.170> five<00:00:31.439> years<00:00:31.800> like<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.090> cost<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.570> car

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
next five years like the cost of the car

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.650 
next five years like the cost of the car
the<00:00:34.500> cost<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.890> finance<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:36.059> cost<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.420> gas

insurance and finally maintenance and

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.350 
insurance and finally maintenance and
repairs<00:00:39.950> but<00:00:40.950> first<00:00:41.219> let's<00:00:41.820> start<00:00:42.120> with<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
repairs but first let's start with the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.229 
repairs but first let's start with the
cost<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.870> actual<00:00:43.350> car<00:00:43.820> so<00:00:44.820> over<00:00:45.210> here

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
cost of the actual car so over here

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.750 
cost of the actual car so over here
let's<00:00:45.989> say<00:00:46.230> we<00:00:46.379> have<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> brand<00:00:46.920> new<00:00:47.129> car<00:00:47.430> with<00:00:47.730> a

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
let's say we have a brand new car with a

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.580 
let's say we have a brand new car with a
sticker<00:00:48.059> price<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.660> nineteen<00:00:49.140> thousand

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
sticker price of nineteen thousand

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.340 
sticker price of nineteen thousand
dollars<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.100> over<00:00:50.789> here<00:00:50.820> we<00:00:51.570> have<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> used<00:00:52.079> car

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
dollars and over here we have a used car

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.290 
dollars and over here we have a used car
that<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.860> same<00:00:53.100> make<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.579> model<00:00:53.640> as<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
that is the same make and model as the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.479 
that is the same make and model as the
other<00:00:54.480> one<00:00:54.660> just<00:00:54.840> five<00:00:55.379> years<00:00:55.620> older<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.399> we

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
other one just five years older that we

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.400 
other one just five years older that we
found<00:00:56.699> for<00:00:56.969> sale<00:00:57.149> by<00:00:57.390> its<00:00:57.420> owner<00:00:57.840> for<00:00:58.199> ten

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
found for sale by its owner for ten

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.380 
found for sale by its owner for ten
thousand<00:00:58.800> dollars<00:00:59.100> now<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.149> may<00:01:00.359> be

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
thousand dollars now you may be

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.750 
thousand dollars now you may be
wondering<00:01:00.539> why<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.829> used<00:01:02.070> car<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.579> much

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
wondering why is the used car so much

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.969 
wondering why is the used car so much
cheaper<00:01:03.210> than<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.449> new<00:01:03.660> car<00:01:03.899> there<00:01:04.860> are<00:01:04.949> a

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
cheaper than the new car there are a

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.550 
cheaper than the new car there are a
couple<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.400> factors<00:01:05.869> one<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.409> new

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
couple of factors one is that the new

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.350 
couple of factors one is that the new
car<00:01:07.799> comes<00:01:08.100> with<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.340> warranty<00:01:08.610> which<00:01:09.180> will

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
car comes with a warranty which will

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.630 
car comes with a warranty which will
cover<00:01:09.540> some<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.840> your<00:01:10.049> repair<00:01:10.350> expenses<00:01:10.650> but

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
cover some of your repair expenses but

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.950 
cover some of your repair expenses but
the<00:01:11.790> biggest<00:01:12.000> factor<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.750> price

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
the biggest factor in this price

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.460 
the biggest factor in this price
difference<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.860> depreciation<00:01:14.720> as<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.930> car<00:01:16.290> gets

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
difference is depreciation as a car gets

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.830 
difference is depreciation as a car gets
older<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.070> loses<00:01:17.490> value<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.509> it

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
older it loses value that is it

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.710 
older it loses value that is it
depreciate<00:01:19.619> seeeeee<00:01:19.820> so<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:20.970> new<00:01:21.150> car<00:01:21.450> that

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
depreciate seeeeee so this new car that

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.170 
depreciate seeeeee so this new car that
costs<00:01:22.049> nineteen<00:01:22.439> thousand<00:01:22.860> dollars<00:01:23.189> after

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
costs nineteen thousand dollars after

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.719 
costs nineteen thousand dollars after
five<00:01:24.420> years<00:01:24.720> might<00:01:25.500> only<00:01:25.710> be<00:01:25.830> worth<00:01:26.130> about<00:01:26.369> ten

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
five years might only be worth about ten

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.640 
five years might only be worth about ten
thousand<00:01:27.180> dollars<00:01:27.479> even<00:01:27.869> if<00:01:28.200> you've<00:01:28.290> kept<00:01:28.530> it

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
thousand dollars even if you've kept it

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.490 
thousand dollars even if you've kept it
in<00:01:28.770> good<00:01:28.950> condition<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:30.840> same<00:01:30.869> car<00:01:31.290> might

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
in good condition and the same car might

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.140 
in good condition and the same car might
only<00:01:31.680> be<00:01:31.770> worth<00:01:32.040> about<00:01:32.220> five<00:01:32.610> thousand

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
only be worth about five thousand

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.109 
only be worth about five thousand
dollars<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.600> another<00:01:33.840> five<00:01:34.110> years<00:01:34.140> as<00:01:34.970> you<00:01:35.970> can

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
dollars in another five years as you can

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.030 
dollars in another five years as you can
see<00:01:36.390> depreciation<00:01:37.229> doesn't<00:01:37.560> happen<00:01:37.710> at<00:01:37.979> a

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
see depreciation doesn't happen at a

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.219 
see depreciation doesn't happen at a
constant<00:01:38.369> rate<00:01:38.549> sure<00:01:39.450> it's<00:01:39.659> almost<00:01:39.930> always

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
constant rate sure it's almost always

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.410 
constant rate sure it's almost always
going<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.680> go<00:01:40.770> down<00:01:41.009> but<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.729> new<00:01:41.909> car<00:01:42.150> loses

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
going to go down but a new car loses

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.139 
going to go down but a new car loses
value<00:01:42.899> fastest<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.799> moment<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.280> buy<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.520> but

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
value fastest the moment you buy it but

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.969 
value fastest the moment you buy it but
then<00:01:45.329> slows<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> more<00:01:46.079> constant<00:01:46.470> rate<00:01:46.770> after

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
then slows to a more constant rate after

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.399 
then slows to a more constant rate after
the<00:01:47.220> first<00:01:47.399> few<00:01:47.640> years<00:01:48.000> if<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:49.049> plan<00:01:49.259> on

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
the first few years if you plan on

at maintenance and repairs this is the

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.530 
at maintenance and repairs this is the

it'll<00:05:11.280> also<00:05:11.400> come<00:05:11.910> with<00:05:11.940> some<00:05:12.360> sort<00:05:12.570> of

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
warranty but for this example let's just

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.150 
warranty but for this example let's just
stick<00:05:15.930> with<00:05:15.990> the<00:05:16.260> car<00:05:16.440> you<00:05:16.590> bought<00:05:16.770> from<00:05:16.980> its
