00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
car this is the next evolution of that

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.070 
car this is the next evolution of that
car<00:00:19.990> completely<00:00:20.380> new<00:00:20.770> platform<00:00:21.369> and<00:00:22.269> it<00:00:22.449> is<00:00:22.660> an

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080 
car completely new platform and it is an

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.769 
car completely new platform and it is an
amazing<00:00:23.679> car<00:00:24.550> like<00:00:24.849> for<00:00:25.089> me<00:00:25.210> I<00:00:25.240> just<00:00:25.599> thought

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
amazing car like for me I just thought

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.480 
amazing car like for me I just thought
it<00:00:26.019> was<00:00:26.109> such<00:00:26.439> a<00:00:26.470> pleasure<00:00:26.589> to<00:00:26.920> drive<00:00:27.130> and<00:00:27.460> I

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
it was such a pleasure to drive and I

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.880 
it was such a pleasure to drive and I
just<00:00:27.789> recently<00:00:28.089> got<00:00:28.359> it<00:00:28.689> this<00:00:29.410> is<00:00:29.589> actually<00:00:29.830> a

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
just recently got it this is actually a

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.409 
just recently got it this is actually a
pre-production<00:00:30.279> prototype<00:00:30.939> I<00:00:31.119> think<00:00:31.330> the

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:31.419 
pre-production prototype I think the

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.120 
pre-production prototype I think the
cars<00:00:31.660> are<00:00:31.900> actually<00:00:32.380> being<00:00:32.619> delivered<00:00:32.860> into

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.130 
cars are actually being delivered into

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.310 
cars are actually being delivered into
the<00:00:33.160> dealers<00:00:33.550> now<00:00:33.790> but<00:00:34.420> this<00:00:34.780> one<00:00:34.990> that<00:00:35.200> the

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
the dealers now but this one that the

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.600 
the dealers now but this one that the
media<00:00:35.560> has<00:00:35.590> been<00:00:35.740> using<00:00:36.100> is<00:00:36.220> a<00:00:36.250> bit<00:00:36.460> of<00:00:36.550> a

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
media has been using is a bit of a

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.910 
media has been using is a bit of a
prototype<00:00:37.120> it's<00:00:38.020> a<00:00:38.140> little<00:00:38.470> bit<00:00:38.590> longer<00:00:38.770> on

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
prototype it's a little bit longer on

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.410 
prototype it's a little bit longer on
the<00:00:39.010> wheel<00:00:39.160> base<00:00:39.400> which<00:00:39.790> gives<00:00:40.000> a<00:00:40.120> little<00:00:40.300> bit

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
the wheel base which gives a little bit

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.730 
the wheel base which gives a little bit
smoother<00:00:40.810> ride<00:00:41.020> compared<00:00:41.440> to<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:41.620> last

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:41.740 
smoother ride compared to the last

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.730 
smoother ride compared to the last
generation<00:00:42.190> the<00:00:43.110> suspensions<00:00:44.110> dialed<00:00:44.440> in<00:00:44.560> to

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:44.740 
generation the suspensions dialed in to

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.990 
generation the suspensions dialed in to
be<00:00:44.860> a<00:00:44.890> little<00:00:45.250> bit<00:00:45.400> smoother<00:00:45.760> to<00:00:45.880> take

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
be a little bit smoother to take

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.350 
be a little bit smoother to take
advantage<00:00:46.240> of<00:00:46.600> a<00:00:46.780> much<00:00:47.110> stiffer<00:00:47.860> structure<00:00:48.700> so

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
advantage of a much stiffer structure so

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.330 
advantage of a much stiffer structure so
they<00:00:49.450> can<00:00:49.570> be<00:00:49.660> much<00:00:49.840> more<00:00:50.020> precise<00:00:50.440> on<00:00:50.680> it<00:00:50.830> but

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
they can be much more precise on it but

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.980 
they can be much more precise on it but
as<00:00:51.520> this<00:00:51.880> car<00:00:52.120> sits<00:00:52.420> this<00:00:52.600> thing<00:00:52.810> is<00:00:52.900> amazing

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:52.990 
as this car sits this thing is amazing

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.760 
as this car sits this thing is amazing
it's<00:00:53.470> got<00:00:53.590> a<00:00:53.700> 306<00:00:54.700> force<00:00:54.970> power<00:00:55.320> v6<00:00:56.320> it's

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 
it's got a 306 force power v6 it's

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.980 
it's got a 306 force power v6 it's
basically<00:00:57.130> a<00:00:57.250> carryover<00:00:57.760> from<00:00:58.060> the<00:00:58.630> previous

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:58.990 
basically a carryover from the previous

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.750 
basically a carryover from the previous
generation<00:00:59.560> but<00:00:59.740> it<00:00:59.830> moves<00:01:00.010> this<00:01:00.160> car<00:01:00.370> at<00:01:00.520> zero

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
generation but it moves this car at zero

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.630 
generation but it moves this car at zero
to<00:01:00.850> 60<00:01:01.180> in<00:01:01.210> 5.5<00:01:02.080> seconds<00:01:02.590> well<00:01:03.040> this<00:01:03.220> isn't<00:01:03.400> the

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
to 60 in 5.5 seconds well this isn't the

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.580 
to 60 in 5.5 seconds well this isn't the
crazy<00:01:03.910> super<00:01:04.390> fast<00:01:04.629> like<00:01:04.839> I<00:01:05.199> had<00:01:05.350> enough

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
crazy super fast like I had enough

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.070 
crazy super fast like I had enough
version<00:01:06.009> this<00:01:06.100> is<00:01:06.159> the<00:01:06.460> big<00:01:06.640> this<00:01:07.000> is<00:01:07.180> the<00:01:07.360> sort

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
version this is the big this is the sort

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.140 
version this is the big this is the sort
of<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:08.320> base<00:01:08.470> yeah<00:01:08.950> the<00:01:09.310> lines<00:01:09.580> of<00:01:09.790> the<00:01:09.940> car<00:01:10.120> I

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
of the base yeah the lines of the car I

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.270 
of the base yeah the lines of the car I
think<00:01:10.300> of<00:01:10.740> it's<00:01:11.740> one<00:01:11.890> of<00:01:11.950> those<00:01:12.040> things<00:01:12.100> like

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
think of it's one of those things like

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.170 
think of it's one of those things like
you're<00:01:12.460> going<00:01:12.550> to<00:01:12.610> love<00:01:12.820> it<00:01:12.850> or<00:01:12.940> you're<00:01:13.090> going

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
to hate it I kind of like it what

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.920 
to hate it I kind of like it what

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
they're doing on the tail section got a

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.680 
they're doing on the tail section got a

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
saw in the GS right and if these daytime

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.990 
saw in the GS right and if these daytime
running<00:01:26.350> lights<00:01:26.680> give<00:01:26.950> you<00:01:27.010> that<00:01:27.159> Lexus<00:01:27.580> logo

running lights give you that Lexus logo
in<00:01:28.210> the<00:01:28.330> light<00:01:28.570> right<00:01:29.080> I<00:01:29.890> mean<00:01:30.130> obviously

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
in the light right I mean obviously

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.980 
in the light right I mean obviously
they're<00:01:30.820> flipped<00:01:31.090> on<00:01:31.210> different<00:01:31.510> sides<00:01:31.690> but

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
they're flipped on different sides but

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.370 
they're flipped on different sides but
it's<00:01:32.140> really<00:01:32.790> kind<00:01:33.790> of<00:01:33.850> a<00:01:34.000> neat<00:01:34.780> part<00:01:35.050> one<00:01:35.350> of

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
it's really kind of a neat part one of

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.410 
it's really kind of a neat part one of
the<00:01:35.470> things<00:01:35.620> I<00:01:35.710> like<00:01:36.010> about<00:01:36.070> this<00:01:36.340> car<00:01:36.550> is<00:01:36.790> I

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
the things I like about this car is I

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.500 
the things I like about this car is I
like<00:01:38.100> talked<00:01:39.100> about<00:01:39.400> this<00:01:39.550> before<00:01:39.729> the<00:01:40.030> tire

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
like talked about this before the tire

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.440 
like talked about this before the tire
that<00:01:41.110> has<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.770> half<00:01:42.010> of<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.670> lips<00:01:42.909> are<00:01:43.150> tough

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
that has the half of the lips are tough

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.770 
that has the half of the lips are tough
the<00:01:43.870> rim<00:01:44.140> protector<00:01:44.979> has<00:01:45.550> every<00:01:46.030> car<00:01:46.360> i<00:01:46.390> have

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
the rim protector has every car i have

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.350 
the rim protector has every car i have
the<00:01:47.110> tires<00:01:47.380> are<00:01:47.740> stretched<00:01:48.130> and<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.850> rims<00:01:49.120> are

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
the tires are stretched and the rims are

only<00:02:41.770> going<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:41.950> be<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.130> four-door<00:02:42.670> except<00:02:43.090> the

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
only going to be a four-door except the

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.910 
only going to be a four-door except the
previous<00:02:44.080> generation<00:02:44.110> they<00:02:44.710> did<00:02:44.890> a

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
previous generation they did a

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.710 
previous generation they did a
convertible<00:02:45.430> hardtop<00:02:45.580> which<00:02:46.090> was<00:02:46.270> a<00:02:46.300> two-door

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
convertible hardtop which was a two-door

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.870 
convertible hardtop which was a two-door
right<00:02:47.290> so<00:02:47.590> they<00:02:47.920> sort<00:02:48.130> of<00:02:48.220> made<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.490> coupe<00:02:48.670> and

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
right so they sort of made the coupe and

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.910 
right so they sort of made the coupe and
convertible<00:02:49.060> sort<00:02:49.660> of<00:02:49.750> all<00:02:49.900> in<00:02:50.080> one<00:02:50.290> or<00:02:50.770> maybe

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
convertible sort of all in one or maybe

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.920 
convertible sort of all in one or maybe
they'll<00:02:51.190> do<00:02:51.370> that<00:02:51.400> again<00:02:51.880> I'd<00:02:52.120> love<00:02:52.540> to<00:02:52.720> see

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
they'll do that again I'd love to see

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.160 
they'll do that again I'd love to see
this<00:02:53.080> as<00:02:53.260> an<00:02:53.350> isf<00:02:53.980> with<00:02:54.610> something<00:02:55.120> like<00:02:55.300> 450

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
this as an isf with something like 450

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.650 
this as an isf with something like 450
horsepower<00:02:56.670> yeah<00:02:57.670> they'll<00:02:58.000> do<00:02:58.240> something

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
horsepower yeah they'll do something

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.230 
horsepower yeah they'll do something
like<00:02:59.020> that<00:02:59.080> I'm<00:02:59.620> sure<00:02:59.830> they<00:03:00.280> will<00:03:00.520> eventually

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
like that I'm sure they will eventually

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.390 
like that I'm sure they will eventually
is<00:03:02.110> it<00:03:02.440> it<00:03:02.620> it's<00:03:03.130> automatic<00:03:03.910> 6-speed<00:03:04.740> um<00:03:05.740> it's

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
is it it it's automatic 6-speed um it's

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.350 
is it it it's automatic 6-speed um it's
I<00:03:06.610> think<00:03:06.970> this<00:03:07.120> one<00:03:07.270> a<00:03:07.300> 7-speed<00:03:07.930> look<00:03:08.860> out<00:03:09.360> this

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
I think this one a 7-speed look out this

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.620 
I think this one a 7-speed look out this
one<00:03:10.540> goes<00:03:10.750> to<00:03:10.810> 11<00:03:11.500> it<00:03:11.710> goes<00:03:11.920> to<00:03:12.220> 11<00:03:12.250> ah<00:03:12.670> and<00:03:13.210> they

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
one goes to 11 it goes to 11 ah and they

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.300 
one goes to 11 it goes to 11 ah and they
think<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:14.110> base<00:03:14.290> price<00:03:14.620> is<00:03:14.920> going<00:03:15.070> to<00:03:15.130> be

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
think the base price is going to be

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.160 
think the base price is going to be
right<00:03:15.640> about<00:03:15.790> a<00:03:15.940> three<00:03:16.240> series<00:03:16.480> yeah<00:03:16.990> it's

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
right about a three series yeah it's

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.500 
right about a three series yeah it's
about<00:03:17.260> 40<00:03:17.770> grand<00:03:18.040> and<00:03:18.400> this<00:03:18.880> one<00:03:19.030> has<00:03:19.150> it<00:03:19.300> sits

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
about 40 grand and this one has it sits

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.410 
about 40 grand and this one has it sits
with<00:03:19.630> a<00:03:19.660> few<00:03:19.900> options<00:03:20.260> is<00:03:20.380> around<00:03:20.790> 45,000<00:03:21.790> but

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
with a few options is around 45,000 but

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.650 
with a few options is around 45,000 but
for<00:03:22.660> 45,000<00:03:23.620> I<00:03:23.770> think<00:03:24.459> it's<00:03:24.580> this<00:03:25.000> is<00:03:25.180> this<00:03:25.510> is

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
for 45,000 I think it's this is this is

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.720 
for 45,000 I think it's this is this is
a<00:03:25.690> great<00:03:25.990> car<00:03:26.230> that<00:03:26.740> longer<00:03:27.100> wheelbase<00:03:27.280> are<00:03:27.640> we
