so it turns out I didn't even need to

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:48.290 
so it turns out I didn't even need to
make<00:05:46.770> that<00:05:46.919> jump<00:05:47.159> because<00:05:47.490> there's<00:05:47.819> there's

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
make that jump because there's there's

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.999 
make that jump because there's there's
nothing<00:05:48.719> over<00:05:48.869> here<00:05:48.990> and<00:05:49.409> I<00:05:49.619> didn't<00:05:49.800> have<00:05:49.889> to
