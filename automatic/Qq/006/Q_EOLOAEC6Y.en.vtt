00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.339
 for the last episode first game there 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.249
 We're going to bet today and harley. 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.780
 worth 10 cas and it is against the paulo that 

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:07.180
 has this stub had that stupid 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.040
 Brazilian nippon neymar and duck in 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.100
 forward soon at the beginning the two did 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.930
 a good move there to do 1 to 0 paulo 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.229
 the game was very difficult paulo is a 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.850
 very hard opponent and at 45 minutes 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.219
 we managed to find a space there 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.009
 for the steroid to do 1 to 1 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:26.079
 then at 97 minutes the excellent paulo 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.509
 player ended up finding space in his 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:31.390
 defense in willian rebound appeared there 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.469
 to make 2 to 1 and practically kill 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.840
 our chances are not 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:37.060
 already was in overtime a game was 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.420
 very difficult and then Lucas appeared 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.250
 also to seal the casket at 120 to 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.049
 we do not have more chances of reaction 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.380
 he got nine kicks on target and 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:50.170
 I was with 7 he got 83% of 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.960
 basketball that with 74 including paulo and 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.429
 he had one to predict there the week more 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.259
 and soccer, right? 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.630
 if we had playing a football 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.920
 true and sure on the court you 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.829
 just talking about something that should not 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.509
 or just also responding but then 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.319
 I left the court everyone is a friend and 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.299
 things like 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:09.610
 that's how our relationship stays. 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.170
 Good luck. I had to make one. 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.120
 downgrading 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.430
 brodie abih and we are going pro next to 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.700
 from then on against the five tonho 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.500
 cases beyond the year have belelli to come back 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.590
 our position and it comes with this 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.989
 including the 50th 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.900
 victories for just six minutes of 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.280
 game the team went up absolutely 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.650
 absolute to make 1 to 0 for us 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.230
 then he was very lucky, since the 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.300
 steroid ended up losing the ball after 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.920
 was combative and we managed to get the 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.650
 ball back we got a space there 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.690
 for his left he dropped a 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.760
 kick the plate and look at the 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.860
 excellent positioning of producers 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.630
 matador got the law to wait 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.510
 before the middle of the field to receive the 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.730
 ball and do 2 to 1 I have to stop 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.410
 out with a goalkeeper so expected 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.750
 I try to give a touch but sometimes 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.880
 When I go to see, it's already in the front. 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.880
 that's when my chance to defend is over 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.830
 good he managed to equalize in the 65 minutes 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.200
 went ahead we got a space of 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.230
 that the studio to do 3 to 2 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.880
 and then the tone came and made a change a 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.100
 return will they succeed 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.290
 finish this right dude position're 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.200
 difficult because when people 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.760
 Can you get some space there to try? 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.650
 stay with a goal in front to see 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.120
 draw and watch this goal from the game 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.519
 we put in front he came running 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.220
 trying to take the ball but there was no way 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.870
 we finally got the victory 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.060
 as I was complaining just now 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.190
 We finally got four kicks to 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.230
 eight kicks in size we stayed there 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.100
 with 70% correct passes and was left with 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.600
 68 and thus being viable leaves the team 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.850
 around the magnet 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.380
 Let's go to the next bet worth 10 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.000
 houses for error 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.660
 I hope people finally get 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.700
 then getting put is getting the 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.680
 victory to put the jean in the team and 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.079
 then we just concentrate on the 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.900
 fernandinho then ball pro game looks the 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:04.690
 jp team that has lewandowski that 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:08.230
 omen tower jesus navas 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:11.799
 schweinsteiger company henan airlines 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:14.470
 thai several excellent guys there but at 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:18.160
 50 minutes there the overflow and left in the front 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:21.039
 let's go 1 to 0 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.980
 53 minutes soon a little later nani 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:24.750

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.440
 but left to diane to 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.450
 we had 2 to 0 59 minutes had opened the 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.120
 we had a lot of chance the ball and 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.790
 I promised you we would do 3 to 0 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.700
 and simon denigrating the young team plays 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.280
 too because he appeared and made 4 to 0 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.200
 75 minutes before the end of the game. 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.450
 to make one more with the iran 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.420
 placed the ball with his hand there on his head 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:52.440
 from the studio to do 5 to 0 and I did 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:54.480
 we finally finalized this game hallelujah 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.030
 we put it will come so we got eight 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:01.620

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:04.020
 correct passes 68% basketball for him 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.990
 finally wrong 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.000
 Welcome to the team there and now. 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.790
 let's focus just the 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.850
 fernandinho to improve it and twice 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.470
 and we finished this series with our 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.480
 next bet is against the gui 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.820
 besides the five houses by the paulinho in 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.880
 fernandinho's position and the given with that 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:27.780
 of the series a with balotelli tevez di 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:30.600
 natale bye and vidal eliene benatti 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:33.720
 finally the whole troop and the series a 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.180
 after 12 minutes Gerrard put this 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.460
 ball in the corner the angle where the owl 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.140
 sleeps to make 1 to 0 after he 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.000
 ended up crossing the area should have 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.010
 placed to err and have to land and 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.070
 ending early because the guy is 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:49.710
 king of the ball stopped and soon after 44 minutes 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:52.200
 before the game ends and goals 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.230
 received and touched the goalkeeper's exit to 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.150
 people do 3 to 0 then they are 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.370
 that left side and let go of the foot 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.080
 There the check just jumped to get out of the photo. 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.810
 because I could not even handle this 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.180
 bomb of the guy and the fernandinho solved 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.190
 hit a corner you provide is 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.740
 heads up and the bid 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:13.380
 when the phase is good and gives it right 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.060
 I wonder how happy the right to stay 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.710
 after that bid 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.260
 one more time I went out in what no 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.360
 asshole and created with goalkeeper and finished 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.610
 taking a goulart coverage goal 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.430
 by the way we got there with six kicks to the 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.080
 album was 8 82% and is part of 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.509
 for people 66 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:33.300
 brig and thus we finish this 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:37.680
 episode with a victory that is missing 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:40.979
 so an upgrade there in little pause to 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:43.860
 people can finish this series and 

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:46.409
