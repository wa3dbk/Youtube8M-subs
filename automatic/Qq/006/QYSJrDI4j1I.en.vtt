 Alexandria Doors

 the invention of the English townhouses in Russia 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.710
 appeared only 20 years ago one of 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.690
 the many benefits of such housing 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.900
 opportunity not just redevelopment it

 really done in a regular apartment 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.050
 first of all this increase in total 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:32.710
 area due to non-residential example of this 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.329
 a townhouse in one of the districts of Moscow 200 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:40.240
 project meters 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:42.670
 turned 350 in the end got three 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.340
 floor plus a small attic 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.400
 she is still in the process of finishing drinking sokal on 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:52.270
 the floor where the pool and sauna are located 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:55.220
 favorite place to host this house 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.410
 if we talk about interior design 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.290
 he sustained the most sought after 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.870
 Today's classic style tailored 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.750
 tastes and preferences of home owners 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.180
 judging by the design of furniture numerous 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.690
 souvenir and decoration of the owners of this 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.410
 houses 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:16.670
 addicted to the east and it's yours which 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:18.470
 you put your soul in and i come back 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.229
 after work always happy to come here 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.990
 and it pulls me away from me even 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.600
 of the nicest places where relaxing and 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.759
 enjoying the comfort even from there me 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.610
 really want to return faster than your home 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:35.930
 because 10 I use cozy this is my 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:38.060
 this is a layer favorite and if you are these from my 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.860
 personal predilections it is probably all 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.729
 the same space that is 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.729
 sauna pool 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.120
 we continue to get acquainted with the family house 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:58.870
 sable ground floor place which 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.160
 greets guests of this house 2 3 floor it 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:05.670
 now more 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.670
 such a master is more than the heart of a house 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:15.420
 common colors combined kitchen and 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.970
 dining room into a single main space 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.870
 element of which furniture is made of solid wood with 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.810
 decor elements for me are several 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.310
 new because it's for me 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.850
 heavy furniture here personally how 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.370
 architect but it's hard for me but when 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.500
 I saw the mistress of the house as svetlana 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.880
 how she wants and what she knows that it's me 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.820
 think need to experiment and 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.290
 just bring it into the interior 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:47.120
 Now I am one hundred percent sure that 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.120
 it was a winning situation 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:58.200
 when I first sat down at the table I 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.430
 felt like in the 19th century 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.030
 feeling 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.590
 scale sensations can even 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:12.060
 some kind of significance its 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:15.810
 you understand that you have achieved something 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.319
 saw what pictures the mistress will describe here 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.989
 then we'll see 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:25.920
 for myself it was a surprise that I 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:30.989
 I came recently to them a guest and I saw 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:33.299
 that the customer began to paint in oils and I 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.799
 for myself, just decided that it was not for nothing that I 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:38.329
 I make this house because it's time 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:42.019
 inspired to such creativity 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:45.349
 climb to the third floor here 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.349
 there are two bedrooms 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:55.900
 my favorite room is my daughter's room 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:58.300
 just somehow very soulful made of 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.620
 a very warm attitude to this probably 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.870
 because loving moms 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:07.020
 actively involved creating design 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:09.400
 eclectic principle of this room 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.420
 combine in one space all 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.050
 The most interesting 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:16.360
 modern trend in design but 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.540
 organize the interior in a single unit 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.400
 using different materials and textures 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.060
 quite difficult it concerns before 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.940
 Total 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:28.090
 selection of its main furniture parts and 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.970
 doors doors fit just like family 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.890
 Well , you yourself can see the furniture and doors and 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.690
 it turned out as if we were specially 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.910
 everyone did it ordered 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.910
 somewhere it turned out that there was no 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:48.230
 all the motley matched into one I 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.440
 I can not imagine that something 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:53.000
 maybe even more 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.370
 it's not even in sophistication but in 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.620
 intelligence performance I don't even 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.300
 I expected that this may be so 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.010
 more from the Russian manufacturer and 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.960
 value for money for not 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.760
 turned out to be more acceptable because for 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.160
 I really care about the money 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.740
 the customer pays and there is a choice 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.830
 classic models are modern and 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.720
 we could and pick and then he color and and 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.580
 Here in the future facility I, too 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.580
 I am guided by the Alexandrian doors 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.949
 Alexandria Doors 

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:31.560
