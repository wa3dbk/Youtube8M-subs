00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.820
 when we talk about vertical green yes 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.100
 means a series of techniques and systems 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.500
 which are aimed at 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.460
 place the vegetation on one 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.460
 vertical dimension 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.350
 it is therefore a plant before 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:41.239
 all conceptual a particular way of 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.520
 think and design green space 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.330
 before making it happen 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.330
 concretely 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.840
 certainly once defined the 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.380
 design can be implemented 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.180
 various realization methods 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.870
 designed specifically to meet the needs 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.870
 our needs 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.070
 among them they can be cited 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:25.750
 mainly two investments and 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.970
 vertical closures vegetate the 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.729
 coating is the best known method 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.560
 and ancient of vertical green and provides 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:36.220
 the support of the greenery has a structure 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.020
 the apparatus already exists in this case 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:43.170
 vegetable can be attacked directly 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.170
 on the wall or through a support 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.430
 there is no great interaction between 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.170
 plants and the closure structure a 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.610
 unlike what happens with the 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.290
 vegetable closure 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.810
 so much so that the wall could very well 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.290
 exist without the presence of 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.290
 plants
