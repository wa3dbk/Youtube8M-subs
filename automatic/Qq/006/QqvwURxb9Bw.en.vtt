00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.019 
already may have guessed it is grown in
the<00:00:21.900> Blue<00:00:22.050> Mountains<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.470> Jamaica<00:00:22.850> so<00:00:23.850> it's<00:00:24.000> a

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
the Blue Mountains of Jamaica so it's a

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.790 
the Blue Mountains of Jamaica so it's a
very<00:00:24.240> small<00:00:24.539> area<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:25.199> produces<00:00:25.680> this

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
very small area that produces this

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.150 
very small area that produces this
coffee<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.910> conditions<00:00:27.390> there<00:00:27.660> are<00:00:28.160> very

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
coffee the conditions there are very

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.209 
coffee the conditions there are very
humid<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.760> they<00:00:30.150> get<00:00:30.269> lots<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.599> rainfall

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:31.219 
humid and they get lots of rainfall

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:33.319 
humid and they get lots of rainfall
because<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.340> temperature<00:00:32.790> disparity

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
because of the temperature disparity

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.389 
because of the temperature disparity
between<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.719> mountains<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.950> low-lying

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
between the mountains and the low-lying

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.619 
between the mountains and the low-lying
areas<00:00:35.899> so<00:00:37.309> they<00:00:38.309> get<00:00:38.430> lots<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.790> rainfall<00:00:39.000> lots

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
areas so they get lots of rainfall lots

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.280 
areas so they get lots of rainfall lots
of<00:00:39.840> very<00:00:40.559> rich<00:00:40.800> soil<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:42.420> has<00:00:42.899> great

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
of very rich soil and it has great

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.729 
of very rich soil and it has great
drainage<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.129> lends<00:00:45.059> itself<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:46.289> good

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
drainage so it lends itself to a good

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.200 
drainage so it lends itself to a good
region<00:00:47.100> for<00:00:47.340> growing<00:00:47.670> coffee<00:00:48.020> and<00:00:49.020> also

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
region for growing coffee and also

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.279 
region for growing coffee and also
Jamaican<00:00:51.210> Blue<00:00:51.329> Mountain<00:00:51.360> Coffee<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.110> only

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee is only

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.619 
Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee is only
the<00:00:52.770> coffee<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.250> has<00:00:53.280> grown<00:00:53.520> between<00:00:53.670> 3,000

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
the coffee that has grown between 3,000

and 5,500 feet

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.639 
and 5,500 feet
anything<00:00:57.000> below<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.390> can't<00:00:58.079> be<00:00:58.230> considered

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
anything below that can't be considered

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:59.840 
anything below that can't be considered
Jamaican<00:00:59.070> Blue<00:00:59.190> Mountain<00:00:59.219> coffee<00:00:59.609> and

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
anything above that isn't coffee because

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.640 
anything above that isn't coffee because
it's<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.430> horse<00:01:02.699> preserve<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.359> no<00:01:04.229> coffee<00:01:04.470> is

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
it's a horse preserve and no coffee is

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.770 
it's a horse preserve and no coffee is
grown<00:01:04.799> there<00:01:05.060> so<00:01:06.060> that's<00:01:06.510> kind<00:01:06.750> of

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
grown there so that's kind of

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.200 
grown there so that's kind of
interesting<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:08.490> Jamaica<00:01:08.850> they<00:01:09.060> only

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
interesting and in Jamaica they only

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.260 
interesting and in Jamaica they only
produce<00:01:09.860> five<00:01:10.860> one<00:01:11.310> hundredths<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.240> percent

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
produce five one hundredths of a percent

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.609 
produce five one hundredths of a percent
of<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.080> world's<00:01:13.680> supply<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.760> coffee<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.619> 80

of the world's supply of coffee and 80

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.710 
of the world's supply of coffee and 80
percent<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.400> shipped<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.700> Japan<00:01:17.820> so

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
percent of that is shipped to Japan so

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.740 
percent of that is shipped to Japan so
that<00:01:18.869> only<00:01:19.020> leaves<00:01:19.670> two<00:01:20.670> one<00:01:21.119> hundredths<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.630> a

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
that only leaves two one hundredths of a

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.719 
that only leaves two one hundredths of a
percent<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.860> total<00:01:23.100> amount<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.670> the
