they're actually shower rings but I got

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.319 
they're actually shower rings but I got
a<00:00:48.660> certain<00:00:49.020> specific<00:00:49.530> size<00:00:50.039> just<00:00:50.430> because<00:00:50.879> I

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
a certain specific size just because I

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.279 
a certain specific size just because I
wanted<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:51.960> way

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
wanted it that way

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.860 
wanted it that way
pending<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:53.129> how<00:00:53.160> sturdy<00:00:53.760> your<00:00:54.059> hanger<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.600> and

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
pending on how sturdy your hanger is and

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.360 
pending on how sturdy your hanger is and
how<00:00:54.960> heavy<00:00:55.230> your<00:00:55.440> scarves<00:00:55.739> are<00:00:56.070> will

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
how heavy your scarves are will

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.010 
how heavy your scarves are will
determine<00:00:56.730> how<00:00:57.090> many<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.390> can<00:00:57.420> hang<00:00:57.719> on<00:00:57.870> each

determine how many you can hang on each
one<00:00:58.260> but<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:58.920> think<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.430> really<00:00:59.699> neat

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
one but I think this is a really neat

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.650 
one but I think this is a really neat
way<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.180> organize<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.289> just<00:01:01.559> because<00:01:02.480> you<00:01:03.480> can

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
way to organize it just because you can

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.890 
way to organize it just because you can
like<00:01:03.960> they<00:01:04.140> I've<00:01:04.320> seen<00:01:05.119> scarf<00:01:06.119> hangers<00:01:06.510> and
