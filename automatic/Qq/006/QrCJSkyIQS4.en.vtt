rather<00:00:45.719> we've<00:00:46.620> got<00:00:46.829> some<00:00:47.070> inclimate<00:00:47.399> weather

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
rather we've got some inclimate weather

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.020 
rather we've got some inclimate weather
so<00:00:48.270> we<00:00:48.570> need<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.960> be<00:00:48.989> able<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.760> protect<00:00:50.760> from

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
so we need to be able to protect from

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.770 
so we need to be able to protect from
that<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.629> we've<00:00:51.809> got<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.050> pool<00:00:52.649> room<00:00:52.949> control

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
that so we've got a pool room control

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.549 
that so we've got a pool room control
and<00:00:54.780> we<00:00:54.930> press<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.469> guy<00:00:56.270> and<00:00:57.270> lots<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.320> stuff

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
and we press that guy and lots of stuff

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.709 
and we press that guy and lots of stuff
starts<00:00:58.980> happening<00:01:00.920> and<00:01:02.329> before<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.359> know<00:01:03.570> it

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
starts happening and before you know it

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.060 
starts happening and before you know it
we<00:01:04.170> have<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.860> nicely<00:01:05.309> enclosed<00:01:06.119> pool<00:01:06.600> room

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
we have a nicely enclosed pool room

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.820 
we have a nicely enclosed pool room
protected<00:01:08.070> from<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.310> elements<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:09.710> for<00:01:10.710> your

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
late night partying pleasure and then

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.940 
late night partying pleasure and then
once<00:01:15.390> we've<00:01:15.570> got<00:01:15.780> some<00:01:16.080> nice<00:01:16.259> sunshiny

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
once we've got some nice sunshiny

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.990 
once we've got some nice sunshiny
weather<00:01:17.220> again<00:01:17.520> one<00:01:18.150> more<00:01:18.330> button<00:01:18.570> press<00:01:18.920> and

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
weather again one more button press and

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.719 
weather again one more button press and

everything retracts covers come into

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.310 
everything retracts covers come into
place<00:01:23.990> for<00:01:24.990> safety<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:26.960> hopefully<00:01:27.960> these<00:01:28.110> can

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
place for safety and hopefully these can

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.160 
place for safety and hopefully these can
be<00:01:28.439> made<00:01:28.590> out<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.740> sandstone<00:01:29.340> at<00:01:29.549> some<00:01:29.820> point

be made out of sandstone at some point
intent<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:32.150> that's<00:01:33.150> about<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:34.520> really<00:01:35.520> proud

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
intent and that's about it really proud

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.600 
intent and that's about it really proud
of<00:01:35.880> how<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.210> worked<00:01:36.479> out<00:01:37.220> some<00:01:38.220> late<00:01:38.369> nights

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
of how this worked out some late nights

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.539 
of how this worked out some late nights
wiring<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.650> if<00:01:40.650> you're<00:01:40.860> not<00:01:40.979> interested<00:01:41.220> in

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
wiring and if you're not interested in

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.179 
wiring and if you're not interested in
redstone<00:01:41.880> wiring<00:01:42.150> then<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:43.170> probably<00:01:43.439> exit

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
redstone wiring then you probably exit

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.530 
redstone wiring then you probably exit
here<00:01:44.369> otherwise<00:01:44.729> I'm<00:01:45.060> going<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.270> take<00:01:45.360> you

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
here otherwise I'm going to take you

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.539 
here otherwise I'm going to take you
inside<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.200> show<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.829> quick<00:01:47.040> tour<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
inside and show you a quick tour of the

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.319 
inside and show you a quick tour of the
wiring<00:01:48.259> which<00:01:49.259> actually<00:01:49.770> came<00:01:50.189> out<00:01:50.220> inside<00:01:51.149> my

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
wiring which actually came out inside my

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.870 
wiring which actually came out inside my
basement<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.619> just<00:01:53.189> left<00:01:53.369> that<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
basement and so I just left that is the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.660 
basement and so I just left that is the
access<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.380> here<00:01:56.280> for<00:01:56.490> my<00:01:56.640> earlier

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.620 
access to it and here for my earlier
video<00:01:57.240> is<00:01:57.479> my<00:01:58.310> hidden<00:01:59.310> door<00:01:59.610> room

room for it not too complicated but took

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.990 
room for it not too complicated but took
some<00:02:16.320> figuring<00:02:16.710> out<00:02:16.890> got<00:02:17.460> a<00:02:17.490> lead<00:02:17.760> from<00:02:17.910> the

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
some figuring out got a lead from the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.060 
some figuring out got a lead from the

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.610 
on the other end so that the retraction
works<00:02:38.489> on<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.270> covers<00:02:39.630> in<00:02:39.870> time<00:02:40.320> with<00:02:40.590> the

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
works on the covers in time with the

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.250 
works on the covers in time with the
portcullises<00:02:41.489> and<00:02:41.850> then<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.630> little<00:02:42.720> unknown

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
portcullises and then a little unknown

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.500 
portcullises and then a little unknown
circuit<00:02:43.709> here<00:02:43.890> that<00:02:44.070> I<00:02:44.190> I<00:02:44.550> brainstorm

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
circuit here that I I brainstorm

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.260 
circuit here that I I brainstorm
together<00:02:45.720> that<00:02:46.380> would<00:02:46.790> override<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.970> delay

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
together that would override the delay

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.090 
together that would override the delay
on<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.720> retraction<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:49.800> it<00:02:49.920> wouldn't

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
on the retraction so that it wouldn't

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.900 
on the retraction so that it wouldn't
take<00:02:50.340> us<00:02:50.489> long<00:02:50.930> so<00:02:51.930> any<00:02:52.230> questions<00:02:52.850> feel<00:02:53.850> free

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
take us long so any questions feel free

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.540 
take us long so any questions feel free

to post them in the bucket thread I

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.720 
to post them in the bucket thread I
