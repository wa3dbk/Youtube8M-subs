00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
made another page on his pad control so

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.120 
made another page on his pad control so
i<00:00:19.890> got<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.189> cue<00:00:21.060> point<00:00:21.330> 1<00:00:21.800> just<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.859> beginning

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
i got a cue point 1 just the beginning

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.370 
i got a cue point 1 just the beginning
of<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.250> song<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.490> then<00:00:23.699> Q<00:00:23.939> point<00:00:24.180> 2<00:00:24.779> 3<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.320> 4

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
of the song and then Q point 2 3 and 4

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.490 
of the song and then Q point 2 3 and 4
which<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.699> f<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.300> cam<00:00:27.689> love<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.260> song

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
which is the f that cam love this song

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:39.950 
which is the f that cam love this song
so<00:00:30.500> turn<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.679> up<00:00:37.489> then<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.879> Q<00:00:39.210> point<00:00:39.239> at<00:00:39.690> sku

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
so turn this up then the Q point at sku

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.479 
so turn this up then the Q point at sku
1<00:00:40.140> 2<00:00:40.350> 3<00:00:40.379> 4<00:00:41.390> &amp;<00:00:42.390> Q<00:00:43.110> point<00:00:43.290> five<00:00:43.590> right<00:00:43.920> after<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.280> is

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
1 2 3 4 &amp; Q point five right after it is

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.880 
1 2 3 4 &amp; Q point five right after it is
a<00:00:44.520> loop<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.600> it'll<00:00:45.750> go<00:00:45.930> straight<00:00:46.410> into<00:00:46.710> that

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
a loop so it'll go straight into that

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.350 
a loop so it'll go straight into that
loop<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.280> stay<00:00:47.460> looping<00:00:47.850> ago<00:00:50.149> so<00:00:51.149> it'll<00:00:51.329> stay

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
loop and stay looping ago so it'll stay

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.740 
loop and stay looping ago so it'll stay
looping<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.230> can<00:00:52.469> jump<00:00:52.739> around<00:00:53.570> into<00:00:54.570> that

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
looping so you can jump around into that

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.779 
looping so you can jump around into that
loop<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.230> because<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.800> loop<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.190> already<00:00:56.579> a

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
loop and because that loop is already a

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.470 
loop and because that loop is already a
set<00:00:57.480> length<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.559> one<00:00:58.890> it'll<00:00:59.820> stay<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.059> way

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
set length of one it'll stay that way

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.680 
set length of one it'll stay that way
now<00:01:01.109> what<00:01:01.289> I've<00:01:01.379> also<00:01:01.590> made<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.309> um<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:03.329> terms

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
now what I've also made is um this terms

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.230 
now what I've also made is um this terms
flux<00:01:04.110> mode<00:01:04.320> on<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.559> off<00:01:04.799> this<00:01:05.729> makes<00:01:06.060> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
flux mode on and off this makes the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.870 
flux mode on and off this makes the
loops<00:01:06.479> go<00:01:08.390> smaller<00:01:09.390> or<00:01:09.659> bigger<00:01:10.640> and<00:01:11.640> then<00:01:11.760> this

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
loops go smaller or bigger and then this

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.050 
loops go smaller or bigger and then this
button<00:01:12.650> actually<00:01:13.650> turns<00:01:13.950> active<00:01:14.520> on<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:14.880> and

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
button actually turns active on on and

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.200 
button actually turns active on on and
off<00:01:15.380> but<00:01:16.380> what<00:01:16.650> will<00:01:16.799> happen<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.310> if<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.180> go

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
off but what will happen is that if I go

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.429 
off but what will happen is that if I go
off<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.220> jump<00:01:20.220> back<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.400> acupoint<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.439> then

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
off and jump back to acupoint and then

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.469 
off and jump back to acupoint and then
play

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.170 

and<00:01:27.560> don't<00:01:28.560> have<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:28.979> active<00:01:29.399> it<00:01:29.640> will<00:01:29.909> not

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
and don't have it active it will not

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.530 
and don't have it active it will not
engage<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.470> Q<00:01:31.829> point<00:01:32.040> five<00:01:32.310> but<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.329> go

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
engage in that Q point five but if I go

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.100 
engage in that Q point five but if I go
back<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.140> do<00:01:34.259> i<00:01:34.619> go<00:01:34.770> back<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:34.979> acupoint

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
back to the do i go back to acupoint

00:01:36.110 --> 00:02:01.000 
back to the do i go back to acupoint
engage<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.610> active<00:01:39.060> comes<00:01:39.299> on

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.820 

so<00:02:02.010> even<00:02:02.250> if<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.400> make<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:02.820> shorter<00:02:03.830> one

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
so even if I make this shorter one

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.770 
so even if I make this shorter one
minute<00:02:06.110> then<00:02:07.110> hit<00:02:07.290> acupoint<00:02:08.540> when<00:02:09.540> it<00:02:09.660> gets

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
minute then hit acupoint when it gets

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.410 
minute then hit acupoint when it gets
back<00:02:09.990> to<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.370> it'll<00:02:11.370> stay<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.910> length<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.300> it

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
back to it it'll stay the length that it

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.870 
back to it it'll stay the length that it
was<00:02:12.510> originally<00:02:13.080> made<00:02:13.110> when<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.100> made<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.370> Q

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
was originally made when you made that Q

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.460 
was originally made when you made that Q
point<00:02:15.120> instead<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.660> being<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.840> cue<00:02:16.080> point<00:02:16.320> it's

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
point instead of being a cue point it's

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:37.160 
point instead of being a cue point it's
like<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.650> loop<00:02:16.950> point<00:02:26.570> make<00:02:27.570> it<00:02:27.720> smaller<00:02:36.170> then

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
like a loop point make it smaller then

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.450 
like a loop point make it smaller then
we<00:02:37.350> switch<00:02:38.310> it<00:02:38.460> up<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:38.820> do<00:02:39.360> flux<00:02:39.690> mode<00:02:40.460> it'll

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
we switch it up and do flux mode it'll

00:02:41.460 --> 00:03:26.130 
we switch it up and do flux mode it'll
be<00:02:41.580> like<00:02:41.610> this

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.600 

so<00:03:27.140> flux<00:03:27.709> mood<00:03:28.010> is<00:03:28.280> awesome<00:03:30.430> practice<00:03:31.430> and

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
so flux mood is awesome practice and

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.089 
so flux mood is awesome practice and
enjoy<00:03:31.910> peace<00:03:32.270> and<00:03:32.450> love<00:03:32.660> dude<00:03:33.020> a<00:03:33.140> giant<00:03:33.530> TJ
