sadly we don't have any fridge for it
yeah<00:01:56.100> it's<00:01:56.399> pretty<00:01:56.640> much<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.880> whole<00:01:57.030> idea<00:01:57.299> why

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
yeah it's pretty much the whole idea why

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.510 
yeah it's pretty much the whole idea why
you're<00:01:57.780> inside<00:01:58.140> if<00:01:58.290> I'll<00:01:58.649> paint<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.130> mental

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
you avoid the waves if you're hit by

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.420 
you avoid the waves if you're hit by
waves<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.810> fuck<00:02:04.110> everyone<00:02:04.439> outside<00:02:04.680> but<00:02:05.369> the

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
waves you fuck everyone outside but the

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.469 
waves you fuck everyone outside but the
main<00:02:05.520> thing<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.729> you're<00:02:05.939> in<00:02:06.090> there<00:02:06.270> for<00:02:06.390> around

main thing is you're in there for around
10<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.899> 15<00:02:07.259> seconds<00:02:07.560> each<00:02:07.710> time<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.039> go<00:02:08.160> in<00:02:08.280> its

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
10 to 15 seconds each time you go in its

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.190 
10 to 15 seconds each time you go in its
more<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.789> more<00:02:08.940> scary<00:02:09.330> but<00:02:09.810> when<00:02:09.959> you<00:02:10.050> do

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
more and more scary but when you do

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.619 
more and more scary but when you do
emerge<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:11.099> also<00:02:11.550> produce<00:02:11.730> waves<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.540> these

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
emerge you also produce waves and these

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.670 
emerge you also produce waves and these
are<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.840> ways<00:02:12.959> that<00:02:13.110> we're<00:02:13.230> talking<00:02:13.349> about

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
are the ways that we're talking about

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.740 
are the ways that we're talking about
that<00:02:13.829> just<00:02:14.010> her<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.400> shit<00:02:14.849> ton<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.239> fuck<00:02:15.510> about

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
that just her a shit ton and fuck about

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.349 
that just her a shit ton and fuck about
with<00:02:15.900> pillows<00:02:16.200> so<00:02:16.409> basic<00:02:17.280> idea<00:02:17.670> is<00:02:17.700> when<00:02:18.239> you

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:18.359 
with pillows so basic idea is when you

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:20.330 
with pillows so basic idea is when you
do<00:02:18.540> come<00:02:18.719> out<00:02:18.930> try<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.409> be<00:02:19.560> away<00:02:20.099> from

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
do come out try and be away from

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.580 
do come out try and be away from
everyone<00:02:20.579> else<00:02:20.879> so<00:02:21.510> you're<00:02:21.719> not<00:02:21.900> going<00:02:22.349> all

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
everyone else so you're not going all

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.289 
everyone else so you're not going all
over<00:02:22.620> them<00:02:23.099> another<00:02:23.790> thing<00:02:23.969> they'll<00:02:24.120> also

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
over them another thing they'll also

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.720 
over them another thing they'll also
produce<00:02:24.599> waves<00:02:24.989> is<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.620> cavitation<00:02:26.219> ability

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
produce waves is the cavitation ability

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.259 
produce waves is the cavitation ability
this<00:02:27.510> generally<00:02:28.260> is<00:02:28.590> faced<00:02:29.040> towards<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:30.000> raid

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
this generally is faced towards the raid

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.879 
this generally is faced towards the raid
the<00:02:30.599> boss<00:02:30.750> would<00:02:30.930> just<00:02:31.079> sort<00:02:31.139> turn<00:02:31.439> around<00:02:31.709> and

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:31.889 
the boss would just sort turn around and

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:34.069 
the boss would just sort turn around and
send<00:02:32.069> out<00:02:32.189> a<00:02:32.219> load<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:32.489> waves<00:02:32.780> but<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.900> did<00:02:34.049> seem

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
send out a load of waves but it did seem

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.780 
send out a load of waves but it did seem
a<00:02:34.290> little<00:02:34.469> bit<00:02:34.590> random<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.129> idea<00:02:35.370> is<00:02:35.489> you<00:02:35.519> just

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
a little bit random the idea is you just

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.220 
a little bit random the idea is you just
dodged<00:02:35.969> the<00:02:36.180> waves<00:02:36.359> and<00:02:36.510> you'll<00:02:36.659> be<00:02:36.750> fine<00:02:36.959> and

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
dodged the waves and you'll be fine and

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.539 
dodged the waves and you'll be fine and
he<00:02:37.290> also<00:02:37.590> has<00:02:37.709> something<00:02:37.980> called<00:02:38.099> without

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
he also has something called without

is disarmed he will now start hitting
the<00:03:12.120> tanks<00:03:12.569> much<00:03:12.870> much<00:03:13.139> more<00:03:13.349> quickly<00:03:13.590> than

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:13.919 
the tanks much much more quickly than

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:16.039 
the tanks much much more quickly than
needed<00:03:14.219> before<00:03:14.459> but<00:03:15.180> on<00:03:15.269> top<00:03:15.450> of<00:03:15.510> this<00:03:15.689> all<00:03:15.900> of

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
needed before but on top of this all of

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.930 
needed before but on top of this all of
his<00:03:16.169> attacks<00:03:16.439> will<00:03:16.680> now<00:03:16.829> attempt<00:03:17.280> to<00:03:17.310> cleave

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
his attacks will now attempt to cleave

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.939 
his attacks will now attempt to cleave
on<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.329> another<00:03:18.599> player<00:03:18.989> who<00:03:19.319> is<00:03:19.349> near<00:03:19.799> the

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:19.949 
on to another player who is near the

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.219 
on to another player who is near the
tank<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:20.489> if<00:03:20.819> there<00:03:20.970> is<00:03:21.000> no<00:03:21.239> one<00:03:21.359> nearby<00:03:21.569> the

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:22.229 
tank and if there is no one nearby the

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:24.050 
tank and if there is no one nearby the
tank<00:03:22.530> would<00:03:22.709> just<00:03:22.889> be<00:03:23.040> hit<00:03:23.280> twice<00:03:23.669> so<00:03:23.970> the

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
tank would just be hit twice so the

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.789 
tank would just be hit twice so the
whole<00:03:24.180> idea<00:03:24.209> is<00:03:24.629> that<00:03:24.750> your<00:03:24.959> two<00:03:25.139> tanks<00:03:25.470> are<00:03:25.590> on

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
whole idea is that your two tanks are on

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.199 
whole idea is that your two tanks are on
top<00:03:25.949> of<00:03:25.979> each<00:03:26.190> other<00:03:26.340> very<00:03:26.609> similar<00:03:26.970> to<00:03:27.090> how

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
top of each other very similar to how

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.149 
top of each other very similar to how
butcher<00:03:27.599> works<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:27.989> everything<00:03:28.019> just<00:03:28.530> so

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 
butcher works and everything just so

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:30.679 
butcher works and everything just so
they<00:03:29.310> don't<00:03:29.340> get<00:03:29.609> absolutely<00:03:30.239> demolished

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:30.689 
they don't get absolutely demolished

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:32.659 
they don't get absolutely demolished
with<00:03:30.900> you<00:03:31.079> know<00:03:31.229> double<00:03:31.919> hits<00:03:32.129> and<00:03:32.370> all<00:03:32.459> that

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
with you know double hits and all that

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:34.429 
with you know double hits and all that
kind<00:03:32.909> of<00:03:33.030> self<00:03:33.269> but<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.019> main<00:03:34.169> thing<00:03:34.199> you<00:03:34.379> need

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:34.439 
kind of self but the main thing you need

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:35.539 
kind of self but the main thing you need
to<00:03:34.590> worry<00:03:34.680> about<00:03:34.979> in<00:03:35.189> this<00:03:35.310> phase<00:03:35.519> is

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
to worry about in this phase is

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:36.939 
to worry about in this phase is
something<00:03:36.090> called<00:03:36.209> seeds<00:03:36.569> of<00:03:36.720> destruction

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:36.949 
something called seeds of destruction

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:40.099 
something called seeds of destruction
this<00:03:37.949> will<00:03:38.099> just<00:03:38.189> debuff<00:03:38.669> random<00:03:39.329> targets<00:03:39.900> and

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
this will just debuff random targets and

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:41.780 
this will just debuff random targets and
when<00:03:40.199> the<00:03:40.319> debuff<00:03:40.650> does<00:03:40.859> expire<00:03:41.250> around<00:03:41.579> five

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
when the debuff does expire around five

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.759 
when the debuff does expire around five
seconds<00:03:42.299> later<00:03:42.479> these<00:03:43.079> players<00:03:43.409> will<00:03:43.620> then

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
seconds later these players will then

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.949 
seconds later these players will then
shoot<00:03:44.040> out<00:03:44.250> eight<00:03:44.489> of<00:03:44.790> these<00:03:44.970> horrible<00:03:45.359> purple

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
shoot out eight of these horrible purple

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.469 
shoot out eight of these horrible purple
waves<00:03:46.169> in<00:03:46.500> all<00:03:47.009> directions<00:03:47.189> around<00:03:47.849> them<00:03:48.299> and

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:48.479 
waves in all directions around them and

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:50.839 
waves in all directions around them and
if<00:03:49.019> you<00:03:49.139> have<00:03:49.259> a<00:03:49.290> large<00:03:49.650> raid<00:03:50.009> size<00:03:50.370> like<00:03:50.609> we

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
if you have a large raid size like we

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.030 
if you have a large raid size like we
did<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.329> lot<00:03:51.629> of<00:03:51.659> people<00:03:52.049> got<00:03:52.169> this<00:03:52.319> debuff<00:03:52.799> and

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
did a lot of people got this debuff and

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.189 
did a lot of people got this debuff and
there<00:03:53.310> was<00:03:53.430> a<00:03:53.459> lot<00:03:53.729> of<00:03:53.759> waves<00:03:54.060> going<00:03:54.449> on<00:03:54.750> so<00:03:55.049> it

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:55.199 
there was a lot of waves going on so it

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:57.740 
there was a lot of waves going on so it
can<00:03:55.470> get<00:03:55.650> really<00:03:56.040> really<00:03:56.340> hectic<00:03:56.639> now<00:03:57.569> they're

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
can get really really hectic now they're

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.240 
can get really really hectic now they're
all<00:03:57.780> the<00:03:57.989> abilities<00:03:58.349> the<00:03:58.560> boss<00:03:58.709> will<00:03:58.889> do<00:03:59.009> in

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250

phase but over the course of the fight

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.659 
phase but over the course of the fight
he'll<00:04:03.540> also<00:04:03.780> spawn<00:04:04.349> these<00:04:04.590> pillars<00:04:04.919> now<00:04:05.579> the

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:05.669 
he'll also spawn these pillars now the

he'll also spawn these pillars now the
pillars<00:04:05.909> themselves<00:04:06.389> don't<00:04:06.599> really<00:04:06.840> do<00:04:06.959> much

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
pillars themselves don't really do much

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.229 
pillars themselves don't really do much

at all all they sort of do is early
damage<00:04:09.479> around<00:04:09.840> them<00:04:10.079> see<00:04:10.259> if<00:04:10.349> you'll<00:04:10.470> stood

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
damage around them see if you'll stood

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.929 
damage around them see if you'll stood
right<00:04:10.889> on<00:04:11.040> top<00:04:11.220> of<00:04:11.250> them<00:04:11.430> you<00:04:11.489> take<00:04:11.699> a<00:04:11.729> lot<00:04:11.879> of

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939 
right on top of them you take a lot of

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:13.610 
right on top of them you take a lot of
damage<00:04:12.090> but<00:04:12.599> they<00:04:12.689> also<00:04:12.810> do<00:04:12.959> posting<00:04:13.349> damage

to the entire raid but it's pretty much

to the entire raid but it's pretty much
unnoticeable<00:04:16.229> it<00:04:16.349> doesn't<00:04:16.530> really<00:04:16.650> do<00:04:16.799> much

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
unnoticeable it doesn't really do much

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.249 
unnoticeable it doesn't really do much
damage<00:04:17.220> at<00:04:17.489> all<00:04:17.639> however<00:04:18.209> if<00:04:18.630> any<00:04:18.900> of<00:04:19.049> these

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:19.259 
damage at all however if any of these

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:20.990 
damage at all however if any of these
pillars<00:04:19.560> are<00:04:19.769> hit<00:04:19.919> by<00:04:20.099> the<00:04:20.159> waves<00:04:20.489> of<00:04:20.759> the<00:04:20.849> ways

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
from the seeds which is obviously going

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.680

out<00:04:26.370> waves<00:04:26.490> and

of these waves hits a pillar you'll do a

live servers now the way that these

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.619 
live servers now the way that these
pillars<00:04:44.129> spawn<00:04:44.430> is<00:04:44.610> that<00:04:44.759> for<00:04:45.060> fishes<00:04:45.479> will

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:45.629 
pillars spawn is that for fishes will

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:47.749 
pillars spawn is that for fishes will

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
the room and after 5 seconds or so a

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.409 
the room and after 5 seconds or so a
pillar<00:04:49.979> will<00:04:50.159> spawn<00:04:50.430> out<00:04:50.580> of<00:04:50.729> them<00:04:50.849> if<00:04:51.060> a

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
pillar will spawn out of them if a

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.420 
pillar will spawn out of them if a
player<00:04:51.659> stands<00:04:52.259> in<00:04:52.349> one<00:04:52.469> of<00:04:52.500> these<00:04:52.620> fishes<00:04:53.039> the

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
player stands in one of these fishes the

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.550 
player stands in one of these fishes the
pillars<00:04:53.699> won't<00:04:53.909> spawn<00:04:54.210> at<00:04:54.419> all<00:04:54.629> however<00:04:54.900> one

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
pillars won't spawn at all however one

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.050 
pillars won't spawn at all however one
of<00:04:55.680> them<00:04:55.830> is<00:04:55.979> always<00:04:56.310> going<00:04:56.520> to<00:04:56.669> be<00:04:56.699> inevitable

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
of them is always going to be inevitable

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.110 
of them is always going to be inevitable
and<00:04:57.569> will<00:04:58.080> spawn<00:04:58.439> regardless<00:04:59.340> so<00:04:59.849> with<00:05:00.000> that

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
and will spawn regardless so with that

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.939 
and will spawn regardless so with that
in<00:05:00.300> mind<00:05:00.330> you<00:05:00.689> want<00:05:00.870> three<00:05:01.110> players<00:05:01.500> to<00:05:01.710> stand

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 
in mind you want three players to stand

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:04.040 
in mind you want three players to stand
in<00:05:02.099> three<00:05:02.370> of<00:05:02.400> the<00:05:02.490> fishes<00:05:02.879> and<00:05:03.060> leave<00:05:03.599> one<00:05:03.990> of

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
in three of the fishes and leave one of

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.050 
in three of the fishes and leave one of
the<00:05:04.229> fishes<00:05:04.529> alone<00:05:04.830> to<00:05:05.069> spawn<00:05:05.340> the<00:05:05.490> crystal<00:05:05.939> in

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
the fishes alone to spawn the crystal in

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.969 
the fishes alone to spawn the crystal in
it<00:05:06.180> now<00:05:06.840> whatever<00:05:07.050> pillar<00:05:07.409> location<00:05:07.889> you

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
it now whatever pillar location you

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:09.890 
it now whatever pillar location you
decide<00:05:08.370> to<00:05:08.520> spawn<00:05:08.759> first<00:05:09.120> you<00:05:09.569> should<00:05:09.629> always

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
decide to spawn first you should always

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.929 
decide to spawn first you should always
choose<00:05:10.289> the<00:05:10.349> closest<00:05:10.860> fishes<00:05:11.279> after<00:05:11.789> that

00:05:11.929 --> 00:05:11.939 
choose the closest fishes after that

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:14.240 
choose the closest fishes after that
point<00:05:12.150> to<00:05:12.840> spawn<00:05:13.199> the<00:05:13.379> pillow<00:05:13.620> from<00:05:13.919> because

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
point to spawn the pillow from because

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.679 
point to spawn the pillow from because
you<00:05:14.370> always<00:05:14.610> want<00:05:14.969> these<00:05:15.120> pillars<00:05:15.360> to<00:05:15.509> be<00:05:15.599> as

00:05:15.679 --> 00:05:15.689 
you always want these pillars to be as

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:17.719 
you always want these pillars to be as
close<00:05:15.840> to<00:05:15.960> each<00:05:16.169> other<00:05:16.319> as<00:05:16.500> possible<00:05:16.979> so<00:05:17.610> it's

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:17.729 
close to each other as possible so it's

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:19.399 
close to each other as possible so it's
a<00:05:17.759> lot<00:05:17.879> easier<00:05:18.060> to<00:05:18.330> block<00:05:18.659> waves<00:05:18.990> that<00:05:19.229> are<00:05:19.289> in

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:19.409 
a lot easier to block waves that are in

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:20.990 
a lot easier to block waves that are in
coming<00:05:19.710> towards<00:05:20.069> them<00:05:20.219> because<00:05:20.580> they're<00:05:20.729> much

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
coming towards them because they're much

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.550 
coming towards them because they're much
closer<00:05:21.330> which<00:05:21.689> means<00:05:21.900> you<00:05:21.990> need<00:05:22.080> kind<00:05:22.349> of<00:05:22.439> need

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
closer which means you need kind of need

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.469 
closer which means you need kind of need
to<00:05:22.650> use<00:05:22.770> less<00:05:22.979> players<00:05:23.279> therefore<00:05:24.120> less

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
to use less players therefore less

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:25.909 
to use less players therefore less
people<00:05:24.840> we're<00:05:24.990> going<00:05:25.169> to<00:05:25.259> be<00:05:25.379> taking<00:05:25.529> damage

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
people we're going to be taking damage

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:27.469 
people we're going to be taking damage
because<00:05:26.430> when<00:05:26.580> you're<00:05:26.789> hit<00:05:26.969> by<00:05:27.000> these<00:05:27.240> waves

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
because when you're hit by these waves

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:30.170 
because when you're hit by these waves
it<00:05:27.930> does<00:05:28.110> do<00:05:28.229> a<00:05:28.259> fair<00:05:28.529> amount<00:05:28.560> but<00:05:29.430> ultimately

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
it does do a fair amount but ultimately

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.490 
it does do a fair amount but ultimately
it's<00:05:30.330> nowhere<00:05:30.569> near<00:05:30.599> as<00:05:30.779> bad<00:05:30.930> as<00:05:31.110> them<00:05:31.259> hitting

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
it's nowhere near as bad as them hitting

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.589 
it's nowhere near as bad as them hitting
a<00:05:31.589> pillar<00:05:31.800> so<00:05:32.490> just<00:05:32.729> to<00:05:32.849> summarize<00:05:33.240> our<00:05:33.449> whole

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:33.599 
a pillar so just to summarize our whole

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:35.719 
a pillar so just to summarize our whole
thing<00:05:33.900> pretty<00:05:34.110> much<00:05:34.229> you'll<00:05:35.039> choose<00:05:35.430> one

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
thing pretty much you'll choose one

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:37.909 
thing pretty much you'll choose one
random<00:05:36.300> location<00:05:36.930> for<00:05:37.110> the<00:05:37.169> first<00:05:37.440> pillar<00:05:37.710> to

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 
random location for the first pillar to

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.010 
random location for the first pillar to
spawn<00:05:38.190> and<00:05:38.550> then<00:05:38.969> just<00:05:39.180> hope<00:05:39.479> that<00:05:39.509> other

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
spawn and then just hope that other

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.230 
spawn and then just hope that other
fishes<00:05:40.500> will<00:05:40.740> spawn<00:05:41.159> near<00:05:41.400> there<00:05:41.639> and<00:05:41.849> just

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
fishes will spawn near there and just

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.640 
fishes will spawn near there and just
don't<00:05:42.449> touch<00:05:42.599> those<00:05:42.839> ones<00:05:43.110> you<00:05:43.229> do<00:05:43.379> want<00:05:43.589> the

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
don't touch those ones you do want the

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.589 
don't touch those ones you do want the
pillars<00:05:43.889> all<00:05:44.039> grouped<00:05:44.370> up<00:05:44.610> make<00:05:45.089> soaking<00:05:45.539> a

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:45.599 
pillars all grouped up make soaking a

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:46.550 
pillars all grouped up make soaking a
hell<00:05:45.719> of<00:05:45.750> a<00:05:45.870> lot<00:05:45.990> easier<00:05:46.139> and<00:05:46.379> you'll

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
hell of a lot easier and you'll

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.469 
hell of a lot easier and you'll
generally<00:05:46.770> have<00:05:47.159> a<00:05:47.190> nice<00:05:47.430> of<00:05:47.639> time<00:05:47.849> however

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
generally have a nice of time however

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:49.999 
generally have a nice of time however
when<00:05:48.659> it<00:05:48.719> actually<00:05:48.900> comes<00:05:49.080> down<00:05:49.529> to<00:05:49.800> the

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:50.009 
when it actually comes down to the

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:52.249 
when it actually comes down to the
soaking<00:05:50.400> of<00:05:50.580> the<00:05:50.759> waves<00:05:50.940> you<00:05:51.629> can't<00:05:51.960> have

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:52.259 
soaking of the waves you can't have

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:55.010 
soaking of the waves you can't have
everyone<00:05:52.979> do<00:05:53.490> it<00:05:53.639> now<00:05:54.419> the<00:05:54.479> reason<00:05:54.719> for<00:05:54.960> this

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
everyone do it now the reason for this

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.570 
everyone do it now the reason for this
is<00:05:55.169> that<00:05:55.199> when<00:05:55.469> players<00:05:55.800> actually<00:05:56.069> stand

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
is that when players actually stand

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.490 
is that when players actually stand
inside<00:05:56.849> the<00:05:57.000> fishes<00:05:57.330> to<00:05:57.479> soak<00:05:57.719> them<00:05:57.960> they'll

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
inside the fishes to soak them they'll

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.439 
inside the fishes to soak them they'll
receive<00:05:58.800> a<00:05:58.860> debuff<00:05:59.310> called<00:05:59.550> latent<00:05:59.819> energy

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:00.449 
receive a debuff called latent energy

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:02.029 
receive a debuff called latent energy
and<00:06:00.599> this<00:06:00.689> lasts<00:06:00.990> for<00:06:01.139> around<00:06:01.199> two<00:06:01.560> minutes<00:06:01.889> or

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 
and this lasts for around two minutes or

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:03.980 
and this lasts for around two minutes or
so<00:06:02.250> while<00:06:02.849> you<00:06:03.000> have<00:06:03.150> this<00:06:03.270> debuff<00:06:03.599> if<00:06:03.810> you're

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
so while you have this debuff if you're

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.529 
so while you have this debuff if you're
hit<00:06:04.199> by<00:06:04.229> any<00:06:04.740> of<00:06:04.860> the<00:06:04.979> waves<00:06:05.250> you'll<00:06:06.029> explode

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
hit by any of the waves you'll explode

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:08.890 
hit by any of the waves you'll explode
just<00:06:06.599> like<00:06:07.169> a<00:06:07.199> crystal<00:06:07.500> pillar<00:06:07.830> does<00:06:08.099> so

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900 
just like a crystal pillar does so

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.510 
just like a crystal pillar does so
you'll<00:06:09.900> just<00:06:10.050> instantly<00:06:10.919> blow<00:06:11.219> up<00:06:11.279> the<00:06:11.490> entire

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
you'll just instantly blow up the entire

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.670 
you'll just instantly blow up the entire
raid<00:06:12.270> yeah<00:06:12.539> you're<00:06:12.659> pretty<00:06:12.779> much<00:06:12.930> a<00:06:13.199> mobile

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
raid yeah you're pretty much a mobile

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.459 
raid yeah you're pretty much a mobile
player<00:06:14.099> crystal<00:06:14.819> and<00:06:15.089> it's<00:06:15.419> very<00:06:15.810> very<00:06:15.930> bad

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:16.469 
player crystal and it's very very bad

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:18.769 
player crystal and it's very very bad
and<00:06:16.740> it<00:06:16.800> can<00:06:17.009> become<00:06:17.189> very<00:06:17.370> very<00:06:17.909> difficult<00:06:18.629> to

00:06:18.769 --> 00:06:18.779 
and it can become very very difficult to

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:21.469 
and it can become very very difficult to
avoid<00:06:19.050> waves<00:06:19.500> like<00:06:20.310> yourself<00:06:20.909> as<00:06:21.150> well<00:06:21.360> as

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 
avoid waves like yourself as well as

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:22.879 
avoid waves like yourself as well as
people<00:06:21.599> trying<00:06:21.960> to<00:06:22.050> soak<00:06:22.259> all<00:06:22.439> the<00:06:22.529> other<00:06:22.680> ones

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:22.889 
people trying to soak all the other ones

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:24.170 
people trying to soak all the other ones
you've<00:06:23.069> pretty<00:06:23.310> much<00:06:23.400> going<00:06:23.639> to<00:06:23.699> pretend<00:06:24.000> you

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
you've pretty much going to pretend you

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.420 
you've pretty much going to pretend you
are<00:06:24.419> the<00:06:24.659> pillar<00:06:24.870> yeah<00:06:25.409> like<00:06:25.740> if<00:06:25.919> you<00:06:26.039> get<00:06:26.219> hit

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 
are the pillar yeah like if you get hit

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.879 
are the pillar yeah like if you get hit
everything<00:06:27.389> goes<00:06:27.569> horribly<00:06:28.199> horribly<00:06:28.469> wrong

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:28.889 
everything goes horribly horribly wrong

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.110 
everything goes horribly horribly wrong
and<00:06:28.919> the<00:06:29.099> thing<00:06:29.279> is<00:06:29.400> you<00:06:29.550> can't<00:06:29.759> just<00:06:29.939> go<00:06:30.089> and

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
and the thing is you can't just go and

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.119 
and the thing is you can't just go and
stand<00:06:30.419> right<00:06:31.169> where<00:06:31.199> all<00:06:31.560> the<00:06:31.650> pillars<00:06:31.860> are

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:32.129 
stand right where all the pillars are

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:33.559 
stand right where all the pillars are
because<00:06:32.400> they're<00:06:32.550> doing<00:06:32.819> a<00:06:32.939> lot<00:06:33.210> of<00:06:33.270> AoE

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:33.569 
because they're doing a lot of AoE

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:35.600 
because they're doing a lot of AoE
damage<00:06:33.659> and<00:06:34.050> very<00:06:34.169> close<00:06:34.500> to<00:06:34.770> them<00:06:34.919> you've<00:06:35.490> got

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610 
damage and very close to them you've got

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.129 
damage and very close to them you've got
to<00:06:35.699> try<00:06:35.880> and<00:06:36.000> find<00:06:36.149> that<00:06:36.330> maybe<00:06:36.509> another<00:06:36.810> safe

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:37.139 
to try and find that maybe another safe

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:38.839 
to try and find that maybe another safe
spot<00:06:37.500> you<00:06:37.620> just<00:06:37.830> got<00:06:37.949> a<00:06:37.979> pretty<00:06:38.459> much<00:06:38.639> run

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:38.849 
spot you just got a pretty much run

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:40.530 
spot you just got a pretty much run
around<00:06:39.120> like<00:06:39.209> a<00:06:39.330> little<00:06:39.569> shaky

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:40.540 
around like a little shaky

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.210 
around like a little shaky
and<00:06:40.780> just<00:06:41.200> hope<00:06:41.350> that<00:06:41.380> you<00:06:41.590> don't<00:06:41.770> get<00:06:41.920> hit<00:06:42.070> by

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.220 
and just hope that you don't get hit by

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.680 
and just hope that you don't get hit by
all<00:06:42.280> this<00:06:42.460> stuff<00:06:42.730> but<00:06:42.970> yeah<00:06:43.240> it's<00:06:43.450> pretty

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:43.690 
all this stuff but yeah it's pretty

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.020 
all this stuff but yeah it's pretty
simple<00:06:44.020> whoever<00:06:44.950> does<00:06:45.160> soak<00:06:45.370> these<00:06:45.520> fissures

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:46.030 
simple whoever does soak these fissures

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.940 
simple whoever does soak these fissures
make<00:06:46.720> sure<00:06:46.900> they<00:06:47.020> don't<00:06:47.050> soak<00:06:47.470> any<00:06:47.680> of<00:06:47.860> the

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:47.950 
make sure they don't soak any of the

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.650 
make sure they don't soak any of the
ways<00:06:48.130> at<00:06:48.370> least<00:06:48.400> until<00:06:48.850> the<00:06:48.940> late<00:06:49.120> and<00:06:49.330> energy

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:49.660 
ways at least until the late and energy

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.240 
ways at least until the late and energy
debuff<00:06:49.990> is<00:06:50.170> gone<00:06:50.380> and<00:06:50.590> for<00:06:50.800> this<00:06:50.890> latent

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.250 
debuff is gone and for this latent

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.160 
debuff is gone and for this latent
energy<00:06:51.520> debuff<00:06:51.850> just<00:06:52.720> other<00:06:52.840> people<00:06:53.050> who<00:06:53.140> are

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:53.170 
energy debuff just other people who are

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.770 
energy debuff just other people who are
worrying<00:06:53.530> about<00:06:53.980> normal<00:06:54.460> mode<00:06:54.640> I<00:06:54.850> don't<00:06:55.450> think

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:55.780 
worrying about normal mode I don't think

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:56.940 
worrying about normal mode I don't think
it's<00:06:55.960> actually<00:06:56.110> in<00:06:56.320> the<00:06:56.410> normal<00:06:56.620> mode<00:06:56.740> it's

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:56.950 
it's actually in the normal mode it's

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.230 
it's actually in the normal mode it's
only<00:06:57.130> in<00:06:57.190> the<00:06:57.250> heroic<00:06:57.610> in<00:06:57.700> the<00:06:57.760> mythic<00:06:58.060> mode

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 
only in the heroic in the mythic mode

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.870 
only in the heroic in the mythic mode
okay<00:06:58.690> so<00:06:59.050> that's<00:06:59.230> a<00:06:59.430> something<00:07:00.430> nice<00:07:00.610> I<00:07:00.850> guess

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880 
okay so that's a something nice I guess

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.730 
okay so that's a something nice I guess
for<00:07:01.330> the<00:07:01.420> normal<00:07:01.690> mode<00:07:01.810> people<00:07:02.170> but<00:07:02.350> yeah<00:07:02.500> that

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:02.740 
for the normal mode people but yeah that

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.320 
for the normal mode people but yeah that
is<00:07:02.860> pretty<00:07:03.010> much<00:07:03.190> the<00:07:03.250> encounter<00:07:03.820> it's<00:07:04.030> very

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:04.330 
is pretty much the encounter it's very

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.450 
is pretty much the encounter it's very
very<00:07:04.660> simple<00:07:04.720> if<00:07:05.440> you<00:07:05.560> look<00:07:05.830> at<00:07:05.950> it<00:07:05.980> in<00:07:06.280> that

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:06.460 
very simple if you look at it in that

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.160 
very simple if you look at it in that
way<00:07:06.670> I<00:07:07.060> mean<00:07:07.300> there's<00:07:07.450> not<00:07:07.600> a<00:07:07.630> whole<00:07:07.780> lot<00:07:07.930> to<00:07:08.140> it

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:08.170 
way I mean there's not a whole lot to it

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.930 
way I mean there's not a whole lot to it
is<00:07:08.380> basically<00:07:08.770> do<00:07:09.130> you<00:07:09.190> have<00:07:09.340> debuff<00:07:09.670> okay

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:09.940 
is basically do you have debuff okay

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.460 
is basically do you have debuff okay
don't<00:07:10.150> soak<00:07:10.360> waves<00:07:10.630> if<00:07:10.900> you<00:07:11.140> don't<00:07:11.320> have

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:11.470 
don't soak waves if you don't have

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.020 
don't soak waves if you don't have
debuff<00:07:11.830> soaked<00:07:12.250> as<00:07:12.400> many<00:07:12.580> ways<00:07:12.730> as<00:07:12.790> you

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:13.030 
debuff soaked as many ways as you

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:14.460 
debuff soaked as many ways as you
possibly<00:07:13.390> can<00:07:13.600> that<00:07:13.840> are<00:07:13.960> heading<00:07:14.290> towards

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:14.470 
possibly can that are heading towards

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.530 
possibly can that are heading towards
pillars<00:07:15.100> Impala<00:07:15.430> Matt<00:07:15.700> just<00:07:15.910> single<00:07:16.210> target

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:16.540 
pillars Impala Matt just single target

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.450 
pillars Impala Matt just single target
new<00:07:16.660> down<00:07:16.840> the<00:07:16.960> boss<00:07:17.140> yeah<00:07:17.620> just<00:07:17.890> it's<00:07:18.130> just<00:07:18.220> he

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:18.460 
new down the boss yeah just it's just he

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.580 
new down the boss yeah just it's just he
hurts<00:07:18.760> a<00:07:19.030> lot<00:07:19.180> yeah<00:07:19.480> a<00:07:19.660> lot<00:07:19.870> of<00:07:19.930> visibility<00:07:20.230> I'm

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:20.590 
hurts a lot yeah a lot of visibility I'm

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.400 
hurts a lot yeah a lot of visibility I'm
sorry<00:07:20.920> very<00:07:21.190> very<00:07:21.970> dangerous<00:07:22.240> yeah<00:07:22.840> it<00:07:23.230> gets

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:23.410 
sorry very very dangerous yeah it gets

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.380 
sorry very very dangerous yeah it gets
pretty<00:07:23.560> hectic<00:07:23.980> but<00:07:24.520> I'm<00:07:24.670> assuming<00:07:25.210> they'll

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:25.390 
pretty hectic but I'm assuming they'll

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.540 
pretty hectic but I'm assuming they'll
maybe<00:07:25.600> like<00:07:25.930> kind<00:07:26.170> of<00:07:26.260> tweak<00:07:26.650> those<00:07:26.860> numbers<00:07:27.340> a

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:27.550 
maybe like kind of tweak those numbers a

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.700 
maybe like kind of tweak those numbers a
little<00:07:27.970> bit<00:07:28.390> he<00:07:28.660> is<00:07:28.690> kind<00:07:28.990> of<00:07:29.050> like<00:07:29.140> a<00:07:29.200> end<00:07:29.530> of

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:29.710 
little bit he is kind of like a end of

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.350 
little bit he is kind of like a end of
wing<00:07:29.890> boss<00:07:30.100> so<00:07:30.310> he's<00:07:30.460> kind<00:07:30.760> of<00:07:30.910> supposed<00:07:31.090> to<00:07:31.240> be

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:31.360 
wing boss so he's kind of supposed to be

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.960 
wing boss so he's kind of supposed to be
quite<00:07:31.720> difficult<00:07:31.990> but<00:07:32.830> um<00:07:32.980> there<00:07:33.550> was<00:07:33.640> a<00:07:33.700> point

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:33.970 
quite difficult but um there was a point

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.580 
quite difficult but um there was a point
in<00:07:34.150> the<00:07:34.270> PTR<00:07:34.690> as<00:07:34.780> well<00:07:34.930> when<00:07:35.050> was<00:07:35.170> testing<00:07:35.500> it

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:35.590 
in the PTR as well when was testing it

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:36.960 
in the PTR as well when was testing it
first<00:07:35.740> on<00:07:35.890> her<00:07:36.040> oak<00:07:36.160> that<00:07:36.370> the<00:07:36.490> pillars<00:07:36.790> would

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:36.970 
first on her oak that the pillars would

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.540 
first on her oak that the pillars would
spawn<00:07:37.300> in<00:07:37.480> the<00:07:37.570> walls<00:07:37.780> yeah<00:07:38.380> that's<00:07:38.890> fun<00:07:39.190> but

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:39.550 
spawn in the walls yeah that's fun but

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.130 
spawn in the walls yeah that's fun but
sometimes<00:07:39.970> it<00:07:40.090> in<00:07:40.210> spawn<00:07:40.420> at<00:07:40.540> all<00:07:40.690> yeah<00:07:40.900> but

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:41.140 
sometimes it in spawn at all yeah but

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.650 
sometimes it in spawn at all yeah but
they<00:07:41.260> do<00:07:41.650> that<00:07:42.610> you<00:07:42.760> made<00:07:42.940> the<00:07:43.030> fighter<00:07:43.240> a<00:07:43.360> easy

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:43.660 
they do that you made the fighter a easy

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.180

but<00:07:43.960> I'll<00:07:44.080> myth<00:07:44.290> it<00:07:44.440> they<00:07:44.530> did<00:07:44.710> seem<00:07:44.920> to<00:07:45.040> fix

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:45.190
