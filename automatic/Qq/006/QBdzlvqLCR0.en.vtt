00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
interesting thing is even though it's

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.869 
interesting thing is even though it's
the<00:00:45.570> same<00:00:45.809> tune<00:00:46.140> if<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.680> have<00:00:46.860> if<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.789> have

the same tune if you have if you have

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.220 
the same tune if you have if you have
Huber<00:00:48.270> instruments<00:00:48.840> there<00:00:48.989> will<00:00:49.079> be<00:00:49.200> a

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
Huber instruments there will be a

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.319 
Huber instruments there will be a
certain<00:00:49.710> dynamics<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.579> certain<00:00:50.940> group<00:00:51.090> add

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
certain dynamics a certain group add

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.260 
certain dynamics a certain group add
another<00:00:51.500> instrument<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.489> will<00:00:53.699> talk<00:00:54.090> to

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
another instrument and it will talk to

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.810 
another instrument and it will talk to
the<00:00:54.329> shift<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.440> can<00:00:55.590> see<00:00:55.739> how<00:00:55.949> this<00:00:56.550> song

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
the shift so you can see how this song

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.910 
the shift so you can see how this song
will<00:00:57.090> will<00:00:57.510> evolve<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:58.350> by<00:00:58.500> adding<00:00:58.710> an

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
will will evolve just by adding an

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.389 
will will evolve just by adding an
instrument<00:00:59.480> that's<00:01:00.620> quite<00:01:01.620> interesting<00:01:01.920> I

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
instrument that's quite interesting I

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.260 
instrument that's quite interesting I

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
much brighter and the reason by its

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.630 
much brighter and the reason by its
brighter<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.689> it's<00:01:52.009> this<00:01:53.009> one<00:01:53.310> asked<00:01:53.520> us

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
brighter is that it's this one asked us

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.179 
brighter is that it's this one asked us

to really shift basket weave and they're
artists<00:01:56.490> as<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.759> can<00:01:56.909> see<00:01:57.030> here<00:01:57.240> probably

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
artists as you can see here probably

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.670 
artists as you can see here probably
small<00:01:58.290> holes<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.090> and<00:02:00.090> compared<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:01.049> this

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
small holes in it and compared to this

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.149 
small holes in it and compared to this
one<00:02:01.740> which<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.210> original<00:02:04.159> not-so-small

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
one which is the original not-so-small

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.089 
one which is the original not-so-small
novels<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:06.560> there<00:02:07.560> will<00:02:07.680> be<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.799> brighter

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
novels so there will be a brighter

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.510 
novels so there will be a brighter
