end but I guys suggested that he slips
on<00:00:25.410> pieces<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.070> old<00:00:26.160> aluminum<00:00:26.400> shaft<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.720> I

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
on pieces of old aluminum shaft so I

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.540 
on pieces of old aluminum shaft so I
slipped<00:00:28.080> down<00:00:28.230> about<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.439> 10-inch<00:00:28.920> piece<00:00:29.310> and

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
slipped down about a 10-inch piece and

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.420 
slipped down about a 10-inch piece and
then<00:00:29.640> taped<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:30.000> off<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.480> give<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.840> try<00:00:31.430> so

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
then taped it off and give it a try so

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.080 
then taped it off and give it a try so
let's<00:00:32.640> fire<00:00:32.850> everything<00:00:33.239> up<00:00:34.670> and<00:00:35.670> see<00:00:35.910> how<00:00:36.059> it

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
let's fire everything up and see how it

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.950 
let's fire everything up and see how it
works

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.599 

great<00:00:41.960> can't<00:00:42.230> quite<00:00:42.469> aways<00:00:42.710> back<00:00:43.039> so<00:00:43.370> that<00:00:43.519> I

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:43.609 
great can't quite aways back so that I

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:45.389 
great can't quite aways back so that I
can<00:00:43.730> get<00:00:43.820> a<00:00:43.850> nice<00:00:44.030> even<00:00:44.269> coat<00:00:44.600> without<00:00:44.780> getting

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
can get a nice even coat without getting

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.649 
can get a nice even coat without getting
crazy<00:00:46.399> with<00:00:46.579> it<00:00:46.879> but<00:00:47.149> it<00:00:47.239> takes<00:00:47.390> a<00:00:47.510> little

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:47.659 
crazy with it but it takes a little

00:00:47.659 --> 00:01:05.370 
crazy with it but it takes a little
longer<00:00:47.839> to<00:00:48.019> spray<00:00:48.289> that<00:00:48.320> way

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:05.380 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:46.730
