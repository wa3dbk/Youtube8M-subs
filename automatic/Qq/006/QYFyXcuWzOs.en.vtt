00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.770
 ok guys then we follow with the 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.720
 mascara which is one of my favorites e 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.940
 you know limelite mask that I after 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.860
 the extensions this a beautiful 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.960
 pipe cleaner made so that separates and 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.760
 lengthen the lashes also giving it the 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.289
 curve then we go to put it right 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.779
 being careful though that when we arrive 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.699
 towards the goal we tend to get dirty 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.930
 so you have to turn it around to get 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.519
 the desired effect 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.619
 so I make the first goal then the uncle is 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.279
 a bit uncomfortable, however, the effect is very 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.279
 beautiful 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.860
 this mascara you have to stay a while 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.030
 until you are really sure that 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.789
 you like the share of eyelashes and so on 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.100
 and then take what the bottom instead 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.039
 mascolo piccolo that is very bedside table 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.039
 for lower lashes or to give 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:02.100
 good tip to those above him 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:04.320
 I'm going to put law now on the partition wall 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.650
 teddy bear which are brown mascaras 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.140
 opaque I take a bit of a brown the most 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.700
 similar to my eyelashes and I'm going to use it 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.049
 to fill just the eyebrows 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.150
 you know that I love the pencil more but 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.990
 to have a soft effect it goes a lot 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.990
 eye shadow is fine too 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.479
 ok now but liked to keep the 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.510
 concentration on the eyes and so I have 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:41.540
 decided to take just barely a bit 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.760
 of this chabi that not intense foods 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.240
 man watermelon pin and I will use it 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.240
 as blush 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:04.700
 I really like it because it is also moisturizing 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:07.340
 so it's also good that you just have to 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:16.850
 put really little by little at times 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:19.900
 blend it well if not make the stain that 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.900
 same thing on the lips 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.420

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.100

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.040
