00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.189
 hi i have fans like this tips 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.720
 I have a fanatic how much I trust you are 

00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:07.910
 a very interesting application is called 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.500
 is power and what they can do is 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.420
 something that possibly many have been 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.880
 waiting and is able to work that in two 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.350
 windows on the ipad screen 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.699
 we go with the video to show you more or 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.419
 less how this application works and 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.419
 what can they do 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.480
 possibly this claim is very 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.850
 interesting for many because they are going 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.980
 to be able to multitask with two 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.750
 applications at the same time the name of 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.710
 this application is called this direct 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.620
 let's click there 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.320
 and we are going to open that you are going to have 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.579
 the two windows will be able to 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.829
 enlarge depending on the use that you 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.629
 have in each of them here we are going to 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.219
 have some applications that are going to 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.620
 be able to open in each window 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.019
 unfortunately there are not many but they are 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.699
 the most important ones such as what 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:59.870
 what is the navigation they have to do 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.730
 facebook or twitter in case 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.190
 you use a lot what are networks 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.080
 social as well as maps and what is 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.729
 gmail for example if we go to what 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.700
 which is to be facebook we can 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.710
 enter facebook here and we go to what 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.990
 is our YouTube account in the part 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.240
 lower 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.369
 Here we have entered our account 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.979
 to become more fanatic here we can see 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.930
 that we have entered to youtube 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.470
 we are going to 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.540
 enter our account directly 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.370
 and this can see our videos 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.770
 we can click on the last one 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.320
 example that we have entered we are going to 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.390
 talk subscribe and we are going directly to 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.400
 have the video we can advance by 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.620
 last this cause we can see a 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.090
 little bit of sluggishness at the moment 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.370
 we have the two windows open and 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.110
 we begin to enlarge or shrink one or the 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.850
 other then let's see a bit of 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.360
 slowness when handling the 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:56.320
 application below we have the video 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:59.380
 unpacking the zeta open discusses 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.300
 Yesterday, I realized that the 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.940
 error of the beginning of the video but you 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.180
 understand they are thanked then here 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.180
 we have 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.340
 the video that this had been downloading 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.350
 and here we have what is going to be our 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.420
 facebook account with the posts that 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.460
 we have done if we want 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.460
 write something and automatically it's going to 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.600
 leave the keyboard to write 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.600
 let's erase the keyboard 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.260
 and there is our video we are going to 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.930
 enlarge the screen is 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.040
 and there is our video we do not have silence 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.040
 so that it does not bother 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:48.020
 then they will be able to work as they 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:52.280
 I say with two centrals we go to two 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:54.560
 we can save or bookmark this page 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.580
 we can close it or we can go back to the 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.890
 back and we're browsing 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.930
 internet we can return for example 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.360
 there then we are returning to the 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.150
 previous window we're going to close this and 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.010
 we can go for example what are maps 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.890
 while we're going to ok while 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.290
 let's go to map let's lower it to the 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.579
 screen here and we'll be able to see the 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.439
 wells last if you want 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.569
 write inside the will be able to be 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:20.400
 in the course of downloads of 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.680
 map then it's something interesting is not 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.000
 100% perfection you can see a 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.890
 some slow time 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.500
 We are working with two windows but 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.230
 have the advantage now of using two 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.879
 applications at the same time as you 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.560
 you can see it on other devices 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.239
