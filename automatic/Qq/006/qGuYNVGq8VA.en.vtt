kind<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.059> tier<00:01:00.390> 2<00:01:00.600> tier<00:01:00.870> 3<00:01:01.109> structure<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.590> very

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
kind of tier 2 tier 3 structure is very

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.380 
kind of tier 2 tier 3 structure is very
similar<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.309> boneyard<00:01:02.850> but<00:01:02.969> most<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.239> them

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
similar to boneyard but most of them

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.509 
similar to boneyard but most of them
ended<00:01:03.510> up<00:01:03.690> failing<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.799> we<00:01:04.920> ended<00:01:05.100> up<00:01:05.220> kind<00:01:05.460> of

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
ended up failing so we ended up kind of

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.160 
ended up failing so we ended up kind of
switching<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.939> more<00:01:06.090> modular<00:01:06.720> structures

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
switching to more modular structures

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.660 
switching to more modular structures
which<00:01:07.380> winded<00:01:07.770> up<00:01:07.799> seeing<00:01:08.100> on<00:01:08.280> the

had just an insanely lucky just lag shot
there<00:01:51.000> as<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.259> there<00:01:52.500> was<00:01:52.619> no<00:01:52.829> way<00:01:52.979> that

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
there as I so that there was no way that

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.730 
there as I so that there was no way that
should<00:01:53.369> have<00:01:53.460> hit<00:01:53.670> but<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.990> allowed<00:01:55.530> us<00:01:55.560> to

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
should have hit but it allowed us to

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.039 
should have hit but it allowed us to
really<00:01:56.219> clutch<00:01:57.030> stuff<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.420> last<00:01:57.750> that

really clutch stuff in that last that

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.800 
really clutch stuff in that last that
second<00:01:58.409> tier<00:01:58.530> cell<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:58.890> really<00:01:59.070> cool<00:01:59.540> so<00:02:00.540> the

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
second tier cell is really cool so the

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.480 
second tier cell is really cool so the
next<00:02:00.960> map<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.320> have<00:02:01.350> here<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.829> transfer<00:02:02.399> of

really blown away when he first showed
me<00:02:53.330> it's<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:55.319> core<00:02:55.620> actually<00:02:55.860> ends<00:02:56.220> up

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
me it's the core actually ends up

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.490 
me it's the core actually ends up
spawning<00:02:56.730> in<00:02:57.030> that<00:02:57.209> crate<00:02:57.569> up<00:02:57.810> there<00:02:58.019> just

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
spawning in that crate up there just

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.119 
spawning in that crate up there just
towards<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:59.550> middle<00:02:59.819> of<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.800> crane<00:03:01.800> and

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
towards the the middle of the crane and

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.130 
towards the the middle of the crane and
it's<00:03:02.250> just<00:03:02.400> it's<00:03:02.849> so<00:03:03.120> cool<00:03:03.360> how<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.599> the

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
it's just it's so cool how the the

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.660 
it's just it's so cool how the the

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
levels interact with each other you know

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.009

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
if you're on the high ground you have a

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.899 
if you're on the high ground you have a
lot<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.290> sight<00:03:08.010> lines<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.459> a<00:03:08.489> lot<00:03:08.580> of<00:03:08.700> power

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
lot of sight lines and a lot of power

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:10.190 
lot of sight lines and a lot of power
positions<00:03:09.360> but<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:09.599> also<00:03:09.750> have<00:03:09.930> to<00:03:10.019> worry

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
positions but you also have to worry

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.780 
positions but you also have to worry
about<00:03:10.319> players<00:03:10.769> on<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.069> cliff<00:03:11.310> shooting<00:03:11.700> you

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
about players on the cliff shooting you

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.180 
about players on the cliff shooting you
down<00:03:11.819> and<00:03:12.360> it<00:03:12.930> has<00:03:13.140> a<00:03:13.170> defender<00:03:13.769> you<00:03:13.890> have<00:03:14.040> to

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
down and it has a defender you have to

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.040 
down and it has a defender you have to
kind<00:03:14.459> of<00:03:14.519> be<00:03:14.730> on<00:03:14.849> your<00:03:15.000> toes<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.480> consistently

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
kind of be on your toes and consistently

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.140 
kind of be on your toes and consistently
move<00:03:16.379> and<00:03:16.620> try<00:03:16.739> to<00:03:16.800> cut<00:03:17.400> off<00:03:17.519> elites<00:03:17.849> on<00:03:18.030> all

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
the paths and interconnecting ramps so

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.790 
the paths and interconnecting ramps so
it's<00:03:21.150> just<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.540> lot<00:03:21.750> of<00:03:21.930> cool<00:03:22.140> dynamic<00:03:22.620> gameplay
