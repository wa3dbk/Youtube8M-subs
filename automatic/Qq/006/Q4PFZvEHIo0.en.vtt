00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.049
 dear friends like to introduce 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:13.549
 your attention 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:19.670
 my vision of the most successful design 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:23.970
 aquarium for lips and here in this 35 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:30.260
 liter aquarium I have is 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:36.020
 a family of small pawns whole generations 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:40.040
 several generations of their little children 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:44.030
 Now look a little closer 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:47.340
 the whole aquarium almost overgrown with me 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:52.190
 wonderful plants before 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.190
 I think she called her from boring 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.129
 he has a whole bunch of advantages 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.219
 plants but the main advantage 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:06.180
 grows very thick 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.630
 dense thickets and now look in 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:15.150
 who are hiding 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:19.759
 young cupies filtering this 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:25.460
 aquarium wanders airlift us filter 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:29.670
 well, actually everything except lips lyoshik 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.640
 here live snails aul so few of them 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.150
 almost everyone ate 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.700
 predatory snail helena who are in 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.000
 soil I think here somewhere in the area 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.549
 four five helen on this volume 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.200
 aquarium but they cleaned it very 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.320
 quickly 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.329
 even ate 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.299
 Melanie well, although a few pieces still 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.020
 I saw almost all of us left 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.560
 actually all 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.430
