00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
lunda lug nut key for the wheels so my

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.840 
lunda lug nut key for the wheels so my
solution<00:00:21.449> was<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:22.220> well<00:00:23.220> I'm<00:00:23.430> not<00:00:23.609> going<00:00:23.760> to

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
solution was this well I'm not going to

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.060 
solution was this well I'm not going to
go<00:00:24.000> out<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.119> buy<00:00:24.420> one<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.109> those<00:00:25.260> removal

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
go out and buy one of those removal

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.650 
go out and buy one of those removal
sockets<00:00:26.730> because<00:00:26.939> they're<00:00:27.060> only<00:00:27.180> good<00:00:27.420> for<00:00:27.449> a

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
sockets because they're only good for a

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.439 
sockets because they're only good for a
couple<00:00:27.869> uses<00:00:28.730> because<00:00:29.730> they<00:00:29.849> wear<00:00:30.029> out<00:00:30.060> so

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
couple uses because they wear out so

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.560 
couple uses because they wear out so
quickly<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:32.660> screwed<00:00:33.660> have<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:34.710> 58<00:00:35.570> half

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
quickly and so screwed have this 58 half

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.260 
quickly and so screwed have this 58 half
inch<00:00:36.870> drive<00:00:37.140> socket<00:00:37.489> and<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.610> just<00:00:38.760> simply

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
inch drive socket and I just simply

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.780 
inch drive socket and I just simply
fired<00:00:39.570> up<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.840> good<00:00:39.989> old<00:00:40.140> make<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.700> hard<00:00:41.700> to

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
fired up the good old make and hard to

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.740 
fired up the good old make and hard to
do<00:00:42.000> because<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:43.110> chrome<00:00:43.739> socket<00:00:44.280> make

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
do because it's a chrome socket make

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.910 
do because it's a chrome socket make
chrome<00:00:45.750> covered<00:00:46.079> lug<00:00:46.260> nut<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.710> doesn't

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
chrome covered lug nut so it doesn't

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.869 
chrome covered lug nut so it doesn't
weld<00:00:47.100> very<00:00:47.370> well<00:00:47.579> but<00:00:48.510> it's<00:00:49.079> really<00:00:49.350> hot<00:00:49.879> so

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
weld very well but it's really hot so

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.650 
weld very well but it's really hot so
let's<00:00:51.090> see<00:00:51.300> if<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.449> worked

here<00:02:29.260> I<00:02:29.319> don't<00:02:29.500> have<00:02:29.590> a<00:02:29.650> breaker<00:02:29.890> bar<00:02:30.329> so<00:02:31.329> I'm

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
here I don't have a breaker bar so I'm

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.199 
here I don't have a breaker bar so I'm
going<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.569> make<00:02:31.720> this<00:02:31.870> as<00:02:32.049> easy<00:02:32.200> as<00:02:32.379> possible

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
going to make this as easy as possible

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.839 
going to make this as easy as possible
here's<00:02:34.209> a<00:02:34.269> little<00:02:34.450> trick<00:02:34.690> you<00:02:34.840> guys<00:02:34.959> can<00:02:35.230> learn

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
here's a little trick you guys can learn

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.309 
here's a little trick you guys can learn
you<00:02:36.849> just<00:02:37.060> have<00:02:37.239> an<00:02:37.359> ordinary<00:02:37.720> ratchet<00:02:38.170> but

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
you just have an ordinary ratchet but

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.050 
you just have an ordinary ratchet but
you<00:02:38.379> need<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.650> be<00:02:38.680> you<00:02:39.220> know<00:02:39.340> make<00:02:39.549> it<00:02:39.700> wander

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
you need to be you know make it wander

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.479 
you need to be you know make it wander
to<00:02:40.150> get<00:02:40.269> more<00:02:40.420> torque<00:02:40.720> on<00:02:40.930> it<00:02:41.160> just<00:02:42.160> take<00:02:42.340> an

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
to get more torque on it just take an

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.699 
to get more torque on it just take an
extension<00:02:43.090> in<00:02:43.359> the<00:02:43.510> fat<00:02:43.750> socket<00:02:44.260> that<00:02:44.410> fits

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
extension in the fat socket that fits

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.819 
extension in the fat socket that fits
over<00:02:44.859> to<00:02:45.519> handle<00:02:45.880> nicely<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:47.380> that<00:02:47.560> will<00:02:47.650> get

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
over to handle nicely and that will get

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.789 
over to handle nicely and that will get
you<00:02:48.010> that<00:02:48.819> much<00:02:49.060> longer<00:02:49.510> but<00:02:49.959> if<00:02:50.049> six<00:02:50.470> inches

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
you that much longer but if six inches

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.879 
you that much longer but if six inches
six<00:02:51.099> and<00:02:51.220> a<00:02:51.250> half<00:02:51.310> inches<00:02:51.549> and<00:02:52.769> usually<00:02:53.769> that's

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:53.889 
six and a half inches and usually that's

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:55.580 
six and a half inches and usually that's
enough<00:02:54.160> to<00:02:54.340> do<00:02:54.669> what<00:02:54.790> you<00:02:54.910> need<00:02:55.060> to<00:02:55.150> do

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
enough to do what you need to do

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.110 
enough to do what you need to do
especially<00:02:56.590> if<00:02:56.799> you're<00:02:56.980> only<00:02:57.069> working<00:02:57.340> around

especially if you're only working around
the<00:02:58.180> house
