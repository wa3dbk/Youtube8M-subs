00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.190 

definitely<00:02:43.209> getting<00:02:43.360> a<00:02:43.480> few<00:02:43.630> lockups<00:02:44.020> at<00:02:44.110> the

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
definitely getting a few lockups at the

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.020 
definitely getting a few lockups at the
moment<00:02:44.500> but<00:02:44.650> most<00:02:45.040> of<00:02:45.160> those<00:02:45.280> I<00:02:45.459> can<00:02:45.640> feel<00:02:45.880> are

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
moment but most of those I can feel are

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.850 
moment but most of those I can feel are
caused<00:02:46.270> by<00:02:46.500> overshooting<00:02:47.500> and<00:02:47.709> moose

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
caused by overshooting and moose

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.949 
caused by overshooting and moose
tensions<00:02:48.250> so<00:02:48.459> I<00:02:48.670> really<00:02:49.390> think<00:02:49.510> this<00:02:49.690> will<00:02:49.810> get

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
tensions so I really think this will get

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.460 
tensions so I really think this will get
better<00:02:50.170> once<00:02:50.770> I<00:02:50.890> attention<00:02:51.130> it<00:02:51.340> and<00:02:51.430> move<00:02:51.550> it

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
better once I attention it and move it

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.089 
better once I attention it and move it
so<00:02:53.470> it<00:02:53.680> really<00:02:53.709> feels<00:02:54.220> great<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:54.910> press<00:02:55.180> so

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099
