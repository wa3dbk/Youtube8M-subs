 is on the line alexandro argudín 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.370
 general director of civil aeronautics 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.090
 thank you very much for taking the call 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.349
 and good morning 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.900
 according to the information that you have 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.059
 so far according to what his 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.449
 desk that happened with the plane 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.670
 who was traveling to jenni rivera we are not in 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.980
 study conditions it is known that 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.949
 we have lost contact with the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.230
 aircraft so front there are 1.8 miles from 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.019
 south of the Monterrey airport there was a 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.590
 abrupt descent from 35 thousand to 9 thousand feet 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.059
 and then the aircraft was found in 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.739
 the area in the area of ​​the municipality of 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.600
 write do not have no more type 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.879
 We're not starting the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.920
 investigation procedures know 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.450
 of the parties and in the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.820
 next days we can have some 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.980
 information that each time useful for 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.469
 determine the channels of the people 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.000
 an airplane is permanently being 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.520
 monitored that is to say you know exactly 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.469
 what happens every second with an aircraft 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.300
 of this nature at any point 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.059
 of the national territory 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.760
 we know well where it is located in the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.380
 resonant while the teams of 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.520
 communication of the aircraft this 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.770
 switched on 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.930
 the planes have an expert in 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.670
 respond that it emits a signal that is 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.680
 captured by the radars and while this 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.990
 equipment is in operation 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.280
 radars locate where they installed and what 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.560
 height also what are the 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.820
 conditions the height the speed the 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.310
 route etcetera photos the data of eternal 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.130
 the pilot issued some call from 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.979
 emergency we do not have your data yet 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.690
 We are looking for what is called the box 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.610
 black the famous black box we are already 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.649
 looking as it is of knowledge of the 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.229
 impact area the aircraft is an area 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:47.880
 complicated access because it is very very 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.060
 exhibited in the area 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:56.070
 we are looking for the black box as soon as 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:57.690
 if the plane had a black plane no no no 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.050
 we know we are doing is a 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.480
 gray aircraft and 25 already with a modern has 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.370
 we are looking for 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.050
 the data of the aircraft we are 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.090
 reviewing the files from the 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.470
 maintenance log and so on for 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.470
 I can give you more details 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.680
 there are traces of explosion 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.280
 I do not say that the project can not give 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.380
 more data 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.720
 we are more lifting the parties 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:30.750
 I do not have this information as soon as 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.750
 have knowledge of who the plane was 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.860
 american 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.150
 the aircraft an American license plate 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:46.750
 american m matricula and therefore 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:48.280
 we assume that people and obviously of 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.920
 compliance with regulations 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:55.900
 American and we put what we do not see 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.640
 no irregularity of the project but 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.270
 We are in the process of reviewing 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.270
 everyone 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.030
 as it says it's called the company 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.700
 discharges management and those who know 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.170
 they do not learn or support torrox 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.990
 we will be working during the day to 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.790
 to be able to integrate information and 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.290
 to get closer to the public 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.900
 complete much more 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.100
 now this and 10 25 is considered no 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.540
 There was an old man 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.040
 but the factory has not been considered 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.700
 the manufacture of this aircraft in 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:33.330
 particular in 1989 it should no longer be 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:37.070
 flying is not that is the condition 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.070
 we have in the world 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.950
 of the world war 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.870
 everything is dependent on maintenance 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.820
 every six hours of use of an aircraft 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.220
 subject choice because it is power of 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.010
 maintenance of three types you know the 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.630
 which implies including the replacement of 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.490
 the data on issues you expect from 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.170
 the times nobody important the 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.910
 aircraft and between that maintenance of 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.800
 correct way does not have any problem 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.960
 the year of manufacture locally the 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.400
 pilots had all the licenses 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.150
 they were authorized to fly this type 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.150
 of aircraft and so on 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.250
 this American company is 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.020
 authorized to fly in Mexico because 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.230
 is in a flight monterrey districts 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:25.530
 federal and listed within Mexico 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.120
 is a company that leases aircraft for 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.710
 the operation within the territory 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.040
 national and state 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.440
 It is not a different US company 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.530
 american that straight and ronald for his 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:43.380
 project operation of that fate no 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:45.210
 does flights in the us say because it has 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.070
 because what we do is governed by 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.080
 the americas authority 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.670
 and the Mexican authority considering that 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.140
 also flies in national territory 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.360
 he also has to regulate it to supervise 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.720
 openly armed 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.700
 obviously the aviation matter is 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.010
 a global issue the system that we are 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:05.100
 looking for total homologation 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:12.740
 of international regulations for 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:12.740
 that all the standards and obviously 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.680
 director according to the data that 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.510
 you have up to this moment in your 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.350
 desk make it sound like it's what 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.350
 what do you think has happened 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.050
 but the others turn out the authority does not 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.580
 may not be able to guess that we have to 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.800
 concentrate on the evidences this what 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.930
 we could say a verification have not 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.310
 killed and today tell you that they mention to 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.020
 no author can no longer be pronounced 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:39.180
 in his position we have to be joint 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.319
 corruptions and with results 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.060
 conclusive of the group 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:45.830
 thank you very much for these minutes of 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.830
 good morning to the brain
