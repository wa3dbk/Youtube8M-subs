00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:09.829
 question of character 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:11.849
 a good person and other people 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.989
 indifferently things that can do a thousand things 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:16.919
 they all left 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:19.899
 how to do things as they should be in venezuela 10 years ago here 

00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:21.820
 we have 10 years of revolutionary government 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.500
 we have had one of the advantages that is open the field of politics is 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.960
 can do politics freely whether we support the process of a 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.430
 socialist project as it is those who do not support the socialist project there 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.140
 freedom of the means of expression every time say crazy opines what 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.400
 think and that there is a process of revolution underway that is supported 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.050
 by most of the bases of the collective the Venezuelans who go marsé 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.640
 that we throw to realize what President Chávez has called as 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.870
 21st century socialism 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.390
 neither polarized here 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.870
 for something chaotic 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.960
 and it would be good if it is and will be a measure for 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.120
 regular to strong 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.560
 who have achieved a rather delicate situation visit of the Holy Week 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.580
 - yellow 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.210
 now the policy towards him 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.539
 too much and crucial 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:10.620
 this 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.530
 In all aspects there will be a social part of people who for many years 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.360
 invisible today you will be supported a total way apart the students the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.210
 part of the workers feel called to participate in this process 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.720
 revolutionary nowadays of mounier be it is all over the country did not put together a and 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.500
 asia scratched sea formerly with no university open to the people and for the 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.230
 village 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.090
 I ate for people I work for people and dignity ignia in this town 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.990
 that really wants to get ahead 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.730
 Panamera 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:37.790
 as 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.330
 there is much lack of understanding between 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.480
 all the 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.060
 the position is known as 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.650
 home is missing 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.380
 but I do not think you're going to know who should come from desire 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:52.749
 gil 

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:54.430
 osama the modernity 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.640
 it's not helpful 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.400
 rock because he has escaped us and I'm going to see things that I do not like 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.040
 I can not do anything 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.040
 has a pragmatic policy 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.890
 in the political part is an example of participation first of all 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.690
 we see how in the communities 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.060
 they are well included in a participatory way to be 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:22.029
 themselves who are going to place the solutions their environment 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:24.119
 Astrada well complicated 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:29.089
 the mayor seems to me that the measure is when more to see me 

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:34.169
 participating all the Venezuelan people both good tute adult people 

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:36.689
 this all social groups are 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.519
 come including 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.299
 massively participating as never in history has been done 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.839
 so I am certainly in agreement as well as what is taking place 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:48.399
 green 

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:51.429
 nadal that it took not addicted of diego alves well we must have 

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:58.459
 good everyone went to his taste his future in his way 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:59.390
 but 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.460
 as I do not think it will go very well in the future of venezuela and hate 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.600
 economically very well we have had 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.319
 thanks to the revolutionary government 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.900
 the rebound of OPEC for example raw material with which is the psc 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.499
 handles the Venezuelan economy that oil in the year 98 we have a 

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:18.840
 oil to two dollars challenge we have an oil over 100 dollars that way 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.650
 part of the international economic policy that has handled the state 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.810
 Venezuelan leader led by President Chávez 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.920
 I would like to say that depends on us 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.959
 we do not have anybody any president of any 

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:34.249
 For hours talking about us 

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:37.169
 with you get closer to what is happening 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.429
 the veteran larry page 

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:40.439
 ansa 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:43.299
 quoted we change way of thinking 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.769
 knows that there is in the Andaman Sea Havana despite general peace the 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.419
 Venezuelan in ondarreta does not matter what it is to the government now since in truth 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.029
 we are the ones who have to do 

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:55.819
 but Canepa appears 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.389
 the people with their way of zaragoza 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:02.479
 for eduardo he paid the marm to the jungle area and there is no merit to it 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.519
 there are people who want to save forward 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:07.769
 I hope there is a change 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.620
 with the future of venezuela 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.470
 entrepreneur because I love the way to socialism thus taking all the 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.750
 basic industries that are of great importance so that they do not leave us or not 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.070
 let's not see ourselves a way affected by this basic industry but rather 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.000
 take them to be every day better and truly help the people 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.900
 Venezuelan not with interests if not really showing solidarity with all 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.920
 the sectors good help will depend on opera and a lot of affection 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:34.409
 I think the streets are not going to be able to walk 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:35.629
 the power 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:38.629

 collaborate with the Venezuelan economy in fact we are cooperative 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:58.490
 besides students 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.389

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:03.779
 help the economy 

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:04.900
 generate job 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.900

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.770
 maternal career house because I like it 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.110

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:36.539
 the future of sep de venezuela 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.550
 we return to the same political participation of the people's bases by 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.129
 hundred contributing their own solutions from their community 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:46.289
 simple concrete an example for the world 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:47.120
 as a young man 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.199
 a great contest 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:52.249

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:53.389
 education 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:54.860
