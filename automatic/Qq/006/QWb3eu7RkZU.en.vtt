00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.919
 change of address 

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:12.039
 the driver of a vehicle that pretends to turn to the right as to the 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:15.489
 left to use a way other than the one that circulates 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:17.450
 take another road from the same road 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.140
 or to get out of it you must warn it in advance and with enough 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.840
 in advance to the drivers of the vehicles that drive behind yours 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.130
 and make sure that the speed and distance of the vehicles that are 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.890
 approach in the opposite direction allow you to perform the maneuver without 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:33.650
 danger 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.790
 abstaining from doing it if these circumstances do not exist 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.970
 you must also refrain from performing the maneuver when it is a change 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.400
 direction to the left and there is not enough visibility 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.710
 execution of the change of address maneuver 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.620
 will necessarily notice its purpose well in advance of the 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.890
 rest of the road users 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.800
 with the left direction indicator today the left arm extended to 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.600
 change direction to the left 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.350
 with the right direction indicator or the left arm bent upwards 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.350
 to change direction to the right 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.660
 unless the road is conditioned by signs to carry it out from another 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.850
 way will be as close as possible to the right edge of the roadway if the change 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.790
 of address is to the right and to the left edge 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.790
 if it's on the left and the one-way road 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.590
 if it is to the left but the roadway through which it circulates is of double direction 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.020
 circulation will be adhered to the longitudinal mark of separation between 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.980
 senses 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.260
 ocz and this would not exist at the axis of the road without invading the area destined 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.710
 Wrong Way 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.060
 when the roadway is of double traffic direction and three lanes 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.240
 separated by discontinuous longitudinal lines should be placed in the 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.790
 Center Lane 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.600
 if the change of direction that left leave left the center of the 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.680
 intersection 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.850
 unless it is conditioned you are marked to leave it on your right 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.580
 cycles and mopeds if there is not a specially conditioned lane 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.130
 for the left turn they should be on the right outside the 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.780
 road 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.289
 whenever possible 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.729
 and start it from that place
