00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
size power brick is about the size of a

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.380 
size power brick is about the size of a
laptop<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.549> just<00:01:23.700> plug<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.060> wall<00:01:24.180> and

laptop and you just plug in the wall and
it's<00:01:24.509> ready<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.840> go<00:01:24.900> alright<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:25.710> now<00:01:25.799> let's

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
it's ready to go alright so now let's

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.560 
it's ready to go alright so now let's
take<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.100> closer<00:01:26.369> look<00:01:26.490> at<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.000> speaker<00:01:27.450> itself

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
take a closer look at the speaker itself

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.450 
take a closer look at the speaker itself
now<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.259> speaker<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.710> pretty<00:01:29.040> decent

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
now this speaker is a pretty decent

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.640 
now this speaker is a pretty decent
sized<00:01:29.640> speaker<00:01:30.000> weighs<00:01:30.210> about<00:01:30.329> 5<00:01:30.659> pounds<00:01:30.900> so

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
sized speaker weighs about 5 pounds so

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.899 
sized speaker weighs about 5 pounds so

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
you probably won't be able to take it

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.219 
you probably won't be able to take it
with<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.150> if<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.360> go<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.630> like<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.780> trip<00:01:34.110> or

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.420 
and then yeah it'll turn the speaker on
and<00:02:34.260> off<00:02:34.410> so<00:02:34.620> that's<00:02:34.770> how<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:34.950> power<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.310> on

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
and off so that's how you power it on

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.670 
and off so that's how you power it on
and<00:02:35.640> off<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:35.910> also<00:02:36.300> a<00:02:36.480> manually<00:02:37.170> adjust<00:02:37.560> the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
and off and also a manually adjust the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.560 
and off and also a manually adjust the
volume<00:02:37.800> for<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.130> speaker<00:02:38.490> itself<00:02:38.610> alright<00:02:39.450> so

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
volume for the speaker itself alright so

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
volume for the speaker itself alright so
let's<00:02:39.720> go<00:02:39.780> ahead<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:39.960> talk<00:02:40.140> about<00:02:40.260> some<00:02:40.560> of

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
let's go ahead and talk about some of

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.950 
let's go ahead and talk about some of
these<00:02:40.680> specs<00:02:41.070> of<00:02:41.250> this<00:02:41.550> speaker<00:02:42.030> like<00:02:42.630> I<00:02:42.780> said

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
these specs of this speaker like I said

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.520 
these specs of this speaker like I said
before<00:02:43.050> as<00:02:43.430> 2.75<00:02:44.430> inch<00:02:44.760> tweeters<00:02:45.350> 23<00:02:46.350> inch

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
before as 2.75 inch tweeters 23 inch

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.130 
before as 2.75 inch tweeters 23 inch
woofers<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:46.980> then<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.520> has<00:02:47.670> 24<00:02:48.300> inch<00:02:48.570> passive

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
woofers and then it has 24 inch passive

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.890 
woofers and then it has 24 inch passive
based<00:02:49.320> radiators<00:02:49.980> now<00:02:50.610> audio<00:02:51.390> quality<00:02:51.570> wise

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
based radiators now audio quality wise

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.600 
based radiators now audio quality wise
this<00:02:52.170> sounds<00:02:52.410> really<00:02:52.740> really<00:02:52.860> good<00:02:53.160> mostly

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
this sounds really really good mostly

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.910 
this sounds really really good mostly
because<00:02:53.730> it<00:02:53.910> has<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.300> Odyssey<00:02:55.140> technology<00:02:55.800> in

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
because it has the Odyssey technology in

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.890 
because it has the Odyssey technology in
it<00:02:56.040> like<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.340> Odyssey<00:02:56.820> EQ<00:02:57.330> and<00:02:57.450> also<00:02:57.720> the

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
it like the Odyssey EQ and also the

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.580 
it like the Odyssey EQ and also the
Odyssey<00:02:58.320> base<00:02:58.530> X<00:02:58.830> X<00:02:59.100> T<00:02:59.550> the<00:03:00.450> base<00:03:00.630> XT<00:03:01.050> is<00:03:01.260> really

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
Odyssey base X X T the base XT is really

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.960 
Odyssey base X X T the base XT is really
cool<00:03:01.740> because<00:03:01.920> what<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:02.340> does<00:03:02.370> is<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:02.790> actually

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
cool because what it does is it actually

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.660 
cool because what it does is it actually
um<00:03:03.540> makes<00:03:04.260> it<00:03:04.440> where<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.710> speaker<00:03:05.010> sounds<00:03:05.370> WAY

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
um makes it where the speaker sounds WAY

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.260 
um makes it where the speaker sounds WAY
WAY<00:03:06.180> WAY<00:03:06.450> lower<00:03:06.900> on<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.380> base<00:03:07.560> end<00:03:07.830> of<00:03:07.950> things

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
WAY WAY lower on the base end of things

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.000 
WAY WAY lower on the base end of things
because<00:03:09.270> it<00:03:09.510> actually<00:03:09.630> forces<00:03:10.140> more<00:03:10.320> out<00:03:10.500> more

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
because it actually forces more out more

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.010 
because it actually forces more out more
air<00:03:11.190> out<00:03:11.430> of<00:03:11.460> the<00:03:11.670> speaker<00:03:12.150> and<00:03:12.270> allows<00:03:12.840> the

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
air out of the speaker and allows the

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.600 
air out of the speaker and allows the
basis<00:03:13.410> sound<00:03:13.590> a<00:03:13.650> lot<00:03:13.770> deeper<00:03:14.040> than<00:03:14.190> it<00:03:14.340> would

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
basis sound a lot deeper than it would

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.240 
basis sound a lot deeper than it would
with<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.750> speaker<00:03:16.080> being<00:03:16.290> this<00:03:16.470> size<00:03:16.680> so<00:03:16.920> from

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
with the speaker being this size so from

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.949 
with the speaker being this size so from
what<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.400> can<00:03:17.490> tell<00:03:17.640> this<00:03:18.270> technology<00:03:18.810> actually

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
what I can tell this technology actually

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.630 
what I can tell this technology actually
does<00:03:19.350> work<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:19.830> it<00:03:19.920> makes<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.190> speaker<00:03:20.459> sound

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
does work and it makes the speaker sound

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.699 
does work and it makes the speaker sound
a<00:03:20.700> lot<00:03:20.850> better<00:03:20.910> for<00:03:21.390> bass<00:03:21.570> and<00:03:21.840> also<00:03:22.170> any<00:03:22.380> other

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
a lot better for bass and also any other

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.770 
a lot better for bass and also any other
like<00:03:23.250> genre<00:03:23.640> of<00:03:23.730> music<00:03:23.880> like<00:03:24.270> rock<00:03:24.540> or

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
anything like that it's gonna sound just

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.640
