00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
we got the treehouse it does require a

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.679 
we got the treehouse it does require a
little<00:01:53.009> bit<00:01:53.189> more<00:01:53.520> because<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.180> one<00:01:54.509> is

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
mom which is a mob trap which is pretty

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.009 
mom which is a mob trap which is pretty
expensive<00:02:13.950> needing<00:02:14.579> a<00:02:14.700> diamond<00:02:15.329> but<00:02:15.840> it's

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
expensive needing a diamond but it's

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.839 
expensive needing a diamond but it's
only<00:02:16.230> one<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.890> everything<00:02:17.280> else<00:02:17.430> is<00:02:17.579> not<00:02:17.700> too

only one and everything else is not too

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.610 
only one and everything else is not too
expensive<00:02:18.180> but<00:02:18.540> on<00:02:18.689> my<00:02:18.810> opinion<00:02:19.230> this<00:02:19.349> is<00:02:19.409> the

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
expensive but on my opinion this is the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.800 
expensive but on my opinion this is the
best<00:02:19.829> part<00:02:20.069> of<00:02:20.189> the<00:02:20.250> mod<00:02:20.489> no<00:02:21.030> it's<00:02:21.150> useful<00:02:21.569> part

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
best part of the mod no it's useful part

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:22.970 
best part of the mod no it's useful part
of<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:21.989> mod<00:02:22.110> because<00:02:22.319> I'm<00:02:22.560> not<00:02:22.739> great<00:02:22.950> at

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
of the mod because I'm not great at

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.250 
of the mod because I'm not great at
building<00:02:23.189> mob<00:02:23.579> traps<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.239> this<00:02:24.870> one<00:02:25.110> is

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
building mob traps and this one is

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.920 
building mob traps and this one is
really<00:02:25.560> freaking<00:02:26.010> amazing<00:02:26.280> um<00:02:26.940> so<00:02:27.390> yeah<00:02:27.629> I

think the smart is worth it just with
the<00:02:29.849> mob<00:02:30.030> shop<00:02:30.299> alone<00:02:30.890> anyway<00:02:31.890> next<00:02:32.220> we<00:02:32.280> got

finally we're using the stable which the
block<00:03:02.879> is<00:03:03.090> actually<00:03:03.480> pretty<00:03:04.109> glitched<00:03:04.530> as<00:03:04.859> you

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980

I<00:04:35.460> was<00:04:35.520> a<00:04:35.639> chest<00:04:35.909> right<00:04:36.120> there<00:04:36.389> um<00:04:36.889> next<00:04:37.889> let<00:04:38.039> me

I was a chest right there um next let me
show<00:04:38.280> you<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.490> treehouse<00:04:38.849> which<00:04:39.060> I<00:04:39.180> said<00:04:39.389> is<00:04:39.570> a

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
little bit expensive but I think it's

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.399 
little bit expensive but I think it's
worth<00:04:41.460> it<00:04:41.789> because<00:04:41.909> it's<00:04:42.180> pretty<00:04:42.389> cool<00:04:42.630> let's

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:43.409 
worth it because it's pretty cool let's

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:45.050 
worth it because it's pretty cool let's
place<00:04:43.650> it<00:04:43.680> down<00:04:44.039> and<00:04:44.340> has<00:04:44.520> this<00:04:44.729> cool

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.690 
place it down and has this cool
structure<00:04:45.840> at<00:04:46.229> the<00:04:46.469> bottom<00:04:46.979> that<00:04:47.340> adds<00:04:47.550> a

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
structure at the bottom that adds a

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.879 
structure at the bottom that adds a
little<00:04:47.820> bit<00:04:47.969> more<00:04:48.270> of<00:04:48.330> a<00:04:48.419> feel<00:04:48.630> to<00:04:48.659> it<00:04:48.930> and<00:04:49.289> if

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
little bit more of a feel to it and if

you want to cool a design like these on
then<00:05:42.510> you<00:05:42.630> could<00:05:42.779> build<00:05:42.930> the<00:05:43.650> pillboxes<00:05:44.310> next

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
Coulomb let me show you to stable which

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.870 
Coulomb let me show you to stable which
is<00:06:13.020> something<00:06:13.349> they<00:06:13.469> recently<00:06:14.130> added<00:06:14.460> into

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
is something they recently added into

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.550 
is something they recently added into
the<00:06:14.909> mod<00:06:15.150> last<00:06:15.479> time<00:06:15.630> i<00:06:15.659> used<00:06:15.990> it<00:06:16.139> they<00:06:16.289> did<00:06:16.440> not

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
the mod last time i used it they did not

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.519 
the mod last time i used it they did not
have<00:06:16.860> it<00:06:17.039> so<00:06:17.520> let's<00:06:17.699> place<00:06:17.940> it<00:06:17.969> down<00:06:18.330> and<00:06:18.750> four

have it so let's place it down and four

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:21.620 
have it so let's place it down and four
horses<00:06:19.830> you<00:06:20.039> already<00:06:20.250> get<00:06:20.370> hay<00:06:20.610> bale<00:06:20.880> and<00:06:21.240> you

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
horses you already get hay bale and you

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.510 
horses you already get hay bale and you
get<00:06:21.779> a<00:06:21.810> sign<00:06:22.139> in<00:06:22.320> a<00:06:22.409> saddle<00:06:22.889> and<00:06:23.039> this<00:06:23.219> is<00:06:23.370> where

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 
get a sign in a saddle and this is where

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.550 
get a sign in a saddle and this is where
you<00:06:23.610> can<00:06:23.699> place<00:06:23.940> your<00:06:24.150> little<00:06:24.419> horse<00:06:24.690> I<00:06:25.050> mean

yeah
and<00:06:26.290> I<00:06:26.440> think<00:06:26.680> it's<00:06:26.800> pretty<00:06:26.950> cool<00:06:27.280> um<00:06:27.730> if<00:06:28.270> you

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:28.510 
and I think it's pretty cool um if you

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:29.610 
and I think it's pretty cool um if you
want<00:06:28.540> to<00:06:28.960> use<00:06:29.080> house<00:06:29.260> and<00:06:29.470> you're<00:06:29.560> playing

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:29.620 
want to use house and you're playing

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.890 
want to use house and you're playing
single<00:06:30.010> player<00:06:30.040> and<00:06:30.370> for<00:06:31.090> the<00:06:31.180> mob<00:06:31.390> trap<00:06:31.660> I'm

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
single player and for the mob trap I'm

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.360 
single player and for the mob trap I'm
going<00:06:32.200> to<00:06:32.260> have<00:06:32.380> to<00:06:32.410> move<00:06:32.650> a<00:06:32.680> little<00:06:33.220> bit

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.370 
going to have to move a little bit

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.640 
going to have to move a little bit
further<00:06:33.790> away<00:06:33.970> because<00:06:34.300> this<00:06:34.750> thing<00:06:35.020> is<00:06:35.050> huge

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
further away because this thing is huge

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.100 
further away because this thing is huge
so<00:06:36.310> do<00:06:36.580> not<00:06:36.910> ever<00:06:37.150> place<00:06:37.510> it<00:06:37.690> like<00:06:37.810> close

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110 
so do not ever place it like close

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.920 
so do not ever place it like close
enough<00:06:38.350> their<00:06:38.500> stuff<00:06:38.860> like<00:06:39.130> over<00:06:39.430> there

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
enough their stuff like over there

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.420 
enough their stuff like over there
because<00:06:40.930> it<00:06:41.110> will<00:06:41.410> mess<00:06:41.650> it<00:06:41.680> up<00:06:41.950> I<00:06:42.130> mean<00:06:42.310> I'm

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:42.430 
because it will mess it up I mean I'm

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.190 
because it will mess it up I mean I'm
just<00:06:42.460> going<00:06:42.730> to<00:06:42.790> place<00:06:42.970> it<00:06:43.000> right<00:06:43.240> here<00:06:43.600> and<00:06:43.780> it

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:44.200 
just going to place it right here and it

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.420 
just going to place it right here and it
will<00:06:44.380> take<00:06:44.530> a<00:06:44.590> little<00:06:44.770> bit<00:06:45.010> of<00:06:45.070> time<00:06:45.280> to

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.430 
will take a little bit of time to

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.670 
will take a little bit of time to
generate<00:06:45.670> oh<00:06:45.940> and<00:06:46.120> there<00:06:46.420> goes<00:06:46.450> right<00:06:47.410> now<00:06:47.530> it

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 
generate oh and there goes right now it

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.440 
generate oh and there goes right now it
doesn't<00:06:47.710> have<00:06:48.010> much<00:06:48.220> of<00:06:48.250> a<00:06:48.460> design<00:06:48.910> i'm<00:06:49.240> trying

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:49.450 
doesn't have much of a design i'm trying

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:50.880 
doesn't have much of a design i'm trying
to<00:06:49.510> find<00:06:49.570> out<00:06:49.750> here's<00:06:49.990> the<00:06:50.050> entrance<00:06:50.290> let's

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:50.890 
to find out here's the entrance let's

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:54.360 
to find out here's the entrance let's
break<00:06:51.310> this<00:06:51.490> and<00:06:51.850> go<00:06:52.390> inside<00:06:52.540> and<00:06:53.100> let<00:06:54.100> me<00:06:54.190> get

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.370 
break this and go inside and let me get

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.490 
break this and go inside and let me get
off<00:06:54.550> of<00:06:54.850> peaceful<00:06:55.570> just<00:06:56.110> so<00:06:56.260> you<00:06:56.320> could

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:56.500 
off of peaceful just so you could

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.380 
off of peaceful just so you could
possibly<00:06:56.770> see<00:06:57.220> stuff<00:06:57.490> spawn<00:06:57.820> and<00:06:58.120> let<00:06:58.270> me<00:06:58.360> just

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:58.390 
possibly see stuff spawn and let me just

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.200 
possibly see stuff spawn and let me just
kind<00:06:58.780> of<00:06:58.900> show<00:06:59.080> you<00:06:59.140> how<00:06:59.440> this<00:06:59.620> works<00:07:00.070> from<00:07:01.060> the

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:01.210 
kind of show you how this works from the

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.060 
kind of show you how this works from the
top<00:07:01.480> because<00:07:01.930> this<00:07:02.350> is<00:07:02.530> not<00:07:02.680> something<00:07:02.890> you

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:03.070 
top because this is not something you

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.040 
top because this is not something you
can<00:07:03.130> build<00:07:03.400> on<00:07:03.490> single<00:07:03.820> player<00:07:03.940> if<00:07:04.270> you<00:07:04.780> go<00:07:04.930> up

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.050 
can build on single player if you go up

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.270 
can build on single player if you go up
here<00:07:05.290> you<00:07:05.380> see<00:07:05.560> a<00:07:05.590> bunch<00:07:05.800> of<00:07:05.860> creepers

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:06.280 
here you see a bunch of creepers

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.820 
here you see a bunch of creepers
skeletons<00:07:07.000> I<00:07:07.210> do<00:07:07.270> not<00:07:07.540> believe<00:07:07.720> I'll<00:07:08.650> be

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:08.830 
skeletons I do not believe I'll be

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.010 
skeletons I do not believe I'll be
spawned<00:07:09.160> I<00:07:09.370> think<00:07:09.880> I<00:07:09.970> thought<00:07:10.300> they<00:07:10.480> do<00:07:10.540> spawn

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:11.020 
spawned I think I thought they do spawn

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.790 
spawned I think I thought they do spawn
maybe<00:07:11.770> not<00:07:12.100> um<00:07:12.460> let's<00:07:12.940> see<00:07:13.320> although<00:07:14.320> I<00:07:14.350> see

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 
maybe not um let's see although I see

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.580 
maybe not um let's see although I see
skeletons<00:07:15.520> I<00:07:15.670> see<00:07:15.850> creepers<00:07:16.360> I<00:07:16.720> don't<00:07:17.500> really

see much of zombies anyway let me cover
this<00:07:19.630> up<00:07:19.900> so<00:07:20.470> they<00:07:20.650> could<00:07:20.710> spawn<00:07:21.190> I<00:07:21.580> so<00:07:22.060> that's

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 
this up so they could spawn I so that's

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.910 
this up so they could spawn I so that's
where<00:07:22.420> they<00:07:22.540> sponsor<00:07:23.110> you<00:07:23.200> do<00:07:23.440> not<00:07:23.590> want<00:07:23.860> to

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:23.920 
where they sponsor you do not want to

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.390 
where they sponsor you do not want to
build<00:07:24.400> in<00:07:24.640> this<00:07:24.870> in<00:07:25.870> one<00:07:26.170> day<00:07:26.200> die<00:07:26.620> they<00:07:27.160> burn

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:27.400 
build in this in one day die they burn

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.280 
build in this in one day die they burn
the<00:07:27.550> lava<00:07:27.790> there<00:07:28.420> they<00:07:28.600> burn<00:07:28.810> into<00:07:28.960> the<00:07:29.140> love

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:29.290 
the lava there they burn into the love

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.620 
the lava there they burn into the love
and<00:07:29.500> then<00:07:29.620> the<00:07:29.710> items<00:07:30.070> drop<00:07:30.280> down<00:07:30.490> here<00:07:30.880> I'm

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:31.630 
and then the items drop down here I'm

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.660 
and then the items drop down here I'm
sure<00:07:31.810> they'll<00:07:32.050> pop<00:07:32.350> up<00:07:32.380> any<00:07:32.800> second<00:07:33.340> because<00:07:33.610> I

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:33.670 
sure they'll pop up any second because I

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.060 
sure they'll pop up any second because I
just<00:07:33.820> saw<00:07:34.120> some<00:07:34.360> stuff<00:07:34.630> recently<00:07:34.840> died<00:07:35.290> let<00:07:35.980> me

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:36.070 
just saw some stuff recently died let me

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:40.110 
just saw some stuff recently died let me
get<00:07:36.250> this<00:07:36.370> out<00:07:36.520> my<00:07:36.700> inventory<00:07:37.200> um<00:07:38.200> I<00:07:39.120> don't

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:40.120 
get this out my inventory um I don't

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.150 
get this out my inventory um I don't
know<00:07:40.240> when<00:07:40.420> it's<00:07:40.570> going<00:07:40.720> to<00:07:40.840> drop<00:07:41.020> um<00:07:41.740> but<00:07:41.920> yeah

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:42.160 
know when it's going to drop um but yeah

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.160 
know when it's going to drop um but yeah
honestly<00:07:42.460> I<00:07:42.790> think<00:07:42.940> this<00:07:43.180> is<00:07:43.240> the<00:07:43.420> best<00:07:43.750> part

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:44.170 
honestly I think this is the best part

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:47.220 
honestly I think this is the best part
of<00:07:44.410> the<00:07:44.620> mob<00:07:44.830> and<00:07:45.190> then<00:07:45.700> there<00:07:45.970> it<00:07:46.090> is<00:07:46.230> mainly

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:47.230 
of the mob and then there it is mainly

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:48.570 
of the mob and then there it is mainly
because<00:07:47.530> this<00:07:47.800> is<00:07:47.950> so<00:07:48.100> cheap<00:07:48.310> it<00:07:48.460> only

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:48.580 
because this is so cheap it only

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.330 
because this is so cheap it only
requires<00:07:48.940> one<00:07:49.620> diamond<00:07:50.620> I<00:07:50.740> mean<00:07:50.920> that's<00:07:51.130> not

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:51.340 
requires one diamond I mean that's not

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.730 
requires one diamond I mean that's not
that<00:07:51.550> much<00:07:51.610> but<00:07:52.390> on<00:07:52.450> my<00:07:52.900> overall<00:07:53.350> personal

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:53.740 
that much but on my overall personal

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.460 
that much but on my overall personal
opinions<00:07:54.190> I<00:07:54.340> think<00:07:54.880> the<00:07:55.000> mob<00:07:55.600> spawner<00:07:56.050> and<00:07:56.380> the

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:56.470 
opinions I think the mob spawner and the

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:58.110 
opinions I think the mob spawner and the
tree<00:07:56.740> house<00:07:56.950> are<00:07:57.220> the<00:07:57.310> best<00:07:57.580> things<00:07:57.880> in<00:07:58.090> the

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:58.120 
tree house are the best things in the

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.600 
tree house are the best things in the
mod<00:07:58.390> because<00:07:59.200> they<00:07:59.560> are<00:07:59.620> the<00:07:59.770> most<00:07:59.950> effective

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:00.610 
mod because they are the most effective

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.010 
mod because they are the most effective
and<00:08:00.820> then<00:08:00.940> of<00:08:01.120> course<00:08:01.210> you<00:08:01.510> have<00:08:01.660> the<00:08:01.780> little

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:02.020 
and then of course you have the little

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.380 
and then of course you have the little
stuff<00:08:02.350> like<00:08:02.590> fountain<00:08:03.460> in<00:08:03.610> the<00:08:03.700> pool<00:08:03.940> just<00:08:04.210> for

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:04.390 
stuff like fountain in the pool just for
