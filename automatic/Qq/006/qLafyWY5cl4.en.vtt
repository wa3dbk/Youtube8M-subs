00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.150 

now<00:02:29.650> we're<00:02:29.770> going<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:29.950> use<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.370> dropper<00:02:30.880> and

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
it turned into like a

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:23.100 
it turned into like a
gelatin

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:40.970 

it's<00:04:23.500> got<00:04:23.710> like<00:04:23.830> a<00:04:23.949> pattern<00:04:24.370> on<00:04:24.490> it<00:04:24.699> too
