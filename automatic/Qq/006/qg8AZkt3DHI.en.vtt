investigation to test if the above
statement<00:00:24.829> is<00:00:25.130> true<00:00:25.480> all<00:00:26.480> right<00:00:26.630> so<00:00:26.930> I<00:00:27.489> have

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:28.489 
statement is true all right so I have

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:36.280 
statement is true all right so I have
let's<00:00:29.390> see<00:00:29.630> I<00:00:30.099> have<00:00:31.099> two<00:00:31.460> cups<00:00:33.190> one<00:00:34.190> a<00:00:34.870> cup<00:00:35.870> a<00:00:36.020> as

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
let's see I have two cups one a cup a as

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.750 
let's see I have two cups one a cup a as
hot<00:00:37.190> water

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
hot water

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.670 
hot water
I<00:00:37.790> just<00:00:38.030> balled<00:00:38.330> it<00:00:38.540> you<00:00:38.810> might<00:00:39.110> not<00:00:39.350> want<00:00:39.590> to

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
I just balled it you might not want to

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.650 
I just balled it you might not want to
test<00:00:40.010> it<00:00:40.750> cup<00:00:41.750> be<00:00:41.990> as<00:00:42.290> ice<00:00:43.160> I<00:00:43.730> put<00:00:44.390> it<00:00:44.480> in<00:00:44.570> the

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
test it cup be as ice I put it in the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.030 
test it cup be as ice I put it in the
freezer<00:00:44.960> for<00:00:45.320> 10<00:00:45.620> minutes<00:00:46.040> so<00:00:46.280> let<00:00:46.430> me<00:00:46.550> see

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
freezer for 10 minutes so let me see

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.900 
freezer for 10 minutes so let me see
okay<00:00:49.040> I<00:00:49.220> think<00:00:49.610> that's<00:00:49.880> good<00:00:50.000> enough<00:00:50.320> so

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
okay I think that's good enough so

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.640 
okay I think that's good enough so
should<00:00:52.910> have<00:00:52.970> frozen<00:00:53.329> by<00:00:53.690> 10<00:00:53.930> minutes<00:00:54.079> anyway

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
should have frozen by 10 minutes anyway

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.910 
should have frozen by 10 minutes anyway
and<00:00:55.390> I<00:00:56.390> have<00:00:56.540> two<00:00:56.750> spoons<00:00:57.140> and<00:00:59.500> sugar<00:01:00.500> I<00:01:00.680> use
