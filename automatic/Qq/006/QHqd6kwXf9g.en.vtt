00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
far my combo hasn't ended and that was

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.710 
far my combo hasn't ended and that was
probably<00:01:01.470> a<00:01:01.650> bad<00:01:01.740> idea<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.370> now<00:01:03.240> the<00:01:03.300> combo<00:01:03.660> is

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
probably a bad idea and now the combo is

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.150 
probably a bad idea and now the combo is
going<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.930> end<00:01:04.080> because<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.620> fucking

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
going to end because of this fucking

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.300 
going to end because of this fucking
ladder<00:01:05.430> length<00:01:06.300> of<00:01:06.480> it<00:01:06.800> I'm<00:01:07.800> gonna<00:01:07.920> check<00:01:08.100> if

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
ladder length of it I'm gonna check if

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.970 
ladder length of it I'm gonna check if
anyone's<00:01:08.640> around<00:01:09.260> no<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.290> just<00:01:10.560> dropped<00:01:10.800> down

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980 
anyone's around no I just dropped down

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.920 
anyone's around no I just dropped down
and<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.760> drop<00:01:12.000> up<00:01:13.760> that<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.940> kind<00:01:15.690> of

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
and to drop up that is kind of

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.260 
and to drop up that is kind of
technically<00:01:16.410> accurate<00:01:16.940> although<00:01:17.940> i<00:01:18.150> think

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
technically accurate although i think

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.950 
technically accurate although i think
the<00:01:18.540> Boers<00:01:18.810> would<00:01:19.020> freak<00:01:19.800> out<00:01:19.979> before<00:01:20.430> you

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
the Boers would freak out before you

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.130 
the Boers would freak out before you
