all right I think the last time you know
we're<00:00:05.879> here<00:00:06.060> you<00:00:06.210> actually<00:00:06.569> seen<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.930> engine

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
we're here you actually seen the engine

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.259 
we're here you actually seen the engine
in<00:00:07.350> this<00:00:07.470> truck<00:00:07.799> it's<00:00:08.550> not<00:00:08.760> in<00:00:08.910> here<00:00:09.059> anymore

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
in this truck it's not in here anymore

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.890 
in this truck it's not in here anymore
obviously<00:00:10.610> but<00:00:11.610> uh<00:00:11.639> I<00:00:12.059> go<00:00:12.420> over<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.599> little<00:00:12.780> bit

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
obviously but uh I go over a little bit

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.430 
obviously but uh I go over a little bit
what<00:00:13.049> I<00:00:13.080> did<00:00:13.349> do<00:00:13.980> I<00:00:15.049> couldn't<00:00:16.049> actually<00:00:16.230> use

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
what I did do I couldn't actually use

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.109 
what I did do I couldn't actually use
the<00:00:16.710> whole<00:00:16.859> engine<00:00:17.160> harness<00:00:17.520> that's<00:00:17.850> where

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
the whole engine harness that's where

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.450 
the whole engine harness that's where
the<00:00:18.779> actual<00:00:19.020> connectors<00:00:19.529> actually<00:00:20.039> bumped<00:00:20.340> up

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
the actual connectors actually bumped up

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.820 
the actual connectors actually bumped up
to<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:20.789> but<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.300> really<00:00:22.020> actually<00:00:22.199> didn't<00:00:22.680> end

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
to it but I really actually didn't end

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.580 
to it but I really actually didn't end
up<00:00:22.949> needing<00:00:23.010> that<00:00:24.080> but<00:00:25.080> oh<00:00:25.380> well<00:00:26.570> and<00:00:27.570> then<00:00:28.560> I

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
up needing that but oh well and then I

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.050 
up needing that but oh well and then I
went<00:00:28.859> ahead<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.189> got<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.460> grid<00:00:29.640> heaters<00:00:29.910> out

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
went ahead and got the grid heaters out

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.640 
went ahead and got the grid heaters out
of<00:00:30.210> here<00:00:30.390> but<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.720> showed<00:00:31.019> y'all<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.470> other

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
of here but I showed y'all in the other

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.080 
of here but I showed y'all in the other
video<00:00:31.920> actually<00:00:32.399> was<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.730> very<00:00:32.910> heater

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
video actually was the very heater

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.389 
video actually was the very heater
assembly<00:00:33.380> or<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.469> good<00:00:34.649> heater<00:00:34.800> relays<00:00:35.190> and

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
assembly or the good heater relays and

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.440 
assembly or the good heater relays and
all<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.670> stuff<00:00:38.960> but<00:00:39.960> pretty<00:00:40.350> much<00:00:41.450> that's

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
all that stuff but pretty much that's

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.190 
all that stuff but pretty much that's
all<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:42.780> really<00:00:43.250> took<00:00:44.250> out<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.719> in<00:00:45.719> here<00:00:46.020> wise

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
all I really took out of it in here wise

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.979 
all I really took out of it in here wise
I<00:00:46.620> was<00:00:47.309> actually<00:00:47.460> gonna<00:00:47.730> try<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.059> get<00:00:48.270> try<00:00:48.899> to

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
I was actually gonna try to get try to

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.470 
I was actually gonna try to get try to
get<00:00:49.170> these<00:00:49.320> off<00:00:49.590> these<00:00:49.829> are<00:00:49.950> actually<00:00:50.309> for<00:00:50.579> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
get these off these are actually for the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.689 
get these off these are actually for the
intercooler<00:00:52.260> mounting<00:00:52.739> at<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.920> bottom<00:00:53.280> but<00:00:53.670> I

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
intercooler mounting at the bottom but I

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.389 
intercooler mounting at the bottom but I
think<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.059> can<00:00:54.210> make<00:00:54.420> them<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:55.199> know<00:00:55.230> if<00:00:56.129> I

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
think I can make them you know if I

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.130 
think I can make them you know if I
can't<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.940> know<00:00:57.000> I'll<00:00:57.449> try<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.690> get<00:00:57.870> them<00:00:57.989> off

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
can't you know I'll try to get them off

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.070 
can't you know I'll try to get them off
somehow<00:01:01.190> if<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.370> need<00:01:02.579> them<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.239> don't<00:01:03.960> know

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
somehow if I need them I I don't know

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.270 
somehow if I need them I I don't know
yet<00:01:04.320> but<00:01:05.630> that's<00:01:06.630> pretty<00:01:07.020> much<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.890> then<00:01:08.189> I

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
yet but that's pretty much it and then I

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.300

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.109 

so<00:01:34.170> what<00:01:34.470> uh<00:01:34.500> what<00:01:35.070> was<00:01:35.220> Scott<00:01:35.460> Scott<00:01:35.939> was

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
so what uh what was Scott Scott was

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.060 
so what uh what was Scott Scott was
saying<00:01:36.560> over<00:01:37.560> it

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
saying over it

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.510 
saying over it
Tandy<00:01:38.670> Safaricom<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.799> inch<00:01:41.310> and

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
Tandy Safaricom that this is a inch and

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
Tandy Safaricom that this is a inch and
3/4<00:01:43.759> you're<00:01:44.759> gonna<00:01:44.880> have<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.060> get<00:01:45.180> some<00:01:45.329> brass

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
3/4 you're gonna have to get some brass

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.969 
3/4 you're gonna have to get some brass
fittings<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.829> actually<00:01:47.220> adapt<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.979> I

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
fittings to actually adapt this and I

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.450 
fittings to actually adapt this and I
think<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.880> other<00:01:51.060> one<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.590> 3/4<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.310> get

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
think the other one is a 3/4 and you get

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.219 
think the other one is a 3/4 and you get
some<00:01:53.610> brass<00:01:53.790> fittings<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.479> adapt<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.930> Chevy

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
some brass fittings and adapt the Chevy

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.550 
some brass fittings and adapt the Chevy
one<00:01:56.130> into<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:57.390> that's<00:01:58.110> how<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.320> can

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
one into this and that's how you can

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.440 
one into this and that's how you can
actually<00:01:58.890> still<00:01:59.130> use<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.369> Chevy<00:01:59.729> harness<00:02:00.180> into

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
actually still use a Chevy harness into

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.280 
actually still use a Chevy harness into
this<00:02:01.640> your<00:02:02.640> oil<00:02:02.790> pressure<00:02:03.090> sending<00:02:03.450> unit<00:02:03.570> is

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
this your oil pressure sending unit is

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.050 
this your oil pressure sending unit is
actually<00:02:04.829> nothing<00:02:05.159> but<00:02:05.460> an<00:02:05.549> 8<00:02:05.700> MP<00:02:05.969> t<00:02:06.329> hole

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
actually nothing but an 8 MP t hole

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.010 
actually nothing but an 8 MP t hole
there's<00:02:09.060> another<00:02:09.420> one<00:02:09.629> that's<00:02:09.869> on<00:02:09.989> top<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.349> the

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
there's another one that's on top of the

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.490 
there's another one that's on top of the
oil<00:02:11.710> pressure<00:02:11.980> or<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.760> oil<00:02:13.030> filter<00:02:13.840> cap<00:02:14.170> I

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
oil pressure or the oil filter cap I

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.350 
oil pressure or the oil filter cap I
think<00:02:14.920> that's<00:02:15.370> one<00:02:15.550> that<00:02:15.730> I'm<00:02:15.820> actually<00:02:16.000> going

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
think that's one that I'm actually going

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.410 
think that's one that I'm actually going
to<00:02:16.480> use<00:02:16.720> for<00:02:17.500> off<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.860> Chevrolet<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.580> just

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
to use for off the Chevrolet and just

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.060 
to use for off the Chevrolet and just
run<00:02:19.600> it<00:02:19.720> across<00:02:19.810> over<00:02:20.290> there<00:02:20.470> cuz<00:02:20.710> it's<00:02:21.010> just

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
run it across over there cuz it's just

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.130 
run it across over there cuz it's just
right<00:02:21.370> there<00:02:21.550> at<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.850> turbo<00:02:22.210> and<00:02:22.690> everything

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
right there at the turbo and everything

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.140 
right there at the turbo and everything
else<00:02:24.600> so<00:02:25.600> far<00:02:26.040> this<00:02:27.040> is<00:02:27.190> kind<00:02:27.430> of<00:02:27.490> a<00:02:27.610> mess<00:02:27.850> right
