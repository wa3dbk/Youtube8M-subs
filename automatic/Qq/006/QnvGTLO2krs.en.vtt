00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.800
 Hello my love again today 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.100
 again very briefly 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.990
 make a possibility completely 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.940
 Simply yourselves to stamp 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.550
 and no I do not mean that 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.849
 Potato pressure that is natural too 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.150
 a very simple and 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:29.070
 child-friendly thing but here 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.770
 I would like you a method 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.930
 imagine where he moosgummi with 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.200
 At least I picture myself 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.690
 A rubber is called that and that is 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.690
 I discovered that you have to combine 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:47.070
 not only something as big it gets 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.859
 big pieces sunning you can completely 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.030
 just have to tinker in the load so 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:54.870
 get rubber plates 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.149
 These are really very thin stripes 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.399
 and they are quite enough 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.679
 you can then these foam rubber plates 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.040
 edit as far as you want 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:06.900
 You can really do that if you are one 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.800
 hobby fair did that work 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.340
 amazingly good if i can give it for 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.330
 from just 1 euro to buy 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.670
 you can do that too with one 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.440
 edit cutter knife or if you 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.660
 really could not have anything else 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.720
 she was also a keen one 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:28.980
 kitchen knife or top club tart 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.380
 Pointy kitchen knives use that 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:35.100
 there were a lot of hissing jobs 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.890
 so reasonably done and me 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.140
 I'll just show it to mine for a short time 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.040
 example objects that is not now 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.110
 big as I said earlier just take it 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.350
 I do not show you the times here the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.240
 made I'm just on the 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.210
 Moss rubber with a pencil 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.740
 my drawings on it or 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.750
 my sketch so to speak 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.160
 and then I have the whole simply with 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.280
 the cutter knife either only 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.340
 tightened to such fine lines 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.459
 get and then that a bit 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.929
 extended or whole big pieces 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:11.760
 cut out I have the whole thing then 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.560
 still glued on a cardboard 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.980
 That's why the cardboard now seems so 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.690
 because of that rubber was yellow I know 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.250
 not if you see that and then I am 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.990
 called in red color over it 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.820
 that's why it's good as I said 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.140
 even glued on a piece of cardboard 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.790
 you do not have to do it on cardboard 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.800
 Stick on but I think that's it 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.100
 more stable and you can more evenly 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.010
 troupe and then your print will be more beautiful 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.930
 Well then you best wear the color 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.500
 on and which color do you use on 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.480
 best 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:50.520
 I would recommend something firmer 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:53.730
 color to take so very wet so 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.640
 How should I say so you should 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.239
 can not drip on it but me 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.680
 should that one like that is the one 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:05.190
 either you take normal 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.790
 But water color stirs the very thick of 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.860
 so use little water and a lot of color 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.190
 or her if you take acrylic paint that 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.930
 is perfect for example just something like 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.030
 watercolor paint economy maybe 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.280
 less recommend because the water 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.140
 slip into the rhön and if 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.180
 then you really neat presses then 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:29.310
 that comes out exactly at the grooves again 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:32.070
 and what's your pressure well then me 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.440
 I found out the best contracts 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.940
 that's on with a sponge that is in 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.640
 by somehow either a plate 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.209
 and mix palette or no to piece 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.900
 newspaper 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:46.350
 pack your color on it and stew it 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:50.130
 so pure in the color that is called the 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:53.160
 color is here then and then hops 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:57.209
 you this really nice on the 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:04:01.170
 plate on it and then carefully on the 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:03.660
 sheet beautifully press on all sides 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.209
 could be so over on his hand back 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.040
 that you really go everywhere 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.370
 color comes and then I have now 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:16.510
 made some samples here 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:20.890
 so i had that this is 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:27.980
 so and so become 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:32.930
 then i had this here this is once 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:34.940
 so and once I'm so one 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:42.050
 made elongated that one sees unfortunately 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:44.510
 very bad and I'm here 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:50.720
 the pages once so hitler weak 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:53.000
 run and I think it's very nice 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.090
 and very simple idea to yourself 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.860
 to make stamp I have now relative 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.350
 made big or just long 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.050
 but you could also do very short 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.630
 make a letter or something and so on 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.430
 then with it any stamp things 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:11.540
 make any headings 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:14.150
 Stamp or similar if you want 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:18.710
 can you really get it all in 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:23.240
 the same size in the carve or im 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:25.430
 cut and then you seemed to tinker 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.430
 on a longer piece of cardboard so if 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:31.490
 her there if that was now bigger can 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:35.870
 you make your way here and 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:40.780
 here still a rail and 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:43.760
 in between these already says yours 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.470
 letters lay the müsstet her then 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.510
 maybe with double sided tape 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:52.310
 make it tight and then you can in 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:55.820
 print a jerk whole word without that 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:58.040
 you slip so that the 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.750
 letters then so that but that 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.820
 maybe here stands and shake 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.750
 maybe repeat that a bit 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.060
 I the ten million 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.220
 if you should prevent that then do 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.710
 all on one straight line on one 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:14.210
 rail sticks with double-sided 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:16.250
 Tape then you could do the trick 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.530
 I would say so now then 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.320
 I have a lot of fun with the stamping 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.630
 make stamp while viewing this 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:26.440
 videos and then I wish you still 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.440
 very nice day
