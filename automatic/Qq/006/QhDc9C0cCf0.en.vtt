these<00:00:06.029> rubber<00:00:06.420> pads<00:00:09.860> they're<00:00:10.860> pretty

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
these rubber pads they're pretty

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.810 
these rubber pads they're pretty
self-explanatory<00:00:11.610> as<00:00:12.509> far<00:00:13.110> as<00:00:13.139> what<00:00:13.410> they<00:00:13.559> do

self-explanatory as far as what they do
they<00:00:14.820> are<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:15.120> vibration<00:00:15.809> dampening<00:00:16.320> system

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
they are a vibration dampening system

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.429 
they are a vibration dampening system
when<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.180> do<00:00:18.330> install<00:00:18.840> them<00:00:19.050> you<00:00:19.170> want<00:00:19.350> to

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
when you do install them you want to

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.290 
when you do install them you want to
install<00:00:19.650> them<00:00:19.980> so<00:00:20.220> that<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.580> tall<00:00:20.939> side

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
install them so that the tall side

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.179 
install them so that the tall side
there's<00:00:21.689> like<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.930> skinnier<00:00:22.500> side<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.100> a

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
there's like a skinnier side and a

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.160 
there's like a skinnier side and a
taller<00:00:23.490> side<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:24.029> want<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.330> tall<00:00:24.570> side<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:25.019> be

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
taller side you want the tall side to be

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.390 
taller side you want the tall side to be
up<00:00:25.400> so<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.609> skinny<00:00:27.060> side<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:27.840> way

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
up so that the skinny side is this way

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.769 
up so that the skinny side is this way
and<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.699> know<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.150> feels<00:00:30.359> like<00:00:30.570> they're

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
and I know that it feels like they're

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.359 
and I know that it feels like they're
sticking<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.470> it's<00:00:31.650> going<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.890> stick<00:00:32.189> on

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
sticking that it's going to stick on

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.340 
sticking that it's going to stick on
there<00:00:32.489> like<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:32.730> that's<00:00:33.239> not<00:00:33.450> going<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:34.079> stay

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
there like that that's not going to stay

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.810 
there like that that's not going to stay
you<00:00:35.010> have<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.190> superglue<00:00:35.880> these<00:00:36.149> on<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:37.820> I'm

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
you have to superglue these on so I'm

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.830 
you have to superglue these on so I'm
going<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.030> go<00:00:39.149> ahead<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.360> grab<00:00:39.629> some

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
going to go ahead and grab some

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.540 
going to go ahead and grab some
superglue<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.649> i'll<00:00:40.739> show<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:41.040> how<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.280> do<00:00:41.520> it

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
superglue and i'll show you how to do it

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.520 
superglue and i'll show you how to do it
really<00:00:41.820> quick<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.660> basically<00:00:42.899> just<00:00:43.170> want

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
really quick so you basically just want

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.610 
really quick so you basically just want
to<00:00:43.590> cover<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:44.629> whole<00:00:45.629> thing<00:00:45.989> make<00:00:46.260> sure<00:00:46.440> that

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
to cover this whole thing make sure that

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.170 
to cover this whole thing make sure that
they're<00:00:46.800> super<00:00:47.160> glue<00:00:47.340> on<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.610> whole<00:00:47.820> entire

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
they're super glue on the whole entire

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.360 
they're super glue on the whole entire
thing<00:00:48.239> ok<00:00:49.579> just<00:00:50.579> like<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.949> there's<00:00:52.949> not<00:00:53.100> all

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
thing ok just like that there's not all

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.040 
thing ok just like that there's not all
the<00:00:53.520> way<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.820> edge<00:00:53.969> keep<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.750> off<00:00:54.870> your

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
the way to the edge keep it off your

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.380 
the way to the edge keep it off your
fingers<00:00:55.410> obviously<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.640> then<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:56.969> can<00:00:57.090> place

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
fingers obviously and then you can place

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.260 
fingers obviously and then you can place
that<00:00:57.719> right<00:00:58.260> where<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.829> want<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.160> it's<00:01:00.059> going

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
that right where you want it it's going

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.959 
that right where you want it it's going
to<00:01:00.329> kind<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.629> go<00:01:00.930> out<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.199> little<00:01:01.469> bit<00:01:01.969> that's

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
to kind of go out a little bit that's

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.969 
to kind of go out a little bit that's
normal<00:01:05.510> so<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.570> want<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:06.990> place<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.409> fairly<00:01:07.740> in

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
normal so you want to place it fairly in

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.730 
normal so you want to place it fairly in
the<00:01:08.070> middle<00:01:08.340> it's<00:01:08.670> not<00:01:08.820> exact<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.479> end<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.140> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
the middle it's not exact the end of the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.859 
the middle it's not exact the end of the
world<00:01:10.979> but<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.909> stuff<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.240> really<00:01:12.479> sticking

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
world but this stuff is really sticking

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.780 
world but this stuff is really sticking
it<00:01:13.200> doesn't<00:01:13.470> look<00:01:13.590> like<00:01:13.650> it's<00:01:13.979> cut<00:01:14.280> but<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.610> is

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
it doesn't look like it's cut but it is

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.210 
it doesn't look like it's cut but it is
so<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.119> just<00:01:15.299> kind<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.509> pull<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.900> apart<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.500> it

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
so you just kind of pull it apart and it

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.800 
so you just kind of pull it apart and it
will<00:01:17.310> come<00:01:17.490> back<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.700> its<00:01:18.030> regular<00:01:18.390> position

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
will come back to its regular position

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.539 
will come back to its regular position
so<00:01:19.290> make<00:01:19.470> sure<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.740> remove<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.340> plastic

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
so make sure you remove the plastic

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.080 
so make sure you remove the plastic
parts<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.360> are<00:01:21.479> on<00:01:21.600> there<00:01:22.670> we've<00:01:23.670> taken<00:01:23.909> the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
parts that are on there we've taken the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.490 
parts that are on there we've taken the
plastic<00:01:24.540> off<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.900> we're<00:01:24.990> just<00:01:25.110> going<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.350> go

make sure you remove that plastic stuff

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.639 
make sure you remove that plastic stuff
otherwise<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.259> won't<00:01:58.439> stick<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:01.200> again<00:02:01.469> we're

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
otherwise it won't stick and again we're

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.539 
otherwise it won't stick and again we're
putting<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:01.979> tall<00:02:02.399> side<00:02:02.759> up<00:02:04.159> we<00:02:05.159> don't<00:02:05.310> want

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
putting the tall side up we don't want

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.600 
putting the tall side up we don't want
to<00:02:05.640> glue<00:02:06.360> them<00:02:06.420> on<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.840> flat<00:02:07.140> way<00:02:07.350> it'll<00:02:08.340> still

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
to glue them on the flat way it'll still

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.190 
to glue them on the flat way it'll still
work<00:02:08.640> but<00:02:08.910> it's<00:02:09.300> not<00:02:09.420> going<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.629> work<00:02:09.750> as<00:02:09.929> well

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
work but it's not going to work as well

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.020 
work but it's not going to work as well
this<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.860> going<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.129> get<00:02:11.400> rid<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.670> all<00:02:11.879> the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
this is going to get rid of all the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.360 
this is going to get rid of all the
vibrate<00:02:12.450> or<00:02:12.629> all<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.989> jello<00:02:13.800> that<00:02:14.099> could<00:02:14.280> be

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
vibrate or all the jello that could be

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.850 
vibrate or all the jello that could be
coming<00:02:14.670> through<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:18.720> stuff<00:02:19.080> is<00:02:19.230> really<00:02:19.470> crazy

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
coming through and stuff is really crazy

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.130 
coming through and stuff is really crazy
it<00:02:20.160> just<00:02:20.330> will<00:02:22.430> stretch<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.849> Bend<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.900> do<00:02:24.989> all

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
it just will stretch and Bend and do all

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.479 
it just will stretch and Bend and do all
kinds<00:02:25.170> of<00:02:25.560> stuff<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:25.920> it<00:02:26.040> always<00:02:26.190> goes<00:02:26.459> back

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
kinds of stuff and it always goes back

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.610 
kinds of stuff and it always goes back
right<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.120> its<00:02:27.239> original<00:02:27.390> shape<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:30.440> go<00:02:31.440> ahead

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
right to its original shape so go ahead

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.839 
right to its original shape so go ahead
and<00:02:32.930> cover<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:34.260> nicely<00:02:34.590> with<00:02:35.129> superglue

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
and cover that nicely with superglue

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.750 
and cover that nicely with superglue
right<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:36.989> edge<00:02:37.140> on<00:02:37.410> all<00:02:37.650> edges<00:02:37.950> there<00:02:40.760> and

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
right to the edge on all edges there and

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.580 
right to the edge on all edges there and
it's<00:02:41.879> going<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.120> kind<00:02:42.330> of<00:02:42.480> squish<00:02:43.110> out<00:02:43.379> on

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
it's going to kind of squish out on

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.780 
it's going to kind of squish out on
anyways<00:02:44.160> when<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:44.519> put<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:44.819> down<00:02:45.060> but<00:02:46.790> tricky

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
anyways when you put it down but tricky

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.130 
anyways when you put it down but tricky
part<00:02:48.030> is<00:02:48.120> getting<00:02:48.180> your<00:02:48.480> fingers<00:02:48.930> out<00:02:49.110> of

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
part is getting your fingers out of

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:58.009 
part is getting your fingers out of
there<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:54.780> then<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.110> next<00:02:55.290> step<00:02:55.530> is<00:02:56.959> going<00:02:57.959> to

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
there and then the next step is going to

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.140 
there and then the next step is going to
be<00:02:58.080> just<00:02:58.349> to<00:02:58.590> do<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:58.920> same<00:02:59.280> exact<00:02:59.700> thing<00:02:59.940> so

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
be just to do the same exact thing so

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.440 
be just to do the same exact thing so
what<00:03:00.300> we'll<00:03:00.450> do<00:03:00.629> is<00:03:00.659> we'll<00:03:01.379> put<00:03:01.650> glue<00:03:02.610> on<00:03:02.909> the

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
what we'll do is we'll put glue on the

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.960 
what we'll do is we'll put glue on the
top<00:03:03.720> of<00:03:03.750> every<00:03:04.290> single<00:03:04.650> one<00:03:04.800> of<00:03:04.830> these<00:03:05.040> and

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
top of every single one of these and

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.780 
top of every single one of these and
then<00:03:06.420> we'll<00:03:06.540> set<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:07.440> quad<00:03:08.010> frame<00:03:08.400> right<00:03:08.610> up

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
then we'll set the quad frame right up

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.180 
then we'll set the quad frame right up
on<00:03:08.940> top<00:03:08.970> of<00:03:09.209> that<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:10.200> want<00:03:10.349> to<00:03:10.409> line<00:03:10.620> it<00:03:10.650> up<00:03:10.920> so

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
on top of that you want to line it up so

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.160 
on top of that you want to line it up so
that<00:03:11.370> they're<00:03:11.700> so<00:03:12.150> it's<00:03:12.300> like<00:03:12.690> in<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:13.019> middle

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
that they're so it's like in the middle

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.770 
that they're so it's like in the middle
here<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:13.800> in<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:13.980> middle<00:03:14.159> here<00:03:14.640> so<00:03:15.450> it<00:03:15.540> takes

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
here and in the middle here so it takes

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.440 
here and in the middle here so it takes
a<00:03:15.959> kind<00:03:16.319> of<00:03:16.409> a<00:03:16.470> precision<00:03:17.159> little<00:03:17.489> line<00:03:17.970> up<00:03:18.209> but

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
a kind of a precision little line up but

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.180 
a kind of a precision little line up but
you<00:03:18.540> want<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:18.780> put<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.080> glue<00:03:19.319> on<00:03:19.349> as<00:03:19.739> fast<00:03:19.950> as

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
you want to put the glue on as fast as

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.000 
you want to put the glue on as fast as
you<00:03:20.310> can<00:03:20.519> so<00:03:21.330> it<00:03:21.450> doesn't<00:03:21.750> dry<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:22.470> then

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
you can so it doesn't dry and then

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.680 
you can so it doesn't dry and then
you're<00:03:23.190> going<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.370> set<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.760> quad<00:03:24.030> down<00:03:24.269> on<00:03:24.480> top

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
you're going to set the quad down on top

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.050 
you're going to set the quad down on top
of<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:25.049> so<00:03:25.650> after<00:03:25.830> you've<00:03:26.099> got<00:03:26.340> your<00:03:26.549> quad<00:03:26.819> on

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
of it so after you've got your quad on

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.539 
of it so after you've got your quad on
here<00:03:27.269> I<00:03:27.299> put<00:03:27.569> a<00:03:27.629> couple<00:03:27.900> batteries<00:03:28.200> on<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:29.220> top

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
here I put a couple batteries on the top

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.250 
here I put a couple batteries on the top
of<00:03:29.580> it<00:03:29.879> just<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.180> kind<00:03:30.420> of<00:03:30.480> push<00:03:30.900> everything

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
of it just to kind of push everything

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.990 
of it just to kind of push everything
down<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:31.709> make<00:03:32.069> sure<00:03:32.250> that<00:03:32.430> it's<00:03:32.580> going<00:03:32.730> to<00:03:32.819> get

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
down to make sure that it's going to get

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.530 
down to make sure that it's going to get
a<00:03:33.060> good<00:03:33.330> seal<00:03:33.860> I<00:03:34.860> let<00:03:35.670> it<00:03:35.790> dry<00:03:36.060> for<00:03:36.120> about<00:03:36.420> a

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
a good seal I let it dry for about a

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.559 
a good seal I let it dry for about a
half<00:03:36.810> an<00:03:36.930> hour<00:03:37.849> could<00:03:38.849> take<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.060> little<00:03:39.299> longer

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
half an hour could take a little longer

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.960 
half an hour could take a little longer
but<00:03:40.290> if<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:40.709> give<00:03:40.860> it<00:03:40.890> a<00:03:41.040> half<00:03:41.190> hour<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:41.909> then

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
but if you give it a half hour and then

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.940 
but if you give it a half hour and then
sometimes<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:43.019> want<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.290> get<00:03:43.440> in<00:03:43.560> and<00:03:43.739> wipe

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
sometimes you want to get in and wipe

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.570 
sometimes you want to get in and wipe
the<00:03:44.700> extra<00:03:45.690> stuff<00:03:45.959> off<00:03:46.260> that's<00:03:46.650> like<00:03:46.769> oozing

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
the extra stuff off that's like oozing

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.580 
the extra stuff off that's like oozing
out<00:03:47.940> on<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.299> side<00:03:48.510> it's<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:48.870> good<00:03:49.019> idea<00:03:49.140> just<00:03:49.379> to

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
out on the side it's a good idea just to

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.789 
out on the side it's a good idea just to
get<00:03:49.799> that<00:03:49.920> stuff<00:03:50.099> out<00:03:50.400> of<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.640> way<00:03:51.680> after<00:03:52.680> you

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
get that stuff out of the way after you

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.410 
get that stuff out of the way after you
put<00:03:53.010> your<00:03:53.159> batteries<00:03:53.549> on<00:03:53.670> me<00:03:53.879> to<00:03:53.970> take<00:03:54.150> a<00:03:54.180> paper

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
put your batteries on me to take a paper

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.600 
put your batteries on me to take a paper
towel<00:03:54.810> and<00:03:54.840> just<00:03:55.319> wipe<00:03:55.560> it<00:03:55.709> down<00:03:55.920> on<00:03:56.129> the<00:03:56.250> edges

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
towel and just wipe it down on the edges

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.570 
towel and just wipe it down on the edges
there<00:03:56.879> but<00:03:57.599> you<00:03:57.720> can<00:03:57.900> see<00:03:58.110> that<00:03:58.140> it's<00:03:58.530> dry<00:03:59.280> and

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
there but you can see that it's dry and

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.320 
there but you can see that it's dry and
it's<00:03:59.760> got<00:04:00.120> lots<00:04:00.299> of<00:04:00.510> movement<00:04:00.810> there<00:04:01.319> Oh

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
it's got lots of movement there Oh

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.759 
it's got lots of movement there Oh
independent<00:04:03.330> of<00:04:03.450> this<00:04:03.629> and<00:04:03.930> that's<00:04:04.590> what

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
independent of this and that's what

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.089 
independent of this and that's what
gives<00:04:04.950> us<00:04:05.129> our<00:04:05.370> vibration<00:04:06.060> dampening<00:04:06.510> so

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
gives us our vibration dampening so

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:09.890 
gives us our vibration dampening so
that's<00:04:08.099> how<00:04:08.220> you<00:04:08.310> install<00:04:08.489> those<00:04:09.000> make<00:04:09.689> sure

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
that's how you install those make sure

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.839 
that's how you install those make sure
that<00:04:10.110> they're<00:04:10.319> tipped<00:04:10.709> up<00:04:10.920> if<00:04:11.159> they<00:04:11.700> are

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
that they're tipped up if they are

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.940 
that they're tipped up if they are
tipped<00:04:12.150> down<00:04:12.420> they<00:04:13.019> still<00:04:13.379> will<00:04:13.590> work<00:04:13.769> but

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
tipped down they still will work but

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.410 
tipped down they still will work but
they<00:04:14.099> just<00:04:14.250> don't<00:04:14.430> give<00:04:14.700> you<00:04:14.819> quite<00:04:15.060> as<00:04:15.239> much

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
they just don't give you quite as much

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.629 
they just don't give you quite as much
motion<00:04:16.019> up<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:16.620> down<00:04:16.859> because<00:04:17.070> there's<00:04:17.310> more

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
motion up and down because there's more

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.969 
motion up and down because there's more
surface<00:04:17.940> area<00:04:18.359> that's<00:04:18.780> glued<00:04:19.169> to<00:04:19.470> both<00:04:19.680> sides

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
surface area that's glued to both sides

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.659 
surface area that's glued to both sides
so<00:04:20.600> that<00:04:21.600> is<00:04:22.320> my<00:04:22.530> tip<00:04:22.590> for<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:23.100> day<00:04:23.250> on<00:04:23.460> those

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
so that is my tip for the day on those

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.680 
so that is my tip for the day on those
and<00:04:24.229> thanks<00:04:25.229> for<00:04:25.350> watching
