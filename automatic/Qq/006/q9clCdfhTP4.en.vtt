piece of jewelry but we're going to talk
about<00:02:20.280> some<00:02:20.490> other<00:02:20.580> reasons<00:02:21.000> as<00:02:21.120> well<00:02:22.040> so

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
about some other reasons as well so

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.180 
about some other reasons as well so
especially<00:02:23.280> in<00:02:24.290> industrial<00:02:25.290> piercings<00:02:25.770> the

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
especially in industrial piercings the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.580 
especially in industrial piercings the
angles<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.120> piercings<00:02:27.570> have<00:02:27.960> to<00:02:28.200> be<00:02:28.350> on

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
angles of the piercings have to be on

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.740 
angles of the piercings have to be on
point<00:02:28.890> okay<00:02:29.220> so<00:02:30.000> that's<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.270> first<00:02:30.450> thing<00:02:30.540> I

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
point okay so that's the first thing I

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.120 
point okay so that's the first thing I
would<00:02:30.810> do<00:02:31.050> if<00:02:31.290> somebody<00:02:31.560> came<00:02:31.680> into<00:02:31.830> my<00:02:31.950> studio

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
would do if somebody came into my studio

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.810 
would do if somebody came into my studio
and<00:02:32.310> had<00:02:32.850> it<00:02:33.000> irritated<00:02:33.660> industrial<00:02:34.260> piercing

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
and had it irritated industrial piercing

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.890 
and had it irritated industrial piercing
I'm<00:02:35.820> just<00:02:36.000> going<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.150> look<00:02:36.240> at<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.480> angles<00:02:36.810> on

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
I'm just going to look at the angles on

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.660 
I'm just going to look at the angles on
the<00:02:36.990> piercings<00:02:37.410> because<00:02:37.650> they<00:02:38.190> have<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.580> be

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
the piercings because they have to be

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.980 
the piercings because they have to be
exact<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.330> if<00:02:40.320> one<00:02:40.920> angle<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.790> off<00:02:42.030> it's<00:02:42.810> going

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
exact and if one angle is off it's going

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.050 
exact and if one angle is off it's going
to<00:02:43.050> cause<00:02:43.350> pressure<00:02:43.740> on<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.220> other<00:02:44.400> wound

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
to cause pressure on the other wound

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.000 
to cause pressure on the other wound
which<00:02:45.570> could<00:02:45.870> cause<00:02:46.110> enough<00:02:46.350> irritation<00:02:46.890> it

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
which could cause enough irritation it

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.450 
which could cause enough irritation it
causes<00:02:47.280> these<00:02:47.400> bumps<00:02:48.080> alright<00:02:49.100> and<00:02:50.100> another

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
causes these bumps alright and another

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.670 
causes these bumps alright and another
thing<00:02:50.820> that<00:02:51.150> you<00:02:51.630> can<00:02:51.780> look<00:02:51.900> at<00:02:52.140> is<00:02:52.440> the

thing that you can look at is the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.760 
thing that you can look at is the

the that scratch can call because you

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.840

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
but some sometimes it can happen so

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.640 
but some sometimes it can happen so
that's<00:04:09.300> something<00:04:09.630> to<00:04:09.690> look<00:04:09.750> at<00:04:10.020> because<00:04:10.470> if

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
that's something to look at because if

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.810 
that's something to look at because if
there's<00:04:10.800> a<00:04:10.860> scratch<00:04:11.250> on<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.489> piece<00:04:11.640> of<00:04:11.670> jewelry

any time it moves back and forth through

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.310 
any time it moves back and forth through
the<00:04:13.860> piercing<00:04:14.570> it<00:04:15.570> can<00:04:15.780> certainly<00:04:16.109> cause

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
the piercing it can certainly cause

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.300 
the piercing it can certainly cause
enough<00:04:16.590> irritation<00:04:17.280> to<00:04:17.730> cause<00:04:18.299> those<00:04:18.600> bumps

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
enough irritation to cause those bumps

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.870 
enough irritation to cause those bumps
jewelry<00:04:20.310> should<00:04:20.459> definitely<00:04:20.790> be

appropriately fitting as well just like
in<00:04:23.160> this<00:04:23.280> case<00:04:23.340> if<00:04:24.000> it's<00:04:24.150> too<00:04:24.300> small<00:04:24.479> can<00:04:24.990> cause

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
in this case if it's too small can cause

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.310 
in this case if it's too small can cause
pressure<00:04:25.440> or<00:04:25.800> if<00:04:26.190> it's<00:04:26.310> too<00:04:26.520> long

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
pressure or if it's too long

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
excess length can actually cause more

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.930 
excess length can actually cause more
