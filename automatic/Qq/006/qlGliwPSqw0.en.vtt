00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello everyone with you evil xp and today i 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.839
 I want to show you a thing that let 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.849
 was invented and not by me but is 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.880
 so wonderful that i can't you 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.950
 it does not demonstrate this thing by itself 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.540
 efficient watermelon farm in a pumpkin in 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.570
 minecraft looks like this 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.949
 way is not difficult to understand why she 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.260
 is most effective 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.480
 the fact is that it costs watermelon or pumpkin 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.840
 grow up in this place like instantly 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.399
 his or her piston cuts down now she 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.500
 turns up in this funnel 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:36.420
 This concept was first tested and 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.000
 developed by youtuber mamba jumbo 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.210
 he first noticed that pumpkins are 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.860
 tight even block, respectively 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.789
 if they would be activated 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:51.780
 this repeater in a strong way 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.210
 any block of redstone were full of this or 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.460
 this side will also be activated 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.739
 so signal from the torch 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.760
 flows into the repeater from the repeater 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.160
 in a pumpkin 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.939
 from pumpkin to this red stone and then 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.860
 piston enters 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.810
 but the main beauty is not even how 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.939
 well it works and how easy and 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.650
 and at the same time build for that you 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.390
 it takes only a few funnels once 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.340
 on which we place like this 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.700
 we will put the earth where we will be 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.509
 stand pumpkin and then remove and put 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.159
 the piston that will cut it down 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.900
 let's put one tight block to which 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.979
 which is not necessary to be 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.860
 Iron spend Redstone put 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.079
 repeater unit and put on it 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.400
 torch 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.090
 do extreme funnel 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.729
 not necessary 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.350
 if you are not going to attach it 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.710
 to this module 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.930
 one more module from this side after 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.619
 this base is left only to apply 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:59.610
 your brilliant hoe on the last block 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:02.370
 and voila everything is ready to plant and pumpkin 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.990
 Thank you all so much for your attention. 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.420
 enjoy your free 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.710
 watermelons endless pumpkins with you was
