00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.120
 or speak to him as they are here we are going to do 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:14.559
 a super easy retro hairstyle is a wave 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:17.110
 60 60 and 70 has inspired like in jackie 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.900
 Kennedy I love how he combed his hair 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.520
 He dressed for this we will do is 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.100
 give volume to our hair in the 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.350
 top part and let's make a tail 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.150
 on the side is super easy for this what 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.670
 only thing you're going to need is that you're 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.260
 pri today I will use gel 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.030
 screen because I want the volume of 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.150
 my hair stays 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.460
 let's use hooks a league to 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.860
 the hair and a small league 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.230
 and now let's start 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:48.030
 The first thing we are going to do is divide 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.030
 our hair to one side 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.810
 I already have the line to the side and now what 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.510
 what we're going to do is we 're going to give it 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.110
 volume to this sector these sectors to 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:05.210
 they have to generate a lot of volume 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.210
 I 'm going to take some hair 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.720
 you are king 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.110
 brush to give volume already know of 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.110
 above 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.680
 jake very well already generates and generate 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.680
 volume and now what I'm going to do 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.020
 is to carry back 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.020
 a half tail 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.190
 leaving these sectors that I'm going to 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.860
 bring in a moment ago too but 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.610
 for the moment we're just going to catch 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.610
 this part above 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.300
 let's use the little list that 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.170
 we have 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.170
 and let's stop 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:21.239
 now let's use bing the hooks 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.300
 we want this part to be high 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.300
 we want you to keep 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.420
 to a lesser extent sure 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.840
 this plot 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.340
 and now I'm going to wear these sides 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.599
 and I will be able to and I will put it behind 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.599
 hiding clarita 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.790
 ah 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.159
 Y 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:23.569
 as they saw called the food of the 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.389
 part of above then I put the hooks 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.909
 in the two sectors on the side above 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:31.310
 of the half tail I made and now what 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:35.109
 What are we going to do with the importer? 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.109
 catch the hair processes 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.350
 let's turn 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.150
 to 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.350
 and now 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.460
 using a lens 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.230
 as they saw I have all my hair 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.320
 to the side now what are we going to 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:29.470
 to do is to hide the little town we are going to 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:33.990
 catch a piece of hair 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.990
 and we're going to spin it around the line 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.460
 as viewed already I pointed using the liguita 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.770
 a piece of hair 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.110
 hooks to hide them now what 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.500
 we will do is pray this little tail 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.500
 pellet 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.480

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.960
