00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.160
 and what happened sawers this time is from 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.880
 some peppers pretty but pretty 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.439
 great for life 11 of the greatest ppi 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.640
 0.12 point 1 boys and good before 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.680
 start with this video I love you 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.660
 send greetings to ruiz or that was the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.460
 who created this map did not pass it through tourÃ© 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.040
 I'll leave it here below your twitter 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.870
 is it generates me description because it is that 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.960
 I liked this map a lot and then nothing 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.930
 let's start we have the lava that 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.339
 because it has nothing of change but what 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.690
 I like its shaders is that as 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:44.550
 can see has the movement of water 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.010
 pretty cool of an aspect as if 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.420
 was passing the air and how can 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.640
 see there we have the leaves that also 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.140
 move there is very cool the truth is that a 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.720
 I love this plus I also 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.519
 has what shadows are and also 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.500
 so let's go see the trees that 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:02.090
 because these also have what they are 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.010
 movement of leaves and shadows 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.810
 and these move slowly very 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.890
 funny and good here we have what 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.330
 are the clippers here we have the brother 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.400
 but 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.750
 but as you mentioned they are normal for 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.090
 fact did not change the texture to the 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.440
 mods simply add more light and 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.360
 what are the shadows because that is 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.040
 It deals with what chiles are, I do not know why 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.350
 where is the sun is not seen right now 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.299
 look there is 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.710
 I've come back a lot up shines and if 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.750
 it flips it down over the moon 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.950
 well, it's pretty, but pretty 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.540
 so I 'll leave it to you in the 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.920
 description for you to pass and you 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.509
 download it the truth is that it is very 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.549
 very, very cool because 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.830
 adds the movement of what are the 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.540
 leaves of the water trees and also 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.539
 what shadows are because that's what 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.950
 more than me I love shadows like that 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.600

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.520
