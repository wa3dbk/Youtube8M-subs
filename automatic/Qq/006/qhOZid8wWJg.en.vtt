the<00:03:10.190> tape<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:10.640> releasing<00:03:11.270> the<00:03:11.360> rocket<00:03:11.810> so<00:03:12.470> the

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
the tape and releasing the rocket so the

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.980 
the tape and releasing the rocket so the
Ender<00:03:13.400> they<00:03:13.550> just<00:03:13.820> to<00:03:13.940> get<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.240> display<00:03:14.720> but

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
Ender they just to get the display but

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:21.550 
Ender they just to get the display but
it's<00:03:15.110> kind<00:03:15.470> of<00:03:15.560> weird<00:03:15.980> I<00:03:16.510> mean<00:03:17.510> yeah<00:03:20.560> yeah

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
it's kind of weird I mean yeah yeah

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.970 
it's kind of weird I mean yeah yeah
there's<00:03:21.830> Buzz<00:03:23.050> big<00:03:24.050> one<00:03:24.230> rocket<00:03:25.300> and<00:03:26.980> he's

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
there's Buzz big one rocket and he's

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.740 
there's Buzz big one rocket and he's
supposed<00:03:28.160> to<00:03:28.400> sit<00:03:29.000> up<00:03:29.150> on<00:03:29.330> top<00:03:29.450> of<00:03:29.900> here<00:03:30.260> and<00:03:31.750> it

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
supposed to sit up on top of here and it

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.030 
supposed to sit up on top of here and it
has<00:03:32.930> no<00:03:33.170> rock<00:03:33.410> action<00:03:34.190> making<00:03:34.430> it<00:03:34.670> faster

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
has no rock action making it faster

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.199 
has no rock action making it faster
obviously<00:03:37.040> because<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.310> rocket<00:03:37.730> was<00:03:37.940> alight

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
obviously because the rocket was alight

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.800 
obviously because the rocket was alight
in<00:03:38.239> the<00:03:38.450> movie<00:03:38.750> and<00:03:38.870> they<00:03:38.959> went<00:03:39.170> fast<00:03:40.660> crap<00:03:41.660> it

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
in the movie and they went fast crap it

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.699 
in the movie and they went fast crap it
just<00:03:41.959> kind<00:03:42.140> of<00:03:42.230> buzz<00:03:43.060> buzz<00:03:44.060> is<00:03:44.269> dead<00:03:44.530> it's<00:03:45.530> not

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
just kind of buzz buzz is dead it's not

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.670 
just kind of buzz buzz is dead it's not
really<00:03:48.010> good<00:03:49.010> set<00:03:49.459> a<00:03:50.150> good<00:03:50.600> play<00:03:50.989> I<00:03:51.019> guess<00:03:51.410> I

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
really good set a good play I guess I

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.310 
really good set a good play I guess I
guess<00:03:52.220> if<00:03:52.370> you<00:03:52.489> play<00:03:53.030> with<00:03:53.209> Legos<00:03:53.540> still<00:03:54.050> then

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
guess if you play with Legos still then

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.130 
guess if you play with Legos still then
you<00:03:54.739> can<00:03:54.920> play<00:03:55.160> with<00:03:55.310> this<00:03:55.459> because<00:03:56.140> good

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
you can play with this because good

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.759 
you can play with this because good
playability<00:03:58.180> but<00:03:59.180> it's<00:03:59.510> a<00:03:59.570> good<00:03:59.750> set<00:04:00.110> good<00:04:00.530> for

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
playability but it's a good set good for

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:03.699 
playability but it's a good set good for
collectors<00:04:01.190> and<00:04:01.400> or<00:04:02.360> just<00:04:02.780> kids<00:04:03.200> who<00:04:03.440> want<00:04:03.650> to

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
collectors and or just kids who want to

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:10.570 
collectors and or just kids who want to
play<00:04:04.010> with<00:04:04.250> it<00:04:08.290> it<00:04:09.290> only<00:04:09.410> has<00:04:09.620> two<00:04:10.010> more<00:04:10.250> pieces

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
play with it it only has two more pieces

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.509 
play with it it only has two more pieces
and<00:04:11.090> then<00:04:11.209> this<00:04:11.390> one<00:04:11.630> little<00:04:11.870> condo<00:04:12.260> set<00:04:12.590> and<00:04:13.430> I

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
and then this one little condo set and I

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:14.949 
and then this one little condo set and I
think<00:04:13.549> this<00:04:13.880> is<00:04:14.030> a<00:04:14.060> round<00:04:14.330> looks<00:04:14.630> to<00:04:14.840> me<00:04:14.930> like

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
think this is a round looks to me like

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.719 
think this is a round looks to me like
it<00:04:15.230> surrounded<00:04:15.590> twenty<00:04:16.010> or<00:04:16.160> thirty<00:04:16.519> dollars

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
it surrounded twenty or thirty dollars

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:20.229 
it surrounded twenty or thirty dollars
to<00:04:17.209> get<00:04:17.989> it<00:04:18.109> to<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:18.859> size<00:04:19.010> of<00:04:19.190> the<00:04:19.250> box<00:04:19.459> but<00:04:20.180> it

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
to get it to the size of the box but it

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.840 
to get it to the size of the box but it
only<00:04:20.359> has<00:04:20.539> two<00:04:20.840> more<00:04:20.890> pieces<00:04:21.890> than<00:04:22.340> the

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
only has two more pieces than the

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.040 
only has two more pieces than the
then<00:04:25.850> the<00:04:27.430> army<00:04:28.430> men<00:04:28.640> on<00:04:28.880> patrol<00:04:29.270> set<00:04:29.690> which<00:04:29.900> my
