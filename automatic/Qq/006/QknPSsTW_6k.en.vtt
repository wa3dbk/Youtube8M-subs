this with saying that this isn't the
best<00:01:20.970> figure<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.689> world<00:01:21.840> if<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.710> need<00:01:23.040> a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
best figure in the world if you need a

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.730 
best figure in the world if you need a
Gundam<00:01:23.670> actor<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.210> your<00:01:24.360> life<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.810> would<00:01:25.500> search

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
Gundam actor in your life I would search

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.999 
Gundam actor in your life I would search
out<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.210> 1/100<00:01:27.210> model<00:01:27.750> kit<00:01:28.049> as<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.979> a

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
out the 1/100 model kit as that is a

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.460 
out the 1/100 model kit as that is a
much<00:01:29.579> better<00:01:30.000> figure<00:01:30.450> than<00:01:30.869> what<00:01:31.110> we<00:01:31.259> have

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
much better figure than what we have

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.310 
much better figure than what we have
here<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.130> I'll<00:01:33.119> show<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.420> why<00:01:33.780> here<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.259> a

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
here and I'll show you why here in a

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.560 
here and I'll show you why here in a
second<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.159> not<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.549> only<00:01:35.759> mode<00:01:36.240> that

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
second this is not the only mode that

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.710 
second this is not the only mode that
the<00:01:36.630> Gundam<00:01:37.020> has<00:01:37.290> um<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:38.670> has<00:01:39.030> another<00:01:39.450> mode

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
the Gundam has um it has another mode

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.690 
the Gundam has um it has another mode
but<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.170> want<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.439> talk<00:01:40.619> about<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:41.100> mode<00:01:41.369> first

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
but I want to talk about this mode first

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.460 
but I want to talk about this mode first
and<00:01:42.030> actually<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.960> better<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.259> the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
and actually this is the better of the

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.389 
and actually this is the better of the
two<00:01:43.500> modes<00:01:43.890> because<00:01:44.700> quite<00:01:45.390> frankly<00:01:46.250> it<00:01:47.250> can

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
two modes because quite frankly it can

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.520 
two modes because quite frankly it can
hold<00:01:47.549> guns<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.329> they<00:01:48.930> look<00:01:49.079> like

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
hold guns and they look like

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.819 
hold guns and they look like
well<00:01:50.250> futuristic<00:01:50.970> six-shooters<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.840> then

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
well futuristic six-shooters and then

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.020 
well futuristic six-shooters and then
along<00:01:53.460> with<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:54.149> also<00:01:54.420> has

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
along with that it also has

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.060 
along with that it also has
well<00:01:56.600> that's<00:01:56.990> another<00:01:57.470> thing<00:01:57.770> that<00:01:57.950> I<00:01:58.010> don't

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
well that's another thing that I don't

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.590 
well that's another thing that I don't
like<00:01:58.250> if<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:58.640> court<00:01:58.850> liner<00:01:59.030> keeps<00:01:59.360> falling

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
like if the court liner keeps falling

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.120 
like if the court liner keeps falling
off<00:01:59.900> it<00:02:00.650> also<00:02:00.950> has<00:02:01.370> these<00:02:02.500> blue<00:02:03.500> things<00:02:03.530> that

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
off it also has these blue things that

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.310

I'm not joking there is a boxing mode to

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.490 
I'm not joking there is a boxing mode to
do<00:02:35.120> that<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:36.160> shoulder<00:02:37.160> pads<00:02:37.400> come<00:02:38.000> off<00:02:38.500> and

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
do that the shoulder pads come off and

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.070 
do that the shoulder pads come off and
then<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.740> front<00:02:39.770> chest<00:02:40.220> plate<00:02:40.490> comes<00:02:40.790> off<00:02:41.080> and

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.810 
then the front chest plate comes off and
then<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.290> shoulder<00:02:42.620> pads<00:02:42.860> plugs<00:02:43.400> into<00:02:43.640> the

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
then the shoulder pads plugs into the

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:53.430 
then the shoulder pads plugs into the
blue<00:02:44.060> parts<00:02:44.480> to<00:02:44.750> form<00:02:45.070> giant<00:02:46.070> boxing<00:02:46.850> gloves

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.010

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
so we have a boxing mode with a football

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.250 
so we have a boxing mode with a football
helmet<00:02:57.470> oh<00:02:57.830> and<00:02:58.790> note<00:02:58.970> that<00:02:59.000> uh<00:02:59.260> nothing

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
helmet oh and note that uh nothing

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.930 
helmet oh and note that uh nothing
happens<00:03:00.769> to<00:03:00.890> this<00:03:01.100> it<00:03:01.280> just<00:03:01.310> goes<00:03:01.580> off<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:01.880> the

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
happens to this it just goes off to the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.310 
happens to this it just goes off to the
side<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.480> then<00:03:03.440> you<00:03:04.340> can<00:03:04.610> do<00:03:04.880> boxing<00:03:05.660> mode<00:03:05.900> by

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
side and then you can do boxing mode by

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.540 
side and then you can do boxing mode by
turning<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.370> torso<00:03:07.880> and<00:03:08.890> this<00:03:09.890> single

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
turning the torso and this single

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.270 
turning the torso and this single
gimmick<00:03:11.120> ruins<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:12.170> figure<00:03:12.500> I<00:03:12.680> understand

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
gimmick ruins the figure I understand

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.090 
gimmick ruins the figure I understand
why<00:03:13.459> it's<00:03:13.640> in<00:03:13.790> here<00:03:14.060> but<00:03:14.930> it<00:03:15.170> ruins<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:15.769> figure

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
why it's in here but it ruins the figure

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.080 
why it's in here but it ruins the figure
because<00:03:16.600> anytime<00:03:17.600> you<00:03:17.989> move<00:03:18.620> it<00:03:18.890> even<00:03:19.730> with

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
because anytime you move it even with

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.110 
because anytime you move it even with
the<00:03:20.420> shoulder<00:03:20.810> pads<00:03:21.050> attached<00:03:21.500> it<00:03:22.250> starts

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
the shoulder pads attached it starts

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.960 
the shoulder pads attached it starts
moving<00:03:23.300> yarns<00:03:23.930> there's<00:03:24.230> no<00:03:24.410> on/off<00:03:24.970> switch

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
moving yarns there's no on/off switch

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.539 
moving yarns there's no on/off switch
which<00:03:26.360> I<00:03:26.600> would<00:03:27.200> kill<00:03:27.830> for<00:03:29.290> but<00:03:30.290> it<00:03:31.280> just

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
which I would kill for but it just

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:39.430 
which I would kill for but it just
doesn't<00:03:32.000> work<00:03:32.239> and<00:03:34.150> here<00:03:35.150> that<00:03:37.570> just<00:03:38.570> doesn't

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
doesn't work and here that just doesn't

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.479 
doesn't work and here that just doesn't
look<00:03:39.620> good<00:03:39.680> either

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
look good either

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:46.240 
look good either
ah<00:03:41.560> so<00:03:43.030> unfortunately<00:03:44.030> this<00:03:44.750> is<00:03:44.989> a<00:03:45.250> definite

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
ah so unfortunately this is a definite

ah so unfortunately this is a definite

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
find it it's out there so I would

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.860 
find it it's out there so I would
definitely<00:04:08.150> avoid<00:04:08.930> the

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
definitely avoid the

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.500 
definitely avoid the
inch<00:04:10.050> figure<00:04:10.769> simply<00:04:11.340> for<00:04:11.730> these<00:04:12.030> punching

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
inch figure simply for these punching

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.930 
inch figure simply for these punching
gimmick<00:04:12.840> because<00:04:13.200> it<00:04:13.410> just<00:04:13.650> it<00:04:14.280> doesn't<00:04:14.790> make

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
gimmick because it just it doesn't make

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.580 
gimmick because it just it doesn't make
a<00:04:14.970> good<00:04:15.209> figure<00:04:15.480> and<00:04:15.900> it<00:04:16.049> really<00:04:16.320> kind<00:04:16.530> of

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
a good figure and it really kind of

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.340 
a good figure and it really kind of
ruins<00:04:16.980> the<00:04:17.100> figure<00:04:17.549> so<00:04:18.209> I<00:04:18.239> would<00:04:18.900> avoid<00:04:18.989> this

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
ruins the figure so I would avoid this

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.650 
ruins the figure so I would avoid this
one<00:04:19.590> and<00:04:19.970> instead<00:04:20.970> I<00:04:21.180> would<00:04:21.389> pick<00:04:21.540> up

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
one and instead I would pick up

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.390 
one and instead I would pick up
something<00:04:21.840> like<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.199> bolt<00:04:22.500> or<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:23.010> shining

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
something like the bolt or the shining

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.280 
something like the bolt or the shining
Gundam<00:04:23.729> they're<00:04:23.970> vastly<00:04:24.660> better<00:04:24.840> figures

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
Gundam they're vastly better figures

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.860 
Gundam they're vastly better figures
than<00:04:25.500> this<00:04:25.650> guy
