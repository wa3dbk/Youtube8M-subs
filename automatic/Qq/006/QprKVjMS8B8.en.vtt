00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:14.020 
tutorial on how to make blinky lights or

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:19.080 
tutorial on how to make blinky lights or
flashing<00:00:14.830> lights<00:00:15.070> with<00:00:15.670> redstone<00:00:16.270> and<00:00:18.090> you

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.090 
flashing lights with redstone and you

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.160 
flashing lights with redstone and you
have<00:00:19.210> to<00:00:19.360> start<00:00:19.690> by<00:00:20.140> making<00:00:20.680> a<00:00:21.070> 5<00:00:21.580> clock<00:00:22.170> which

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
have to start by making a 5 clock which

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.770 
have to start by making a 5 clock which
is<00:00:23.560> five<00:00:24.310> inverters<00:00:25.300> an<00:00:26.700> earring<00:00:27.700> shape<00:00:28.060> so

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:28.780 
is five inverters an earring shape so

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.170 
is five inverters an earring shape so
you<00:00:28.840> have<00:00:28.990> to<00:00:29.140> have<00:00:29.230> at<00:00:29.380> least<00:00:29.410> a<00:00:29.920> space<00:00:30.820> of<00:00:30.850> two

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
you have to have at least a space of two

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:38.760 
you have to have at least a space of two
blocks<00:00:31.450> in<00:00:31.630> between<00:00:31.960> them<00:00:34.829> okay<00:00:35.829> and<00:00:37.770> they

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
blocks in between them okay and they

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.310 
blocks in between them okay and they
have<00:00:39.130> to<00:00:39.370> be<00:00:39.400> an<00:00:39.850> earring<00:00:40.420> shape<00:00:42.329> then<00:00:43.329> you<00:00:44.020> add

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
have to be an earring shape then you add

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.740 
have to be an earring shape then you add
in<00:00:44.680> the<00:00:45.160> adjoining<00:00:45.690> connectors<00:00:48.090> no<00:00:49.090> this<00:00:49.480> one

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
in the adjoining connectors no this one

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.240 
in the adjoining connectors no this one
is<00:00:49.780> longer<00:00:50.110> because<00:00:50.559> it<00:00:50.680> has<00:00:50.800> to<00:00:50.980> travel

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
is longer because it has to travel

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.639 
is longer because it has to travel
farther<00:00:51.610> but<00:00:52.570> when<00:00:52.870> you<00:00:53.020> turn<00:00:53.260> these<00:00:53.440> into

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
farther but when you turn these into

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.729 
farther but when you turn these into
inverters<00:00:54.720> the<00:00:55.720> power<00:00:55.930> is<00:00:56.170> going<00:00:56.350> to<00:00:56.440> go<00:00:56.590> into

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
inverters the power is going to go into

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.400 
inverters the power is going to go into
here<00:00:57.100> then<00:00:57.550> to<00:00:57.790> here<00:00:58.180> then<00:00:58.450> into<00:00:59.020> this<00:00:59.140> book

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
here then to here then into this book

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.590

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
into that wire into this blog into that

into that wire into this blog into that
wire<00:01:01.809> into<00:01:02.079> this<00:01:02.230> book<00:01:02.440> into<00:01:02.739> that<00:01:02.890> one<00:01:03.100> all

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
wire into this book into that one all

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.850 
wire into this book into that one all
the<00:01:03.879> way<00:01:04.059> along<00:01:04.239> and<00:01:04.659> just<00:01:05.019> keep<00:01:05.259> going<00:01:05.649> all

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
the way along and just keep going all

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.910 
the way along and just keep going all
the<00:01:06.130> way<00:01:06.219> around<00:01:06.810> now<00:01:07.810> when<00:01:08.140> you<00:01:08.350> turn<00:01:08.590> these

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
the way around now when you turn these

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.219 
the way around now when you turn these
into<00:01:09.539> inverters<00:01:12.240> see<00:01:13.240> that<00:01:13.479> one's<00:01:13.659> positive

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
into inverters see that one's positive

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.010 
into inverters see that one's positive
right<00:01:14.469> now<00:01:14.499> that<00:01:15.100> one<00:01:15.369> is<00:01:15.399> negative<00:01:15.810> but<00:01:16.810> when

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
right now that one is negative but when

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.840 
right now that one is negative but when
it's<00:01:17.200> in<00:01:17.380> a<00:01:17.469> ring<00:01:17.709> that<00:01:18.100> one<00:01:18.340> will<00:01:18.520> end<00:01:18.700> up

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
it's in a ring that one will end up

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.669 
it's in a ring that one will end up
changing<00:01:19.119> to<00:01:19.479> negative<00:01:19.929> and<00:01:20.049> that<00:01:20.170> one<00:01:20.319> or<00:01:20.529> go

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:20.679 
changing to negative and that one or go

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:23.389 
changing to negative and that one or go
to<00:01:20.740> positive<00:01:21.459> because<00:01:21.670> it's<00:01:21.850> in<00:01:21.969> a<00:01:22.060> ring

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
to positive because it's in a ring

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.169 
to positive because it's in a ring
positive<00:01:24.399> negative<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:26.259> then<00:01:26.920> positive<00:01:27.340> but

00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:28.179 
positive negative and then positive but

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:31.340 
positive negative and then positive but
because<00:01:28.509> they're<00:01:28.749> all<00:01:28.959> inverters<00:01:29.679> they

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
because they're all inverters they

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.879 
because they're all inverters they
invert<00:01:32.350> each<00:01:32.679> other<00:01:33.119> subsequently<00:01:34.119> and<00:01:35.049> turn

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:35.889 
invert each other subsequently and turn

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:37.360 
invert each other subsequently and turn
it<00:01:36.099> into

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
it into

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.480 
it into
quashing<00:01:38.240> so<00:01:39.110> that<00:01:39.260> is<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.500> main<00:01:39.740> part<00:01:40.070> of<00:01:40.250> it

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
quashing so that is the main part of it

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.350 
quashing so that is the main part of it
and<00:01:41.620> because<00:01:42.620> redstone<00:01:43.220> can<00:01:43.400> only<00:01:43.520> travel<00:01:43.850> 15

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
and because redstone can only travel 15

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.900 
and because redstone can only travel 15
blocks<00:01:44.600> you<00:01:44.870> may<00:01:45.020> want<00:01:45.260> to<00:01:45.320> fit<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.950> inverter

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
blocks you may want to fit the inverter

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.090 
blocks you may want to fit the inverter
booster<00:01:47.630> type<00:01:47.930> thing<00:01:48.200> they<00:01:48.530> don't<00:01:48.710> worry<00:01:48.980> i

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
booster type thing they don't worry i

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:56.770 
booster type thing they don't worry i
was<00:01:49.250> still<00:01:49.400> flash<00:01:51.010> then<00:01:52.690> you<00:01:53.690> want<00:01:54.080> it<00:01:54.380> to<00:01:55.780> go

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
was still flash then you want it to go

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:05.700 
was still flash then you want it to go
up<00:01:57.080> one<00:01:59.320> so<00:02:00.320> you<00:02:00.710> will<00:02:01.010> want<00:02:01.070> to<00:02:01.700> do<00:02:02.330> this<00:02:04.180> and

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
up one so you will want to do this and

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.570 
up one so you will want to do this and
then<00:02:06.710> you<00:02:07.570> redstone<00:02:08.649> room<00:02:09.649> all<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:09.920> way<00:02:10.190> your

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
then you redstone room all the way your

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:23.140 
then you redstone room all the way your
décor<00:02:11.710> when<00:02:12.710> it<00:02:12.980> like<00:02:13.610> so<00:02:14.380> and<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:18.800> flash<00:02:22.150> if

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
décor when it like so and the flash if

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.110 
décor when it like so and the flash if
you<00:02:23.390> add<00:02:23.570> in<00:02:23.810> more<00:02:23.840> five<00:02:24.440> cloaks<00:02:24.940> they<00:02:25.940> may

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
you add in more five cloaks they may

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.900 
you add in more five cloaks they may
flash<00:02:26.510> faster<00:02:27.260> or<00:02:27.500> slower<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:30.370> so<00:02:31.370> there<00:02:31.790> you

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
flash faster or slower and so there you

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.350 
flash faster or slower and so there you
have<00:02:31.940> it<00:02:32.800> flashes<00:02:33.800> red<00:02:34.070> so<00:02:34.310> much<00:02:34.520> speed<00:02:35.090> with<00:02:35.330> a

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
have it flashes red so much speed with a

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.880 
have it flashes red so much speed with a
5-4<00:02:37.240> booster<00:02:38.770> and<00:02:39.770> a<00:02:40.250> line<00:02:40.580> of<00:02:40.910> redstone<00:02:41.890> so

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
5-4 booster and a line of redstone so

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.580 
5-4 booster and a line of redstone so
thank<00:02:43.370> you<00:02:43.520> very<00:02:43.550> much<00:02:44.030> for<00:02:44.060> watching<00:02:44.300> and<00:02:44.780> i

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
thank you very much for watching and i

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.500 
thank you very much for watching and i
hope<00:02:45.680> i<00:02:46.340> have<00:02:46.610> taught<00:02:46.850> you<00:02:47.030> well<00:02:47.500> bye
