00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.660 
strips now the way I like to do these is
I<00:01:12.229> actually<00:01:12.470> take<00:01:12.770> scissors<00:01:13.070> now<00:01:13.430> you<00:01:13.490> can

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.090 
take a knife and I take these chicken
tenders<00:01:15.770> and<00:01:16.340> I<00:01:16.429> cut<00:01:16.759> them<00:01:16.969> up<00:01:17.149> and<00:01:17.420> I<00:01:18.229> usually

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
tenders and I cut them up and I usually

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.859 
tenders and I cut them up and I usually
cut<00:01:19.369> them<00:01:19.490> in<00:01:19.549> half<00:01:19.729> okay<00:01:20.179> and<00:01:20.390> so<00:01:20.539> we<00:01:20.689> have

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
cut them in half okay and so we have

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:22.510 
cut them in half okay and so we have
them<00:01:20.990> a<00:01:21.079> little<00:01:21.109> bit<00:01:21.409> smaller<00:01:21.740> but<00:01:22.369> we'll

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
them a little bit smaller but we'll

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.010 
them a little bit smaller but we'll
simply<00:01:22.880> take<00:01:22.909> the<00:01:23.149> chicken<00:01:23.600> there

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
simply take the chicken there

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.340 
simply take the chicken there
cut<00:01:24.590> it<00:01:24.710> in<00:01:24.770> half<00:01:24.829> so<00:01:25.310> you're<00:01:25.729> going<00:01:25.850> to<00:01:25.909> have<00:01:26.090> a

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
cut it in half so you're going to have a

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.359 
cut it in half so you're going to have a
smaller<00:01:27.350> piece<00:01:27.740> here<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:28.039> really<00:01:28.219> you<00:01:28.340> can

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
smaller piece here and really you can

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.039 
smaller piece here and really you can
cut<00:01:28.670> them<00:01:28.789> into<00:01:28.880> nuggets<00:01:29.420> as<00:01:29.600> well<00:01:29.780> you<00:01:29.929> can

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
cut them into nuggets as well you can

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:31.270 
cut them into nuggets as well you can
actually<00:01:30.320> make<00:01:30.439> these<00:01:30.590> into<00:01:30.740> more<00:01:30.920> more<00:01:31.159> like

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.630 
because it's packed with protein
I<00:01:45.469> mean<00:01:45.649> plain<00:01:45.859> and<00:01:46.009> simple<00:01:46.219> it's<00:01:46.340> a<00:01:46.369> great

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
I mean plain and simple it's a great

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.190 
I mean plain and simple it's a great
source<00:01:46.939> of<00:01:47.090> protein<00:01:47.299> so<00:01:47.719> if<00:01:47.810> you're<00:01:47.899> trying<00:01:48.079> to

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
source of protein so if you're trying to

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.090 
source of protein so if you're trying to
build<00:01:48.350> muscle<00:01:48.679> burn<00:01:49.640> fat<00:01:49.999> lose<00:01:50.329> weight<00:01:50.359> also

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
build muscle burn fat lose weight also

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.709 
build muscle burn fat lose weight also
hardly<00:01:52.100> anybody<00:01:52.640> in<00:01:52.789> the<00:01:52.880> world<00:01:53.030> is<00:01:53.270> allergic

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 
hardly anybody in the world is allergic

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:55.989 
hardly anybody in the world is allergic
to<00:01:53.840> chicken<00:01:54.079> and<00:01:54.469> so<00:01:54.979> again<00:01:55.249> it's<00:01:55.429> great<00:01:55.700> for

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:55.999 
to chicken and so again it's great for

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:57.879 
to chicken and so again it's great for
for<00:01:56.509> almost<00:01:56.630> everybody<00:01:57.170> and<00:01:57.289> the<00:01:57.710> thing<00:01:57.859> that

00:01:57.879 --> 00:01:57.889 
for almost everybody and the thing that

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:59.379 
for almost everybody and the thing that
I<00:01:58.039> found<00:01:58.399> -<00:01:58.609> in<00:01:58.759> terms<00:01:58.939> of<00:01:59.090> getting<00:01:59.240> a<00:01:59.359> good

00:01:59.379 --> 00:01:59.389 
I found - in terms of getting a good

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:01.510 
I found - in terms of getting a good
source<00:01:59.719> of<00:01:59.869> protein<00:01:59.950> I'm<00:02:00.950> you<00:02:01.130> know<00:02:01.189> kids

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
source of protein I'm you know kids

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.160 
source of protein I'm you know kids
typically<00:02:01.939> also<00:02:02.270> really<00:02:02.509> like<00:02:02.659> chicken<00:02:02.899> so

typically also really like chicken so
it's<00:02:03.289> a<00:02:03.350> good<00:02:03.499> option<00:02:03.679> and<00:02:04.569> again<00:02:05.710> protein<00:02:06.710> is

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
it's a good option and again protein is

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.260 
it's a good option and again protein is
the<00:02:07.009> good<00:02:07.280> thing<00:02:07.549> that<00:02:07.880> we're<00:02:07.999> getting<00:02:08.090> here

chicken<00:02:27.590> is<00:02:27.950> that<00:02:28.489> you<00:02:28.580> know<00:02:28.670> really<00:02:28.940> the

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
chicken is that you know really the

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.789 
chicken is that you know really the
chickens<00:02:29.480> are<00:02:29.599> treated<00:02:29.900> terribly<00:02:30.650> they're

chickens are treated terribly they're

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.680 
chickens are treated terribly they're
loaded<00:02:31.159> with<00:02:31.190> hormones<00:02:31.849> they're<00:02:32.390> actually

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
loaded with hormones they're actually

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.210 
loaded with hormones they're actually
injected<00:02:33.200> with<00:02:33.319> steroids

injected with steroids

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.339 
injected with steroids
so<00:02:34.580> again<00:02:34.760> if<00:02:34.849> you<00:02:34.940> do<00:02:35.090> chicken<00:02:35.569> it's<00:02:35.750> got<00:02:36.170> to

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
so again if you do chicken it's got to

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.440 
so again if you do chicken it's got to
be<00:02:36.470> organic<00:02:36.980> chicken<00:02:37.610> and<00:02:37.730> again<00:02:38.239> if<00:02:38.360> you're

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
be organic chicken and again if you're

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
be organic chicken and again if you're
only<00:02:38.510> going<00:02:38.690> to<00:02:38.750> do<00:02:38.810> one<00:02:38.989> sort<00:02:39.200> of<00:02:39.260> food

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
only going to do one sort of food

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.740 
only going to do one sort of food
category<00:02:40.010> organically<00:02:40.700> it<00:02:40.970> should<00:02:41.360> really<00:02:41.659> be

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
category organically it should really be

heat<00:04:54.290> also<00:04:54.980> coconut<00:04:55.310> oil<00:04:55.640> is<00:04:55.820> packed<00:04:56.240> with

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
heat also coconut oil is packed with

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.440 
heat also coconut oil is packed with
something<00:04:57.980> called<00:04:58.100> medium<00:04:58.520> chain<00:04:58.760> fats<00:04:59.120> so

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
something called medium chain fats so

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.120 
something called medium chain fats so
it's<00:04:59.570> great<00:04:59.780> for<00:04:59.810> burning<00:05:00.410> fat<00:05:00.680> and<00:05:00.710> losing

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
it's great for burning fat and losing

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.690 
it's great for burning fat and losing
weight

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
weight

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.700 
weight
so<00:05:02.030> again<00:05:02.240> coconut<00:05:02.690> oil<00:05:02.870> is<00:05:02.990> my<00:05:03.200> oil<00:05:03.470> of<00:05:03.680> choice

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
so again coconut oil is my oil of choice

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.680 
so again coconut oil is my oil of choice
here<00:05:04.400> and<00:05:04.550> then<00:05:05.180> we're<00:05:05.270> going<00:05:05.360> to<00:05:05.420> add<00:05:05.540> in<00:05:05.660> some

and really this recipe is pretty quick

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.210 
and really this recipe is pretty quick
it<00:05:38.810> doesn't<00:05:39.080> take<00:05:39.230> a<00:05:39.260> long<00:05:39.530> time<00:05:39.830> again<00:05:40.040> with

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220

it doesn't take a long time again with
their<00:05:40.610> thin<00:05:40.880> strips<00:05:41.330> we<00:05:41.510> cut<00:05:41.690> them<00:05:41.810> like<00:05:42.350> we

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
their thin strips we cut them like we

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.050 
their thin strips we cut them like we
cut<00:05:42.710> them<00:05:42.830> in<00:05:42.890> half<00:05:43.070> earlier<00:05:43.490> so<00:05:43.669> again<00:05:43.910> it's

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
cut them in half earlier so again it's

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.420 
cut them in half earlier so again it's
not<00:05:44.120> going<00:05:44.210> to<00:05:44.360> take<00:05:44.570> a<00:05:44.600> real<00:05:44.870> long<00:05:45.110> time<00:05:45.430> here

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430
