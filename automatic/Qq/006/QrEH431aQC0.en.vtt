of I was doing so good then fan another
loss<00:02:43.769> so<00:02:44.769> let's<00:02:45.010> take<00:02:45.160> a<00:02:45.220> look<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:45.579> see<00:02:45.670> what

loss so let's take a look and see what

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:53.239 
loss so let's take a look and see what
happens

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:53.249 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:55.979 

so<00:02:54.249> I<00:02:54.280> chose<00:02:54.700> to<00:02:54.909> attack<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.329> space<00:02:55.569> because

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
so I chose to attack the space because

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.989 
so I chose to attack the space because
the<00:02:56.200> motors<00:02:56.469> wizards<00:02:57.040> and<00:02:57.310> expose<00:02:57.700> we're<00:02:57.939> all

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:57.999 
the motors wizards and expose we're all

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:00.839 
the motors wizards and expose we're all
in<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.239> center<00:02:58.540> so<00:02:59.530> they<00:02:59.560> can<00:03:00.159> take<00:03:00.459> out<00:03:00.670> the

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
in the center so they can take out the

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:02.550 
in the center so they can take out the
barbs<00:03:01.269> and<00:03:01.329> archers<00:03:01.659> pretty<00:03:01.900> quickly<00:03:02.170> so<00:03:02.319> I

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
barbs and archers pretty quickly so I

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.280 
barbs and archers pretty quickly so I
try<00:03:02.889> to<00:03:02.920> avoid<00:03:03.159> them<00:03:03.719> also<00:03:04.719> the<00:03:04.870> king<00:03:05.170> and

try to avoid them also the king and

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.020 
try to avoid them also the king and
queen<00:03:05.409> are<00:03:05.530> sleeping<00:03:06.099> and<00:03:06.310> they're<00:03:06.700> right

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
towers in the center I deployed the

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.500

barbarians and archers the same way as
usual<00:03:50.219> just<00:03:51.219> doesn't<00:03:51.639> make<00:03:51.699> sense<00:03:53.189> so<00:03:54.189> as<00:03:54.400> at

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
usual just doesn't make sense so as at

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:55.949 
usual just doesn't make sense so as at
this<00:03:54.699> point<00:03:55.000> we're<00:03:55.269> at<00:03:55.299> twenty-two<00:03:55.780> percent

and<00:03:56.290> we've<00:03:56.379> attacked<00:03:56.739> two<00:03:56.919> sides<00:03:57.189> that's<00:03:57.519> not

00:03:57.749 --> 00:03:57.759 
and we've attacked two sides that's not

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:00.390 
and we've attacked two sides that's not
good<00:03:58.090> because<00:03:58.439> we<00:03:59.439> should<00:03:59.620> be<00:03:59.769> at<00:03:59.919> twenty-five

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
good because we should be at twenty-five

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.969 
good because we should be at twenty-five
percent<00:04:00.629> as<00:04:01.629> we're<00:04:01.930> starting<00:04:02.349> to<00:04:02.470> attack<00:04:02.739> the

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
to have to end up using another one and

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.350 
to have to end up using another one and
there's<00:04:35.800> also<00:04:35.979> two<00:04:36.190> builder<00:04:36.669> huts<00:04:36.820> over<00:04:37.090> here

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
there's also two builder huts over here

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.700 
there's also two builder huts over here
so<00:04:37.659> I'm<00:04:37.780> going<00:04:37.930> to<00:04:37.960> take<00:04:38.110> those<00:04:38.320> out<00:04:38.500> with

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
so I'm going to take those out with

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.939 
so I'm going to take those out with
another<00:04:38.949> lightning<00:04:39.430> spell<00:04:40.800> next<00:04:41.800> how<00:04:41.889> to

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
another lightning spell next how to

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.589 
another lightning spell next how to
choose<00:04:42.219> between<00:04:42.340> the<00:04:42.729> water<00:04:43.000> and<00:04:43.120> the<00:04:43.300> builder

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:43.599 
choose between the water and the builder

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:45.959 
choose between the water and the builder
side<00:04:43.810> the<00:04:44.590> motor<00:04:44.979> actually<00:04:45.219> counts<00:04:45.699> as<00:04:45.789> more

00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:45.969 
side the motor actually counts as more

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:48.529 
side the motor actually counts as more
percent<00:04:46.389> so<00:04:46.599> I<00:04:46.630> decided<00:04:47.050> to<00:04:47.199> take<00:04:47.349> that<00:04:47.560> out

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
percent so I decided to take that out

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.969 
percent so I decided to take that out
after<00:04:49.539> i<00:04:49.810> take<00:04:50.020> out<00:04:50.169> this<00:04:50.320> mortar<00:04:50.650> we're<00:04:50.860> going

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
after i take out this mortar we're going

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:53.219 
after i take out this mortar we're going
to<00:04:51.039> be<00:04:51.130> at<00:04:51.280> forty-eight<00:04:51.699> percent<00:04:51.849> so<00:04:52.780> i<00:04:52.810> just

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
to be at forty-eight percent so i just

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:55.560 
to be at forty-eight percent so i just
need<00:04:53.440> two<00:04:53.710> more<00:04:53.860> percent<00:04:54.310> so<00:04:55.120> that's<00:04:55.360> going<00:04:55.509> to

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
need two more percent so that's going to

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.120 
need two more percent so that's going to
be<00:04:55.659> two<00:04:56.139> buildings<00:04:56.560> that<00:04:56.650> we<00:04:56.770> need<00:04:56.889> to<00:04:56.979> take

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
be two buildings that we need to take

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.870 
be two buildings that we need to take
out<00:04:58.409> all<00:04:59.409> I<00:04:59.440> got<00:04:59.710> left<00:04:59.740> is<00:05:00.099> the<00:05:00.190> heroes<00:05:00.580> and

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
out all I got left is the heroes and

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.580 
out all I got left is the heroes and
there's<00:05:01.029> still<00:05:01.240> a<00:05:01.270> dragon<00:05:01.690> out<00:05:01.779> there<00:05:02.050> so<00:05:02.469> we

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
there's still a dragon out there so we

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.590 
there's still a dragon out there so we
got<00:05:02.740> to<00:05:02.830> be<00:05:02.919> careful<00:05:02.949> of<00:05:03.490> the<00:05:03.610> dragon

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
got to be careful of the dragon

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.720 
got to be careful of the dragon
and<00:05:04.780> try<00:05:05.560> to<00:05:05.620> take<00:05:05.830> out<00:05:05.920> two<00:05:06.220> buildings<00:05:06.580> as

and try to take out two buildings as

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.210 
and try to take out two buildings as

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
fast as we can I probably should have

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.920 
fast as we can I probably should have
distracted<00:05:09.760> the<00:05:09.850> dragon<00:05:10.240> with<00:05:10.390> my<00:05:10.420> barbarian

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
distracted the dragon with my barbarian

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.640

King<00:05:11.310> but<00:05:12.310> I<00:05:12.880> actually<00:05:13.270> decided<00:05:13.540> to<00:05:13.870> use<00:05:14.140> it<00:05:14.350> to

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
King but I actually decided to use it to

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.520 
King but I actually decided to use it to
distract<00:05:15.370> the<00:05:15.490> defenses<00:05:16.060> so<00:05:16.780> my<00:05:16.990> archer<00:05:17.290> Queen

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
distract the defenses so my archer Queen

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.590 
distract the defenses so my archer Queen
didn't<00:05:17.830> get<00:05:17.950> killed<00:05:18.220> before<00:05:19.000> she<00:05:19.360> could<00:05:19.480> take

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600

didn't get killed before she could take
out<00:05:19.780> two<00:05:19.960> buildings<00:05:20.640> these<00:05:21.640> intense<00:05:22.030> moments

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:22.420 
out two buildings these intense moments

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.000 
out two buildings these intense moments
really<00:05:22.690> require<00:05:22.990> fast<00:05:23.320> thinking<00:05:23.770> and

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
really require fast thinking and

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.010 
really require fast thinking and

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
sometimes there's just not enough time

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.460 
sometimes there's just not enough time
