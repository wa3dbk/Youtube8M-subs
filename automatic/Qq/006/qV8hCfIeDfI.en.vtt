00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:02.500
 cantinflas 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.500
 with 12 asterisks remains 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.479
 cantinflas 

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:10.979
 until your little boat ride 

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:14.059
 and since we're paddling young 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:15.679
 the quiet bassi senator 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.210
 spend a summer afternoon 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.589

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:27.649

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.150

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.600
 from the tip of the feet to the tip of the beard 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.600
 what happens is that this error suddenly appeared that surely 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.630
 I do not think you'll ever get as good a view as an Americo Vespucci 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.180
 I know that sailing means driving a boat 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.270
 and that name, vespucius america 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.470
 I think I know him very well 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.440
 but I can not remember where I had previously 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.850
 It is very famous 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.340
 america vespucio was one of the greatest navigators in history 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.760
 so man is doctor fernando lugo and to know 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.890
 I will refresh your memory 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.890
 thank you thousand 451 in florence italy 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.430
 when he was very young he liked to be the stars 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.270
 first a nuance and cristian 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.750
 he studied many subjects including mathematics astronomy and cartography 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.880
 Tokyo York and a priest was his place 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.210
 America's skill in numbers led to a banking career 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.420
 eventually he moved to Seville Spain and worked for the banking company 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.420
 that was associated with the world do not have 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.149
 but in his interior his desire was to affect the opportunity he presented himself first 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.740
 Guild of 1499 was the beginning of the era of discovery 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.159
 Cristóbal Colon had already made two trips to what he thought was the 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.710
 east coast of india 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.340
 now one of the colonnades captains was going to be his own trip 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.560
 the fmi asked mexico to accompany him as a navigator myself 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.540
 I think I could also be going forward young I also know the 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.009
 stars the big thing the work goes out he was 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.649
 I'm a friend cantinflas 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.840
 ao mucho gusto 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.479
 I am an Amerigo Vespucci 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:16.899
 his name sounds to me in scene perfume 

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:20.159
 I do not know where I know him from but that does not make him 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.770
 but let me see that little machine has on its dial 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.099
 it is used to determine the position of the boat 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.259
 very interesting proposal raised 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:32.149
 no no no on the other side 

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:34.039
 now if I can navigate 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:39.539
 he only validated the biggest bear encounter the polar star that the command speech 

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:41.699
 where we were friend of mine 

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:46.229
 According to my calculations calculates assets we are in the middle of the Sahara Desert 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:50.269
 22 it's better that I have not done it before it's too late 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:57.090
 say goodbye to buying cave lands do not lose old lands before 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.850
 get to the new land the ships will be separated all headed to haiti 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.940
 coclé colón had initiated the colonization I heard led the others 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.680
 two southwest where no explorer had been titled one 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.319
 The first land he found is what is now known as 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.209
 Brazil 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.199
 he was the first white man who created that wonderful place and his fantastic 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.089
 the basic for 

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:24.809
 vespucio explored great distance along a great river that afterwards 

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:27.569
 called the Amazon but never landed yesterday 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:28.640
 pity 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.639
 I hoped to rest a little 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:36.039
 when leaving the great river of listening and went north as well 

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.779
 Haiti 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:37.869
 or Spanish 

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:39.779
 as the Spaniards called her 

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:44.599
 there the ships of month puchi were united to the other two ships of the expedition 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.379
 and what is that they have there 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.379
 boxes of food that will transport to Spain 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:55.339
 By the way the king had tired of spending on explorations and refused to 

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:58.499
 sponsor another trip that enjoys 

00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:02.379
 but fortunately the small country of Portugal was very interested in 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:03.529
 exploration 

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:08.299
 the king of portugal sent the only one I heard to map territory without 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.609
 course 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:12.929
 the lady told me if she wanted a lot 

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:16.219
 the cantinflas per cent less castilla or health 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.359
 the 222 of the crow 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.379
 this rise of 40 

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:23.890
 don juan de bourbon 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.550
 it can not be that is what Mr. Colon 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.729
 no friend 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:31.780
 which he called split leather to check the lookout ten teams 

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:35.099
 they changed like that 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:36.309
 and indeed 

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:40.439
 I heard I had put that same southern continent but on this trip in 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:44.079
 the year of 1501 drone further south along the coast 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.460
 I was hoping to make it to the end of November, chlorinating its surrounding first 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.169
 bad weather forced him to return to portugal 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:55.419
 he did not even imagine when he was about to climb 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.669
 please sr 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:00.699
 I think I'd rather be on solid ground for some time 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.000
 Nonetheless 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.070
 this trip was very important the extraordinary maps that and turn 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.290
 knife were used to prove that these were new lands in our india 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.659
 as they had supposed 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:14.919
 the world was acquiring a new face thanks to messi 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:21.339
 in 1507 a German cartographer granted a very important 1st listen to the cob 

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:22.800
 I gab these lands 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.180
 amet 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.180
 fence named the new world in his honor 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.659
 the service and no name 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:35.449
 but I think I deserve a little credit ana that you did 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.330
 Well, in a way, I think that this little friend Quique is part of 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.250
 this medical measure went out to medical 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.310
 it's time for America to leave already indicated 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.339
 that vision does not grow 

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:49.740
 apec cantinflas 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.300
 How many times will I tell you 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:53.979
 that history 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:56.979
 It can not be changed 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:59.719
 okay, but 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:02.689
 the story would be better if it were with more friends 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:03.939
 you're right
