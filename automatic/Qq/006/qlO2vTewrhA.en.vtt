gonna go ahead and get this fitted and

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.870 
gonna go ahead and get this fitted and
we've<00:01:09.060> got<00:01:09.210> some<00:01:09.450> holes<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.439> drill<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.490> slot

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
we've got some holes to drill and a slot

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.660 
we've got some holes to drill and a slot
to<00:01:12.060> cut<00:01:12.240> in<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.450> firewall<00:01:13.340> to<00:01:14.340> allow<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
to cut in the firewall to allow the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.890 
to cut in the firewall to allow the
lever<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:16.590> come<00:01:16.770> out<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.040> back<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.810> so<00:01:18.810> we're

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
lever to come out the back and so we're

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.789 
lever to come out the back and so we're
gonna<00:01:18.990> jump<00:01:19.259> on<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.500> right<00:01:19.560> now<00:01:21.799> alright

gonna jump on that right now alright
first<00:01:23.100> thing<00:01:23.250> we<00:01:23.369> do<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:24.420> this

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
first thing we do is on this

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.920 
first thing we do is on this
installation<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.560> locate<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:27.450> remove<00:01:27.780> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
installation is locate you remove the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.890 
installation is locate you remove the
pet<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.530> pad<00:01:28.740> off<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.299> pedal<00:01:30.299> assembly<00:01:30.329> and

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
pet the pad off the pedal assembly and

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.190 
pet the pad off the pedal assembly and
just<00:01:31.110> located<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:32.310> position<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.939> is

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
just located in a position that is

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.039 
just located in a position that is
comfortable<00:01:34.200> for<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.890> driver<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.509> we've<00:01:36.509> got

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
comfortable for the driver so we've got

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.249 
comfortable for the driver so we've got
that<00:01:37.229> positioned<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.070> good<00:01:38.220> spot<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:39.259> then

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
that positioned in a good spot and then

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.880 
that positioned in a good spot and then
you<00:01:40.290> just<00:01:41.030> mark<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.270> there<00:01:43.460> so<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.490> we<00:01:44.670> have<00:01:44.820> a

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
you just mark it there so that we have a

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.870 
you just mark it there so that we have a
place<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:49.100> figure<00:01:50.100> out<00:01:50.280> where<00:01:50.399> our<00:01:50.430> brackets

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
place to figure out where our brackets

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.969 
place to figure out where our brackets
video<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:52.170> bracket<00:01:52.590> goes<00:01:52.740> on<00:01:52.890> the

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
video so this bracket goes on the

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.399 
video so this bracket goes on the
outside<00:01:53.369> but<00:01:54.180> it's<00:01:54.689> going<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.869> be<00:01:54.990> used<00:01:55.200> as<00:01:55.380> a

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
outside but it's going to be used as a

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.620 
outside but it's going to be used as a
template<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:58.399> to<00:01:59.399> drill<00:01:59.850> our<00:01:59.969> holes<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.479> cut

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
template to to drill our holes and cut

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:08.949 
template to to drill our holes and cut
the<00:02:00.780> slot<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.880> the<00:02:02.930> template<00:02:03.930> along<00:02:04.380> with

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.250 

some<00:02:10.239> measurements<00:02:11.239> and<00:02:11.360> so<00:02:11.480> forth<00:02:11.720> will

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
some measurements and so forth will

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.479 
some measurements and so forth will
allow<00:02:12.470> us<00:02:12.590> to<00:02:12.709> get<00:02:12.799> it<00:02:12.920> in<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.040> correct<00:02:13.280> place

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
allow us to get it in the correct place

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.970 
allow us to get it in the correct place
so<00:02:14.000> we're<00:02:14.180> gonna<00:02:14.269> go<00:02:14.540> ahead<00:02:14.629> and<00:02:14.860> mark<00:02:15.860> the

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
so we're gonna go ahead and mark the

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.949 
so we're gonna go ahead and mark the
holes<00:02:16.159> and<00:02:16.489> get<00:02:16.939> them<00:02:17.030> drilled<00:02:17.269> and<00:02:17.510> cut<00:02:17.810> the

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
holes and get them drilled and cut the

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.899 
holes and get them drilled and cut the
slot<00:02:18.170> out<00:02:18.349> and<00:02:18.590> then<00:02:19.370> we'll<00:02:19.489> get<00:02:19.610> put<00:02:19.790> together

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:19.909 
slot out and then we'll get put together

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:24.490 
slot out and then we'll get put together
to<00:02:20.150> show<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.329> what<00:02:20.450> it<00:02:20.540> looks<00:02:20.659> like<00:02:23.379> all<00:02:24.379> right

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
we'll start by drilling a hole in each

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.539 
we'll start by drilling a hole in each
corner<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:44.000> then<00:02:44.870> use<00:02:45.590> a<00:02:45.620> body<00:02:45.859> saw<00:02:46.159> to<00:02:46.220> cut

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549
