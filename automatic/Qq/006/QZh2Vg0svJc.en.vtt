00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:07.390
 hello how about friends we are here another 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:09.519
 time in a video of how to interpret and 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.820
 how to play on the guitar good in this 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:14.090
 goya case 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.350
 to explain a little 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:20.270
 as per day 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.270
 already one day we can look at many ways 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.580
 there is a shape of your earth with your fingers 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.920
 what is important for beginners is 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.920
 watching 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.360
 you learn from the scales 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.420
 to be able to improve 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.920
 seeks to understand how it means so much 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.530
 count above play along 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.360
 top down of the person 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.490
 managing the different scales that 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.510
 exist but we have the possibility of 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.230
 paint 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.230
 with fingers 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.640
 but no 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.640
 we can do also 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:18.380
 and we have the option to use barb as well 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.159
 for other styles of pointing but that 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.159
 it gives us more speed 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.610
 and 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:50.090
 good for the first important the 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:54.880
 fingering while harder the better 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.880
 It will be the same following 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:16.910
 Y 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.910
 then also to look for the forms 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.049
 after 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.300
 but that's the important thing 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.800
 with fingers 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.780
 activity when interpreting 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.489
 different melodies just put the 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.980
 emphasis on what they want to zero in what 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.959
 they want to make people talk about 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.390
 that if they are going to be a first guitar 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.069
 puntear engage yourself if they will be going to 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.659
 be people just sing and play 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.569
 do not give so much importance to 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:08.819
 counts as long as they feel very 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.430
 comfortable in boxing and the in alicante 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:14.909
 was power is the best and there but this 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.579
 but the important thing I think is to make one 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.900
 better know how to be the best they can follow and 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.000
 giving emphasis to what he is going to give 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.549
 results as much as first vocalist 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.700
 as a guitarist vocalist as the first 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.700
 guitar 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.959
 well this has been everything I hope there 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:32.959
 liked and good 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.720
 targeted and if you want to be good 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.349
 first guitar bands that are 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.349
 being all day
