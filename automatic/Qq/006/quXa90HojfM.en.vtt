00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
middle of the night why not use radio

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.510 
middle of the night why not use radio
waves<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.780> kill<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.230> cancer<00:00:34.440> cells<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:35.430> the

waves to kill the cancer cells and the
best<00:00:35.730> thing<00:00:35.850> would<00:00:35.969> work<00:00:36.030> as<00:00:36.329> antennas<00:00:36.510> was<00:00:36.989> I

best thing would work as antennas was I

best thing would work as antennas was I
know<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.590> could<00:00:37.860> find<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.250> three<00:00:38.460> o'clock

wife Mary Ann heard the noise and found

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.170 
wife Mary Ann heard the noise and found
her<00:00:43.590> husband<00:00:43.890> inventing<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.520> radio<00:00:44.879> frequency

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
her husband inventing a radio frequency

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.740 
her husband inventing a radio frequency
generator<00:00:45.930> using<00:00:46.590> her<00:00:46.770> pie<00:00:47.070> pans<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.910> got<00:00:48.570> up

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
generator using her pie pans I got up

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.229 
generator using her pie pans I got up
immediately<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.559> thought<00:00:49.860> had<00:00:50.070> lost<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.610> here

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
immediately and thought had lost it here

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.729 
immediately and thought had lost it here
are<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.480> basics<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:52.050> John's<00:00:52.260> idea

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
are the basics of John's idea

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.709 
are the basics of John's idea
radio<00:00:53.370> waves<00:00:53.610> will<00:00:53.789> heat<00:00:54.000> certain<00:00:54.329> metals

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
radio waves will heat certain metals

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.049 
radio waves will heat certain metals
like<00:00:54.930> gold<00:00:55.160> tiny<00:00:56.160> bits<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.610> metal<00:00:56.910> are

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
like gold tiny bits of that metal are

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.090 
like gold tiny bits of that metal are
injected<00:00:57.600> into<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.840> cancer<00:00:58.260> patient<00:00:58.440> those

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
injected into a cancer patient those

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.160 
injected into a cancer patient those
nanoparticles<00:00:59.730> are<00:01:00.449> attracted<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.050> the

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
nanoparticles are attracted to the

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.080 
nanoparticles are attracted to the
abnormalities<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.280> cancer<00:01:02.640> cells<00:01:02.879> and

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
abnormalities of the cancer cells and

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.570 
abnormalities of the cancer cells and
ignore<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.809> healthy<00:01:04.170> cells<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:05.070> patient<00:01:05.489> is

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
ignore the healthy cells the patient is

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.910 
ignore the healthy cells the patient is
then<00:01:05.700> exposed<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.299> radio<00:01:06.630> waves<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.080> only<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
then exposed to radio waves and only the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.789 
then exposed to radio waves and only the
bad<00:01:08.189> cells<00:01:08.549> heat<00:01:08.790> up<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.150> die<00:01:09.619> killing<00:01:10.619> cancer

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
bad cells heat up and die killing cancer

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.920 
bad cells heat up and die killing cancer
cells<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.310> amazing<00:01:11.820> but<00:01:12.150> John<00:01:12.479> had<00:01:12.659> also

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
cells is amazing but John had also

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.780 
cells is amazing but John had also
stumbled<00:01:13.229> on<00:01:13.380> yet<00:01:13.799> another<00:01:13.979> amazing

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
stumbled on yet another amazing

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.060 
stumbled on yet another amazing
breakthrough<00:01:15.180> yeah<00:01:15.689> nothing<00:01:16.020> his<00:01:16.680> machine

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
breakthrough yeah nothing his machine

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.200 
breakthrough yeah nothing his machine
could<00:01:17.250> actually<00:01:17.460> burn

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
could actually burn

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.880 
could actually burn
salt<00:01:18.509> water

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.070 

I'm<00:01:21.520> Kansas<00:01:22.000> discovered<00:01:22.480> that<00:01:22.570> his<00:01:22.720> radio

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
I'm Kansas discovered that his radio

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.870 
I'm Kansas discovered that his radio
frequency<00:01:23.590> generator<00:01:24.040> could<00:01:24.490> release<00:01:24.850> the

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
frequency generator could release the

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.150 
frequency generator could release the
oxygen<00:01:25.300> and<00:01:25.780> hydrogen<00:01:25.930> from<00:01:26.380> saltwater<00:01:26.800> and

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
oxygen and hydrogen from saltwater and

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.120 
oxygen and hydrogen from saltwater and
create<00:01:27.760> an<00:01:27.910> incredibly<00:01:28.540> intense<00:01:28.960> flame<00:01:29.410> just

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
create an incredibly intense flame just

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.500 
create an incredibly intense flame just
like<00:01:30.280> that<00:01:30.460> that<00:01:30.730> was<00:01:30.850> inside<00:01:31.210> a<00:01:31.240> cryo

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
like that that was inside a cryo

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.600 
like that that was inside a cryo
cylinder<00:01:31.990> you<00:01:32.470> could<00:01:32.620> see<00:01:32.740> them<00:01:32.860> out<00:01:32.980> of<00:01:33.130> fire

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
cylinder you could see them out of fire

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.580 
cylinder you could see them out of fire
that<00:01:33.820> would<00:01:33.910> be<00:01:34.030> in<00:01:34.120> the<00:01:34.210> cylinder<00:01:34.570> I<00:01:35.050> can<00:01:35.470> put

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
that would be in the cylinder I can put

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.410 
that would be in the cylinder I can put
my<00:01:35.710> hand<00:01:35.950> in<00:01:36.100> here<00:01:36.280> put<00:01:36.610> your<00:01:36.640> hand<00:01:37.060> into<00:01:37.300> the

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
my hand in here put your hand into the

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.850 
my hand in here put your hand into the
beam<00:01:37.690> nothing<00:01:38.320> happens

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860
