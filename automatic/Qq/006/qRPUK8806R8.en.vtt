on two jagged rocks and I want one final
finale<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.439> test<00:00:22.680> this<00:00:22.890> thing<00:00:23.130> out<00:00:23.340> now<00:00:24.269> all<00:00:24.570> of

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.540 
finale to test this thing out now all of
these<00:00:24.900> tests<00:00:25.380> I've<00:00:25.470> done<00:00:25.740> have<00:00:26.160> basically

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
these tests I've done have basically

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.000 
these tests I've done have basically
tested<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.180> body<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.869> device<00:00:28.170> we<00:00:28.859> all

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
tested the body of the device we all

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.160 
tested the body of the device we all
know<00:00:29.160> it's<00:00:29.340> super<00:00:29.609> rugged<00:00:29.880> but<00:00:30.750> there's<00:00:30.929> one

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
know it's super rugged but there's one

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
know it's super rugged but there's one
thing<00:00:32.510> that<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.630> held<00:00:33.899> back<00:00:34.170> these<00:00:34.710> types<00:00:34.980> of

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
thing that is held back these types of

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.470 
thing that is held back these types of
devices<00:00:35.489> in<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.969> past

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
devices in the past

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.200 
devices in the past
it's<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.410> screen<00:00:37.829> while<00:00:38.760> they<00:00:38.910> make<00:00:39.090> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
it's the screen while they make the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.840 
it's the screen while they make the
outside<00:00:39.329> very<00:00:39.780> rugged<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.920> screen<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.520> just

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
outside very rugged the screen is just

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.459 
outside very rugged the screen is just
the<00:00:42.000> same<00:00:42.210> as<00:00:42.420> any<00:00:42.629> other<00:00:42.750> phone<00:00:45.289> so<00:00:46.289> this

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
the same as any other phone so this

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.220 
the same as any other phone so this
device<00:00:46.829> right<00:00:47.250> here<00:00:47.510> that<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.539> hold<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.870> my<00:00:48.899> hand

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
device right here that I hold in my hand

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.420 
device right here that I hold in my hand
I<00:00:49.500> have<00:00:49.879> run<00:00:50.879> over<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.270> with<00:00:51.510> my<00:00:51.690> car<00:00:52.430> and

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
I have run over it with my car and

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.010 
I have run over it with my car and
you're<00:00:54.090> just<00:00:54.239> gonna<00:00:54.390> have<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.570> wait<00:00:54.719> until<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
you're just gonna have to wait until the

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.330 
you're just gonna have to wait until the
end<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.199> see<00:00:55.440> what<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.649> back<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.129> looks

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
end to see what the back of it looks

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:04.009 
end to see what the back of it looks
like<00:00:56.930> I'll<00:00:57.930> see<00:00:58.620> outside<00:01:01.370> okay<00:01:02.370> let's<00:01:03.059> do<00:01:03.480> this

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
like I'll see outside okay let's do this

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.719 
like I'll see outside okay let's do this
I'm<00:01:04.640> putting<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.939> galaxy<00:01:06.570> s6<00:01:07.110> active<00:01:07.729> face

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
I'm putting the galaxy s6 active face

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.620 
I'm putting the galaxy s6 active face
down<00:01:10.250> because<00:01:11.250> honestly<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.760> thought<00:01:12.390> this

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
down because honestly I thought this

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.630 
down because honestly I thought this
would<00:01:12.869> be<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.380> safest<00:01:13.860> way<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.130> test<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
would be the safest way to test the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.600 
would be the safest way to test the
device<00:01:15.259> yes<00:01:16.259> it's<00:01:16.740> not<00:01:16.890> being<00:01:17.070> remember<00:01:17.430> on

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
device yes it's not being remember on

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:35.039 
device yes it's not being remember on
the<00:01:17.820> screen<00:01:18.150> but<00:01:19.310> let's<00:01:20.310> see<00:01:20.549> how<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.850> did

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.820 

the<00:01:36.049> suspension<00:01:36.740> is<00:01:36.860> killing<00:01:37.220> me<00:01:38.049> yep<00:01:39.080> so<00:01:39.470> it

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
the suspension is killing me yep so it

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.910 
the suspension is killing me yep so it
just<00:01:40.159> totally<00:01:40.460> annihilated<00:01:41.270> the<00:01:41.510> screen<00:01:41.920> it

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
just totally annihilated the screen it

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.590 
just totally annihilated the screen it
still<00:01:43.340> works<00:01:43.550> and<00:01:43.700> everything<00:01:44.090> and<00:01:44.360> for<00:01:44.540> the

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
still works and everything and for the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.100 
still works and everything and for the
most<00:01:44.780> part<00:01:44.900> the<00:01:45.860> glass<00:01:46.100> isn't<00:01:46.369> very<00:01:46.700> no<00:01:47.659> sharp

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
most part the glass isn't very no sharp

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.740 
most part the glass isn't very no sharp
so<00:01:48.409> it<00:01:48.470> doesn't<00:01:48.770> hurt<00:01:49.009> to<00:01:49.190> use<00:01:49.369> the<00:01:49.549> device<00:01:49.850> it

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
so it doesn't hurt to use the device it

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.920 
so it doesn't hurt to use the device it
just<00:01:51.350> did<00:01:52.070> get<00:01:52.369> cracked<00:01:53.000> all<00:01:53.270> over<00:01:53.630> there's

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
just did get cracked all over there's

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.550 
just did get cracked all over there's
not<00:01:54.080> like<00:01:54.200> a<00:01:54.229> single<00:01:54.530> spot<00:01:55.040> that<00:01:56.200> was<00:01:57.200> left

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
not like a single spot that was left

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:05.139 
not like a single spot that was left
uncracked<00:02:02.170> hey<00:02:03.170> guys<00:02:03.380> as<00:02:03.800> you<00:02:03.890> can<00:02:03.920> see<00:02:04.149> the

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
uncracked hey guys as you can see the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.480 
uncracked hey guys as you can see the
screen<00:02:05.450> on<00:02:05.570> this<00:02:05.690> device<00:02:05.960> got<00:02:06.530> really<00:02:07.070> cracked

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
screen on this device got really cracked

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.199 
screen on this device got really cracked
now<00:02:08.390> it<00:02:08.539> still<00:02:08.810> does<00:02:08.989> work<00:02:09.200> and<00:02:09.470> everything

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
now it still does work and everything

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.940 
now it still does work and everything
you<00:02:11.209> know<00:02:11.330> like<00:02:11.930> that<00:02:12.110> it's<00:02:12.440> not<00:02:12.590> rough<00:02:12.830> or

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
you know like that it's not rough or

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.770 
you know like that it's not rough or
anything<00:02:13.250> so<00:02:13.489> it's<00:02:13.640> not<00:02:14.060> cutting<00:02:14.390> my<00:02:14.450> finger

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
anything so it's not cutting my finger

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.460 
anything so it's not cutting my finger
up<00:02:15.730> but<00:02:16.730> I<00:02:16.880> just<00:02:17.209> want<00:02:17.360> to<00:02:17.420> show<00:02:17.600> that<00:02:17.900> the

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
up but I just want to show that the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.500 
up but I just want to show that the
screens<00:02:18.890> are<00:02:19.370> certainly<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.880> bottleneck<00:02:20.330> on

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
screens are certainly the bottleneck on

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.390 
screens are certainly the bottleneck on
these<00:02:20.750> types<00:02:21.110> of<00:02:21.290> rugged<00:02:21.620> devices<00:02:21.890> while<00:02:22.310> the

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
these types of rugged devices while the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.150 
these types of rugged devices while the
outside<00:02:22.820> could<00:02:23.720> be<00:02:23.870> bulletproof<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.800> screen

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
outside could be bulletproof the screen

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.020 
outside could be bulletproof the screen
still<00:02:26.030> is<00:02:26.150> brittle<00:02:26.540> as<00:02:26.750> glass<00:02:27.730> this<00:02:28.730> is<00:02:28.790> the

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
still is brittle as glass this is the

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.880 
still is brittle as glass this is the
same<00:02:29.239> glass<00:02:29.480> that's<00:02:29.750> in<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:30.140> same<00:02:30.350> Samsung

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
same glass that's in the same Samsung

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.110 
same glass that's in the same Samsung
