00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
what happens to these branches if you

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.360 
what happens to these branches if you
look<00:01:01.120> over<00:01:01.390> here<00:01:01.420> to<00:01:01.690> my<00:01:01.899> left<00:01:01.929> again<00:01:02.589> this<00:01:03.190> is

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
look over here to my left again this is

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.710 
look over here to my left again this is
a<00:01:03.399> white<00:01:03.670> pine<00:01:03.940> that<00:01:04.210> is<00:01:04.360> somehow<00:01:04.920> managed<00:01:05.920> to

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
a white pine that is somehow managed to

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.140 
a white pine that is somehow managed to
shed<00:01:07.720> most<00:01:08.170> of<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.440> ice<00:01:08.650> and<00:01:08.920> snow<00:01:09.790> that<00:01:09.910> you

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
shed most of the ice and snow that you

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.770 
shed most of the ice and snow that you
have<00:01:11.070> typically<00:01:12.070> these<00:01:12.370> want<00:01:12.760> to<00:01:12.910> be<00:01:13.180> branched

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
have typically these want to be branched

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.390 
have typically these want to be branched
low<00:01:14.020> to<00:01:14.080> the<00:01:14.290> ground<00:01:14.410> and<00:01:14.860> that's<00:01:14.980> how<00:01:15.130> you<00:01:15.220> get

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
low to the ground and that's how you get

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.250 
low to the ground and that's how you get
the<00:01:15.580> most<00:01:15.760> screening<00:01:16.360> you<00:01:16.750> see<00:01:16.930> all<00:01:17.080> those

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
the most screening you see all those

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.750 
the most screening you see all those
nice<00:01:17.440> branches<00:01:18.010> but<00:01:18.160> look<00:01:18.370> at<00:01:18.490> how<00:01:18.610> those

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
nice branches but look at how those

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.580 
nice branches but look at how those
branches<00:01:19.030> are<00:01:19.330> coming<00:01:19.630> out<00:01:19.780> they're<00:01:20.260> coming

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
branches are coming out they're coming

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.760 
branches are coming out they're coming
out<00:01:20.710> at<00:01:20.950> right<00:01:21.340> angles<00:01:21.910> to<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.510> trunk<00:01:22.960> so<00:01:23.650> if

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
out at right angles to the trunk so if

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.590 
out at right angles to the trunk so if
you<00:01:23.860> think<00:01:24.070> about<00:01:24.340> a<00:01:24.370> tree<00:01:24.730> these<00:01:24.970> get<00:01:25.210> you

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
you think about a tree these get you

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.350 
you think about a tree these get you
know<00:01:25.690> 100<00:01:26.290> 200<00:01:26.830> feet<00:01:26.980> tall<00:01:27.250> and<00:01:27.610> those

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
know 100 200 feet tall and those

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.600 
know 100 200 feet tall and those
branches<00:01:28.570> go<00:01:28.990> straight<00:01:29.320> out<00:01:29.350> think<00:01:30.220> about<00:01:30.340> how

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
branches go straight out think about how

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.610 
branches go straight out think about how
hard<00:01:30.820> it<00:01:31.000> is<00:01:31.120> to<00:01:31.300> hold<00:01:31.450> your<00:01:31.690> arms<00:01:32.140> out<00:01:32.320> like

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
hard it is to hold your arms out like

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.910 
hard it is to hold your arms out like
this<00:01:32.890> then<00:01:33.490> add<00:01:33.760> about<00:01:34.150> you<00:01:34.810> know<00:01:34.960> two<00:01:35.710> inches

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
this then add about you know two inches

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.190 
this then add about you know two inches
of<00:01:36.220> ice<00:01:36.430> and<00:01:36.880> snow<00:01:37.090> and<00:01:37.600> all<00:01:37.690> that<00:01:37.870> so<00:01:38.050> these

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
of ice and snow and all that so these

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.310 
of ice and snow and all that so these
trees<00:01:38.500> once<00:01:39.310> those<00:01:39.580> branches<00:01:39.940> get<00:01:40.480> so<00:01:40.840> loaded

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
trees once those branches get so loaded

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.510 
trees once those branches get so loaded
with<00:01:41.350> ice<00:01:41.740> and<00:01:42.040> snow

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
with ice and snow

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.720 
with ice and snow
if<00:01:42.700> one<00:01:43.570> falls<00:01:43.810> from<00:01:44.260> up<00:01:44.410> here<00:01:44.680> it<00:01:44.890> drops<00:01:45.280> and

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
if one falls from up here it drops and

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.150 
if one falls from up here it drops and
then<00:01:45.910> it's<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.180> domino<00:01:46.600> effect<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.680> depending

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
then it's the domino effect so depending

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.130 
then it's the domino effect so depending
upon<00:01:48.190> where<00:01:48.550> the<00:01:48.700> weakest<00:01:49.150> link<00:01:49.420> was<00:01:49.690> if<00:01:49.990> it

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
upon where the weakest link was if it

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.310 
upon where the weakest link was if it
was<00:01:50.170> a<00:01:50.290> weak<00:01:50.560> link<00:01:50.890> up<00:01:51.520> top<00:01:52.030> and<00:01:52.390> it<00:01:52.810> falls<00:01:53.050> on

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
was a weak link up top and it falls on

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.260 
was a weak link up top and it falls on
the<00:01:53.470> branch<00:01:53.710> below<00:01:53.950> it<00:01:54.310> then<00:01:54.610> that<00:01:54.790> one<00:01:54.970> falls

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
the branch below it then that one falls

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.930 
the branch below it then that one falls
you<00:01:55.930> get<00:01:56.080> all<00:01:56.290> that<00:01:56.500> accumulated<00:01:57.340> weight<00:01:57.670> and

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
you get all that accumulated weight and

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.970 
you get all that accumulated weight and
you<00:01:58.390> get<00:01:58.510> these<00:01:58.660> branches<00:01:59.170> that<00:01:59.770> just

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
you get these branches that just

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.340 
you get these branches that just
completely<00:02:00.370> collapse<00:02:01.060> and<00:02:01.390> I<00:02:01.840> have<00:02:01.960> a<00:02:01.990> lot<00:02:02.200> of

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
completely collapse and I have a lot of

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.960 
completely collapse and I have a lot of
clients<00:02:02.860> that<00:02:02.920> have<00:02:03.160> told<00:02:03.370> me<00:02:03.520> stories<00:02:03.940> about

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
clients that have told me stories about

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.780 
clients that have told me stories about
laying<00:02:04.510> in<00:02:04.720> their<00:02:04.840> bed<00:02:05.020> at<00:02:05.890> night<00:02:06.250> during<00:02:06.610> the

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
laying in their bed at night during the

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.400 
laying in their bed at night during the
ice<00:02:07.000> storm<00:02:07.300> and<00:02:07.480> all<00:02:07.570> of<00:02:07.690> a<00:02:07.750> sudden<00:02:07.780> hearing<00:02:08.259> a

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
ice storm and all of a sudden hearing a

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.190 
ice storm and all of a sudden hearing a
crack<00:02:08.739> and<00:02:09.160> then<00:02:09.970> crack<00:02:10.479> crack<00:02:10.840> crack<00:02:11.170> crack

crack and then crack crack crack crack

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.190 
crack and then crack crack crack crack
and<00:02:11.680> they<00:02:11.739> go<00:02:11.890> out<00:02:12.069> and<00:02:12.310> they're<00:02:12.430> white<00:02:12.640> pines

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
and they go out and they're white pines

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.840 
and they go out and they're white pines
look<00:02:14.200> like<00:02:14.380> a<00:02:14.410> telephone<00:02:14.800> pole<00:02:15.220> with<00:02:15.430> all<00:02:15.640> the

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
look like a telephone pole with all the

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.720 
look like a telephone pole with all the
broken<00:02:16.240> branches<00:02:16.690> down<00:02:16.900> here<00:02:17.260> so<00:02:17.950> that

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
broken branches down here so that

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.550 
broken branches down here so that
has<00:02:18.849> been<00:02:19.090> a<00:02:19.120> concern<00:02:19.540> over<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:19.930> past<00:02:20.110> 15<00:02:20.530> or

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
has been a concern over the past 15 or

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.920 
has been a concern over the past 15 or
20<00:02:20.890> years<00:02:21.040> because<00:02:21.190> of<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:22.180> numerous<00:02:22.720> ice

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
20 years because of the the numerous ice

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.050 
20 years because of the the numerous ice
storms<00:02:23.290> that<00:02:23.440> we've<00:02:23.620> had<00:02:23.860> so<00:02:24.580> if<00:02:24.670> you<00:02:24.790> plan<00:02:25.030> a

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
storms that we've had so if you plan a

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.479 
storms that we've had so if you plan a
white<00:02:25.390> pine<00:02:25.720> be<00:02:26.560> aware<00:02:26.830> that<00:02:26.890> when<00:02:27.190> they<00:02:27.310> get

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
white pine be aware that when they get

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.820 
white pine be aware that when they get
to<00:02:27.700> this<00:02:27.879> size<00:02:28.150> eventually<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:29.080> may<00:02:29.260> have<00:02:29.590> to

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
to this size eventually you may have to

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.339 
to this size eventually you may have to
do<00:02:29.980> some<00:02:30.250> pruning<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:31.629> that's<00:02:31.870> why<00:02:32.049> they<00:02:32.200> look

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
do some pruning and that's why they look

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.890 
do some pruning and that's why they look
like<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.560> naughty<00:02:33.209> telephone<00:02:34.209> pole<00:02:34.480> right<00:02:34.690> now

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
like a naughty telephone pole right now

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.380 
like a naughty telephone pole right now
but<00:02:35.560> it<00:02:35.680> is<00:02:35.830> a<00:02:35.860> great<00:02:36.250> evergreen<00:02:36.940> tree<00:02:37.209> when

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
but it is a great evergreen tree when

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.559 
but it is a great evergreen tree when
they're<00:02:37.540> young<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:40.180> don't<00:02:40.360> usually

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
they're young and and you don't usually

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.420 
they're young and and you don't usually
have<00:02:40.900> an<00:02:41.049> ice<00:02:41.230> problem<00:02:41.709> with<00:02:41.860> them<00:02:42.010> until<00:02:42.280> they

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
have an ice problem with them until they

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.509 
have an ice problem with them until they
get<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:42.879> probably<00:02:43.299> that<00:02:43.599> size<00:02:43.930> which<00:02:44.530> that<00:02:45.310> one

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
get to probably that size which that one

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.520 
get to probably that size which that one
was<00:02:45.760> probably<00:02:45.970> a<00:02:46.329> five<00:02:46.660> to<00:02:46.840> six<00:02:47.049> foot<00:02:47.319> tall

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
was probably a five to six foot tall

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.020 
was probably a five to six foot tall
pine<00:02:47.920> tree<00:02:48.340> maybe<00:02:49.470> twenty<00:02:50.470> years<00:02:50.739> ago<00:02:51.040> and<00:02:51.340> the

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
pine tree maybe twenty years ago and the

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.690 
pine tree maybe twenty years ago and the
way<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.209> tell<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.660> age<00:02:52.690> of<00:02:53.110> a<00:02:53.230> pine<00:02:53.500> tree<00:02:53.530> if<00:02:54.129> we

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
way to tell the age of a pine tree if we

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.610 
way to tell the age of a pine tree if we
had<00:02:54.819> a<00:02:54.849> small<00:02:55.239> one<00:02:55.480> I<00:02:55.510> could<00:02:55.780> show<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.200> young

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
had a small one I could show the young

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.559 
had a small one I could show the young
guys<00:02:56.829> here<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:57.280> you<00:02:57.370> could<00:02:57.489> watch<00:02:57.700> them<00:02:57.940> grow

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
guys here and you could watch them grow

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.789 
guys here and you could watch them grow
but<00:02:58.950> typically<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:01.480> pine<00:03:01.750> sends<00:03:02.319> up<00:03:02.440> a<00:03:02.560> bud

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
but typically the pine sends up a bud

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.550 
but typically the pine sends up a bud
and<00:03:03.280> each<00:03:04.030> year<00:03:04.540> you<00:03:04.780> get<00:03:04.959> a<00:03:05.019> certain<00:03:05.500> amount

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
and each year you get a certain amount

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.460 
and each year you get a certain amount
of<00:03:05.980> growth<00:03:06.310> on<00:03:06.609> the<00:03:06.849> bud<00:03:07.030> so<00:03:07.810> if<00:03:07.959> you<00:03:08.079> can<00:03:08.230> look

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
of growth on the bud so if you can look

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.330 
of growth on the bud so if you can look
at<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.769> the<00:03:08.879> the<00:03:09.879> number<00:03:10.120> of<00:03:10.950> like<00:03:11.950> here<00:03:12.160> was<00:03:12.310> a

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
at the the the number of like here was a

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.690 
at the the the number of like here was a
ring<00:03:12.760> of<00:03:13.000> branches<00:03:13.959> here<00:03:14.170> was<00:03:14.290> a<00:03:14.319> ring<00:03:14.620> he<00:03:15.549> was

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
ring of branches here was a ring he was

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.460 
ring of branches here was a ring he was

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
isn't as a year of growth so the only

isn't as a year of growth so the only
thing<00:03:25.750> you<00:03:25.840> can't<00:03:26.079> tell<00:03:26.319> us<00:03:26.440> how<00:03:26.590> many<00:03:26.769> years

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
thing you can't tell us how many years

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.940 
thing you can't tell us how many years
it<00:03:27.280> was<00:03:27.489> down<00:03:27.819> here<00:03:28.419> but<00:03:29.230> you<00:03:29.440> can<00:03:29.590> start<00:03:29.829> to

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
it was down here but you can start to

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.870 
it was down here but you can start to
say<00:03:30.130> ok<00:03:30.370> there's<00:03:30.609> 1<00:03:30.880> 2<00:03:31.299> 3<00:03:31.720> 4<00:03:32.230> 5<00:03:32.620> 6<00:03:33.069> 7<00:03:33.459> 8<00:03:33.760> 9<00:03:34.239> 10<00:03:34.989> 11

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
say ok there's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.909 
say ok there's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
11<00:03:36.880> years<00:03:37.599> of<00:03:37.780> growth<00:03:37.989> got<00:03:38.290> it<00:03:38.440> up<00:03:38.560> to<00:03:38.590> that

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:38.919 
11 years of growth got it up to that

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:41.280 
11 years of growth got it up to that
point<00:03:39.220> and<00:03:40.209> then<00:03:40.359> you<00:03:40.389> could<00:03:40.599> keep<00:03:40.750> going<00:03:40.810> and

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
point and then you could keep going and

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.170 
point and then you could keep going and
counting<00:03:41.799> but<00:03:41.950> it's<00:03:42.340> really<00:03:42.579> fun<00:03:42.790> to<00:03:42.819> do<00:03:43.030> that

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
counting but it's really fun to do that

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.599 
counting but it's really fun to do that
on<00:03:43.299> a<00:03:43.329> small<00:03:43.720> tree<00:03:44.079> because<00:03:44.919> a<00:03:44.950> small<00:03:45.250> one<00:03:45.430> this

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
on a small tree because a small one this

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.270 
on a small tree because a small one this
might<00:03:45.880> be<00:03:46.060> 3<00:03:46.359> or<00:03:46.389> 4<00:03:46.660> years<00:03:47.079> but<00:03:47.799> then<00:03:48.010> as<00:03:48.160> they

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
might be 3 or 4 years but then as they

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.849 
might be 3 or 4 years but then as they
start<00:03:48.340> to<00:03:48.609> grow<00:03:48.880> that<00:03:49.120> I<00:03:49.329> have<00:03:49.720> used<00:03:49.900> on<00:03:50.470> a<00:03:50.530> pine

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
start to grow that I have used on a pine

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.339 
start to grow that I have used on a pine
tree<00:03:50.889> when<00:03:51.280> that<00:03:51.400> buddy<00:03:51.669> long<00:03:52.060> gates<00:03:52.359> because

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
tree when that buddy long gates because

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.080 
tree when that buddy long gates because
sometimes<00:03:53.829> it'll<00:03:54.099> grow<00:03:54.280> this<00:03:54.579> much<00:03:54.819> in<00:03:54.970> a<00:03:55.060> year

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
sometimes it'll grow this much in a year

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.240 
sometimes it'll grow this much in a year
but<00:03:55.959> you<00:03:56.109> won't<00:03:56.260> have<00:03:56.410> any<00:03:56.590> branches<00:03:57.099> you<00:03:57.160> have

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
but you won't have any branches you have

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.559 
but you won't have any branches you have
branches<00:03:57.639> here<00:03:57.849> and<00:03:57.940> then<00:03:58.060> you<00:03:58.120> have<00:03:58.150> branches

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
branches here and then you have branches

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.330 
branches here and then you have branches
up<00:03:58.690> here<00:03:58.870> that's<00:03:59.049> just<00:03:59.260> typical<00:03:59.410> of<00:03:59.889> the

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
up here that's just typical of the

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.979 
up here that's just typical of the
species<00:04:00.549> but<00:04:00.880> that's<00:04:01.030> one<00:04:01.299> year's<00:04:01.629> worth<00:04:01.690> of

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
species but that's one year's worth of

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.190 
species but that's one year's worth of
growth<00:04:02.819> so<00:04:03.819> you<00:04:04.480> can<00:04:04.599> get<00:04:04.720> kind<00:04:04.840> of<00:04:04.989> an<00:04:05.109> idea

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
growth so you can get kind of an idea

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.289 
growth so you can get kind of an idea
and<00:04:05.530> then<00:04:05.620> eventually<00:04:05.980> they<00:04:06.489> get<00:04:06.669> smaller<00:04:07.030> and

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
and then eventually they get smaller and

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.150 
and then eventually they get smaller and
smaller<00:04:07.359> growth<00:04:08.349> when<00:04:08.590> they<00:04:08.680> get<00:04:08.829> up<00:04:08.950> to<00:04:08.980> the

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
smaller growth when they get up to the

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.940 
smaller growth when they get up to the
top<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.639> tight<00:04:09.940> the<00:04:10.450> top<00:04:10.930> but<00:04:11.709> then<00:04:11.829> you'll

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
top the tight the top but then you'll

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.800 
top the tight the top but then you'll
get<00:04:12.040> the<00:04:12.160> growth<00:04:12.340> on<00:04:12.549> the<00:04:12.700> on<00:04:13.180> the<00:04:13.660> outer

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
get the growth on the on the outer

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:20.159 
get the growth on the on the outer
branches<00:04:14.470> so

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.559 

well<00:04:20.799> as<00:04:21.159> long<00:04:21.549> as<00:04:21.729> it's<00:04:21.879> got<00:04:21.999> a<00:04:22.060> good<00:04:22.360> strong

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:22.569 
well as long as it's got a good strong

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:25.020 
well as long as it's got a good strong
root<00:04:23.169> system<00:04:23.199> it<00:04:23.889> really<00:04:24.249> shouldn't<00:04:24.729> make<00:04:24.969> a

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
root system it really shouldn't make a

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.939 
root system it really shouldn't make a
difference<00:04:25.150> unless<00:04:25.900> for<00:04:26.349> some<00:04:26.379> reason<00:04:26.560> the

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:26.949 
difference unless for some reason the

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:29.129 
difference unless for some reason the
wind<00:04:27.189> comes<00:04:28.060> up<00:04:28.270> and<00:04:28.479> picks<00:04:28.689> it<00:04:28.840> up<00:04:28.930> and

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
wind comes up and picks it up and

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.480 
wind comes up and picks it up and
there's<00:04:29.289> not<00:04:29.409> you<00:04:29.770> know<00:04:29.800> because<00:04:30.099> the<00:04:30.279> the

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
there's not you know because the the

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.489 
there's not you know because the the
branch<00:04:30.729> is<00:04:30.939> actually<00:04:31.090> act<00:04:31.449> as<00:04:31.629> a<00:04:31.689> baffle<00:04:32.289> to

00:04:32.489 --> 00:04:32.499 
branch is actually act as a baffle to

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:34.379 
branch is actually act as a baffle to
kind<00:04:33.129> of<00:04:33.189> break<00:04:33.400> up<00:04:33.430> a<00:04:33.669> lot<00:04:33.819> of<00:04:33.849> wind<00:04:34.120> so<00:04:34.240> that

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
kind of break up a lot of wind so that

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:35.790 
kind of break up a lot of wind so that
would<00:04:34.539> probably<00:04:34.840> be<00:04:34.930> the<00:04:35.050> biggest<00:04:35.169> concern<00:04:35.469> is

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
would probably be the biggest concern is

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.920 
would probably be the biggest concern is
if<00:04:35.919> you<00:04:36.039> get<00:04:36.219> some<00:04:36.430> kind<00:04:36.699> of<00:04:36.759> big<00:04:37.300> uplifting

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
if you get some kind of big uplifting

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.869 
if you get some kind of big uplifting
wind<00:04:38.169> that<00:04:38.349> just<00:04:38.529> goes<00:04:38.650> right<00:04:38.949> to<00:04:39.219> that<00:04:39.639> thick

00:04:39.869 --> 00:04:39.879 
wind that just goes right to that thick

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:42.059 
wind that just goes right to that thick
part<00:04:40.180> and<00:04:40.419> and<00:04:40.599> topples<00:04:41.379> it<00:04:41.529> but<00:04:41.710> they're

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:42.069 
part and and topples it but they're

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:44.399 
part and and topples it but they're
pretty<00:04:42.279> strong<00:04:42.729> trees<00:04:43.180> even<00:04:43.360> though<00:04:43.659> it<00:04:43.930> is<00:04:44.379> a

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:44.409 
pretty strong trees even though it is a

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:46.980 
pretty strong trees even though it is a
softwood<00:04:45.370> um<00:04:45.669> this<00:04:46.210> is<00:04:46.360> the<00:04:46.479> pine<00:04:46.689> that<00:04:46.900> you

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
softwood um this is the pine that you

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.739 
softwood um this is the pine that you
get<00:04:47.169> a<00:04:47.199> lot<00:04:47.439> of<00:04:47.650> a<00:04:48.129> lot<00:04:48.909> of<00:04:48.939> your<00:04:49.090> wood<00:04:49.300> products

00:04:49.739 --> 00:04:49.749 
get a lot of a lot of your wood products

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:51.899 
get a lot of a lot of your wood products
from<00:04:50.069> but<00:04:51.069> there's<00:04:51.310> a<00:04:51.370> lot<00:04:51.520> of<00:04:51.639> different

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:51.909 
from but there's a lot of different

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:53.129 
from but there's a lot of different
kinds<00:04:52.150> of<00:04:52.210> pines<00:04:52.419> but<00:04:52.659> this<00:04:52.779> is<00:04:52.930> the<00:04:53.020> one

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
kinds of pines but this is the one

00:04:53.139 --> 00:05:03.240 
kinds of pines but this is the one
that's<00:04:53.259> native<00:04:53.469> to<00:04:53.620> to<00:04:54.219> Kentucky<00:05:02.219> typically<00:05:03.219> I

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
that's native to to Kentucky typically I

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.920 
that's native to to Kentucky typically I
mean<00:05:03.550> you're<00:05:03.759> gonna<00:05:03.879> be<00:05:03.969> having<00:05:04.330> the<00:05:04.689> same

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
mean you're gonna be having the same

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.839 
mean you're gonna be having the same
type<00:05:05.289> of<00:05:05.319> growth<00:05:05.770> on<00:05:06.099> the<00:05:06.400> ends<00:05:06.669> of<00:05:06.759> the

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:06.849 
type of growth on the ends of the

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:08.550 
type of growth on the ends of the
branches<00:05:07.060> as<00:05:07.419> you<00:05:07.840> are<00:05:07.960> on<00:05:08.080> the<00:05:08.169> ends<00:05:08.409> of<00:05:08.500> the

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
branches as you are on the ends of the

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.749 
branches as you are on the ends of the
roots<00:05:08.770> so<00:05:08.919> those<00:05:09.069> roots<00:05:09.310> are<00:05:09.430> just<00:05:09.639> gonna

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 
roots so those roots are just gonna

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:13.350 
roots so those roots are just gonna
continue<00:05:10.150> to<00:05:10.360> spread<00:05:11.259> way<00:05:12.099> out<00:05:12.520> beyond<00:05:13.060> they

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
continue to spread way out beyond they

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.360 
continue to spread way out beyond they
used<00:05:13.539> to<00:05:13.689> say<00:05:13.900> just<00:05:14.139> the<00:05:14.289> drip<00:05:14.560> line<00:05:14.800> of<00:05:14.830> a<00:05:15.069> tree

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
used to say just the drip line of a tree

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.480 
used to say just the drip line of a tree
but<00:05:16.060> like<00:05:16.210> I'm<00:05:16.449> standing<00:05:16.960> in<00:05:17.110> the<00:05:17.199> drip<00:05:17.409> line

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
but like I'm standing in the drip line

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.129 
but like I'm standing in the drip line
so<00:05:18.490> you<00:05:18.550> know<00:05:19.029> that<00:05:19.270> those<00:05:19.419> roots<00:05:19.629> have<00:05:19.870> to<00:05:20.050> be

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.139 
so you know that those roots have to be

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:22.170 
so you know that those roots have to be
going<00:05:20.439> way<00:05:20.680> out<00:05:20.889> further<00:05:21.219> than<00:05:21.580> that<00:05:21.610> and<00:05:21.939> they

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
going way out further than that and they

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.719 
going way out further than that and they
don't<00:05:22.389> necessarily<00:05:22.629> go<00:05:22.990> very<00:05:23.199> deep<00:05:23.550> most<00:05:24.550> of

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
don't necessarily go very deep most of

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:26.579 
don't necessarily go very deep most of
your<00:05:24.879> trees<00:05:25.180> even<00:05:25.629> your<00:05:25.750> big<00:05:25.930> Oaks<00:05:26.139> and<00:05:26.349> things

00:05:26.579 --> 00:05:26.589 
your trees even your big Oaks and things

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:29.100 
your trees even your big Oaks and things
the<00:05:26.770> roots<00:05:26.979> are<00:05:27.159> within<00:05:27.339> the<00:05:27.610> top<00:05:27.810> 18<00:05:28.810> inches

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
the roots are within the top 18 inches

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.749 
the roots are within the top 18 inches
of<00:05:29.289> the<00:05:29.379> ground<00:05:29.650> it's<00:05:29.919> not<00:05:30.099> like<00:05:30.310> these<00:05:30.490> roots

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:30.759 
of the ground it's not like these roots

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:33.719
