00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.350
 hands clapped and off we go and 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.170
 Welcome to a new one 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.960
 whiskey tasting with rainer andwhich 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:30.150
 Thomas Thiemeyer today on the plan 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.279
 bit from the usa yes it is 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.920
 be good again but now that I am 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.809
 has tested some singles with thomas 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.910
 I also gave them all very well 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.530
 happy to be happy now but also on it 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.520
 once again a good citizen 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.660
 present 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.269
 It is a whiskey from the famous of the 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.920
 laubacher trace we already have biskys 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.440
 Pre-ordered from this the scenery and 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.489
 I think that's not the jersey 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.710
 you can not do anything wrong 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:01.050
 wants to cook 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:08.030
 This time we have a silver mtg 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.030
 and show you this is what he looks like 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.250
 a beautiful set up nicely compact the 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.120
 have a nice color when you look at yourself 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.240
 take a look 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.920
 until quite dark almost bit 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.720
 what about cherry, that's what you have to say 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.520
 American Bergs at all 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.370
 American whiskeys are not allowed 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.840
 be asked and not filtered 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.810
 but are actually like this 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.310
 natural from the barrel out here 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.290
 Unfortunately, there is no age indication 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.770
 I care to say how many 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.120
 year old has already on the hump 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.710
 someone else already would have this 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.750
 that's not clear that's something 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.910
 I would still have to say 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.380
 say 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.970
 Let's start directly by 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.520
 restrictive offer 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.180
 We all know what it's about and there 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:00.399
 we do not need a nice sound many 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:05.360
 words to look at you said the tower 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:07.550
 I have to say that the lyrics are easy too 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.720
 Head up and let us take a look 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.590
 thomas vollert amber do so very much 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.830
 nice color 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.989
 so I guess now alone of 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.980
 the optics ago I would say that has 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.660
 at least 15 years 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.549
 so I will at least seven 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.170
 probably rather meet there 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:30.230
 many other great whiskeys too 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.010
 this destillerie buffalo trace thinks 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.690
 the dazzle 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:39.170
 There are really great whiskeys there 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.120
 famous shot of jean spies tech 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.280
 Hide exactly then there's no 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.750
 apart from 300 race there is the 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.070
 the whiskey year 2012 planned 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.440
 and they have some of them all 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.660
 makes some but really great whiskeys 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.980
 All good, all fantastically already gone 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.400
 I still shed times direction 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.800
 different direction is there 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.540
 really shoots a bunch of flavors 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.990
 I love the one against that 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.080
 exchanges 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:09.080
 yes i am usually always very 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.290
 Carefully what the alcohol content 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.120
 affects here are since 45.4 percent 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.750
 but I do not think so 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:22.100
 connect 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:24.550
 that would be a shame because what I think he 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.410
 I have a lot of scents I smell 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:31.670
 Everything about fruit and flowers 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:34.520
 yes, cherry cherry is cherry too 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.110
 kesha is in there of course yes cherry 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.300
 is of course as usual with this 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.130
 Whiskeys also whatsoever these panels 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.310
 strong vanilla aroma from the wood 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.080
 comes as may establish the on 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.480
 is brought and thus the know the 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.180
 extracts and removes bitterness 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.850
 so caramel taste however 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.900
 I see his place too 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:59.270
 beautiful is exactly when they streak 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.640
 which is always a good sign and he 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.900
 is wonderful 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.070
 then I would say try it 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.070
 market problems 0 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.040
 So the first impression is confirmed 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.300
 this is still everything was amazing 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.919
 always a multiple again 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.850
 I was negotiating incredibly 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:30.520
 incredible blumegg little promises and 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.410
 I deserve this very strong 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.360
 taste of person bit candied 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.280
 cherries are as he is a fresh one 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.810
 cherries not fresh from the tree but 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.820
 More like that one on the cake 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.340
 or somehow in sweets with 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.200
 in there are more so but he has too 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.880
 really a sweet that is not 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.710
 probably the raman will taste it 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.950
 i think for women this whiskey is 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.169
 before it is appropriated because he is beautiful mild 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.400
 is pretty soft and sweeter and some 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.510
 Men will probably consider him too 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.090
 sweet find 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.590
 I think it's just right 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.360
 more things are not going be, I say 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.790
 Personally, the trigger was at that time 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.740
 already left or really direction 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.389
 this this burned what he has that 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.419
 that could be almost too much for some 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:12.889
 So will be a designated scotch 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:14.870
 For example, wearers will be here 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:18.100
 probably already limits to their the 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:20.390
 The factory should therefore hands away 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.430
 definitely he does not cook anything is yes 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.260
 nothing hard smoky or racy 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.890
 nothing spicy but everything 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.000
 about everything because I flowery everything as 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.200
 if you take his girlfriend to the 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.900
 whiskey persuade his wife again 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:37.520
 Give us a short télé that we can 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:40.340
 try mattel multitouch george w 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.660
 He is still fighting, but now 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.010
 that's something special 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.280
 that must also according to the 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:48.169
 This will be a highlight and for 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.479
 the tenth follow or somehow a 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.190
 highlight of our swiss ski clubs though 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:55.490
 that is definitely one 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:57.350
 Great candidate of it's people 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.330
 American whiskeys like the citizens 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.610
 like the whiskeys like a very clear one 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.830
 well and in that sense I would too 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:11.729
 ever write the review 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:14.939
 I would go as always 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:26.669
 We are rating from 0 to 100 

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:30.090
 Score from the beginning is 91 for this 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:31.919
 really good and I 90 percent there 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.930
 we are very close together and me 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:36.690
 think the whiskey absolutely deserves it 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.349
 then I would say for today we say 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.979
 Goodbye 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:42.270
 as a protected thank-you to look up 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:44.780
 and then until the next time and until 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.780
 next time
