00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.500
 good for the project he presented here 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:08.760
 you can 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.460
 the construction of a robot clamp on 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.760
 another video explain another model is 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.529
 different because the joints of the 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.490
 clamp is accommodated with screws that stone 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.720
 of wood 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.939
 and it's the same, everyone works 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.830
 for the pizza is but this one takes 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:30.009
 others we have to know what is the 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.840
 doll in this project carry two 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.059
 degrees of freedom would be the heart is 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.550
 of given level that is the clamp and other 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:39.610
 degree what the doll would lack me 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.500
 to make a robot arm other two other 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.720
 zero that were the elbow and another of the 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.370
 shoulder and I would have a 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.370
 in full robotic fat 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.360
 so 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.410
 as I have done the right arm a 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.920
 position and plane 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:04.280
 as you see simply a series of 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.140
 pieces of which it is built and 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.760
 found it went out like I do all my 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.820
 4 mm plywood projects 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.100
 and cut you know of marquetry not 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.640
 the zetas 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:20.010
 let's ride here 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.100
 and asked 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.780
 in fact a structure and in this 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.310
 occasion we will use another element 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.579
 new but what 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.189
 the me here we can get it from what 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.320
 michu of water and any element 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.680
 we can find many elements 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.680
 yeites 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.950
 here what I have done 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:49.330
 for a niche and as you see here what 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.100
 are the potentiometers 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.380
 the x axis 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.409
 as we can see for the x axis and the axis 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.420
 and choose 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.850
 then all the potentiometers then 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.579
 each one goes 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.679
 activated to control conserve 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.619
 then with a potentiometer I'm going to 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.330
 say I'm going to control the movement of 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.660
 the pizza and with our the movement of 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.000
 the doll 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.680
 everything is controlled good not always 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.079
 nothing placard and no 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.819
 I have fed it what it is I do not observe 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:26.640
 at 5 volts for power supply 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:30.260
 external and the arduino board its cable 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.260
 he has also violated apart 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.050
 well the scheme of the program is very 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.590
 You can also find it simple 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.020
 on the web and all this as always good 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.459
 because with the book he has helped me with the 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.340
 robot construction book for 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.870
 editorial aficionado work in 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.690
 succession 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.510
 they experiment experimenting with tweezers 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.819
 robotic body you have all the data 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.810
 needed how to make robotic pizzas 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:01.560
 as sacks set up and how to use 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:05.519
 toys to make robotic tweezers or 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.560
 elements that we can find in 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.720
 hardware stores or stores like this 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.050
 how to connect it to a servo to do 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.790
 a clamp breaks 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.600
 Well, I'll put it in 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.470
 operation for 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.580
 you can not 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.580
 feeding 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.140
 automatically already 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.020
 I can see 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.020
 well such 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.879
 and I can not act on this 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.879
 He says 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.390
 on the skin of the wrist so that 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.390
 OK 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:06.019
 the program 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.019
 only new 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.720
 and control because I could control the 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.720
 complete robotic arm 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:21.030
 we have used you as a means to 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:25.650
 elbow and another for the wrist and so with 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:28.270
 four deer in your arms and put other 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.169
 applications to this project 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.169
 but little
