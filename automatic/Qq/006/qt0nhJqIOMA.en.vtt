gauges<00:02:45.710> because<00:02:46.190> of<00:02:46.340> course<00:02:46.550> this<00:02:46.820> is<00:02:47.060> running

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
gauges because of course this is running

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.010 
gauges because of course this is running
off<00:02:47.540> your<00:02:48.380> network<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.750> if<00:02:50.750> you<00:02:50.900> are

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
off your network and if you are

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.050 
off your network and if you are
downloading<00:02:52.510> then<00:02:54.550> it's<00:02:55.550> going<00:02:55.730> to<00:02:55.820> slow<00:02:56.000> down

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
downloading then it's going to slow down

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.690 
downloading then it's going to slow down
your<00:02:56.330> speed<00:02:56.540> a<00:02:56.570> bit<00:02:57.130> get<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.250> flaps<00:02:58.490> up

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
your speed a bit get the flaps up

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.880 
your speed a bit get the flaps up
because<00:02:58.940> now<00:02:59.120> we're<00:02:59.360> it<00:02:59.540> by<00:03:00.350> the<00:03:00.410> web<00:03:00.620> speed

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
because now we're it by the web speed

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:12.240 
because now we're it by the web speed
and<00:03:01.870> marked<00:03:05.980> BNF

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.850 

and<00:03:12.430> we're<00:03:13.060> climbing<00:03:13.360> out<00:03:13.480> this<00:03:14.260> is<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:14.560> stop

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
and we're climbing out this is the stop

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.810 
and we're climbing out this is the stop
for<00:03:15.160> departure<00:03:15.550> and<00:03:15.790> Las<00:03:16.330> Vegas<00:03:17.640> zoom<00:03:18.640> out<00:03:18.760> a

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
for departure and Las Vegas zoom out a

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.360 
for departure and Las Vegas zoom out a
little<00:03:18.910> bit<00:03:19.150> more<00:03:19.390> now<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:22.480> there<00:03:23.140> you<00:03:23.260> go

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
little bit more now and there you go

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:31.740 
little bit more now and there you go
turn<00:03:26.040> lemon<00:03:27.040> out

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.440 

and<00:03:32.350> really<00:03:32.740> really<00:03:32.980> smooth<00:03:33.220> in<00:03:33.490> once<00:03:34.150> again<00:03:34.420> I

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
and really really smooth in once again I

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.280 
and really really smooth in once again I
can<00:03:34.810> still<00:03:35.800> do<00:03:36.010> all<00:03:36.070> this<00:03:36.810> well<00:03:37.810> this<00:03:38.020> is<00:03:38.140> all

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
can still do all this well this is all

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.460 
can still do all this well this is all
happening<00:03:38.440> doesn't<00:03:39.130> affect<00:03:39.610> the<00:03:39.760> gauge

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
happening doesn't affect the gauge

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.490 
happening doesn't affect the gauge
whatsoever<00:03:41.490> everything<00:03:42.490> stays<00:03:42.760> the<00:03:42.820> same<00:03:43.500> no

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
whatsoever everything stays the same no

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:52.160 
whatsoever everything stays the same no
lag<00:03:44.820> no<00:03:45.820> nothing

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.890 

and<00:03:52.260> we're<00:03:53.130> still<00:03:54.030> climbing<00:03:54.209> nicely<00:03:54.720> through

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
and we're still climbing nicely through

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.270 
and we're still climbing nicely through
the<00:03:54.990> clouds<00:03:55.290> what's<00:03:55.590> our<00:03:55.740> performance

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
the clouds what's our performance

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.550 
the clouds what's our performance
looking<00:03:56.550> like<00:03:56.700> still<00:03:57.660> in<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.810> 50s<00:03:58.020> there<00:03:58.440> we

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
looking like still in the 50s there we

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.330 
looking like still in the 50s there we
go<00:03:59.060> so<00:04:00.060> as<00:04:00.209> you<00:04:00.330> can<00:04:00.420> see<00:04:00.599> there's<00:04:00.810> some<00:04:01.340> added

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
go so as you can see there's some added

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.270 
go so as you can see there's some added
benefits<00:04:02.849> to<00:04:03.590> which<00:04:04.590> you<00:04:04.800> can<00:04:04.980> accomplish

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
benefits to which you can accomplish

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.820 
benefits to which you can accomplish
with<00:04:05.700> this<00:04:05.780> you<00:04:06.780> can<00:04:06.810> run<00:04:07.080> your<00:04:07.170> gauges<00:04:07.410> as

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
with this you can run your gauges as

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.550 
with this you can run your gauges as
large<00:04:08.280> as<00:04:08.489> you<00:04:08.520> want<00:04:08.610> and<00:04:09.030> it<00:04:09.959> will<00:04:10.050> not<00:04:10.290> affect

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
large as you want and it will not affect

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.340 
large as you want and it will not affect
the<00:04:11.520> performance<00:04:11.940> of<00:04:12.390> your<00:04:14.390> fsx<00:04:15.390> machine<00:04:15.720> now

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
the performance of your fsx machine now

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.349 
the performance of your fsx machine now
one<00:04:16.560> thing<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.799> note<00:04:17.480> you<00:04:18.480> can<00:04:18.510> run<00:04:18.959> as<00:04:19.169> many

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
one thing to note you can run as many

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:26.240 
one thing to note you can run as many
clients<00:04:21.359> as<00:04:21.770> you<00:04:22.770> want<00:04:23.030> I<00:04:24.620> only<00:04:25.620> have<00:04:25.950> one

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
clients as you want I only have one

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.550 
clients as you want I only have one
machine<00:04:26.639> right<00:04:26.880> now<00:04:27.030> running<00:04:27.300> a<00:04:27.450> client<00:04:27.870> but

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
machine right now running a client but

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.430 
machine right now running a client but
once<00:04:29.070> i<00:04:29.220> have<00:04:29.460> my<00:04:29.700> lower<00:04:30.090> eks<00:04:30.540> monitor<00:04:30.930> back<00:04:31.139> i

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
once i have my lower eks monitor back i

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.110 
once i have my lower eks monitor back i
will<00:04:31.650> have<00:04:31.830> two<00:04:32.040> machines<00:04:32.400> running<00:04:32.669> clients

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
will have two machines running clients

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.690 
will have two machines running clients
and<00:04:33.270> if<00:04:34.110> you<00:04:34.290> have<00:04:34.530> say<00:04:34.800> another<00:04:35.040> machine<00:04:35.280> that

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
and if you have say another machine that

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.190 
and if you have say another machine that
you<00:04:35.880> like<00:04:36.120> to<00:04:36.150> run<00:04:36.479> maybe<00:04:37.350> a<00:04:37.440> touch<00:04:37.680> screen<00:04:37.860> CDU

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
you like to run maybe a touch screen CDU

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.230 
you like to run maybe a touch screen CDU
you<00:04:40.200> can<00:04:40.380> run<00:04:40.530> that<00:04:40.680> as<00:04:40.830> well<00:04:41.040> and<00:04:41.280> in<00:04:42.090> fact

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
you can run that as well and in fact

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.940 
you can run that as well and in fact
let's<00:04:42.510> give<00:04:42.750> you<00:04:42.870> a<00:04:42.930> little<00:04:43.169> demonstration<00:04:43.260> of

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
let's give you a little demonstration of

that I'm going to go ahead and pause the

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.379 
that I'm going to go ahead and pause the
video<00:04:46.200> now<00:04:46.380> and<00:04:46.530> then<00:04:47.250> bring<00:04:47.490> it<00:04:47.580> back<00:04:47.610> and<00:04:48.120> a
