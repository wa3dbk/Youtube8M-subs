00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:14.910
 Wiebe left the iphone in I play and 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:15.960
 I play and I wo n't play it 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.580
 escaped 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.080
 apple has two new iphones 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.930
 presented 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.670
 this allows between here and more 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.640
 customers 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.710
 ok well first but a nice crazy one 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.000
 budget version like that but you ask 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.730
 can speak for this with a suggested retail price 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.469
 from 599 euros but still it is real 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.210
 starring this is the iphone 5c 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.410
 the iphone 5c stands out for its fun 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.520
 colors 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.520
 at least that feels nokia 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.050
 apple itself calls it was an experiment 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.090
 in reality it is of course one 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.800
 great smartphone to a contrast 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.550
 until earlier iphones just from 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.780
 plastic or rather an I polycarbonate 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.850
 example apple doesn't bother at all 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.659
 thanks to an ingenious how far it is yet 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.060
 always sturdy and completely beautiful house 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.590
 incredible already to be good to that 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.659
 superlatives are of course used to it 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.759
 but what does the iphone 5c have 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.009
 really on board daily 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.140
 use , the iphone 5c is not inferior 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.270
 for the current iphone 5 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.820
 it contains the same a6 processor 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.369
 an isight camera of 8 megapixels and 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.409
 one of the 4-inch screen, 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.030
 do you want to have then drive September 20 to 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.140
 Germany because he is already there 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.340
 to gain 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.320
 when the device comes to the Netherlands 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.939
 is not yet clear 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.960
 the same applies to apples new 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.180
 flagship the iphone 5s 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.310
 the price is already known the 16 gigabytes 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:51.650
 edition costs 699 euros 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.730
 the 32 gigabyte edition 799 euros and the 64 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.790
 gigabyte edition 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:58.370
 almost 900 euros 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.890
 coaching that is not a lot of money good then 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.260
 you get iphone 5s with a new a7 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.090
 processor that Apple says 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.100
 that both speed and graphics 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.869
 power have doubled 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.970
 in terms of design, the model is equal to the 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.250
 iphone 5 but with a different one 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.940
 color to know gold 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.100
 yes, black and space gray 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.660
 noteworthy is that you are from that which is the 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.640
 fingerprint scanner that is in the home button 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.340
 is processed your finger, the prince 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.970
 best especially with this fingerprint reader 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.410
 iPhone 5s can recognize its possession 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.230
 so you no longer need a password 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.300
 to enter your fingerprint is enough too 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.030
 does the device have a better camera with 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.520
 an aperture of f2 point two 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.020
 the sensor even seems to be a 15% large 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.110
 are because good photos in the dark 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.370
 must yield whether that is so 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.870
 of course just wait but the 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.870
 expectations are high in any case 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.940
 tense or not sometimes 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.940
 who the love is in i play
