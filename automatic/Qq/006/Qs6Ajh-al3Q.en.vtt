intelligence<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:09.150> basic<00:00:09.450> premise<00:00:09.570> here<00:00:09.840> is

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
intelligence the basic premise here is

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.480 
intelligence the basic premise here is
not<00:00:10.080> so<00:00:10.230> much<00:00:10.290> that<00:00:10.530> they're<00:00:10.679> smart<00:00:11.070> dogs<00:00:11.250> and

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
not so much that they're smart dogs and

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.160 
not so much that they're smart dogs and
dumb<00:00:11.639> dogs<00:00:11.880> although<00:00:12.150> there's<00:00:12.840> probably<00:00:13.049> some

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
dumb dogs although there's probably some

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.350 
dumb dogs although there's probably some
truth<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.349> that<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:14.250> idea<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.700> that<00:00:14.730> different

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
truth to that the idea is that different

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.150 
truth to that the idea is that different
dogs<00:00:15.540> use<00:00:15.839> different<00:00:16.199> cognitive<00:00:16.680> strategies

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
dogs use different cognitive strategies

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.090 
dogs use different cognitive strategies
to<00:00:17.670> help<00:00:17.760> them<00:00:17.970> solve<00:00:18.150> problems<00:00:18.619> so<00:00:19.619> this<00:00:19.949> was

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
to help them solve problems so this was

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.640 
to help them solve problems so this was
based<00:00:20.460> on<00:00:20.670> research<00:00:21.090> by<00:00:21.390> Brian<00:00:22.080> hare<00:00:22.380> who's<00:00:22.619> a

based on research by Brian hare who's a
cognitive<00:00:23.340> neuroscientist<00:00:24.029> at<00:00:24.630> Duke

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
cognitive neuroscientist at Duke

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.929 
cognitive neuroscientist at Duke
University<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.650> we<00:00:26.279> wanted<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.519> try<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.760> get<00:00:26.910> a

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
University and we wanted to try to get a

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.910 
University and we wanted to try to get a
sense<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.330> whether<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:28.140> can<00:00:28.410> actually<00:00:28.560> work

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
sense of whether this can actually work

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.890 
sense of whether this can actually work
with<00:00:28.949> regular<00:00:29.820> people<00:00:29.970> who<00:00:30.750> aren't

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
with regular people who aren't

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.590 
with regular people who aren't
scientists<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.850> regular<00:00:32.850> dogs<00:00:33.059> like<00:00:33.300> Riley

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
scientists and regular dogs like Riley

00:00:33.600 --> 00:01:47.210 
scientists and regular dogs like Riley
here<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.230> here<00:00:34.770> we<00:00:34.860> go

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.040 

okay<00:01:48.220> so<00:01:48.280> we<00:01:48.490> have<00:01:48.610> some<00:01:48.790> results<00:01:49.119> here<00:01:49.630> from

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
okay so we have some results here from

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.020 
okay so we have some results here from
dognition<00:01:50.590> on<00:01:50.920> Riley<00:01:51.399> and<00:01:51.550> the<00:01:51.580> test<00:01:51.820> we<00:01:51.909> did

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
dognition on Riley and the test we did

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.090 
dognition on Riley and the test we did
with<00:01:52.180> him<00:01:52.330> unfortunately<00:01:53.080> we<00:01:53.649> couldn't<00:01:53.920> get

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
with him unfortunately we couldn't get

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.830 
with him unfortunately we couldn't get
through<00:01:54.190> the<00:01:54.280> complete<00:01:55.000> battery<00:01:55.270> of<00:01:55.570> tests

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
through the complete battery of tests

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.870 
through the complete battery of tests
because<00:01:56.050> we<00:01:56.170> didn't<00:01:56.320> have<00:01:56.470> access<00:01:56.590> to<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:57.250> to

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
because we didn't have access to the to

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.540 
because we didn't have access to the to
the<00:01:57.970> website<00:01:58.330> but<00:01:58.630> based<00:01:59.080> on<00:01:59.259> the<00:01:59.680> things<00:02:00.490> that

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
the website but based on the things that

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.190 
the website but based on the things that
we<00:02:00.700> did<00:02:00.850> do<00:02:01.030> we<00:02:01.240> have<00:02:01.360> some<00:02:01.540> preliminary

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
we did do we have some preliminary

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.710 
we did do we have some preliminary
results<00:02:02.350> suggesting<00:02:03.159> that<00:02:03.360> Riley<00:02:04.360> is<00:02:04.539> an

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
results suggesting that Riley is an

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.749 
results suggesting that Riley is an
independent<00:02:05.229> problem<00:02:05.590> solver<00:02:06.009> and<00:02:06.250> that's

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
independent problem solver and that's

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.820 
independent problem solver and that's
because<00:02:07.090> in<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.750> experiment<00:02:08.200> where<00:02:08.470> his

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
because in the experiment where his

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.770 
because in the experiment where his
owner<00:02:09.070> put<00:02:09.340> a<00:02:09.369> piece<00:02:09.820> of<00:02:09.850> food<00:02:10.119> under<00:02:10.390> one<00:02:10.539> cup

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
owner put a piece of food under one cup

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.050 
owner put a piece of food under one cup

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
where he knew the food was so he relied
