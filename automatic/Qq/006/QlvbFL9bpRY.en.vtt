00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
that's it so here we go to this Mewtwo

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.819 
that's it so here we go to this Mewtwo
which<00:03:02.700> my<00:03:02.909> friend<00:03:03.150> actually<00:03:03.510> soft<00:03:04.109> reset<00:03:04.560> for

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
which my friend actually soft reset for

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.119 
which my friend actually soft reset for
and<00:03:05.040> it<00:03:05.489> has<00:03:05.669> really<00:03:06.030> nice<00:03:06.269> IVs<00:03:07.200> unfortunately

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
and it has really nice IVs unfortunately

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.740 
and it has really nice IVs unfortunately
it's<00:03:08.220> not<00:03:08.250> EV<00:03:08.609> trained<00:03:08.909> yet<00:03:09.150> which<00:03:09.329> leaves<00:03:09.569> it

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
it's not EV trained yet which leaves it

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.259 
it's not EV trained yet which leaves it
open<00:03:09.840> for<00:03:10.400> whatever<00:03:11.400> you<00:03:11.609> want<00:03:11.819> to<00:03:11.970> make<00:03:12.090> it

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
open for whatever you want to make it

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.179 
open for whatever you want to make it
into<00:03:12.510> what<00:03:12.659> sort<00:03:12.840> of<00:03:12.900> mutual<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:13.349> want<00:03:13.590> it<00:03:14.040> is

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
into what sort of mutual you want it is

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:15.710 
into what sort of mutual you want it is
actually<00:03:14.400> naive<00:03:14.909> in<00:03:15.060> nature<00:03:15.419> so<00:03:15.569> it's

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
actually naive in nature so it's

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.449 
actually naive in nature so it's
probably<00:03:15.900> best<00:03:16.019> suited<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:16.709> sweeping<00:03:17.280> sort

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
probably best suited to a sweeping sort

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:18.979 
probably best suited to a sweeping sort
of<00:03:17.579> Mewtwo<00:03:17.909> but<00:03:18.449> this<00:03:18.569> is<00:03:18.659> going<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:18.840> be<00:03:18.900> the

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
of Mewtwo but this is going to be the

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.069 
of Mewtwo but this is going to be the
second<00:03:19.349> price<00:03:19.530> so<00:03:20.659> you<00:03:21.659> should<00:03:21.870> basically

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
second price so you should basically

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.710 
second price so you should basically
want<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:22.919> try<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:23.310> EV<00:03:23.609> this<00:03:23.819> thing<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.269> make

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
want to try and EV this thing and make

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.899 
want to try and EV this thing and make
it<00:03:25.109> whatever<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:25.650> want<00:03:25.889> it<00:03:26.099> to<00:03:26.129> be<00:03:26.220> so<00:03:26.609> that's

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:26.909
