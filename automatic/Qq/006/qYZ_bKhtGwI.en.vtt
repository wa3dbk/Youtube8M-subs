00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
for a minute or two just to show in the

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:08.810 
for a minute or two just to show in the
video<00:01:00.570> fact<00:01:01.570> does<00:01:01.899> work

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.260 

and<00:01:09.820> so<00:01:10.240> you<00:01:10.420> shall<00:01:10.630> see<00:01:11.399> do<00:01:12.399> a<00:01:12.430> shock<00:01:12.640> 404<00:01:13.149> it's

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
and so you shall see do a shock 404 it's

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.260 
and so you shall see do a shock 404 it's
just<00:01:13.539> fine<00:01:14.399> and<00:01:15.399> in<00:01:15.579> fact<00:01:15.759> it's<00:01:15.939> probably<00:01:16.030> the

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
just fine and in fact it's probably the

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:25.950 
just fine and in fact it's probably the
best<00:01:16.450> way<00:01:16.600> to<00:01:16.630> play<00:01:16.810> it

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.080
