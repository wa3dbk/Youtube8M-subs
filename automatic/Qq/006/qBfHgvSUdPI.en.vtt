00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
Rising in its framerate but that's not a

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.940 
Rising in its framerate but that's not a
multi-platform<00:03:17.240> game<00:03:17.690> we<00:03:18.140> don't<00:03:18.290> know<00:03:18.500> how<00:03:18.740> it

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
multi-platform game we don't know how it

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.940 
multi-platform game we don't know how it
will<00:03:19.340> play<00:03:19.490> on<00:03:19.910> the<00:03:20.090> ps4<00:03:20.390> because<00:03:21.350> it's<00:03:21.590> not<00:03:21.740> on

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
will play on the ps4 because it's not on

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.800 
will play on the ps4 because it's not on
the<00:03:22.070> ps4<00:03:22.340> so<00:03:22.880> we<00:03:23.030> can't<00:03:23.270> really<00:03:23.450> talk<00:03:23.750> about

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
the ps4 so we can't really talk about

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.020 
the ps4 so we can't really talk about
that<00:03:24.170> I'm<00:03:24.350> talking<00:03:24.680> strictly<00:03:25.130> about

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
that I'm talking strictly about

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.810 
that I'm talking strictly about
multi-platform<00:03:26.990> games<00:03:27.260> and<00:03:27.590> which<00:03:28.220> console

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
multi-platform games and which console

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.750 
multi-platform games and which console
will<00:03:29.030> be<00:03:29.150> better<00:03:29.390> on<00:03:29.600> and<00:03:29.870> in<00:03:30.380> my<00:03:30.560> opinion<00:03:30.770> Sony

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
will be better on and in my opinion Sony

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.980 
will be better on and in my opinion Sony
is<00:03:32.000> trying<00:03:32.330> so<00:03:32.720> hard<00:03:32.800> to<00:03:33.800> one-up<00:03:34.520> Xbox<00:03:35.240> that

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
is trying so hard to one-up Xbox that

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.740 
is trying so hard to one-up Xbox that
they<00:03:36.350> are<00:03:36.560> not<00:03:36.920> thinking<00:03:37.850> straight<00:03:38.030> I<00:03:38.420> think

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
they are not thinking straight I think

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.600 
they are not thinking straight I think
that<00:03:38.960> is<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.290> problem<00:03:39.740> I<00:03:39.860> think<00:03:40.130> if<00:03:40.280> Sony

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
that is the problem I think if Sony

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.990 
that is the problem I think if Sony
would<00:03:40.880> have<00:03:41.000> made<00:03:41.210> Call<00:03:41.900> of<00:03:41.930> Duty<00:03:42.290> ghosts<00:03:43.000> 720p

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
would have made Call of Duty ghosts 720p

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.990 
would have made Call of Duty ghosts 720p
60<00:03:44.959> frames<00:03:45.230> per<00:03:45.350> second<00:03:46.040> they<00:03:46.520> would<00:03:46.670> have<00:03:46.790> no

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
60 frames per second they would have no

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.790 
60 frames per second they would have no
issue<00:03:47.240> here<00:03:47.420> and<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:47.870> game<00:03:48.080> would<00:03:48.260> probably

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
issue here and the game would probably

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.340 
issue here and the game would probably
look<00:03:49.040> better<00:03:49.390> to<00:03:50.390> me<00:03:50.570> it<00:03:50.720> feels<00:03:50.930> like<00:03:51.200> they

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
look better to me it feels like they

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.199 
look better to me it feels like they
care<00:03:51.620> way<00:03:51.920> too<00:03:51.950> much<00:03:52.220> about<00:03:52.400> public<00:03:52.850> opinion

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
care way too much about public opinion

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.960 
care way too much about public opinion
and<00:03:53.810> what<00:03:54.440> people<00:03:54.800> think<00:03:55.070> about<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:55.490> console

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
and what people think about the console

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.300 
and what people think about the console
than<00:03:56.450> they<00:03:56.600> do<00:03:56.660> about<00:03:56.810> making<00:03:57.620> competent

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
than they do about making competent

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.120 
than they do about making competent
games<00:03:59.000> that<00:03:59.330> run<00:03:59.570> well<00:03:59.870> I<00:04:00.200> was<00:04:00.650> reading<00:04:00.980> an

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
games that run well I was reading an

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.890 
games that run well I was reading an

Duty<00:04:03.200> ghosts<00:04:03.530> on<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:03.709> Xbox<00:04:04.280> one<00:04:04.610> and<00:04:04.880> how<00:04:05.150> the

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
Duty ghosts on the Xbox one and how the

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.140 
Duty ghosts on the Xbox one and how the
frame<00:04:05.720> rate<00:04:05.959> was<00:04:06.200> suffering<00:04:06.709> at<00:04:06.950> 1080p<00:04:07.430> they

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
frame rate was suffering at 1080p they

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.510 
frame rate was suffering at 1080p they
said<00:04:08.390> they<00:04:08.540> could<00:04:08.750> have<00:04:08.840> went<00:04:09.020> 1080p<00:04:09.709> but<00:04:10.310> the

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
said they could have went 1080p but the

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.550 
said they could have went 1080p but the
frame<00:04:10.790> rate<00:04:11.030> would<00:04:11.240> have<00:04:11.360> had<00:04:11.510> issues<00:04:11.930> so

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
frame rate would have had issues so

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.400 
frame rate would have had issues so
that's<00:04:12.770> why<00:04:12.980> they<00:04:13.190> decided<00:04:13.340> to<00:04:13.820> go<00:04:13.940> 720p<00:04:14.900> you

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
that's why they decided to go 720p you

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.740 
that's why they decided to go 720p you
have<00:04:15.650> to<00:04:15.860> think<00:04:16.160> this<00:04:16.400> same<00:04:16.760> information<00:04:17.390> was

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
have to think this same information was

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.770 
have to think this same information was
available<00:04:17.900> to<00:04:18.650> Sony<00:04:18.950> and<00:04:19.310> and<00:04:20.090> Sony<00:04:20.480> just

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
available to Sony and and Sony just

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.540 
available to Sony and and Sony just
decided<00:04:21.440> you<00:04:21.560> know<00:04:21.710> what<00:04:21.919> we're<00:04:22.160> gonna<00:04:22.250> one-up

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
decided you know what we're gonna one-up

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.290 
decided you know what we're gonna one-up
them<00:04:22.850> we're<00:04:23.419> gonna<00:04:23.479> win<00:04:23.780> public<00:04:24.080> opinion

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
them we're gonna win public opinion

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.689 
them we're gonna win public opinion
and<00:04:25.389> we're<00:04:25.629> gonna<00:04:25.750> go<00:04:25.990> 1080p<00:04:26.680> obviously<00:04:27.669> I

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:27.699 
and we're gonna go 1080p obviously I

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.399 
and we're gonna go 1080p obviously I
have<00:04:28.030> no<00:04:28.240> knowledge<00:04:28.449> of<00:04:28.780> what's<00:04:29.020> really<00:04:29.259> going

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:29.409 
have no knowledge of what's really going

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:31.559 
have no knowledge of what's really going
on<00:04:29.770> behind<00:04:29.979> the<00:04:30.220> scenes<00:04:30.310> and<00:04:30.909> what's<00:04:31.120> going<00:04:31.300> on

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:31.569 
on behind the scenes and what's going on

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:33.890 
on behind the scenes and what's going on
with<00:04:31.780> Sony<00:04:32.080> but<00:04:32.919> I<00:04:32.949> do<00:04:33.190> think<00:04:33.789> that

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
with Sony but I do think that

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.240 
with Sony but I do think that
multi-platform<00:04:34.900> games<00:04:35.169> once<00:04:35.650> again<00:04:36.009> are

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
multi-platform games once again are

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.730 
multi-platform games once again are
gonna<00:04:36.400> be<00:04:36.550> better<00:04:36.759> on<00:04:36.909> the<00:04:36.940> Xbox<00:04:37.509> one<00:04:37.810> so<00:04:38.409> far

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
gonna be better on the Xbox one so far

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.860 
gonna be better on the Xbox one so far
we've<00:04:38.979> seen<00:04:39.009> no<00:04:39.490> difference<00:04:39.970> in<00:04:40.150> graphics<00:04:40.720> if

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
we've seen no difference in graphics if

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.279 
we've seen no difference in graphics if
any<00:04:41.680> at<00:04:41.889> all<00:04:42.129> on<00:04:42.520> on<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:43.539> multi-platform

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
any at all on on the multi-platform

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.969 
any at all on on the multi-platform
games<00:04:44.560> so<00:04:45.069> I<00:04:45.460> don't<00:04:46.120> think<00:04:46.479> that<00:04:46.750> the<00:04:47.379> graphics

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
games so I don't think that the graphics

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:49.290 
games so I don't think that the graphics
are<00:04:48.190> gonna<00:04:48.340> make<00:04:48.520> that<00:04:48.729> much<00:04:48.909> of<00:04:49.060> a<00:04:49.120> difference

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
are gonna make that much of a difference

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.749 
are gonna make that much of a difference
in<00:04:49.720> multi-platform<00:04:50.590> games<00:04:50.860> and<00:04:51.159> to<00:04:51.550> add<00:04:51.729> on

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 
in multi-platform games and to add on

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:54.480 
in multi-platform games and to add on
the<00:04:52.360> fact<00:04:52.629> that<00:04:52.750> most<00:04:53.190> multi-platform<00:04:54.190> games

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
the fact that most multi-platform games

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.490 
the fact that most multi-platform games
will<00:04:54.729> have<00:04:54.759> dedicated<00:04:55.090> servers<00:04:55.810> on<00:04:55.960> the<00:04:55.990> Xbox

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
will have dedicated servers on the Xbox

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.490 
will have dedicated servers on the Xbox
one<00:04:56.770> and<00:04:57.039> possibly<00:04:57.789> cloud<00:04:58.479> computing<00:04:59.139> I<00:04:59.289> would

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
one and possibly cloud computing I would

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.309 
one and possibly cloud computing I would
highly<00:04:59.889> doubt<00:05:00.129> that<00:05:00.180> because<00:05:01.180> that's<00:05:01.780> just<00:05:02.020> so

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:02.319 
highly doubt that because that's just so

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:04.350 
highly doubt that because that's just so
much<00:05:02.560> you<00:05:02.620> got<00:05:02.919> to<00:05:03.009> put<00:05:03.190> into<00:05:03.340> one<00:05:03.729> version<00:05:04.240> of

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
much you got to put into one version of

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.659 
much you got to put into one version of
the<00:05:04.449> game<00:05:04.659> but<00:05:05.289> I<00:05:05.319> think<00:05:05.409> dedicated<00:05:06.250> servers

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
the game but I think dedicated servers

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.420 
the game but I think dedicated servers
will<00:05:06.909> become<00:05:07.419> the<00:05:07.599> normal<00:05:08.050> thing<00:05:08.349> for<00:05:09.159> any

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
will become the normal thing for any

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.249 
will become the normal thing for any
multi-platform<00:05:10.360> game<00:05:10.569> that<00:05:10.780> comes<00:05:10.930> to<00:05:11.169> the

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
multi-platform game that comes to the

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:13.980 
multi-platform game that comes to the
Xbox<00:05:11.710> one<00:05:12.009> so<00:05:12.490> in<00:05:12.610> the<00:05:12.699> end<00:05:12.849> guys<00:05:13.090> I<00:05:13.120> think<00:05:13.449> Sony

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
Xbox one so in the end guys I think Sony

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.640 
Xbox one so in the end guys I think Sony
needs<00:05:14.289> to<00:05:14.500> stop<00:05:14.770> going<00:05:15.190> for<00:05:15.520> the<00:05:15.940> throat<00:05:16.389> of

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
needs to stop going for the throat of

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.439 
needs to stop going for the throat of
Microsoft<00:05:17.650> they<00:05:17.889> need<00:05:18.069> to<00:05:18.219> stop<00:05:18.490> trying<00:05:19.300> to

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
Microsoft they need to stop trying to

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:21.629 
Microsoft they need to stop trying to
make<00:05:19.810> themselves<00:05:20.349> look<00:05:20.710> better<00:05:21.009> because<00:05:21.280> it's

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
make themselves look better because it's

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.850 
make themselves look better because it's
gonna<00:05:21.789> come<00:05:22.090> out<00:05:22.300> that<00:05:22.930> they're<00:05:23.319> actually

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
gonna come out that they're actually

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.740 
gonna come out that they're actually
hurting<00:05:24.099> themselves<00:05:24.759> and<00:05:24.940> I<00:05:25.330> think<00:05:25.569> that's

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
hurting themselves and I think that's

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.719 
hurting themselves and I think that's
what's<00:05:26.020> going<00:05:26.349> on<00:05:26.440> a<00:05:26.500> little<00:05:26.830> bit<00:05:27.039> here<00:05:27.069> but
