00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
the pliers or squeezing it the line will

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.990 
the pliers or squeezing it the line will
get<00:01:47.930> kind<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.110> cut<00:01:49.350> up<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:50.189> if<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.399> get<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.640> fish

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
get kind of cut up and if you get a fish

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.929 
get kind of cut up and if you get a fish
the<00:01:51.329> line<00:01:51.509> will<00:01:51.720> snap<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.549> just<00:01:53.759> keep

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
the line will snap so so you just keep

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.969 
the line will snap so so you just keep
on<00:01:54.090> pulling<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.600> until<00:01:54.810> wherever<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.439> want<00:01:55.680> to

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
on pulling it until wherever you want to

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.160 
on pulling it until wherever you want to
and<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.729> just<00:01:57.000> release<00:01:59.240> and<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.360> just<00:02:00.719> stays

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
and you just release and it just stays

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.810 
and you just release and it just stays
there<00:02:03.409> it<00:02:04.409> stays<00:02:04.890> like<00:02:05.070> this<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:05.610> don't

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
there it stays like this so you don't

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.559 
there it stays like this so you don't
have<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.090> tie<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.659> swivel<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:09.360> weight

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
have to tie a swivel so the weight

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.339 
have to tie a swivel so the weight
doesn't

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
doesn't

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.819 
doesn't
and<00:02:11.439> then<00:02:12.159> you<00:02:12.340> just<00:02:12.579> put<00:02:13.269> your<00:02:13.390> hook<00:02:13.659> on<00:02:13.930> the

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
and then you just put your hook on the

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:19.349 
and then you just put your hook on the
other<00:02:14.859> end<00:02:15.749> and<00:02:16.749> you<00:02:16.989> sit<00:02:17.849> you<00:02:18.849> can<00:02:18.879> buy<00:02:19.299> these

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:19.359
