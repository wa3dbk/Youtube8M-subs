00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
this restoring screen so basically you

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.180 
this restoring screen so basically you

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
let this thing sit here and in about 15

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.800 
let this thing sit here and in about 15
minutes<00:03:01.430> or<00:03:01.700> depending<00:03:02.180> on<00:03:02.269> how<00:03:02.450> many<00:03:02.510> apps

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
minutes or depending on how many apps

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.199 
minutes or depending on how many apps
and<00:03:02.989> how<00:03:03.049> much<00:03:03.140> data<00:03:03.379> you<00:03:03.620> had<00:03:03.830> on<00:03:04.459> your

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
and how much data you had on your

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.000 
and how much data you had on your
existing<00:03:05.750> device<00:03:06.230> you<00:03:06.500> see<00:03:06.739> I've<00:03:06.830> got<00:03:06.980> a

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
existing device you see I've got a

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.280 
existing device you see I've got a
couple<00:03:07.310> games<00:03:07.489> in<00:03:07.700> here<00:03:07.910> that<00:03:08.540> are<00:03:08.840> kind<00:03:09.200> of

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
couple games in here that are kind of

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.280 
couple games in here that are kind of
big<00:03:09.500> so<00:03:10.120> if<00:03:11.120> you<00:03:11.330> have<00:03:11.510> a<00:03:11.540> lot<00:03:11.750> of<00:03:11.780> games<00:03:12.080> that

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
big so if you have a lot of games that

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.199 
big so if you have a lot of games that
obviously<00:03:12.590> take<00:03:12.799> longer<00:03:13.069> to<00:03:13.370> do<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.670> restore

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
obviously take longer to do the restore

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.569 
obviously take longer to do the restore
but<00:03:14.900> otherwise<00:03:15.230> you<00:03:15.950> should<00:03:16.129> be<00:03:16.160> good<00:03:16.250> to<00:03:16.459> go

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
but otherwise you should be good to go

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.009 
but otherwise you should be good to go
just<00:03:16.790> let<00:03:17.150> this<00:03:17.269> thing<00:03:17.329> sync<00:03:17.750> when<00:03:17.900> you're
