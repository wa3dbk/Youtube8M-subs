00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.970
 here we have three super simple ways 

00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:07.670
 and beautiful to style the hair that 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.249
 it should be treat we will only need 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.410
 a few things takes a clamp of 3 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:15.740
 inch heat shield that is 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.890
 indispensable flexible spray and some 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.349
 pins 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.020
 start preparing all the hair with 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:26.619
 heat protector then select the 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.869
 layer of the background to start curling me 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.750
 like to start praying from the middle and 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.970
 pull the hair through the barrel of 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.540
 this way the heat is distributed 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:40.440
 uniformly and as you can see I like 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.809
 prepare the next layer of hair 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.239
 keep the clamp at least 6 seconds and 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.640
 this will form beautiful curls in 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:52.440
 spiral shape so I repeat the same 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.440
 process in my whole head 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.990
 once you reach the third and 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.570
 Last layer part the hair as more 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.150
 like today I'll split it on my right side 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.510
 and we will continue doing as of 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.510
 habit 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.930
 suddenly you will find hair that 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.090
 they were forgotten make sure you curl 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.720
 the all before you start to stylize 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.720
 your hair 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.409
 now apply the sprite throughout 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.500
 hair to fix those beautiful 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.140
 curls to volume your hair 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.799
 Carefully pierce with your fingers 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.659
 your curls now do it carefully or from 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.909
 another way it may look like a ball 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.070
 spongy but we can accommodate 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.509
 passing the curls around our 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.750
 fingers 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.700
 now the hair looks beautiful but to me 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.130
 I like to keep it away from my face 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.570
 so I'm going to take some pins and what 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.570
 match with one side 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:14.520
 and voilÃ  now it looks beautiful this is 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.340

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.920
