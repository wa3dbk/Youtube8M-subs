00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
for about half an hour just until that

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.009 
for about half an hour just until that
frosting<00:03:13.950> can<00:03:14.159> sit<00:03:14.519> a<00:03:14.549> little<00:03:14.730> bit<00:03:14.900> with<00:03:15.900> the

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
frosting can sit a little bit with the

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.530 
frosting can sit a little bit with the
Kit<00:03:16.200> Kats<00:03:16.670> and<00:03:17.670> it<00:03:17.790> just<00:03:17.939> becomes<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.359> little

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
Kit Kats and it just becomes a little

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.110 
Kit Kats and it just becomes a little
bit<00:03:18.629> more<00:03:18.840> stable<00:03:19.590> if<00:03:20.010> you<00:03:20.099> like<00:03:20.280> so<00:03:20.849> when<00:03:21.030> we

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
bit more stable if you like so when we

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.460 
bit more stable if you like so when we
cut<00:03:21.299> into<00:03:21.390> it<00:03:21.540> it<00:03:21.659> doesn't<00:03:21.959> all<00:03:22.019> sort<00:03:22.230> of<00:03:22.290> fall

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
cut into it it doesn't all sort of fall

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.949 
cut into it it doesn't all sort of fall
apart<00:03:22.799> so<00:03:23.430> we<00:03:23.700> just<00:03:23.849> pull<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.180> out<00:03:24.239> after<00:03:24.689> 30

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
apart so we just pull it out after 30

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.459 
apart so we just pull it out after 30
minutes<00:03:25.319> in<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:26.129> fridge<00:03:26.250> now<00:03:26.579> it's<00:03:27.209> time<00:03:27.599> to

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:28.469
