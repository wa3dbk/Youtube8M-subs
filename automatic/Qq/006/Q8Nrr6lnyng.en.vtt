00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.310
 cellular membrane 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:31.510
 limits you by making it liquid to this 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.510
 city as the intracellular fluid 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:41.789
 its components are 1 55% are 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:48.129
 proteins 2 25 percent are 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:52.180
 phospholipids 3 13% cholesterol 4 14 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:56.199
 percent of another type of lipids 5 a 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:59.109
 3% glucose in the plasma membrane 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.449
 of each cell four major occurs 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:03.850
 movements this about the 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.610
 politicians who make up the first of 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.470
 they are lateral diffusion if it says that 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.390
 is the natural movement of the 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.119
 other lipids 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.429
 the second is that frob where one 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.340
 the other lipids exchange place with 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:20.979
 another the opposite lipid layer as 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.409
 third movement is in reflection 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.810
 where the tails of our football and pi 2 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.540
 formed by fatty acids have their 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.240
 own movement 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.390
 and finally there is the movement of 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.710
 rotation where the phospholipids rotate 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.710
 on its own axis 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.710
 diffusion comprises both the simple 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.990
 as facilitated in the simple infusion 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.450
 the substances go through the membrane of 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.160
 two ways one by help of the 'law 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.320
 possibility to cross the 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.420
 intra-membrane interstices leds and two 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.370
 through activation either by the 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.410
 voltage difference by ligand or 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.360
 any chemicals that 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.520
 happen will open a gate in our 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.420
 protein channel and thus allow the passage 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.420
 of the substance 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.180
 in diffusion facilitates something happens 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.670
 similar here the protein channel is 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.140
 activated by a molecule which binds 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.390
 to a receiver that is in 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.610
 our channel and this makes OCCUR 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.980
 change conformation to or structural in 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.810
 the protein that forms the channel generating 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.230
 that the molecule entered absent from the 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.230
 cell 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.200
 and active transport is a mechanism 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.880
 in which the diffusion of ions requires 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.860
 the decision of the atp 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.440
 the potassium stage pump controls the 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.090
 cellular volume by means of proteins 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.940
 Conveyors formed by two 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.000
 globular proteins an alpha subunit 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.800
 major and a minor beta subunit the 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.530
 Alpha subunit has three points 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.170
 receptors for sodium inside that 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.480
 transports them abroad and two points 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.370
 receptors for potassium abroad 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.980
 that transports them inside the 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.370
 cell where the 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.769
 ppc activity 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.930
 with primary active transport it 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.819
 generates a high concentration of sodium 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.860
 in liquid cellular stress what 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.440
 represents a radiant warehouse of 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.989
 energy in the with transport the energy 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.750
 Sodium diffusion can drag other 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.760
 molecules like glucose and both are 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.610
 transported to the interior of the cell 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.860
 in the 4 transport the energy the 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.739
 release of sodium moves towards the 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.730
 inside and makes the other substance 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.730
 move to the outside 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.260
 when moved substance through 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.840
 the membrane is water the process is called 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.940
 osmosis is the intracellular fluid 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.670
 how this is online is composed of 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.220
 solutions is solvent usually is 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.290
 the water this moves through the 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.630
 semipermeable membrane towards a 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.900
 highest solute concentration 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.700
 constituted by molecules or ions up 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.580
 that the equilibrium of the 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.310
 solution the plasma membrane contains 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.230
 proteins called auto by in us the 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.920
 which are special channels for the 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:14.049
 water movement during osmosis 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.090
 a cell in a hypertonic environment 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.739
 will have water movement from within 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.720
 from the cell towards the greatest 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.040
 solute concentration of the solution 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.040
 out of the cell 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.360
 in a solution and potonik to the 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.430
 solute concentration is higher 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.230
 inside the cell so the water 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.230
 diffuses into the shell 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.810
 when the solutions reach the 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:06.449
 balance on both sides of the membrane 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.449
 he is known with isotonic solution
