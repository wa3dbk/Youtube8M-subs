 water source meaning we can take 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.680
 something infinitely water and develop here 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:04:00.720
 there is an endless look from here to where 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:00.720
 she wants to spend it a little bit 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.540
 and you can make a garden and finally 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:12.159

 oh you maza flags finally last 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:18.789
 life hack on today the most clear with 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.080
 using 9 coal we can melt down 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:25.889
 some amount of iron 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.889
 let's see how much 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:03.760
 so what we see 9 coal melted a 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:07.510
 1 stack of iron and 8 iron extra 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:10.960
 now we will do almost the same beauty 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:14.740
 we take 9 coal and from these 9 coal we will make 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.510
 coal block and also try before 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.700
 remelt piece of iron let's see how much 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.400

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.990
 melted too from nine coal 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:06:01.860
 and since you yourself saw out of nine coal 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.770
 we got 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:09.120
 a stack of iron and eight more iron 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:10.430
