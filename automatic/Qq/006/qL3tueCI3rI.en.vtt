00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
like home remedies and things like that

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.520 
like home remedies and things like that

swim<00:02:32.830> check<00:02:33.100> knows<00:02:33.280> a<00:02:33.700> little<00:02:34.300> bit<00:02:34.510> of<00:02:34.630> garlic

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.770 

all<00:02:42.530> right<00:02:42.680> so<00:02:42.920> very<00:02:43.190> straightforward<00:02:43.970> just

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
all right so very straightforward just

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.870 
all right so very straightforward just
gonna<00:02:45.020> lay<00:02:45.230> this<00:02:45.440> in<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.710> oven<00:02:45.890> today<00:02:46.730> it's

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
gonna lay this in the oven today it's

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.810 
gonna lay this in the oven today it's
already<00:02:47.000> preheated<00:02:47.990> to<00:02:48.770> 400<00:02:49.310> degrees<00:02:49.340> and

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
already preheated to 400 degrees and

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.570 
already preheated to 400 degrees and
it's<00:02:50.240> going<00:02:50.390> to<00:02:50.450> take<00:02:50.630> about<00:02:51.580> somewhere

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
it's going to take about somewhere

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.960 
it's going to take about somewhere
around<00:02:52.640> 20<00:02:53.120> minutes<00:02:53.270> give<00:02:54.260> or<00:02:54.290> take<00:02:54.820> what<00:02:55.820> I'd

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
around 20 minutes give or take what I'd

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.420 
around 20 minutes give or take what I'd
recommend<00:02:56.150> is<00:02:56.720> probably<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.680> set<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:58.190> timer

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
recommend is probably to set the timer

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.850 
recommend is probably to set the timer
for<00:02:58.610> about<00:02:58.970> 10<00:02:59.210> minutes<00:02:59.450> and<00:02:59.690> just<00:02:59.750> check<00:03:00.680> it

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
for about 10 minutes and just check it

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.030 
for about 10 minutes and just check it
you<00:03:01.220> know<00:03:01.310> every<00:03:01.550> 10<00:03:01.730> minutes<00:03:01.910> or<00:03:02.120> so<00:03:02.150> but<00:03:03.040> I'm

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
you know every 10 minutes or so but I'm

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.650 
you know every 10 minutes or so but I'm
guessing<00:03:04.520> around<00:03:04.640> 20<00:03:05.030> minutes<00:03:05.300> is<00:03:05.420> all<00:03:05.570> it's

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
guessing around 20 minutes is all it's

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.840 
guessing around 20 minutes is all it's
going<00:03:05.780> to<00:03:05.840> take<00:03:06.050> and<00:03:06.290> then<00:03:06.770> you<00:03:06.920> take<00:03:07.670> it<00:03:07.790> up

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
going to take and then you take it up

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.520 
going to take and then you take it up
and<00:03:08.030> it's<00:03:08.150> good<00:03:08.300> to<00:03:08.390> go<00:03:08.510> so<00:03:08.960> I'll<00:03:09.170> see<00:03:09.350> you<00:03:09.380> back

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
and it's good to go so I'll see you back

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.590 
and it's good to go so I'll see you back
here<00:03:09.770> in<00:03:09.950> 20<00:03:10.190> minutes

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
here in 20 minutes

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:19.090

cooked dry spice I did leave it on for a
little<00:03:23.510> longer<00:03:23.870> I<00:03:24.530> left<00:03:24.860> it<00:03:25.010> on<00:03:25.070> for<00:03:25.130> about<00:03:25.580> 25

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
little longer I left it on for about 25

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.050 
little longer I left it on for about 25
minutes<00:03:26.450> and<00:03:27.050> what<00:03:27.860> I<00:03:27.890> did<00:03:28.160> half<00:03:28.490> way<00:03:28.730> through

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
minutes and what I did half way through

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.410 
minutes and what I did half way through
is<00:03:29.570> I<00:03:29.810> switched<00:03:30.110> you<00:03:30.260> up<00:03:30.410> into<00:03:30.620> royal<00:03:31.370> so<00:03:31.970> turn

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
is I switched you up into royal so turn

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.770 
is I switched you up into royal so turn
on<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.810> top<00:03:34.060> heating<00:03:35.060> element<00:03:35.390> in<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.570> oven

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
on the top heating element in the oven

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.540 
on the top heating element in the oven
so<00:03:35.900> you<00:03:36.170> cook<00:03:36.350> the<00:03:36.470> fish<00:03:36.500> from<00:03:36.800> both<00:03:36.950> sides<00:03:37.220> so

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
so you cook the fish from both sides so

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.750 
so you cook the fish from both sides so
I<00:03:38.090> just<00:03:38.300> switched<00:03:38.540> it<00:03:38.690> halfway<00:03:38.870> through<00:03:39.290> and

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
I just switched it halfway through and

I just switched it halfway through and
like<00:03:40.760> I<00:03:40.790> said<00:03:40.940> it<00:03:41.030> looks<00:03:41.240> good<00:03:41.590> even<00:03:42.590> this<00:03:42.830> it

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
like I said it looks good even this it

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.610 
like I said it looks good even this it
takes<00:03:43.160> now<00:03:43.400> but<00:03:44.060> it's<00:03:44.180> a<00:03:44.300> simple<00:03:44.690> way<00:03:44.930> simple
