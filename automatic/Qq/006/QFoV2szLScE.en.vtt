 kilometers of route through the district 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.399
 federal but the party the flavor and the 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.620

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.059
 titanic mission and it does not matter if they are 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.339
 Young old men women are 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.659
 disabled for all there is a 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:54.659
 opportunity when there is will 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.170
 after having prepared 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.930
 and good 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.470
 there was someone who took the opportunity to withdraw from 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.930
 the great competitions in this more 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.759
 visionary because the body already begins to

 complain rest although he promised no 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.490
 leave it all 185 bullies 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.200
 fifteen 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.150
 but the last big marathon costs 15 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.440
 because no longer the last sergio that we 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.310
 made 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.840
 and support banners elvis del 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.810
 I remember the necessary stretches 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.650
 to return to the routine everything 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.720
 they conspired to make a scenario 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.070
 pleasant family and in which undoubtedly 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.530
 we had to recognize those of high 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.150
 performance for bad luck of the 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.130

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.740
 10 the best located was Veracruz 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.420
 you take moon in place 11 who promised 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.020
 be redeemed more than in the next 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.020
 occasions 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.110
 money 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.110
 but I think 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.180
 in the end everything went according to the expected 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.280
 second the general director of the sport 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.380

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.360
 alfredo castle holder of the conade and 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.620
 He said that the Mexican marathon is at 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.620
 height of the best in the world 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:01.500
 difficult kilometers trying 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:13.190
 this is the carnival of legs that 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.960
 he lived the mexican capital 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.720
 the same one that you do not have to reach 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.960
 first but simply you have to know 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.960
