00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.580
 Hi Faust 36 I shot my ball and I did not shoot the video a day. My team 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.330
 I'm going to write about it so the ball has gone too far and I can not use it right now 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.519
 Like 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:19.320
 Haetguyo ready to party image collection times do I determine the right opponent description 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.820
 The power of the ball is different because of the different soul seats , but the remaining stats are all high power 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.320
 I'll be in state. 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.670
 Let's see what the difference is, by turning around again. 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.960
 I'll do it 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.710
 The first thing I did was to make Faust the biggest screen in every 9 cars . 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.660
 I did it. 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.660
 I'll be ready for the new video. 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.579
 Pau goes in first and then hunts. 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:50.880
 I knew the yarn was hunting so fast in my last narrative video. 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.880
 So I can not predict the outcome. 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.790
 I'm hunting the power-ups a little quicker with the ranged 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:07.509
 I took Marius the next. 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.460
 In the first area, the turbo booster is getting faster this way. 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:14.040
 Ah 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:18.350
 This is the second time I 've moved on , 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.350
 In the itguyo I not know about the same 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.500
 Power smile I thought it was strange, so I came here first to deal with Elloy. 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.570
 It is still almost similar, but if you look at your physical strength, 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:39.409
 I can see you getting a little cut. 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:44.830
 Despite being close to flat, the narrative is now less stamina than ranged faust 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.830
 When you can tell for sure that itguyo good body efficiency 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.850
 The second area also had power moved first, compared to the first area 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.930
 It looks like the gap is getting smaller. 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:01.399
 Now, it narrowed some differences seoseul this came along almost 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:06.720
 Now, in the last Mac , there's a situation in which this is reversing 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:11.960
 I have a little bit of physical strength, but I think there's a bit more to it. 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.960
 This prevents both parties from the region was moved to the rest of the state over Bondage 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:19.829
 Jaffa, even though equidistance is described in today's herbal herbal blood is so strong, while 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.829
 Itguyo and continue with many states 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.120
 Both hold Marius. 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:40.090
 Seoseul first, it was the last leg naseoni solpeul fails, the server yobeon 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:45.190
 This seoseul it: I gave it a successful party solpeul Now Faust myeotdae 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:49.810
 Hit'm the debt is seoseul 're solpeul a Mare so slightly faster 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:54.370
 The situation has come out. The power is high at this level, 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:56.770
 I have been hunting so well that I have 34 levels in success 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.660
 And I won. 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.660
 I'll do the video on here.
