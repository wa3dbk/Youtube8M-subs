00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:06.819
 and friends we are already in December and with 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.969
 this begin those preparations not 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:14.290
 only from the kitchen the stick 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:17.110
 parties we also want to see ourselves better and 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.780
 maybe deflate them and lower the belly 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.940
 and how are we going to make up and about 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.980
 all show off those clothes that sometimes 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.020
 we buy and we are waiting for all the 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.800
 year to use this December I 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:34.210
 I promise many very effective recipes for 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:37.030
 expect this 2015 full or full of 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.150
 optimism eager to fight for 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.820
 life for our life and making a 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.920
 objectively summarize everything that 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.510
 we have achieved and perhaps we said when 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.780
 started the year I'm going to start doing 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.930
 exercise we did not do exactly like 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.180
 we thought but if there we went two or 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.850
 three times a week or walking more 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.060
 using less transportation we manage 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.810
 plus the hair we manage better with 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.660
 rice 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:07.120
 but also emotionally we went towards 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.640
 inside we forgive we forgive the 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.030
 people that we feel have left us 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.480
 wounds and that's a great achievement not 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.960
 we need to run a full marathon 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.300
 to take firm steps forward today 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.990
 I bring a very effective recipe are good 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:29.200
 two recipes to clarify those armpits in 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.930
 two or three important minutes is that 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.180
 these recipes are only used in 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.030
 emergency cases this means 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.830
 which is not to be used 3 times to the 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.960
 week or the next day because we 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.750
 can irritate since the ingredients 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.380
 They are powerful if you have sensitive skin 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.750
 get a sensitivity test and 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.390
 every way I recommend that all 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.880
 world is made a sensitivity test 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.880
 and let's see how it is done 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.050
 for the first recipe we will need 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:06.770
 baking soda the juice of half 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:09.800
 lemon and a spoonful of hydrogen peroxide 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.540
 which it is what we use for 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.080
 drinks and that's what we have in the 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:19.220
 first aid kit to see close and there goes to efe 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:22.520
 a tablespoon of baking soda 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.940
 medium lemon juice 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.310
 spoonful of hydrogen peroxide nothing more 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.980
 half a spoonful when we take the 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.350
 lemon baking soda is normal 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.480
 to be done as a spit and right now 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.270
 my half teaspoon of hydrogen peroxide 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.070
 only mean that we are not going to 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.170
 shave we are going to put on the mask 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.880
 because this can cause us a 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.870
 irritation that we do not like 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:52.680
 home 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:57.989
 and my friends in the armpit completely 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:00.500
 dry I'm going to take this mixture and I'm going to 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.500
 Apply 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:07.100
 this we are going to leave for two or three 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.520
 minutes and we will remove it with water 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.520
 tibia 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.870
 and that's easy if you're sensitive skin 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.690
 I recommend you use a 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.060
 special deodorant for your skin or that 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.760
 do not put it's time of that day for 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.270
 do not go irritate anymore and let's see 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:32.050
 the second recipe that is much more 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:34.720
 powerful for those very black armpits very 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.480
 stained remember we're going to use 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.900
 for the occasion for this second recipe 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.990
 let's use but I'm still 20 or 30 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.440
 volumes I recommend that we use 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:51.010
 of 30 if you are so very dirty and 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.830
 again our baking soda 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.330
 the preparation is very easy let's see 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.790
 how it is done 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.310
 we are going to need approximately one 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.880
 tablespoon of baking soda 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.940
 or half tablespoon depending which 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.770
 so black and how big the area 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.730
 that you want to dismantle 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:15.370
 this is going to apply a little trickle 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:17.890
 until we make a little bed nothing more 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:21.160
 it may be less than one 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:23.710
 we'll stir it up watch 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.750
 as it was already pampered and this also 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.630
 serves to awaken areas of the body 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:32.020
 that are black that need urgency 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.000
 but remember once only nothing that 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.580
 tomorrow I repeat it and Saturday because no 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.980
 faint well for these treatments to 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.630
 long term I have other recipes that yes 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.330
 can be repeated twice a week 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.300
 three times a week and they're not going to 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.289
 help 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:51.639
 I'm going to put on a glove I'm going to take a 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:55.759
 little of the mixture and I'm going to apply 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:57.500
 massaging in circles do your forehead 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:59.300
 in the mirror because it is important that 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.060
 you are noticing if this is 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.599
 clarifying or if the product is 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:09.470
 covering the whole area that is 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:11.659
 darkened does not burn me does not bother me if 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.509
 feel you burn Que Te Pica 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:17.389
 any little thing that jumps at sight 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:21.129
 they immediately see let's say after 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:23.589
 two or three minutes we go back to remove 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:26.139
 completely removed because if we leave 

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:29.739
 the peroxide we can stain more and 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:30.969
 yes there sensitive skin even without you 

00:05:29.739 --> 00:05:34.119
 you can cause an administration 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:36.459
 pretty serious recommendations that day 

00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:38.319
 Do not use deodorant or alcohol or any 

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:40.709
 product as perfume that can irritate 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:43.719
 your skin if you are going to expose yourself to the sun 

00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:45.849
 use a sunscreen because 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:48.369
 we know that peroxide and water 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:52.029
 oxygenated stain because I raise my 

00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:55.539
 Whitish armpits to give them a 

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:58.029
