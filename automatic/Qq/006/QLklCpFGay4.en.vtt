it<00:01:57.210> looks<00:01:57.479> kind<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.020> like<00:01:58.110> carbon<00:01:58.439> fiber<00:01:58.909> and

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
it looks kind of like carbon fiber and

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.139 
it looks kind of like carbon fiber and
you<00:02:01.979> know<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.130> think<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.430> looks<00:02:02.579> cool<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.969> just

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
you know I think it looks cool it just

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.149 
you know I think it looks cool it just
kind<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.479> goes<00:02:04.079> with<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.380> bike<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.619> bit<00:02:04.920> and

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
kind of goes with the bike a bit and

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.219 
kind of goes with the bike a bit and
then<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.820> side<00:02:06.270> piece<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.840> runs<00:02:06.960> all<00:02:07.200> the

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
then the side piece that runs all the

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.410 
then the side piece that runs all the
way<00:02:07.350> around<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.979> vinyl<00:02:08.700> they<00:02:08.849> recommend<00:02:09.270> using

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
way around is vinyl they recommend using

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.089 
way around is vinyl they recommend using
vinyl<00:02:09.750> for<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.140> sides<00:02:10.410> because<00:02:10.739> it's<00:02:11.039> a

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
vinyl for the sides because it's a

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.020 
vinyl for the sides because it's a
little<00:02:11.280> more<00:02:11.400> durable

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
little more durable

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.309 
little more durable
holds<00:02:12.209> up<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.450> little<00:02:12.600> better<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:13.050> like<00:02:13.200> the

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
holds up a little better to like the

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.140 
holds up a little better to like the
stress<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.800> compressing<00:02:14.580> when<00:02:14.670> you<00:02:14.760> sit<00:02:15.000> on<00:02:15.120> it

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
stress of compressing when you sit on it

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.690 
stress of compressing when you sit on it
so<00:02:15.930> this<00:02:16.050> is<00:02:16.110> their<00:02:16.470> black<00:02:16.770> carbon<00:02:17.370> fiber

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
so this is their black carbon fiber

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.420 
so this is their black carbon fiber
vinyl<00:02:18.360> so<00:02:19.080> it<00:02:19.319> looks<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.620> little<00:02:19.890> bit<00:02:20.220> different

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
vinyl so it looks a little bit different

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.059 
vinyl so it looks a little bit different
it's<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:21.030> little<00:02:21.060> shinier<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:22.470> can<00:02:22.650> tell<00:02:22.860> it's

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
it's a little shinier you can tell it's

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.220 
it's a little shinier you can tell it's
a<00:02:23.280> different<00:02:23.610> material<00:02:23.700> but<00:02:24.630> it<00:02:24.750> blends<00:02:24.990> in

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
a different material but it blends in

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.520 
a different material but it blends in
real<00:02:25.410> nice<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.860> it<00:02:25.980> looks<00:02:26.060> looks<00:02:27.060> very<00:02:27.330> nice

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.170 

and<00:02:31.010> you<00:02:31.070> can<00:02:31.250> see<00:02:31.400> if<00:02:31.550> you<00:02:31.700> can<00:02:31.820> see<00:02:32.030> I<00:02:32.060> don't

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
and you can see if you can see I don't

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.690 
and you can see if you can see I don't
know<00:02:32.360> how<00:02:32.390> well<00:02:32.950> it's<00:02:33.950> coming<00:02:34.250> in<00:02:34.460> but<00:02:34.580> the

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
know how well it's coming in but the

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.220 
know how well it's coming in but the
stitching<00:02:35.150> is<00:02:35.750> very<00:02:36.110> high-quality<00:02:38.110> so<00:02:39.110> I'll

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
stitching is very high-quality so I'll

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:48.550 
stitching is very high-quality so I'll
just<00:02:39.380> show<00:02:39.530> you<00:02:39.590> a<00:02:39.680> shot<00:02:39.950> of<00:02:40.070> that<00:02:47.290> but<00:02:48.290> all<00:02:48.410> in

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
just show you a shot of that but all in

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.550 
just show you a shot of that but all in
all<00:02:48.650> so<00:02:48.920> far<00:02:49.190> it<00:02:49.370> was<00:02:49.490> so<00:02:49.610> far<00:02:49.820> I<00:02:49.850> love<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:50.240> seat

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
all so far it was so far I love the seat

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.380 
all so far it was so far I love the seat
seems<00:02:51.560> very<00:02:51.710> comfortable<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.970> other<00:02:53.090> thing

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
seems very comfortable the other thing

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.660 
seems very comfortable the other thing
is<00:02:53.510> it's<00:02:53.720> kind<00:02:54.080> of<00:02:54.110> hard<00:02:54.320> to<00:02:54.410> tell<00:02:54.620> but<00:02:54.920> on<00:02:55.340> the

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
is it's kind of hard to tell but on the

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.010 
is it's kind of hard to tell but on the
corbin<00:02:56.030> seat<00:02:56.240> what<00:02:56.360> they<00:02:56.450> did<00:02:56.630> is<00:02:56.750> they<00:02:56.780> kind

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
corbin seat what they did is they kind

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.250 
corbin seat what they did is they kind
of<00:02:57.140> took<00:02:57.350> off<00:02:57.530> some<00:02:57.950> of<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.450> padding<00:02:59.450> in<00:03:00.080> the

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
of took off some of the padding in the

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260 
of took off some of the padding in the
middle<00:03:00.530> area<00:03:00.730> kind<00:03:01.730> of<00:03:01.760> where<00:03:01.880> your<00:03:02.000> crotch

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
middle area kind of where your crotch

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.570 
middle area kind of where your crotch
sits<00:03:02.660> so<00:03:03.590> what<00:03:03.800> it<00:03:03.890> does<00:03:04.070> is<00:03:04.310> it<00:03:04.430> actually

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
sits so what it does is it actually

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.730 
sits so what it does is it actually
takes<00:03:05.240> I<00:03:05.570> think<00:03:05.840> it's<00:03:06.110> like<00:03:06.230> a<00:03:06.260> couple<00:03:06.620> inches

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
takes I think it's like a couple inches

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.990 
takes I think it's like a couple inches
or<00:03:07.010> something<00:03:07.250> like<00:03:07.370> that<00:03:07.430> off<00:03:07.730> so<00:03:07.940> you

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
or something like that off so you

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.420 
or something like that off so you
actually<00:03:08.240> sit<00:03:08.570> a<00:03:08.630> little<00:03:08.840> bit<00:03:08.959> lower<00:03:09.230> on<00:03:09.620> the

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
actually sit a little bit lower on the

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.480 
actually sit a little bit lower on the
seat<00:03:10.640> than<00:03:10.850> you<00:03:10.940> do<00:03:11.060> with<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.300> stock<00:03:11.510> seat

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
seat than you do with the stock seat

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.570 
seat than you do with the stock seat
which<00:03:13.490> is<00:03:13.520> nice<00:03:13.790> because<00:03:14.000> now<00:03:14.300> I'm<00:03:14.390> like<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:14.750> can

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
which is nice because now I'm like I can

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.920 
which is nice because now I'm like I can
sit<00:03:16.580> a<00:03:16.610> little<00:03:16.730> bit<00:03:16.850> lower<00:03:17.090> and<00:03:17.209> my<00:03:17.420> feet<00:03:17.690> can

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
sit a little bit lower and my feet can

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.770 
sit a little bit lower and my feet can
touch<00:03:17.959> the<00:03:18.290> ground<00:03:18.530> better<00:03:19.330> which<00:03:20.330> makes<00:03:20.600> it

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
touch the ground better which makes it

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.180 
touch the ground better which makes it
more<00:03:20.870> comfortable<00:03:21.320> when<00:03:21.470> coming<00:03:21.770> to<00:03:21.800> a<00:03:21.890> stop

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
more comfortable when coming to a stop

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.760 
more comfortable when coming to a stop
at<00:03:22.400> like<00:03:22.520> a<00:03:22.550> stoplight<00:03:23.060> or<00:03:23.090> something

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.340 

it<00:03:26.160> also<00:03:26.310> keeps<00:03:26.760> you<00:03:27.270> since<00:03:27.600> it's<00:03:27.750> lower<00:03:28.020> right

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
it also keeps you since it's lower right

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.080 
it also keeps you since it's lower right
here<00:03:28.560> in<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.740> middle<00:03:28.980> part<00:03:29.220> and<00:03:29.400> it<00:03:29.790> kind<00:03:30.000> of

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
here in the middle part and it kind of

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.640 
here in the middle part and it kind of
raises<00:03:30.480> as<00:03:30.600> it<00:03:30.720> comes<00:03:30.900> up<00:03:31.050> here<00:03:31.260> it<00:03:31.440> kind<00:03:31.620> of

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
raises as it comes up here it kind of

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.030 
raises as it comes up here it kind of
keeps<00:03:31.800> you<00:03:31.980> from<00:03:32.130> sliding<00:03:32.520> and<00:03:32.790> slamming<00:03:33.240> your

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
thighs stuck to the tank so you're not

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.520

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
sliding around I'm pretty anal about

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.240 
sliding around I'm pretty anal about
cleaning<00:04:22.860> and<00:04:23.220> maintaining<00:04:24.500> all<00:04:25.500> my<00:04:25.770> vehicles

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
cleaning and maintaining all my vehicles

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.190 
cleaning and maintaining all my vehicles

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
so one of the first thing I did when I

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.010 
so one of the first thing I did when I
bought<00:04:28.380> the<00:04:28.530> bike<00:04:28.770> was<00:04:28.979> wax<00:04:29.310> it<00:04:29.550> and<00:04:29.990> as<00:04:30.990> soon

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
bought the bike was wax it and as soon

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.630 
bought the bike was wax it and as soon
as<00:04:31.169> I<00:04:31.290> wanted<00:04:31.500> to<00:04:31.620> ride<00:04:31.800> after<00:04:31.979> waxing<00:04:32.550> the

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
as I wanted to ride after waxing the

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.610 
as I wanted to ride after waxing the
tank<00:04:32.910> and<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.450> rest<00:04:33.630> of<00:04:33.780> the<00:04:33.840> bike<00:04:34.020> as<00:04:34.410> I

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
tank and the rest of the bike as I

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.909 
tank and the rest of the bike as I
noticed<00:04:34.979> how<00:04:35.240> slippery<00:04:36.240> it<00:04:36.360> was<00:04:36.630> and<00:04:36.840> when<00:04:37.830> you

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
noticed how slippery it was and when you

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.800 
noticed how slippery it was and when you
come<00:04:38.100> to<00:04:38.250> stop<00:04:38.550> or<00:04:38.880> you're<00:04:38.940> decelerating<00:04:39.690> or

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
come to stop or you're decelerating or

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.210 
come to stop or you're decelerating or
accelerating<00:04:40.260> your<00:04:40.320> slide<00:04:40.620> it's<00:04:40.800> really<00:04:41.039> hard

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
accelerating your slide it's really hard

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.490 
accelerating your slide it's really hard
to<00:04:41.340> get<00:04:41.430> a<00:04:41.490> grip<00:04:41.760> on<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:42.060> tank<00:04:42.350> with<00:04:43.350> your

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
to get a grip on the tank with your

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.540 
to get a grip on the tank with your
pants<00:04:43.890> so<00:04:45.260> this<00:04:46.260> made<00:04:46.530> a<00:04:46.560> huge<00:04:46.979> difference<00:04:47.190> and

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
pants so this made a huge difference and

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.370 
pants so this made a huge difference and
it<00:04:47.640> really<00:04:47.700> walks<00:04:48.120> in<00:04:48.419> the<00:04:48.840> only<00:04:48.990> thing<00:04:49.140> I<00:04:49.229> will

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
it really walks in the only thing I will

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.200 
it really walks in the only thing I will
say<00:04:49.410> is<00:04:49.830> that<00:04:49.860> these<00:04:50.340> if<00:04:50.729> you<00:04:50.850> can<00:04:50.970> see<00:04:51.150> these

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
say is that these if you can see these

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.900 
say is that these if you can see these
like<00:04:51.510> bumps<00:04:51.960> stick<00:04:52.350> out<00:04:52.530> they<00:04:53.520> work<00:04:53.729> really

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
like bumps stick out they work really

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.670 
like bumps stick out they work really
well<00:04:54.120> of<00:04:54.240> gripping<00:04:54.479> but<00:04:54.810> they're<00:04:54.960> also<00:04:55.110> kind

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
well of gripping but they're also kind

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.140 
well of gripping but they're also kind
of<00:04:55.770> aggressive<00:04:56.280> it's<00:04:56.430> like<00:04:56.550> a<00:04:56.580> hard<00:04:56.910> rubber

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
of aggressive it's like a hard rubber

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.310 
of aggressive it's like a hard rubber
and<00:04:57.500> they<00:04:58.500> do<00:04:58.560> kind<00:04:59.010> of<00:04:59.660> abrade<00:05:00.660> your<00:05:00.900> pants<00:05:01.260> a

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
and they do kind of abrade your pants a

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.200 
and they do kind of abrade your pants a
little<00:05:01.440> bit<00:05:01.620> and<00:05:02.010> your<00:05:02.460> legs<00:05:02.729> that<00:05:02.970> think

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
little bit and your legs that think

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.560

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
really noticed the insides of my knees

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.080 
really noticed the insides of my knees
were<00:05:12.330> a<00:05:12.390> little<00:05:12.450> a<00:05:12.840> little<00:05:13.320> swords<00:05:13.830> from

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
were a little a little swords from

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.190 
were a little a little swords from
rubbing<00:05:15.090> you<00:05:15.450> know<00:05:15.570> accelerating

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
rubbing you know accelerating

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.590 
rubbing you know accelerating
decelerating<00:05:17.180> braking<00:05:18.180> and<00:05:18.330> things<00:05:18.450> like

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
decelerating braking and things like

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.290 
decelerating braking and things like
that<00:05:18.660> it<00:05:19.410> rubs<00:05:19.650> a<00:05:19.800> little<00:05:20.039> bit<00:05:20.190> and<00:05:20.310> it<00:05:20.370> does<00:05:20.550> it

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
that it rubs a little bit and it does it

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.270 
that it rubs a little bit and it does it
does<00:05:21.510> get<00:05:21.660> a<00:05:21.690> little<00:05:21.930> sore<00:05:22.110> but<00:05:22.350> again<00:05:22.740> it's<00:05:23.100> uh

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
does get a little sore but again it's uh

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.120 
does get a little sore but again it's uh
I<00:05:23.669> think<00:05:24.330> it<00:05:24.419> was<00:05:24.539> well<00:05:24.720> worth<00:05:24.870> it<00:05:25.110> and<00:05:25.800> they

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
I think it was well worth it and they

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.000 
I think it was well worth it and they
just<00:05:26.310> stick<00:05:26.520> on<00:05:26.900> you<00:05:27.900> got<00:05:28.050> to<00:05:28.110> be<00:05:28.200> really<00:05:28.440> take

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
just stick on you got to be really take

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.620 
just stick on you got to be really take
your<00:05:29.160> time<00:05:29.370> and<00:05:29.640> be<00:05:29.700> careful<00:05:30.150> putting<00:05:30.330> them<00:05:30.510> on

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
your time and be careful putting them on

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.270 
your time and be careful putting them on
because<00:05:30.990> once<00:05:31.380> they're<00:05:31.620> stuck<00:05:31.860> on<00:05:32.010> they're

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
because once they're stuck on they're

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.120 
because once they're stuck on they're
stuck<00:05:32.550> so<00:05:33.270> you<00:05:33.330> can't<00:05:33.659> peel<00:05:34.349> it<00:05:34.470> back<00:05:34.650> off<00:05:34.919> if

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
stuck so you can't peel it back off if

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.339 
stuck so you can't peel it back off if
you<00:05:35.220> screw<00:05:35.490> it<00:05:35.520> up<00:05:35.700> and<00:05:35.970> rista<00:05:36.780> kit<00:05:36.930> on<00:05:37.020> it's<00:05:37.260> a

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:37.349 
you screw it up and rista kit on it's a

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:38.180 
you screw it up and rista kit on it's a
one-time<00:05:37.740> deal

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
one-time deal

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.760 
one-time deal
so<00:05:38.610> you
