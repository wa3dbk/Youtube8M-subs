I<00:01:56.039> really<00:01:57.039> feel<00:01:57.280> that<00:01:57.340> if<00:01:57.700> he<00:01:57.939> works<00:01:58.210> hard<00:01:58.539> and

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
I really feel that if he works hard and

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.249 
I really feel that if he works hard and
improves<00:02:00.340> his<00:02:00.789> footwork<00:02:01.299> and<00:02:01.509> fitness<00:02:01.899> level

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
improves his footwork and fitness level

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.980
