workout with it and over time get strong
the<00:00:38.550> way<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.730> can<00:00:38.910> do<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.120> more<00:00:39.270> reps<00:00:39.600> once<00:00:40.260> you

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
the way you can do it more reps once you

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.690 
the way you can do it more reps once you
can<00:00:40.500> do<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.950> race<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.219> weight<00:00:41.370> up<00:00:41.520> right

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
wait but every what month I might have

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.920 
wait but every what month I might have
shit<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.189> back<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.850> two<00:01:33.000> months<00:01:33.270> yeah<00:01:33.689> the

shit it back to two months yeah the
strength<00:01:34.259> gains<00:01:34.500> I'll<00:01:34.770> slow<00:01:35.250> down<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.909> let's

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
strength gains I'll slow down and let's

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.580 
strength gains I'll slow down and let's
say<00:01:36.210> they<00:01:36.329> feel<00:01:36.540> began<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:36.960> should<00:01:37.170> see<00:01:37.380> some

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
say they feel began you should see some

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.440 
say they feel began you should see some
significant<00:01:38.070> stretch<00:01:38.310> things<00:01:38.520> over<00:01:39.000> over<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
significant stretch things over over the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.420 
significant stretch things over over the
first<00:01:39.689> three<00:01:39.869> months<00:01:40.079> yeah<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.159> should

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
first three months yeah and you should

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.969 
first three months yeah and you should
probably<00:01:41.790> be<00:01:41.970> going<00:01:42.180> up<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.570> wait<00:01:42.979> probably

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
probably be going up and wait probably

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.310 
probably be going up and wait probably
every<00:01:44.850> two<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.299> three<00:01:45.329> weeks<00:01:45.570> but<00:01:46.020> we're<00:01:46.200> all

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
every two to three weeks but we're all

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.910 
every two to three weeks but we're all
different

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
different

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.249 
different
yeah<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.549> know<00:01:47.670> pace<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.659> based<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.170> your

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
yeah you know pace is based on your

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.560 
yeah you know pace is based on your
genetics<00:01:49.710> as<00:01:49.860> well<00:01:50.040> but<00:01:50.640> each<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.030> time<00:01:51.210> each

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
genetics as well but each and time each

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.910 
genetics as well but each and time each
