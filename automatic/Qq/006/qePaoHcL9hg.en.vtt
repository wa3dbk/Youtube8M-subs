00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
glitched 15th prestige errs out there

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.080 
glitched 15th prestige errs out there
they'll<00:02:52.800> come<00:02:53.040> into<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.370> lobby<00:02:53.640> they'll<00:02:53.970> have

they'll come into a lobby they'll have

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.420 
they'll come into a lobby they'll have
like<00:02:54.239> two<00:02:54.480> hours<00:02:54.840> played<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.440> there'll<00:02:56.310> be<00:02:56.340> a
