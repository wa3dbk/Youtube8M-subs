00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 now to arthur matveev in these moments 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.790
 Our correspondent drove to the place 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.500
 the fall of the IL-76 transport aircraft on 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.510
 board downed by the militias in Lugansk 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.179
 IL-76 was remind 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.969
 40 Ukrainian soldiers and 9 members 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.529
 the crew they all died site reports 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.609

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.199
 Arthur is directly connected with us 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:25.970

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.970

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.420
 who are the national militia also 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.590
 This technique also died 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.590
 which is 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.449

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.189

00:01:48.170 --> 00:02:04.050
 so no need to come on the river romance 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:05.190
 but thanks arthur be careful on 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.050
