00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.330
 Today I do wp number three so 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.310
 wanted progress number three to mine 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.310
 job project yes that was yesterday 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.320
 a lot done today but nothing 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.060
 Yesterday something happened because 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.880
 Yesterday like you might mine 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.740
 my breckling could see unboxing 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.490
 at least two have arrived 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:40.360
 the three packages today is the third 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:44.600
 packet arrived with the figures 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:50.530
 yes that means I've got 25 now I know 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:52.670
 I think these three tones 24 24 now 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.550
 I think if I like that well 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:00.650
 Especially since I can do that too 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.360
 So, about 15 July , I have started 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.400
 time here so I have it 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.090
 Water used for the first time in the 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.360
 water stripes make this one 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.100
 beach shore part of water here with 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.259
 dark and bright blog already on the edge 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.799
 so a bit with transparent stone 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:21.259
 For this foaming water there is sand 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.060
 at the beach always have before so 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.749
 a wall of transparent stone 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.170
 I made that water with it 

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:32.329
 sometimes the water does not fall down here 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.020
 have been a few vehicles as 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:38.090
 set up where wise set up but 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.369
 do not know exactly how they exist now 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.880
 stay 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:45.889
 Then I have the mosque construction 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.009
 So I built a roscheba I have it 

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:51.590
 now done so actually is the 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.359
 app he is so oblique partially or 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.579
 not exactly grown but it can be 

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:56.689
 the palisade stones as bad 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.310
 and I wanted to do this 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:02.659
 Use palisade stone because you can use it 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:06.229
 just these are not round but from 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.240
 looks at the depreciations of ponds 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.200
 it's on of all the building techniques that I do 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.370
 have seen so far 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.650
 perhaps the roundest from corn 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.350
 so grundstein has but they are like 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.520
 Rare 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.220
 not where I'm the somehow me now 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.530
 but could find so well I think so 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.420
 First of all, it's good that I have more 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.140
 Worth it a bit rounder 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.550
 and tree looks similar to that 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.010
 grow is as you want 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.070
 but I think he is quite good 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.350
 become certain astra nastran made 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.300
 here above dark green leaves that 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.930
 Baumhaus was slightly changed 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:46.710
 By the way, that's what he has here 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.050
 Well in house then well I have 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.280
 here these these dig in here 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.900
 bit of it comes up front too 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.650
 these stones or what i know to wall 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.000
 where you are going to stand behind 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.160
 here are the smaller trees 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.750
 maybe with such a tree report one 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.690
 second big tree but there I do 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.430
 not him these pages always a lot 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.170
 thanks but six with it 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.390
 the stable for the tree house better 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.680
 Unfortunately I can not look second 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.780
 making palisade arch 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.990
 That's why I might as well 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.060
 Use these palms to have a look 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.770
 Should they still blue plates he 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.570
 looks a bit shitty but i know 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.340
 that is intentionally I did it because no 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.710
 other plates taken because these too 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.300
 go because there and there so hill or 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:33.960
 rock is coming as the year is yes 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:40.320
 otherwise there is earth and grass surface there 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:46.380
 come on it all over it then plant 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:48.870
 I think so at the back corners 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.890
 it now when there will be no trees 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.660
 Because of the area therefore also on the beach 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.250
 coffee has not grown so much 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.660
 Wednesday therefore already not grow 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.120
 so with bending the trees are the first 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.560
 from the edge where the frog is 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.270
 it caught the first of 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.790
 that means in the middle no trees and 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.020
 be on like this 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.650
 yes, I also have a few total 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:16.109
 Plates that I have in such a small 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.970
 mini moke in it is somehow so saves 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.130
 that would still need sand surfaces 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.410
 can increase influence 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.060
 yes I will also something from 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.980
 transition time a little bit better 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.600
 this is not so angular here 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.150
 is something more irregular 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.700
 looks like what's happening here too 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.860
 will be there and once three leaflets 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:39.310
 we'll have to do that too 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.050
 also a bit just done so much 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:45.250
 for the planning or what I now 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:48.420
 So I thought next wp 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.770
 I will do if I do the rest 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.800
 Maybe I made the rocks 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.450
 or have something here too 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.540
 have become irregular then 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:03.850
 I think I'm still a bip for the 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:06.280
 Plant and do and one for the 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:09.760
 detailing and the figures and 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:13.500
 scenes and so on then that's it 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.500
 until nothing bye
