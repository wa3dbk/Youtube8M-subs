intersection<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:58.170> allows<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.560> to<00:00:58.680> make<00:00:58.800> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
intersection it allows you to make the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.130

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
same left hand guitar shapes that you

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.290 
same left hand guitar shapes that you
normally<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.550> would<00:01:02.670> make<00:01:02.850> playing<00:01:03.149> a

normally that you would make playing a
real<00:01:03.480> guitar<00:01:03.890> so<00:01:04.890> it's<00:01:05.070> it's<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:06.079> pretty<00:01:07.079> good

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
real guitar so it's it's a pretty good

real guitar so it's it's a pretty good
simulation<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.280> pretty<00:01:08.550> good<00:01:08.670> teaching

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090

the<00:01:11.460> guitar<00:01:11.810> in<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.350> buttons<00:01:13.680> are<00:01:13.800> easy

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
the guitar in that the buttons are easy

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.020 
the guitar in that the buttons are easy
to<00:01:14.100> press<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.460> don't<00:01:14.610> have<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.820> develop

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
to press you don't have to develop

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.360 
to press you don't have to develop
calluses<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.200> left<00:01:16.380> hand<00:01:16.470> has<00:01:16.770> buttons<00:01:17.190> to

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
calluses so the left hand has buttons to

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.820 
calluses so the left hand has buttons to
simulate<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.420> left<00:01:18.659> hand<00:01:18.930> sort<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.530> chord

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830

right-hander strumming hand we actually

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.250 
right-hander strumming hand we actually
have<00:01:26.310> six<00:01:26.640> simulated<00:01:27.270> strings<00:01:27.690> that<00:01:28.020> will

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
have six simulated strings that will

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.820 
have six simulated strings that will
pick<00:01:28.620> up<00:01:28.940> where<00:01:29.940> you<00:01:29.970> pluck<00:01:30.330> and<00:01:30.830> translate
