I don't really know what originally put

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:16.760 
I don't really know what originally put
it<00:00:16.109> into<00:00:16.320> my<00:00:16.410> head

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
it into my head

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.529 
it into my head
I'm<00:00:16.830> not<00:00:17.039> entirely<00:00:17.520> sure<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:18.060> think<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.359> big<00:00:18.510> part

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539

I'm not entirely sure I think a big part
of<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.840> though<00:00:18.930> was<00:00:19.080> working<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.740> going<00:00:19.770> to

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
of it though was working and going to

car shows and just seeing different
things<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.470> people<00:00:22.590> I'd<00:00:22.769> built

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:37.810 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.060

car<00:00:50.710> when<00:00:51.710> we<00:00:51.800> first<00:00:51.980> got<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:52.220> car<00:00:52.370> home<00:00:52.640> we

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
car when we first got the car home we

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.119 
car when we first got the car home we
put<00:00:53.570> it<00:00:53.660> into<00:00:53.809> the<00:00:54.020> backyard<00:00:54.440> because<00:00:54.860> I

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
put it into the backyard because I

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:56.470 
put it into the backyard because I
wanted<00:00:55.309> to<00:00:55.400> get<00:00:55.520> started<00:00:55.790> right<00:00:56.000> away<00:00:56.120> of

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
wanted to get started right away of

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.100 
wanted to get started right away of
course<00:00:56.510> and<00:00:57.350> so<00:00:58.070> be<00:00:58.670> I<00:00:58.879> was<00:00:59.150> literally<00:00:59.870> sitting

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
course and so be I was literally sitting

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.319 
course and so be I was literally sitting
there<00:01:00.350> looking<00:01:00.590> at<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:00.710> car<00:01:00.890> and<00:01:01.010> I'm<00:01:01.070> like

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
there looking at the car and I'm like

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:08.230 
there looking at the car and I'm like
okay<00:01:02.329> where<00:01:02.960> do<00:01:03.110> I<00:01:03.140> start<00:01:06.880> this<00:01:07.880> is<00:01:08.150> the

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
okay where do I start this is the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.790 
okay where do I start this is the
hardest<00:01:08.540> one<00:01:08.600> to<00:01:08.660> get<00:01:08.840> can<00:01:09.020> you<00:01:09.110> can't<00:01:09.650> see

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
hardest one to get can you can't see

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.230 
hardest one to get can you can't see
where<00:01:09.920> you're<00:01:10.009> where<00:01:10.250> sleev<00:01:10.610> is<00:01:10.820> down<00:01:11.030> there

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
where you're where sleev is down there

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.180 
where you're where sleev is down there
yeah<00:01:11.660> the<00:01:12.050> bottom<00:01:12.170> stroke<00:01:12.560> of<00:01:12.649> the<00:01:12.710> piston<00:01:12.830> is

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
yeah the bottom stroke of the piston is

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.249 
yeah the bottom stroke of the piston is
so<00:01:13.820> you<00:01:13.910> want<00:01:14.030> to<00:01:14.119> be<00:01:14.180> just<00:01:14.390> like<00:01:14.570> just<00:01:14.990> above

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
so you want to be just like just above

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:21.400 
so you want to be just like just above
that<00:01:15.550> yeah<00:01:18.700> when<00:01:19.700> we<00:01:19.880> immerse<00:01:20.210> ourself<00:01:20.420> a<00:01:20.899> big

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
that yeah when we immerse ourself a big

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.710 
that yeah when we immerse ourself a big
project<00:01:21.680> or<00:01:22.100> a<00:01:22.160> problem<00:01:22.670> set<00:01:22.940> without<00:01:23.330> even

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
project or a problem set without even

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.109 
project or a problem set without even
necessarily<00:01:23.869> knowing<00:01:24.590> why<00:01:25.190> or<00:01:25.520> what<00:01:25.970> the

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
necessarily knowing why or what the

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.719 
necessarily knowing why or what the
outcome<00:01:26.149> is<00:01:26.690> we<00:01:26.990> have<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:27.470> opportunity<00:01:28.160> to

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
outcome is we have the opportunity to

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.170 
outcome is we have the opportunity to
learn<00:01:28.940> new<00:01:29.300> things<00:01:29.440> that<00:01:30.440> are<00:01:30.860> unlike<00:01:31.190> any

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
learn new things that are unlike any

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.219 
learn new things that are unlike any
other<00:01:32.299> opportunity<00:01:33.820> look<00:01:34.820> at<00:01:34.940> that<00:01:35.229> real

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
other opportunity look at that real

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.149 
other opportunity look at that real
close<00:01:36.560> bad<00:01:36.830> most<00:01:37.190> you<00:01:37.690> the<00:01:38.690> project<00:01:39.350> itself<00:01:39.770> is

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
close bad most you the project itself is

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.340 
close bad most you the project itself is
creating<00:01:41.090> opportunities<00:01:41.750> for<00:01:41.780> her<00:01:42.049> to<00:01:42.170> learn

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
creating opportunities for her to learn

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.130 
creating opportunities for her to learn
that<00:01:42.740> she<00:01:43.180> didn't<00:01:44.180> set<00:01:44.360> out<00:01:44.540> for<00:01:44.810> that<00:01:44.990> to

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
that she didn't set out for that to

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.520 
that she didn't set out for that to
happen<00:01:46.270> so<00:01:47.270> what<00:01:47.479> I'm<00:01:47.630> doing<00:01:47.659> right<00:01:48.290> now<00:01:48.350> is

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
happen so what I'm doing right now is

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.130 
happen so what I'm doing right now is
I'm<00:01:49.280> using<00:01:49.640> telescope<00:01:50.570> gauges<00:01:50.990> and

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
I'm using telescope gauges and

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.830 
I'm using telescope gauges and
micrometers<00:01:51.710> to<00:01:52.159> measure<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.420> bore<00:01:53.630> of<00:01:53.750> the

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
micrometers to measure the bore of the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.020 
micrometers to measure the bore of the
cylinder<00:01:54.380> in<00:01:54.770> three<00:01:55.520> different<00:01:55.729> locations

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
cylinder in three different locations

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.539 
cylinder in three different locations
top<00:01:56.600> middle<00:01:57.229> and<00:01:57.290> bottom<00:01:57.380> then<00:01:58.310> I'm<00:01:58.430> also

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
top middle and bottom then I'm also

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.570 
top middle and bottom then I'm also
measuring<00:01:59.210> the<00:01:59.750> diameter<00:02:00.619> of<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.040> piston<00:02:01.220> to

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
measuring the diameter of the piston to

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.490 
measuring the diameter of the piston to
make<00:02:01.729> sure<00:02:01.880> that<00:02:02.180> my<00:02:02.360> tolerance<00:02:02.869> levels<00:02:03.260> are

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
make sure that my tolerance levels are

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.630 
make sure that my tolerance levels are
where<00:02:03.799> they're<00:02:03.950> supposed<00:02:03.979> to<00:02:04.340> be

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.889 

imagine<00:02:09.640> if<00:02:09.759> she<00:02:09.910> kind<00:02:10.119> of<00:02:10.239> did<00:02:10.420> this<00:02:10.599> as<00:02:10.780> an

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
imagine if she kind of did this as an

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.619 
imagine if she kind of did this as an
exercise<00:02:11.349> on<00:02:11.650> paper<00:02:11.980> or<00:02:12.430> watched<00:02:12.940> someone

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
exercise on paper or watched someone

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.990 
exercise on paper or watched someone
else<00:02:13.780> do<00:02:14.110> it<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.769> amount<00:02:15.160> of<00:02:15.280> real<00:02:15.819> learning

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
else do it the amount of real learning

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.240 
else do it the amount of real learning
that<00:02:16.300> would<00:02:16.390> happen<00:02:16.750> would<00:02:16.900> be<00:02:16.930> minimal<00:02:17.290> so

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
that would happen would be minimal so

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.250 
that would happen would be minimal so
it's<00:02:18.459> it's<00:02:18.760> really<00:02:18.849> that<00:02:19.150> almost<00:02:19.629> that<00:02:19.840> diving

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
it's it's really that almost that diving

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.070 
it's it's really that almost that diving
off<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.739> cliff<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:22.060> into<00:02:22.629> something

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
off the cliff and and into something

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.809 
off the cliff and and into something
that<00:02:23.110> is<00:02:23.560> really<00:02:23.980> too<00:02:24.280> risky

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
that is really too risky

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.420 
that is really too risky
you<00:02:24.940> know<00:02:25.060> she's<00:02:25.650> spending<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:26.739> lot<00:02:26.920> of<00:02:26.950> time<00:02:27.069> on

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
you know she's spending a lot of time on

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.130 
you know she's spending a lot of time on
this<00:02:27.580> and<00:02:27.760> yet<00:02:28.330> she's<00:02:28.599> holding<00:02:28.930> it<00:02:28.989> all

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
this and yet she's holding it all

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.350 
this and yet she's holding it all
together<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.830> I<00:02:29.950> think<00:02:30.370> that's<00:02:30.550> that's

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
together and I think that's that's

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.390 
together and I think that's that's
pretty<00:02:31.750> amazing<00:02:34.860> when<00:02:35.860> I<00:02:35.920> first<00:02:36.160> started

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
pretty amazing when I first started

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.949 
pretty amazing when I first started
school<00:02:36.730> like<00:02:37.209> all<00:02:37.390> through<00:02:37.599> elementary

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
school like all through elementary

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.600 
school like all through elementary
school<00:02:38.170> really<00:02:38.590> I<00:02:38.620> wasn't<00:02:39.069> very<00:02:39.160> good<00:02:39.280> at<00:02:39.459> math

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
school really I wasn't very good at math

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.690 
school really I wasn't very good at math
at<00:02:39.819> all<00:02:39.940> like<00:02:40.209> I<00:02:40.450> had<00:02:41.200> so<00:02:41.560> many<00:02:41.709> issues<00:02:41.950> like<00:02:42.519> we

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
at all like I had so many issues like we

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.339 
at all like I had so many issues like we
do<00:02:42.880> flashcards<00:02:43.450> every<00:02:43.630> night<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.019> I'd<00:02:44.110> still

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
do flashcards every night and I'd still

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.610 
do flashcards every night and I'd still
just<00:02:44.620> completely<00:02:45.400> not<00:02:45.670> understand<00:02:46.239> it<00:02:46.420> and<00:02:47.260> so

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
just completely not understand it and so

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.830 
just completely not understand it and so
like<00:02:48.040> as<00:02:48.220> I<00:02:48.310> got<00:02:48.459> older<00:02:48.760> it<00:02:48.790> starts<00:02:49.209> to<00:02:49.420> be<00:02:49.569> a

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
like as I got older it starts to be a

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.120 
like as I got older it starts to be a
problem<00:02:50.290> you<00:02:50.319> know<00:02:50.500> cuz<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:50.739> can't<00:02:50.950> really

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
problem you know cuz you can't really

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:58.900 
problem you know cuz you can't really
pass<00:02:51.280> school<00:02:51.640> without<00:02:51.790> knowing<00:02:52.150> that

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.000 

then<00:02:59.540> I<00:02:59.780> started<00:03:00.080> on<00:03:00.170> this<00:03:00.290> car<00:03:00.590> and<00:03:00.620> I<00:03:00.830> could

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
then I started on this car and I could

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.310 
then I started on this car and I could
take<00:03:01.220> on<00:03:02.000> lessons<00:03:02.510> I<00:03:02.600> learned<00:03:02.840> from<00:03:02.960> the<00:03:03.080> car

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
take on lessons I learned from the car

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.530 
take on lessons I learned from the car
and<00:03:03.590> how<00:03:03.860> I'd<00:03:03.980> used<00:03:04.190> it<00:03:04.400> mathematically<00:03:04.580> to<00:03:05.270> do

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
and how I'd used it mathematically to do

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.120 
and how I'd used it mathematically to do
and<00:03:05.870> solve<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.350> problems<00:03:06.680> in<00:03:06.830> the<00:03:06.980> classroom

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
and solve the problems in the classroom

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.980 
and solve the problems in the classroom
and<00:03:08.000> that's<00:03:08.240> for<00:03:08.420> sure<00:03:08.540> it's<00:03:08.690> at<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:11.750> most

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
and that's for sure it's at the most

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.930 
and that's for sure it's at the most
basic<00:03:12.230> level<00:03:12.470> since<00:03:13.280> you're<00:03:13.430> learning<00:03:13.790> to

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
basic level since you're learning to

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.730 
basic level since you're learning to
learn<00:03:14.120> so<00:03:14.780> you're<00:03:15.020> becoming<00:03:15.350> a<00:03:15.530> better

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
learn so you're becoming a better

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.700 
learn so you're becoming a better
learner<00:03:16.100> and<00:03:16.670> your<00:03:17.600> engagement<00:03:18.290> around

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
learner and your engagement around

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.130 
learner and your engagement around
learning<00:03:19.310> is<00:03:19.400> higher<00:03:19.670> you're<00:03:20.180> going<00:03:20.480> to<00:03:20.690> be

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
learning is higher you're going to be

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.410 
learning is higher you're going to be
more<00:03:21.320> receptive<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:22.010> open<00:03:22.100> to<00:03:22.490> new<00:03:22.850> forms<00:03:23.270> of

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
more receptive and open to new forms of

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.790 
more receptive and open to new forms of
learning<00:03:23.510> even<00:03:23.930> ones<00:03:24.110> that<00:03:24.230> don't<00:03:24.440> especially

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
learning even ones that don't especially

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.760 
learning even ones that don't especially
work<00:03:25.190> for<00:03:25.460> you<00:03:25.610> that's<00:03:26.300> way<00:03:26.510> too<00:03:26.540> small<00:03:26.780> some

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
work for you that's way too small some

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.530 
work for you that's way too small some
of<00:03:27.830> the<00:03:28.010> examples<00:03:28.430> in<00:03:28.520> my<00:03:28.550> car<00:03:28.850> for<00:03:29.090> math<00:03:29.240> is

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
of the examples in my car for math is

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.330 
of the examples in my car for math is
like<00:03:29.600> converting<00:03:30.260> metric<00:03:30.740> to<00:03:30.920> standard

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
like converting metric to standard

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.880 
like converting metric to standard
systems<00:03:31.790> and<00:03:32.090> just<00:03:32.870> learning<00:03:33.530> how<00:03:33.560> to<00:03:33.650> measure

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
systems and just learning how to measure

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.560 
systems and just learning how to measure
and<00:03:34.160> place<00:03:34.400> parts<00:03:34.850> in<00:03:35.060> to<00:03:35.180> be<00:03:35.240> able<00:03:35.390> to

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
and place parts in to be able to

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.780 
and place parts in to be able to
understand<00:03:36.530> how<00:03:36.710> much<00:03:36.980> tolerance<00:03:37.340> you<00:03:37.580> need

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
understand how much tolerance you need

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.730 
understand how much tolerance you need
for<00:03:38.030> it<00:03:38.150> and<00:03:38.420> so<00:03:38.660> it<00:03:38.810> helps<00:03:39.110> to<00:03:39.320> learn<00:03:39.500> your

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
for it and so it helps to learn your

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:47.200 
for it and so it helps to learn your
mathematical<00:03:40.280> systems<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:46.430> form<00:03:46.730> it's<00:03:47.030> been

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 
mathematical systems the form it's been

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.520 
mathematical systems the form it's been
a<00:03:47.240> really<00:03:47.480> big<00:03:47.630> part<00:03:47.660> of<00:03:47.900> this<00:03:48.020> project

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
a really big part of this project

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.710 
a really big part of this project
because<00:03:48.770> it's<00:03:49.220> an<00:03:49.310> online<00:03:49.460> place<00:03:50.210> where<00:03:50.540> you

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
because it's an online place where you

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.140 
because it's an online place where you
post<00:03:51.320> comments<00:03:51.980> almost<00:03:52.280> like<00:03:52.430> Facebook<00:03:52.940> and

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
post comments almost like Facebook and

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.060 
post comments almost like Facebook and
it's<00:03:53.780> called<00:03:54.020> the<00:03:54.200> Pennock<00:03:54.470> sphere<00:03:54.770> form

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
it's called the Pennock sphere form

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.830 
it's called the Pennock sphere form
because<00:03:55.460> it's<00:03:55.670> pretty<00:03:56.090> much<00:03:56.240> all<00:03:56.510> based<00:03:56.720> on

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
because it's pretty much all based on

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.690 
because it's pretty much all based on
fierros<00:03:57.610> so<00:03:58.610> yeah<00:03:58.790> this<00:03:59.090> is<00:03:59.270> your<00:03:59.390> welded<00:04:00.700> and

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
fierros so yeah this is your welded and

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.030 
fierros so yeah this is your welded and
there's<00:04:02.480> some<00:04:02.630> of<00:04:02.720> your<00:04:02.810> nice<00:04:02.930> holes<00:04:03.230> are<00:04:03.800> your

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
there's some of your nice holes are your

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.340 
there's some of your nice holes are your
favorite<00:04:04.400> I'll<00:04:04.490> finish<00:04:04.750> you<00:04:05.750> go<00:04:05.900> in<00:04:06.050> and

favorite I'll finish you go in and
there's<00:04:07.280> people<00:04:07.490> working<00:04:07.940> on<00:04:08.240> all<00:04:08.390> kinds<00:04:08.420> of

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
there's people working on all kinds of

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.570 
there's people working on all kinds of
different<00:04:09.140> projects<00:04:09.620> to<00:04:10.070> do<00:04:10.190> with<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:10.370> Barrow

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
different projects to do with the Barrow

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.180 
different projects to do with the Barrow
or<00:04:10.850> just<00:04:11.630> sharing<00:04:12.110> feedback<00:04:12.410> or<00:04:12.860> suggestions

or just sharing feedback or suggestions
it's<00:04:13.520> kind<00:04:13.880> of<00:04:13.910> like<00:04:14.060> having<00:04:14.209> a<00:04:14.360> bigger<00:04:14.570> form

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
it's kind of like having a bigger form

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.740 
it's kind of like having a bigger form
of<00:04:15.140> family<00:04:15.440> really<00:04:15.980> on<00:04:16.160> the<00:04:16.370> forum

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.309 

definitely<00:05:02.120> think<00:05:02.300> about<00:05:02.389> how<00:05:02.750> school<00:05:03.139> could

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:03.319 
definitely think about how school could

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:04.659 
definitely think about how school could
be<00:05:03.349> better<00:05:03.530> if<00:05:03.680> they<00:05:03.830> had<00:05:04.009> more<00:05:04.190> interactive

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
be better if they had more interactive

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:06.249 
be better if they had more interactive
projects<00:05:05.270> because<00:05:05.539> there<00:05:05.690> are<00:05:05.750> so<00:05:05.870> many<00:05:05.900> kids

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:06.259 
projects because there are so many kids

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:08.680 
projects because there are so many kids
who<00:05:06.680> don't<00:05:07.340> get<00:05:07.550> to<00:05:07.819> go<00:05:07.940> on<00:05:07.969> and<00:05:08.300> learn<00:05:08.449> what

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
who don't get to go on and learn what

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.029 
who don't get to go on and learn what
they<00:05:08.780> could<00:05:08.930> really<00:05:09.050> do<00:05:09.289> because<00:05:09.710> they<00:05:09.889> don't

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 
they could really do because they don't

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:12.700 
they could really do because they don't
have<00:05:10.099> these<00:05:10.370> opportunities<00:05:11.120> and<00:05:11.659> so<00:05:12.440> I<00:05:12.500> think

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
have these opportunities and so I think

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.439 
have these opportunities and so I think
that<00:05:12.830> it's<00:05:12.979> like<00:05:13.099> schools<00:05:13.610> could<00:05:13.879> offer<00:05:14.060> more

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:14.449 
that it's like schools could offer more

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:17.290 
that it's like schools could offer more
interactive<00:05:15.289> more<00:05:15.919> what<00:05:16.669> you<00:05:16.819> want<00:05:17.000> to<00:05:17.120> do
