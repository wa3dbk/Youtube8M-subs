thing<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:40.079> can<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.350> bring<00:01:40.530> this<00:01:40.740> out<00:01:40.950> to

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
thing is I can you bring this out to

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.039 
thing is I can you bring this out to
either<00:01:41.400> place<00:01:41.640> deal<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.509> if<00:01:42.600> i<00:01:42.659> bring<00:01:42.780> this<00:01:42.899> on

want a semi tail right huh oh yeah if

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:44.070 
want a semi tail right huh oh yeah if
just<00:07:42.279> X<00:07:42.430> not<00:07:42.639> hit<00:07:42.849> like<00:07:43.029> if<00:07:43.059> redox<00:07:43.599> isn't<00:07:43.960> it

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.080 
just X not hit like if redox isn't it

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:50.830 
play this deck s sanatana depending on

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.290 
play this deck s sanatana depending on
how<00:07:50.889> magnetic<00:07:51.099> if<00:07:51.339> it's<00:07:51.459> a<00:07:51.550> slow<00:07:51.729> format<00:07:52.149> this

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:52.300 
how magnetic if it's a slow format this

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.139 
how magnetic if it's a slow format this
text<00:07:52.569> really<00:07:52.779> fast<00:07:52.899> like<00:07:53.580> it<00:07:54.580> and<00:07:54.759> each<00:07:54.909> one

00:07:55.139 --> 00:07:55.149 
text really fast like it and each one

00:07:55.149 --> 00:08:05.850 
text really fast like it and each one
turn<00:07:55.360> to<00:07:55.479> explode<00:07:55.810> and<00:07:56.139> i'll<00:07:56.259> go<00:07:56.349> on
