00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.090
 hello to all small rallies and 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.040
 menestrales to my channel 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.600
 I am Andrea and in today's video as 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.550
 I told you, I will try to do some 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.070
 video more on Sundays I want to do them and 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.050
 fast and dynamic videos where 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.340
 can also jump a little more in this 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.840
 Occasion has decided to make a book tag 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.490
 I really wanted to do it is the one 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.010
 social networks and I've been looking 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.500
 some girl and I've seen the claw 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.180
 so he took the questions from there 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.790
 I will leave below the video in which clau 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.100
 did this like and let's start I have not 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.870
 actually thought the answers hardly 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.780
 I've read the questions to make it that way 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.219
 like that much more dynamic or real or 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.960
 that is the first book that I pass 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.910
 by the head the first social network is 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.219
 twitter and I have to choose my book 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.469
 short favorite well short so I've cut 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:58.829
 chosen the 100 have a total of from 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:01.500
 300 pages and is cortito is exactly 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.570
 very interesting I liked it very much not 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.970
 I had read like that so nothing 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.009
 when I picked up this book I loved it 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.509
 also the series I like a lot and I 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.220
 I recommend because you read right away 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.409
 hook a lot there is a lot of 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.909
 characters and is very original so 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.039
 less it seemed to me 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.719
 on facebook social networks and I have to 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:21.109
 choose a book that I was pressured to 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:21.109
 read 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.220
 This was a book that I asked you 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.020
 I asked you to press me, you are going to read it 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.390
 because really, if not not 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.990
 could Ivonne talk about him in the video of 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.280
 Tuesday 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.740
 I'm going to leave you here in case 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.380
 you want to see see my opinion about him and 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.780
 see if it helped me to press or not 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.030
 the next social network is so blair and 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.130
 I have to say a book that I read before 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.070
 that was famous since it was cool 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.620
 You can know what happened to me with a couple of 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.050
 books I think exactly happened to me with 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.020
 'twilight' and with shadow hunters 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.540
 against muscle was that joffrÃ© counted 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.400
 before a bookstore in which then they 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.040
 a lot of books arrived before 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.630
 that they were published so that they 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.580
 take a look and such and give the 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.380
 opinion to the publisher then once 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.690
 they let me read 'twilight' in a 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.880
 gallera da is to say that it was like a 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.950
 first try a first draft before 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.750
 of being published definitively is a 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.670
 moment so I did not re- read it 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.320
 but at the time I liked it so much 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.170
 what was this and then when it came out was 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.450
 as it is worth I have read it 50,000 ago 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.620
 years that happened to me with hunters of 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.360
 shadows melo 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.489
 and very small and I think she 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.920
 recommended once that's why that's why 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.330
 that maybe I do not get so excited 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.610
 sure to read them now I would like 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.379
 a lot but I need time to do it 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.480
 messily I remember big 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.069
 big spoilers big spoilers of the 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.269
 plot then you do not do like reading it 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.500
 from scratch but that this one I discovered 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.180
 when he had just left in Spanish 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.500
 aythami happened to me with the games of 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.319
 hunger ' is very curious because I 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.720
 recommended a lot of people and people 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.900
 like he did not want to read it or he said in 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.640
 plan there I do not know that I do not like such and 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.170
 then it became very fashionable and all the 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.489
 world began to read it the people who 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.230
 he had been recommended and he did not want to 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:10.209
 read and it was like nothing's worth but good 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.099
 the fact is that I read it so soon 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.690
 just leave I had to go back to 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.700
 reread melo when all the hype started 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.519
 of the hunger games ' the next 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.900
 The social network of the book tag is myspace and 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.549
 I have to say a book that were 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.590
 agreements and I liked it or not 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.659
 Without a doubt that book would be Aragon 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.220
 I think I liked it but also a 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:29.319
 I remember that there was one thing that 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.460
 made it a little heavy carrying right now 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.100
 I can not say 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.290
 if I liked it a lot if you did not like anything if 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.600
 I was indifferent we continued with 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.010
 instagram a book so so beautiful that 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.350
 I had to take a picture and upload it 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.600
 instagram 1 that lake with many many 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.970
 but I will choose as well as my covers 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.430
 favorite although I already made a video of that 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.040
 I'm not going to leave here but I care 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.230
 favorite ideas more I like is the 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.820
 tenth Icelandic asoman of the already soler already 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.890
 He has commented on several occasions 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.470
 colors partly in precious and the 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.150
 calligraphy of the letters is super spin 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.890
 youtube a book that I want to see 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.540
 become film 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.940
 that is the selection but my dream has 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.220
 been fulfilled is going to be made film 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.780
 so I really want to see her 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.820
 I think you can do it very well I hope 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.740
 that they do it lately I have enough 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.380
 faith in literary adaptations because 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.300
 I think they're starting to do them well 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.770
 especially from youth books I think that 

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.740
 can be very cool with everyone 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:26.070
 dressed in royalty and all the 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.180
 things about the castle so I feel like 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.530
 goodreads a book that I recommend to all 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.290
 I recommend the world as a whole 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.870
 world in august's lesson so much to 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.370
 young people like my parents indeed 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.060
 my father my mother my grandmother I have 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.800
 read 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.280
 and he liked it very much also 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.389
 you read my boyfriend 's mother or whether 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.800
 recommended to everyone because it is for 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:48.430
 any age is a very nice book what 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.770
 I have here and besides besides apart from the 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.660
 Julia's story that is here they are going to 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.480
 pull out more books so I'm very 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.370
 excited and that as soon as the baby comes out 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.320
 to read the first of everything you do and 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.820
 I do not rule out rereading melo and 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.350
 last is the reader to you a book 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.910
 originally written in Spanish and that 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.889
 I liked it a lot because it's dominating the 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.950
 bookshelf and I think there are some that has 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.919
 been translated into other languages whose 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:14.410
 original language was Castilian but 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:16.270
 I'm not sure so I'm not going to take out 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.979
 one and then not be because it's going to 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.930
 look very bad so this question is 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.100
 will be blank and that's already been 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.810
 today's video I hope you have 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.910
 liked to leave my networks here 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.130
 social and if you like this dynamic of 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.200
 a quick video on Sundays as it is 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.760
 cool I'll sign it and continue 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.100
 doing whenever I can if you have 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.229
 come here you have to leave me in 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.330
 the comments the following phrase percy 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:39.700
 jackson sleeps with a pair of piglets 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.960
 roses and I send you a very strong kiss 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.860
 and see you in the next video 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.860
 goodbye
