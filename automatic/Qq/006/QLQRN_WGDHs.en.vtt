00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.279
 and we are already with another idea of ​​biology 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.910
 this time with the types of air already in the 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.830
 channel I explained a few times ago that 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.950
 were the hostages of their duties 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.280
 general characteristics and so on but 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.840
 today we are going to explain what are the 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:25.770
 types that I would have rm but before 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:28.170
 get fully into the types for 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.810
 that they understand a little better in what 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.750
 each one appears and for what purpose 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.149
 they use what it is that explains after 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.790
 I'm going to explain to you a bit how the 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.700
 general process what happens 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.800
 I tried to draw some cells but 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.110
 he has not put organelles apart from the nucleus 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.240
 so that they are not going to confuse this 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.330
 it would be our core which is where it happens 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.300
 the translation process and then what's 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.770
 outside it would simply be the cytoplasm 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.220
 where the transcription process occurs 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.080
 of the rm 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.900
 then let's start inside 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:08.760
 our core we have our double 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:11.520
 dn air helix and here appears a 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.940
 green chain with an air in the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.580
 polymerase 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:20.170
 this arn polymerase molecule in what 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:22.840
 what it does is that it reads the dead thread that 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.480
 we are going to use our DNA for 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.930
 make a complementary in rm 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.770
 this air n polymerase will go reading 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.770
 every 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:40.400
 each gel to be copied to make 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.860
 the chain would be DNA and in the sand 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.159
 client be complementary you have to 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:49.520
 keep in mind that in the DNA is used 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:52.610
 adenine or anima cytosine and thymine but 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.860
 in the air of the thyme we will change it 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.590
 for now if not then it would be adelina 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.990
 Huarina cytosine and asylum in the air 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.329
 that is a mistake that can be made and 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.990
 you have to take into account then if the 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:11.310
 air in the polymerase in the DNA reads us 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:14.519
 adenine for the protein rn of January if 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.640
 for the adherent he would have to place a 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.920
 racing or if you read a cytosine goes to 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.530
 put a guanine if you read a guanine 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.459
 in the DNA it will place a situation in 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:32.569
 the network and if you read a tub in the cade me 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:32.569
 will place an adenine in the air 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:48.349
 and then when we have already translated 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:49.840
 an air chain in this leaves the 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.480
 nucleus 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.209
 with 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.510
 the air in a messenger and the a de reine 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:02.670
 transfer they enter their functions in 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:05.830
 this part there are also ribosomes 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:09.370
 amino acids to go forming by this 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.950
 process that chains are made 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.900
 for the proteins until you reach 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.760
 our interim proteins for real 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.920
 these two have been more or less clear 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.530
 processes, let's start with the 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.930
 rd types we start with the air of 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.390
 messenger its structure is linear 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.360
 except in some areas where they are formed 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.750
 hairpins originate within the nucleus 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.510
 cell using a thread as a mold 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.299
 of DNA its main function is to copy 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.650
 the genetic information of the DNA and 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:42.700
 take it to the ribosomes so that 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.819
 follow from the translation process 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.650
 towards transcription taking it from 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:51.329
 inside the nucleus towards then we go to 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.080
 continue with the air in the ribosome whose 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.780
 structure 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.750
 present the four nitrogen bases 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.660
 and some methylated also has zones 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.940
 of double helix and this ere in the 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.160
 ribosome mikko linked to basic proteins 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.620
 they form the rivers or so they 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.410
 would find in these gas zones then 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.510
 we have the air in the core whose 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.330
 structure is variable although it looks 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.140
 to the air in the ribosome that is 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:23.050
 finds attached to different proteins 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:27.390
 forming the nucleus what originates 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:31.240
 from fragments of DNA denominated 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:33.550
 organizing region of the lar nucleus and a 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.700
 Once this air is formed in the 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.920
 core fragments to yield the 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.810
 different types of wheat and DNA 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.310
 last would have to show the DNA 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.530
 transparent 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.840
 which contains in addition to the bases 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.990
 common nitrogenated guanine sand 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.600
 cytosine and brazil also contain 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.710
 nucleotides with nitrogenous bases 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.900
 totally different 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.010
 It is made up of relatively molecules 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.440
 small whose function is to act as 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:05.370
 carriers of the amino acids 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.370
 specific to ribosomes 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:16.920
 to finish with the transferring arn 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.120
 drawn this structure that is yours 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.310
 imagine that in the part that they are 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.140
 lines nothing else there are also balls with 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.810
 the nitrogenous bases is that in my 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:28.210
 small blackboard level track so that they 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:31.870
 I have described how each one is called 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:34.210
 is the arm of this is the arm t this 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.970
 is the anti- colon arm and this is the 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:41.400
 arm to sector this side is always 5 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:45.060
 premium and this side is always the 3 prime 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:47.790
 this is the structure not the dimensional 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:51.230
 of the transparent arn the three-dimensional 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:53.750
 It has a shape of l 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:56.900
 but if you draw it, it's going to be like that 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:59.360
 but when everything completes on the side in 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:02.720
 the extreme five bonuses there are always of 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:06.050
 first a molecule of guanine ion 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:10.700
 free phosphoric acid and in the extreme 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:15.590
 of the three prima there is always a triplet 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:19.810
 to sector of other nucleotides that would be 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:21.960
 is always because this triplet 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:28.350
 is the one that accepts amino acids 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:28.350
 specific for this transparent sand
