00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.470
 hello my name is Dmitri I'm glad 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.360
 greet you in the attic there 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.099
 a lot of people will take about the weather 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.839
 however, only some of them 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:20.390
 appear as a result of summarizing the facts 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:22.279
 and perennial observations and the rest 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.289
 it's just a fantasy having nothing 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.359
 in common with reality let's 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.550
 consider the most interesting and find and 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.560
 physical confirmation let's start with this 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.310
 if swallows fly low soon 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.500
 it will be raining 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.210
 in fact it is not standard 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.910
 The explanation of this omens is 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.710
 swallows are insectivorous animals and in 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.219
 mostly they like to hunt flies and 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.469
 mosquitoes 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.910
 flying into the role and snatching them on the fly 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.339
 air humidity before rain 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.589
 increases and on the wings of insects 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:49.910
 starts to condense 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.980
 microscopic droplets it becomes 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.429
 harder to fly and they rush to 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.530
 earth 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:56.510
 for sure in order to do frequent 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.670
 respites respectively paws 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.249
 rush after them and fly to 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.019
 low altitude but firstly humidity 

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:05.150
 may change for other reasons not 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.190
 necessary because of the approaching rain and 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.350
 secondly recent studies with 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.180
 using slow motion showed that 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.440
 when flying flies and mosquitoes in counties 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.230
 microscopic wings are formed 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.120
 whifles that effectively shake off 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.650
 little droplets and mosquitoes aren't even 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.160
 afraid of raindrops and can 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.020
 fly 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.910
 doing them through and through 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.880
 unbelievable movements like kung fu masters 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.400
 so it will accept only a myth though 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.080
 and very beautiful next sign if 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.790
 bubbles are forming on yours 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.950
 it's a long rain here 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.200
 A little more complicated thing is that with 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.840
 strong enough rain bubbles in the puddles 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.730
 are always formed only during their lifetime 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.190
 may be different all the difference in 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.050
 humidity as soon as a bubble forms 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.210
 molecules from its surface immediately 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.760
 start to evaporate if moisture 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.160
 low then evaporation is very intense 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.820
 the wall of the bubble quickly becomes thin and 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.230
 he disappears escaping our gaze 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.630
 accordingly, if the humidity is high then 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.310
 slow evaporation 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.990
 and long-lived bubbles can hold 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.320
 few seconds and just the same 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.549
 humidity depends on the duration of the rain 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.590
 really small points fast 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.899
 fly by quickly pay rain and 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.209
 fly away quickly and humidity rises 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.310
 slightly contrary long 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.800
 solid rains spill out 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.930
 huge clouds under which humidity is already 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.489
 managed to rise to high values 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.590
 so bubbles in the puddles 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.599
 this is a sure sign of a long rain 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.180
 go on the next sign 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.190
 if smoke spreads on the ground and then wait 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.720
 it is simply due to increased 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.819
 moisture on smoke particles 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.620
 moisture condenses therefore smoke 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.959
 it gets harder and creeps 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.730
 they rise up and most likely 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.980
 this is not the correct explanation because 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.410
 smoke particles are hot air therefore 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.150
 condensation will be difficult so but it 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.890
 luck works, then she has all the same 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.660
 there must be some explanation 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.090
 so what 's the matter imagine 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.670
 density of wet and dry air 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.099
 differ not with the same pressure and 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.390
 moist air will be lighter in temperature 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.760
 than dry 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.040
 strange as it may seem 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.350
 in that the mass of the water molecule is less than 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.060
 mass molecule of oxygen or nitrogen from 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.790
 which mainly consists of air 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.130
 so with increasing humidity in one 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.560
 cubic meter of air, the fraction of light molecules 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.780
 water will grow therefore the cubic meter itself 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.090
 there will be lighter hot smoke lighter than air 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.639
 therefore rises up by the simple 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.560
 Archimedes law however if the air itself 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:26.019
 that buoyancy becomes easier 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.970
 decrease there is nothing left for him 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.850
 except to climb the surface 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.130
 the subject is proven and by the way if wet 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.230
 the air is easier to explain 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.810
 reduce atmospheric pressure before 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.150
 because it is caused by rain 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.579
 air column hanging over us 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.139
 pressure drop explain the main 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.359
 more joint sensitivity 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:48.400
 drowsiness before the rain therefore looking 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:50.500
 weather forecast do not pay attention 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.300
 only on temperature but also on others 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.370
 options 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.930
 this all put likes subscribe to
