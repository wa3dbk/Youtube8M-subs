00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.520
 I'm at the Rijksmuseum today 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.589
 ethnology in Leiden 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.880
 I have an appointment with the alia azzouzi 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.440
 who tells me more about the 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.879
 special exhibition mine 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.769
 desire for mecca 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:15.900
 all Muslims must come here 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.910
 my interest has certainly been aroused 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.230
 I see a map with all the numbers here 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.189
 tell 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.109
 to those numbers that actually stand 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.670
 for the amount of people who matter 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.470
 different parts of the world per 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.939
 years on heart 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.099
 so you see that we are from the Netherlands 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.470
 about 5,000 five thousand to the Netherlands 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.230
 we are the netherlands and about 25,000 the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.620

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.250
 only 200 and 11,000 from indonesia per 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.960
 year 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.090
 nowadays only people need visa 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.370
 but in the past also had animals 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.260
 visa also have how long ago who 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.520
 then well it will be 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.050
 two hundred years ago , years flourish 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.329
 ago have a travel pass here for one 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.379
 donkey and that donkey that you travel with it 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.969

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.710
 with the Egyptian carafe hands to the 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.899
 towards the mecca and in that travel pass 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.609
 is also precisely defined the 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.199
 donkey is a blond and brown locks 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.680

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.620

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.030

 mecca is and you are actually on this 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.840
 very clearly indicated that 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.670
 non-Muslims are not allowed in mecca 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.780
 and this artist has her artwork 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.820
 made of it 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.200
 Muslims may make a line if you 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.750
 if you are a muslim you are allowed in and if you are not 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.670
 if you are a Muslim then you must exit that 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.990
 xchat red exit and which exit must 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.150

 may lead you into your margot allowed anywhere 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.290
 how you really change this one 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.450
 space I see everything around me here 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.070
 use this what what see the meaning of 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.120
 well what you actually shoot here is 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.770
 how people walk around the kaaba 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.030
 during the that people will expire seven 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.470
 times around the beads 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.420
 if you look around you like that you see in 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.980
 the projections you see that people really care 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.970
 you normally walk logically 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.790
 of course 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.160
 around you also see the crabs 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.480
 how many people there are not 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.970
 all day long 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.040
 365 days a year just around the 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.030
 kaaba walk so you are feeling instinctively 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.470
 the middle of those people 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.930
 emotionally you are indeed in it 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.440
 and all those people are walking around you 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.650
 and the 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.970
 I also feel the intensities of beer 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.140
 really i also had real idea for us too 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.330
 it is quite busy here 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.890
 what I see behind me well this is 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.110
 really one of the nicest things in the 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.060
 exhibition I think this is a book 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.250
 he has already started on the Kaaba 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.540
 for the door of the room and this book is 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.459
 now more than 400 years old it was called the 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.810
 voter and earlier was that even in 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.459
 color made this is here 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.780
 green and red and black and gold 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.310
 nowadays it only becomes 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.500
 in black and in gold so is convenience 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.660
 actually very special that this so in 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.980
 Yes in all those colors still bright here this 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.270
 in just really on the cable range 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.830
 really at the door of the chapel 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.790
 just more than 400 years ago 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.500
 400 years ago 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.850
 for the people who can come 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.930
 watch it is in lead and how long 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.310
 takes a stentor vote 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.010
 is exhibition lasts until 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.330
 march 2014 shit certainly about five 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.430
 and half a month to come 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.709
 and lead in the Rijksmuseum 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.450
 ethnology that there is 3 minutes walk 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.920
 from the central station 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.320
 so it is actually for all muslims 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.550
 so definitely worth it 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.550
 all Muslims must come here
