00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
 "Prevention of Age-Related Macular Degeneration through Diet" 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.957
 Anyone who has ever sunburned, 

00:00:09.957 --> 00:00:13.357
 knows how harmful UV rays from sunlight can be. 

00:00:13.357 --> 00:00:15.357
 Imagine what these rays are doing 

00:00:15.357 --> 00:00:18.686
 with the back of our eyeball, the retinas? 

00:00:18.686 --> 00:00:22.041
 The eye is designed to capture sunlight and focus it, 

00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:26.157
 it works much like a magnifying glass, in this case located at the back of the eye. 

00:00:26.157 --> 00:00:29.476
 Fortunately, we have in our eye 

00:00:29.476 --> 00:00:31.558
 a layer of retinal pigment cells, 

00:00:31.558 --> 00:00:35.277
 that promotes and protects our fragile visual system. 

00:00:35.277 --> 00:00:40.862
 This layer creates a supply of yellow plant pigments such as zeaxanthin. 

00:00:40.862 --> 00:00:45.998
 These pigments then absorb blue light and protect the retina from oxidative damage 

00:00:45.998 --> 00:00:49.817
 from the light. Yellowing of our cornea, which occurs during gray cataracts 

00:00:49.817 --> 00:00:54.071
 (cataract), it can actually be the defense mechanism of the body, protecting our retina. 

00:00:54.071 --> 00:00:58.148
 If we have cataract removed surgically, 

00:00:58.148 --> 00:01:01.237
 we risk blindness caused by macular degeneration, 

00:01:01.237 --> 00:01:04.385
 since we removed this protection from the eye. 

00:01:04.385 --> 00:01:07.758
 Instead of replacing one type of sight loss with another, 

00:01:07.758 --> 00:01:10.917
 and instead of coloring the eye lens with cataract 

00:01:10.917 --> 00:01:15.959
 it's better to color the back of your eye with a healthy diet. 

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:20.596
 The pigment at the back of our eye comes exclusively from the diet. 

00:01:20.596 --> 00:01:23.918
 This suggests that the most common cause of blindness 

00:01:23.918 --> 00:01:26.243
 in western countries we could slow down 

00:01:26.243 --> 00:01:31.077
 or even avert a suitable diet. 

00:01:31.077 --> 00:01:33.477
 What is the source of these substances in our diet? 

00:01:33.477 --> 00:01:37.837
 Egg industry boasts that eggs are a good source 

00:01:37.837 --> 00:01:41.557
 but even if you eat eggs almost every day, 6 days a week, for 3 months, 

00:01:41.557 --> 00:01:46.276
 pigmentation in your eyes would remain virtually the same. 

00:01:46.276 --> 00:01:50.317
 Bio eggs with a high lutein content, from the free range, were used in the experiment. 

00:01:50.317 --> 00:01:54.468
 The egg did not come from a supermarket but from a local farm. 

00:01:54.468 --> 00:01:56.505
 Instead of getting phyto-nutrients from eggs, 

00:01:56.505 --> 00:01:58.982
 which had to be brought down by a hen, 

00:01:58.982 --> 00:02:02.437
 that got them from corn and grass, 

00:02:02.437 --> 00:02:05.158
 what to go like this directly to the source? 

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:09.477
 How about a cup of corn and half a cup of spinach a day for three months? 

00:02:09.477 --> 00:02:13.878
 Significant increase in protective eye pigment concentrations. 

00:02:13.878 --> 00:02:19.678
 To compare it with eggs, here's the best that eggs can do. 

00:02:19.678 --> 00:02:23.676
 But if you leave out the mediator in the form of a hen 

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:29.157
 And taking your nutrients straight from the plants, you can achieve this result. 

00:02:29.157 --> 00:02:32.437
 The fact that researchers are attending to the participants is also great on this study 

00:02:32.437 --> 00:02:35.515
 three months after the end of the study, they returned the pigment levels. 

00:02:35.515 --> 00:02:39.558
 And the levels were still high. 

00:02:39.558 --> 00:02:42.357
 So once we build a macular pigment supply with a healthy diet, 

00:02:42.357 --> 00:02:45.365
 our eyeballs are economical. 

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:46.865
 So even if we're on vacation, 

00:02:46.865 --> 00:02:49.957
 where we will eat more iceberg lettuce than spinach 

00:02:49.957 --> 00:02:54.461
 our eyes will last until we return. 

00:02:54.461 --> 00:02:57.716
 Yes, eggs may increase blood levels of zeaxanthin, 

00:02:57.716 --> 00:03:00.905
 but they also increase bad cholesterol levels and the risk of heart disease. 

00:03:00.905 --> 00:03:04.198
 So we cannot recommend eating egg yolk as 

00:03:04.198 --> 00:03:08.518
 a good way to increase zeaxanthin levels. 

00:03:08.518 --> 00:03:13.599
 It would be desirable to consume some cholesterol-free alternative 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.746
 for example, goji fruits, 

00:03:16.746 --> 00:03:19.317
 which have up to 60 times more zeaxanthin than eggs. 

00:03:19.317 --> 00:03:24.488
 Even a small dose significantly increases the level of zeaxanthin in our body. 

00:03:24.488 --> 00:03:28.238
 It is an efficient, safe and cheap method 

00:03:28.238 --> 00:03:30.730
 to increase blood levels of zeaxanthin including only solid foods. 

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:33.652
 However, we do not need this substance in the blood. 

00:03:33.652 --> 00:03:36.038
 We need it in our eyes. 

00:03:36.038 --> 00:03:40.641
 How about making double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled 

00:03:40.641 --> 00:03:44.236
 study? In traditional Chinese medicine, for the preservation of sight in the elderly 

00:03:44.236 --> 00:03:48.876
 it often prescribes the consumption of 40-100 goji fruits per day. 

00:03:48.876 --> 00:03:54.116
 In this study, they only administered 15 fruits a day for 3 months. 

00:03:54.116 --> 00:03:59.038
 Yet it has been found that it can protect against pigment loss 

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:01.315
 and prevent the creation of what we call "soft drusen," 

00:04:01.315 --> 00:04:03.967
 which are the accumulated metabolic products stored at the back of the eye. 

00:04:03.967 --> 00:04:07.679
 Both of these problems are associated with age-related macular degeneration, 

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:11.399
 the main cause of legally recognized blindness in older men and women, 

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:15.117
 affecting more than 10 million Americans. 

00:04:15.117 --> 00:04:19.718
 It should be taken into account that in this study they administered goji with milk, 

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:21.438
 so fat can increase milk fat 

00:04:21.438 --> 00:04:23.472
 absorption of carotenoid pigments. 

00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:25.310
 A healthier way to achieve the same effect 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.196
 is eating goji fruits (goji chinese) together 

00:04:27.196 --> 00:04:33.920
 with nuts or seeds, just put a mixture of nuts and dried fruits including goji.
