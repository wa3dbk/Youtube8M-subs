00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
dddd it took a lot of practice we had to

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.620 
dddd it took a lot of practice we had to
figure<00:00:23.550> out<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.850> method<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.689> madness<00:00:24.750> and

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
figure out a method to this madness and

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.700 
figure out a method to this madness and
so<00:00:27.630> we've<00:00:27.930> come<00:00:28.230> up<00:00:28.260> with<00:00:29.539> a<00:00:30.539> little<00:00:31.289> different

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
so we've come up with a little different

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.170 
so we've come up with a little different

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
technique not different than everybody

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.040 
else's per se but you see my mess over
here<00:00:35.190> but<00:00:35.910> at<00:00:36.000> first<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.390> tried<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.630> use<00:00:36.899> this

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
here but at first I tried to use this

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.959 
here but at first I tried to use this
little<00:00:37.380> Bowl<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.399> got<00:00:38.550> from<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.790> Dollar

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
what we found is that I guess because

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.880 
what we found is that I guess because
the<00:00:47.039> surface<00:00:47.489> area<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.360> large<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:49.170> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
the surface area is so large that the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.760 
the surface area is so large that the
polish<00:00:50.730> when<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:50.969> drop<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:51.629> doesn't<00:00:52.199> set

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
polish when you drop it in doesn't set

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.709 
polish when you drop it in doesn't set

the<00:03:15.360> glass<00:03:15.600> a<00:03:16.140> little<00:03:17.010> bit<00:03:17.180> it'll<00:03:18.180> shake

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
the glass a little bit it'll shake

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.960 
the glass a little bit it'll shake
things<00:03:18.720> up<00:03:19.100> and<00:03:20.100> that<00:03:20.250> just<00:03:20.430> seemed<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:20.820> make

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
things up and that just seemed to make

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.150 
things up and that just seemed to make
the<00:03:21.150> black<00:03:21.359> disperse<00:03:21.930> a<00:03:22.140> little<00:03:22.380> bit<00:03:22.500> so<00:03:22.769> I'm

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
the black disperse a little bit so I'm

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.229 
the black disperse a little bit so I'm
another<00:03:23.519> drop<00:03:23.730> of<00:03:23.760> life<00:03:24.060> there<00:03:24.420> we<00:03:24.510> go<00:03:25.760> and<00:03:26.760> I'm

another drop of life there we go and I'm
blowing<00:03:27.600> it<00:03:27.690> because<00:03:27.989> like<00:03:28.799> I<00:03:28.920> said<00:03:28.980> I<00:03:29.100> found

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.970 
don't let the polish set up in the glass
a<00:03:33.299> little<00:03:33.750> bit<00:03:33.870> first<00:03:34.230> before<00:03:34.680> I<00:03:34.739> stick<00:03:34.950> a

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
a little bit first before I stick a

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.340 
a little bit first before I stick a
finger<00:03:35.220> in<00:03:35.540> she'll<00:03:36.540> just<00:03:36.690> get<00:03:36.810> like<00:03:36.930> a<00:03:36.989> glob<00:03:37.320> of

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
finger in she'll just get like a glob of

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.009 
finger in she'll just get like a glob of
paint<00:03:37.940> and<00:03:38.940> not<00:03:39.150> actually<00:03:39.570> like<00:03:39.720> a<00:03:39.750> real

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.390 
paint and not actually like a real
design<00:03:40.380> or<00:03:40.799> like<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.459> marbling<00:03:41.850> technique<00:03:42.329> so

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
design or like the marbling technique so

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.590 
design or like the marbling technique so
you<00:03:44.400> know<00:03:44.519> there's<00:03:44.730> really<00:03:44.940> no<00:03:45.209> right<00:03:45.570> or

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
wrong way it's just a matter of

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.920 
wrong way it's just a matter of
technique<00:03:50.060> I'm<00:03:51.060> just<00:03:51.299> getting<00:03:51.480> like<00:03:51.630> a<00:03:51.660> little

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
you'll see what I'm talking about see

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.460 
you'll see what I'm talking about see
that<00:05:16.030> some<00:05:17.030> people<00:05:17.300> just<00:05:17.419> use<00:05:17.509> a<00:05:17.630> toothpick<00:05:17.960> I

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
that some people just use a toothpick I

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.680 
that some people just use a toothpick I
find<00:05:19.070> that<00:05:19.310> a<00:05:19.370> q-tip<00:05:19.699> works<00:05:20.150> best<00:05:20.360> for<00:05:20.599> me

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
find that a q-tip works best for me

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.560 
find that a q-tip works best for me
because<00:05:20.960> it<00:05:21.050> absorbs<00:05:21.199> a<00:05:21.530> lot<00:05:21.560> of<00:05:21.800> the<00:05:21.889> paint

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
because it absorbs a lot of the paint

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.010 
because it absorbs a lot of the paint
and<00:05:23.570> you<00:05:24.169> know<00:05:24.490> it<00:05:25.490> it<00:05:26.150> lowers<00:05:26.659> the<00:05:26.690> water

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
and you know it it lowers the water

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.219 
and you know it it lowers the water
level<00:05:27.470> just<00:05:27.710> you<00:05:28.099> know<00:05:28.280> a<00:05:28.610> little<00:05:28.880> bit<00:05:29.030> so<00:05:29.870> i

level just you know a little bit so i

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:31.719 
level just you know a little bit so i
will<00:05:30.710> have<00:05:30.740> a<00:05:30.919> little<00:05:31.099> bit<00:05:31.220> pull<00:05:31.370> your<00:05:31.490> finger
