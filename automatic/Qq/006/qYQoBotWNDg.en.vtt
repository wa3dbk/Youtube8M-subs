again we're gonna do an f7 they see me
platinum<00:04:00.520> okay<00:04:02.110> let's<00:04:03.110> go<00:04:03.230> slowly<00:04:03.530> for<00:04:03.830> the

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
platinum okay let's go slowly for the

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:18.090 
platinum okay let's go slowly for the
first<00:04:04.130> two<00:04:04.280> boxes<00:04:04.460> go<00:04:13.300> okay<00:04:14.300> again

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:27.480 

I<00:04:19.920> was<00:04:20.920> fast<00:04:21.190> at<00:04:21.370> that<00:04:21.400> time<00:04:21.790> but<00:04:26.190> so<00:04:27.190> here<00:04:27.370> we

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
I was fast at that time but so here we

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.640 
I was fast at that time but so here we
have<00:04:27.640> DFC<00:04:28.390> in<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.890> right<00:04:30.070> hand<00:04:31.530> then<00:04:32.530> I'm

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
have DFC in the right hand then I'm

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.770 
have DFC in the right hand then I'm
gonna<00:04:32.770> do<00:04:33.010> an<00:04:33.130> arpeggiated<00:04:33.910> b-flat<00:04:34.030> chord

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
gonna do an arpeggiated b-flat chord

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.040 
gonna do an arpeggiated b-flat chord
three<00:04:35.470> times<00:04:35.800> going<00:04:36.220> up<00:04:36.400> the<00:04:36.820> F<00:04:37.270> B<00:04:37.510> flat<00:04:37.540> one

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
three times going up the F B flat one

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.470 
three times going up the F B flat one
two<00:04:38.230> fours<00:04:38.590> what<00:04:38.800> you<00:04:38.890> need<00:04:39.010> to<00:04:39.100> use<00:04:39.300> and<00:04:40.300> then

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
two fours what you need to use and then

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.510 
two fours what you need to use and then
once<00:04:40.690> you<00:04:40.810> form<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.290> next<00:04:41.470> D<00:04:41.710> flat<00:04:42.010> B<00:04:42.220> and<00:04:42.430> then

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
once you form the next D flat B and then

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.210 
once you form the next D flat B and then
one<00:04:42.640> more<00:04:42.760> time<00:04:43.260> on<00:04:44.260> counts<00:04:44.620> two<00:04:44.770> three<00:04:44.980> four

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
one more time on counts two three four

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.960 
one more time on counts two three four
so<00:04:45.700> it's<00:04:45.880> one<00:04:46.150> two<00:04:46.590> three<00:04:47.590> four<00:04:48.250> the<00:04:48.730> four

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
so it's one two three four the four

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.250 
so it's one two three four the four
counts<00:04:49.360> the<00:04:50.230> left<00:04:50.440> hand<00:04:50.680> goes<00:04:50.770> B<00:04:51.130> black<00:04:52.260> and

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
counts the left hand goes B black and

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.870 
counts the left hand goes B black and
then<00:04:53.380> there's<00:04:53.590> a<00:04:53.680> bull<00:04:53.860> B<00:04:54.070> flat<00:04:54.310> chord<00:04:54.340> E<00:04:54.700> or<00:04:54.760> B

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
then there's a bull B flat chord E or B

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.640 
then there's a bull B flat chord E or B
flat<00:04:55.090> D<00:04:55.450> F<00:04:55.870> be<00:04:56.410> weapon<00:04:56.980> five<00:04:57.370> three<00:04:57.610> two<00:04:57.640> one

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.530 

that's<00:05:02.250> where<00:05:02.400> we<00:05:02.460> get<00:05:02.580> the

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.510 

that<00:05:06.290> cord<00:05:08.680> but<00:05:09.680> let's<00:05:09.830> do<00:05:09.950> this<00:05:10.070> measure<00:05:10.310> real

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
that cord but let's do this measure real

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.379 
that cord but let's do this measure real
slow<00:05:10.760> first

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.449 

see<00:05:16.389> so<00:05:16.569> the<00:05:16.719> the<00:05:17.080> first<00:05:17.709> time<00:05:17.949> you<00:05:18.099> do<00:05:18.219> it<00:05:18.249> is

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:18.459 
see so the the first time you do it is

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:20.129 
see so the the first time you do it is
with<00:05:18.610> the<00:05:18.699> cord<00:05:18.999> the<00:05:19.270> second<00:05:19.809> time<00:05:19.929> you<00:05:20.020> do

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.139 
with the cord the second time you do

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:21.749 
with the cord the second time you do
