00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:06.720
 [Music] 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:09.090
 In this video I'll show you how 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.910
 make another knot is a knot that is known 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.230
 as neckline lap the turn of 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.199
 neckline is a knot that will serve us 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.930
 to join two strings we can 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.320
 use when one of the strings is 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.110
 wider than the other then good is 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.580
 quite useful a point that we have to 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.110
 take into account when we make the return 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.690
 of scott is that he should only 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.719
 used with dry ropes is not a 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.420
 good knot to join wet ropes 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.980
 let's assume that the rope that I have 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.570
 to my left it will have a wider width 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.420
 that the rope that I have the right and 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.400
 I wish to join then these two ropes 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.570
 I will explain 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.280
 how can they carry it out well what 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.640
 first thing I have to do is with the 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.730
 rope that I have in my left hand 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:03.060
 I'm going to make a gaza look at the form 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.010
 how is the gaza on this side 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.080
 is exactly the end of 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.210
 the rope that is important then 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.460
 well I'll keep it remember the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.930
 end of the rope on this side then 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.600
 here I have my other rope that is the one 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.110
 I wish to unite and we can suppose that good 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.479
 is thinner or is the same thickness as 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.479
 the other always the thickest is going to be 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.230
 this one what I do is that the step 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.480
 by the gaz 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:33.280
 I turn around 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.460
 down below 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:40.490
 if we are going around down and 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:45.120
 then I pass the tip here 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:49.380
 see the tip step and there it is 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:52.310
 and already just tense and they stayed together 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.890
 my two ropes 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.799
 ok notice that at the ends of the 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.990
 ropes this dakar and this one that I have in 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.539
 the right hand are found 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.700
 precisely on opposite sides that what 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.640
 that we are looking for this gives you greater 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.009
 solidity to the knot if both ends 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.200
 will be on the same side then the 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.140
 knot would not be so solid that's why it's 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.480
 It is advisable to do it in this way as 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.470
 I explained to them I'll repeat it I'll 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.290
 do it again then I do a 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.689
 small gaza 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.879
 I hold it this way so that for 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:29.380
 that the tip of my rope that of that 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:32.380
 shape 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.200
 then he passed the other rope inside 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.580
 the house 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.590
 I turn them down 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.220
 That is we are turning around for 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.470
 down 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.260
 and I pass the tip here 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.800
 there it is perfectly noticeable then 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.600
 just tense and my two strings have 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.200
 stayed together 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.250
 we can observe 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.410
 there is 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.410
 and I'm going to repeat it one last time 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.800
 so 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.140
 in my house 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.830
 [Music] 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.290
 I hold 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:19.329
 and another rope 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.329
 / on gauze the bottom part 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.349
 turn around 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:29.250
 something that happens here 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.319
 [Music] 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.950
 halo tension 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:40.159
 and so now is the knot 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.159
 we know as scott's turn to
