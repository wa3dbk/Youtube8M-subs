00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
chemistry starts today and what I think

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.429 
chemistry starts today and what I think
of<00:00:28.740> them<00:00:28.949> because<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:30.109> yesterday<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.140> kind<00:00:31.410> of

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
of them because and yesterday I kind of

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.930 
of them because and yesterday I kind of
went<00:00:31.560> off<00:00:31.679> in<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.890> chat<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.369> tangent<00:00:32.790> and

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
went off in the chat in a tangent and

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.819 
went off in the chat in a tangent and
this<00:00:33.149> first<00:00:33.390> game<00:00:33.630> I'm<00:00:33.870> just<00:00:34.440> gonna<00:00:34.559> say<00:00:34.649> it

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
this first game I'm just gonna say it

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.130 
this first game I'm just gonna say it
wasn't<00:00:35.399> not<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:36.390> great<00:00:36.630> in<00:00:36.809> turn<00:00:36.960> to

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
wasn't not that great in turn to

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.799 
wasn't not that great in turn to
highlight<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.800> apart<00:00:38.790> from<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.120> goals<00:00:39.629> are

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
highlight and apart from the goals are

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.930 
highlight and apart from the goals are
scored<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.500> there<00:00:41.190> wasn't<00:00:41.340> too<00:00:41.579> much<00:00:41.730> in

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
scored and there wasn't too much in

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.209 
scored and there wasn't too much in
terms<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.300> opportunities<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.230> that's<00:00:44.040> one

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
terms of opportunities and that's one

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.529 
terms of opportunities and that's one
thing<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.610> don't<00:00:44.670> like<00:00:45.000> about<00:00:45.149> these

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
thing that I don't like about these

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.900 
thing that I don't like about these
chemistry<00:00:45.989> styles<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.350> can't<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.950> my<00:00:47.460> passing

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
chemistry styles I can't I my passing

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.060 
chemistry styles I can't I my passing
doesn't<00:00:48.210> seem<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.510> be<00:00:48.660> as<00:00:48.750> crisp<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.620> movement

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
doesn't seem to be as crisp the movement

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.970 
doesn't seem to be as crisp the movement
doesn't<00:00:50.219> seem<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.670> be<00:00:50.789> as<00:00:51.030> as<00:00:51.600> fluid<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.260> my

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
doesn't seem to be as as fluid and my

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.200 
doesn't seem to be as as fluid and my
players<00:00:53.219> aren't<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.699> positions<00:00:54.120> that

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
players aren't in the positions that

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.520 
players aren't in the positions that
they<00:00:54.449> usually<00:00:54.629> are<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.140> it's<00:00:55.230> kind<00:00:55.469> of

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
they usually are and it's kind of

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.590 
they usually are and it's kind of
frustrating<00:00:55.649> like<00:00:56.280> these<00:00:56.850> chemistry<00:00:57.270> styles

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
frustrating like these chemistry styles

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.630 
frustrating like these chemistry styles
are<00:00:57.719> supposed<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.590> kind<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.949> boost<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.460> play

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
are supposed to kind of boost the play

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.040 
are supposed to kind of boost the play
actually<00:01:00.030> no<00:01:00.149> they<00:01:00.359> just<00:01:00.390> changed<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.930> way

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
actually no they just changed the way

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.689 
actually no they just changed the way
they<00:01:01.199> play<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.440> be<00:01:01.680> honest<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.190> I'm<00:01:02.430> supposed

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
they play to be honest and I'm supposed

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.210 
they play to be honest and I'm supposed
to<00:01:02.850> really<00:01:03.090> boost<00:01:03.719> them<00:01:04.080> in<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.439> well<00:01:04.619> they<00:01:05.040> do

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
to really boost them in it well they do

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.770 
to really boost them in it well they do
boost<00:01:05.489> them<00:01:05.700> but<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.090> know<00:01:06.210> what<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.450> mean<00:01:06.479> I

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
boost them but you know what I mean I

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.359 
boost them but you know what I mean I
know<00:01:06.810> I'm<00:01:07.380> saying<00:01:07.680> but<00:01:07.860> I'm<00:01:07.979> kind<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.250> going

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
know I'm saying but I'm kind of going

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.920 
know I'm saying but I'm kind of going
off<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.670> tangent<00:01:09.060> once<00:01:09.180> again<00:01:09.479> but<00:01:09.750> yeah

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
off in the tangent once again but yeah

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.830 
off in the tangent once again but yeah
and<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:11.610> chemistry<00:01:11.939> stars<00:01:12.240> i'm<00:01:12.479> using<00:01:12.810> right

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
and the chemistry stars i'm using right

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.050 
and the chemistry stars i'm using right
now<00:01:12.990> maybe<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:14.159> wrong<00:01:14.400> ones<00:01:14.670> for<00:01:14.909> my

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
now maybe the wrong ones for my

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.390 
now maybe the wrong ones for my
playstyle<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.170> might<00:01:16.350> have<00:01:16.500> ma'am<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:17.189> might

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
playstyle so I might have ma'am I might

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.890 
playstyle so I might have ma'am I might
change<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.850> up<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.119> try<00:01:18.270> different<00:01:18.330> ones<00:01:18.720> but

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
change it up and try different ones but

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.840 
change it up and try different ones but
what<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.229> have<00:01:19.500> right<00:01:19.680> now<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:20.130> not<00:01:20.310> working<00:01:20.729> for

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
what I have right now is not working for

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.160 
what I have right now is not working for
me<00:01:20.909> even<00:01:21.180> though<00:01:21.360> I'm<00:01:21.450> getting<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.750> wind<00:01:21.960> I'm

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
me even though I'm getting the wind I'm

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.590 
me even though I'm getting the wind I'm
not<00:01:22.619> happy<00:01:22.860> with<00:01:23.070> how<00:01:23.220> I'm<00:01:23.340> playing<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.880> I

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
not happy with how I'm playing and I

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.690 
not happy with how I'm playing and I
like<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.990> even<00:01:25.470> though<00:01:25.770> I'm<00:01:25.860> winning<00:01:26.250> it

like to even though I'm winning it

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.460 
like to even though I'm winning it

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
doesn't feel right I know that one game

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.050 
doesn't feel right I know that one game
i'm<00:01:28.590> just<00:01:28.770> gonna<00:01:28.890> get<00:01:29.100> absolutely<00:01:29.579> actually

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
might try some different chemistry

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.469 
might try some different chemistry
styles<00:01:41.100> on<00:01:41.189> one<00:01:41.400> absolute<00:01:41.850> finish<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.299> was

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
styles on one absolute finish that was

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.690 
styles on one absolute finish that was
by<00:01:42.630> h<00:01:42.899> ere<00:01:43.290> going<00:01:43.740> off<00:01:43.950> track<00:01:44.100> but<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.520> might

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
by h ere going off track but I might

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.429 
by h ere going off track but I might
change<00:01:45.000> some<00:01:45.299> check<00:01:45.509> some<00:01:45.720> chemistry<00:01:46.079> styles

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
change some check some chemistry styles

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.020 
change some check some chemistry styles
or<00:01:46.590> might<00:01:46.770> just<00:01:46.979> go<00:01:47.100> back<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.340> basic<00:01:47.850> and

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
this area is that so far they haven't

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.170 
this area is that so far they haven't
had<00:02:39.060> many<00:02:39.240> informs<00:02:39.810> like<00:02:40.020> personally<00:02:40.770> and

and<00:04:46.680> i<00:04:46.979> thought<00:04:47.400> i<00:04:47.460> would<00:04:47.700> have<00:04:47.820> been<00:04:47.910> a

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
and i thought i would have been a

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.300 
and i thought i would have been a
penalty<00:04:48.120> but<00:04:48.389> according<00:04:49.380> to<00:04:49.590> the<00:04:49.770> referee<00:04:50.220> it

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
penalty but according to the referee it

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.900 
penalty but according to the referee it
wasn't<00:04:50.700> but<00:04:51.300> then<00:04:51.630> we<00:04:51.930> move<00:04:52.139> on<00:04:52.380> and<00:04:52.680> our

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
wasn't but then we move on and our

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.790 
wasn't but then we move on and our
opponent<00:04:53.910> is<00:04:54.030> still<00:04:54.419> being<00:04:54.570> day<00:04:54.810> and<00:04:55.530> i

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
opponent is still being day and i

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.260 
opponent is still being day and i
honestly<00:04:56.100> didn't<00:04:56.550> think<00:04:56.580> this<00:04:56.820> deserved<00:04:57.180> a

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
honestly didn't think this deserved a

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.790 
honestly didn't think this deserved a
red<00:04:57.419> card<00:04:57.660> on<00:04:57.780> a<00:04:57.810> sorry<00:04:58.080> at<00:04:58.229> first<00:04:58.440> I<00:04:58.620> thought

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
red card on a sorry at first I thought

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.320 
red card on a sorry at first I thought
it<00:04:58.860> was<00:04:58.979> like<00:04:59.220> an<00:04:59.370> orphan<00:04:59.520> challenge<00:05:00.000> just<00:05:00.150> a

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
it was like an orphan challenge just a

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.450 
it was like an orphan challenge just a
free-kick<00:05:00.570> but<00:05:01.470> apparently<00:05:02.010> the<00:05:02.130> referee

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
free-kick but apparently the referee

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.940 
free-kick but apparently the referee
decided<00:05:02.940> to<00:05:03.060> send<00:05:03.270> him<00:05:03.389> off<00:05:03.540> so<00:05:03.810> that<00:05:04.080> was<00:05:04.770> kind

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
decided to send him off so that was kind

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.100 
decided to send him off so that was kind
of<00:05:05.010> good<00:05:05.160> night<00:05:05.370> for<00:05:05.550> my<00:05:05.700> for<00:05:06.210> my<00:05:06.240> opponent<00:05:06.870> but

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
of good night for my for my opponent but

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.700 
of good night for my for my opponent but
and<00:05:08.870> yeah<00:05:09.870> things<00:05:10.320> weren't<00:05:10.560> as

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
and yeah things weren't as

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.200 
and yeah things weren't as
straightforward<00:05:11.010> as<00:05:11.400> I<00:05:11.550> thought<00:05:11.729> it<00:05:11.880> would<00:05:11.940> be

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
straightforward as I thought it would be

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.370 
straightforward as I thought it would be
because<00:05:14.180> yeah<00:05:15.180> with<00:05:15.539> the<00:05:15.660> chemistry<00:05:15.990> start<00:05:16.200> I

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
because yeah with the chemistry start I

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.590 
because yeah with the chemistry start I
don't<00:05:16.560> know<00:05:16.710> i<00:05:16.919> don't<00:05:17.010> know<00:05:17.280> like<00:05:17.669> bananas<00:05:18.450> is

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:11.640 
us that saves us and guess was the three

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.820 
us that saves us and guess was the three
points<00:06:12.120> because<00:06:12.510> that<00:06:12.870> was<00:06:13.050> the<00:06:13.200> final<00:06:13.620> kick

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
points because that was the final kick

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.390 
points because that was the final kick
of<00:06:14.010> the<00:06:14.039> game

as you can see from the stars I did

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:19.170 
as you can see from the stars I did
