 history of the game they are used to

 serve the customers of the pizzeria and cheer up 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.170
 the environment through play and 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.320
 shows 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.770
 however the game does not explain if by bad 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:40.399
 or for any other reason. 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.430
 robots began to annoy customers 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.829
 but according to the creator of the game itself 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.190
 that confirmed via twitter 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:51.550
 the fire dolls 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:55.470
 they are haunted 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.470
 the bite of 87 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:02.830
 the bite of 87 is an incident occurred 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:05.410
 at pizzeria freire fesbe ers at 87 who 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.110
 mentions this event for the first time 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.810
 It is the phone guy who speaks by 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.410
 phone in both games 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.290
 the details of this macabre incident are 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.260
 counted in five nights to flow the two 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.860
 in this incident that cost the reputation 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.740
 of the pizzeria one of the customers was attacked 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.200
 and bitten by one of the onyx animals 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.050
 details of the attack are not mentioned 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:37.000
 only the state in which the victim was 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:40.900
 without parts of the face and the right 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.500
 after all the pizzeria fred fesp really 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.200
 exists as a plot full of gaps and 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.830
 giving rise to players' imagination 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.739
 It took a long time for the internet to be 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.080
 flooded with theory about the game over 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.959
 is that the pizzeria exists 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.570
 Truth this rumor gained strength in the month 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.550
 following the launch of the first game 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.680
 when the players went to 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.530
 information about the same 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.690
 when you search the google site one of the 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.170
 results points to google site 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.989
 maps called freire fesbe ers pizzeria 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.180
 according to google maps macabre pizzeria 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.300
 would be located in the united states 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.860
 more precisely in the city of 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.570
 utah state 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.040
 obviously everything is just a 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.950
 Just kidding 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.760
 the location on google maps and added photos 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.750
 false 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:38.019
 but do not worry, all have already been 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:41.950
 erased conspiracy theories of 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:44.980
 players as the creator of the game itself 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.319
 chooses fifth commented the rest of the 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.239
 story is left to the player 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.129
 there are many theories about what really 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.700
 happened in the pizzeria 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:56.469
 the strongest of them is that the 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.290
 animatronics were responsible for the 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:04:01.720
 disappearance of children and that they 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.239
 would have destroyed the evidence 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.489
 another theory assumes that onyx animals 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:09.129
 confuse humans with 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.750
 but the outer coating 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.340
 when they realize that a human being 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.459
 it's close 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.509
 they attack him to turn them into a 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.690
 of yours 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:21.870
 there is no way to affirm any of them since 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.139
 the rest of the story is almost 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.500
 interpretive 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:29.889
 that is, it depends on each player 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:35.590
 yet five nights freires is a 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:38.530
 game full of secrets and let's get 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:42.580
 here, thank you very much to each one for 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:45.300
 We have a big hug and even 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.300
 the next
