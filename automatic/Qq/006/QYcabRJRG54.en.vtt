together we spent all our time together
but<00:01:04.670> we<00:01:05.000> weren't<00:01:05.180> dying<00:01:05.510> it<00:01:05.690> to<00:01:05.840> do<00:01:05.960> that<00:01:06.200> what

but we weren't dying it to do that what

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.710 
but we weren't dying it to do that what
we<00:01:06.710> wanted<00:01:07.310> to<00:01:07.430> do<00:01:07.640> was<00:01:08.150> do<00:01:08.330> a<00:01:08.360> show<00:01:08.660> together

we wanted to do was do a show together

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.440 
we wanted to do was do a show together
and<00:01:09.290> we<00:01:09.830> had<00:01:09.980> much<00:01:10.250> more<00:01:10.280> respect<00:01:11.240> and

and we had much more respect and

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.360 
and we had much more respect and
affection<00:01:11.600> and<00:01:12.140> I<00:01:12.650> think<00:01:12.860> there's<00:01:12.980> a<00:01:13.040> lot<00:01:13.220> to

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
affection and I think there's a lot to

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.950 
affection and I think there's a lot to
be<00:01:13.490> learned<00:01:13.570> from<00:01:14.570> how<00:01:14.750> how<00:01:15.110> much<00:01:15.580> stronger

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
be learned from how how much stronger

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.840 
be learned from how how much stronger
respect<00:01:17.960> is<00:01:18.140> an<00:01:18.350> affection<00:01:18.800> for<00:01:18.830> one<00:01:19.160> we

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
respect is an affection for one we

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.090 
respect is an affection for one we
understand<00:01:20.560> respect<00:01:21.560> and<00:01:21.800> we<00:01:21.860> don't

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
understand respect and we don't

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.800 
understand respect and we don't
understand<00:01:22.550> affection<00:01:23.030> so<00:01:23.450> it's<00:01:23.540> a<00:01:23.600> little

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
understand affection so it's a little

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.540 
understand affection so it's a little
easier<00:01:24.140> to<00:01:24.170> get<00:01:24.380> it<00:01:24.560> get<00:01:24.710> your<00:01:24.920> mind<00:01:25.400> around

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
easier to get it get your mind around

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.400 
easier to get it get your mind around
and<00:01:26.030> be<00:01:26.960> able<00:01:27.110> to<00:01:27.440> manipulate<00:01:28.370> and<00:01:28.910> so<00:01:29.900> when

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.460 
you don't care that much your life goes
on<00:01:45.740> so<00:01:46.220> he's<00:01:46.340> become<00:01:46.490> my<00:01:46.909> best<00:01:47.150> friend<00:01:47.510> but<00:01:47.690> in

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
on so he's become my best friend but in

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.890 
on so he's become my best friend but in
a<00:01:48.590> very<00:01:48.920> circuitous<00:01:49.790> route<00:01:50.240> you<00:01:50.450> know<00:01:50.600> through

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.060 

I<00:01:55.979> think<00:01:56.729> if<00:01:56.940> you<00:01:57.090> were<00:01:57.300> to<00:01:57.330> picture<00:01:58.229> what<00:01:58.920> we

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
I think if you were to picture what we

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.120

what<00:01:59.550> we<00:01:59.700> do<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.570> probably<00:02:01.350> be<00:02:01.530> pretty<00:02:01.710> right

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
what we do you probably be pretty right

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.840 
what we do you probably be pretty right
I<00:02:02.990> tend<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.110> have<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.920> responsibility<00:02:05.310> for

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
I tend to have the responsibility for

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.570 
I tend to have the responsibility for
what<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.270> say<00:02:06.720> there<00:02:07.590> are<00:02:07.770> lines<00:02:08.069> here<00:02:08.490> and

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
what I say there are lines here and

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.820 
what I say there are lines here and
there<00:02:08.819> that<00:02:09.090> are<00:02:09.149> tellers<00:02:09.630> there<00:02:10.229> are<00:02:10.380> moments

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
there that are tellers there are moments

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.740 
there that are tellers there are moments
in<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.069> in<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.640> shape<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.270> plot<00:02:12.540> of

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
things that are tellers but for the most

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.360 
things that are tellers but for the most
part<00:02:16.820> I'm<00:02:17.820> in<00:02:18.209> charge<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.570> what<00:02:18.720> I<00:02:18.750> say<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:19.370> for

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
part I'm in charge of what I say and for

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.940 
part I'm in charge of what I say and for
the<00:02:20.490> most<00:02:20.760> part<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:21.480> tellers<00:02:22.320> in<00:02:22.350> charge<00:02:22.709> of<00:02:22.860> the

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
the most part a tellers in charge of the

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.940 
the most part a tellers in charge of the
magic<00:02:23.310> now<00:02:23.700> there<00:02:23.880> are<00:02:24.110> great<00:02:25.110> lines<00:02:25.470> in<00:02:25.830> the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
magic now there are great lines in the

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.050 
magic now there are great lines in the
show<00:02:26.160> that<00:02:26.520> came<00:02:26.730> from<00:02:26.910> teller<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:27.510> there<00:02:28.260> are

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
show that came from teller and there are

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.120 
show that came from teller and there are
slightly<00:02:30.060> clever<00:02:30.570> magic<00:02:31.380> moments<00:02:31.830> that<00:02:31.980> come

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
slightly clever magic moments that come

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.550 
slightly clever magic moments that come
from<00:02:32.310> me<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:32.700> we<00:02:33.330> do<00:02:33.540> work<00:02:33.810> together<00:02:34.050> on

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
from me and we do work together on

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.320 
from me and we do work together on
things<00:02:34.980> but<00:02:35.640> those<00:02:35.760> are<00:02:36.000> really<00:02:36.150> the

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
things but those are really the

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.000 
things but those are really the
responsibilities<00:02:37.140> if<00:02:37.260> you<00:02:37.380> wanted<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.769> break

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
responsibilities if you wanted to break

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.259 
responsibilities if you wanted to break
it<00:02:38.040> down<00:02:38.370> in<00:02:38.670> in<00:02:39.030> really<00:02:39.660> traditional<00:02:39.840> terms<00:02:40.500> I

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
it down in in really traditional terms I

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.150 
it down in in really traditional terms I
think<00:02:42.269> you<00:02:42.420> would<00:02:42.630> see<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:43.140> teller<00:02:43.500> as<00:02:43.739> kind<00:02:44.040> of

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
think you would see a teller as kind of

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
the director I kind of directs the show

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.900 
the director I kind of directs the show
and<00:02:48.150> I<00:02:49.110> don't<00:02:49.230> care<00:02:49.800> very<00:02:50.070> much<00:02:50.670> about<00:02:52.910> staging

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
and I don't care very much about staging
