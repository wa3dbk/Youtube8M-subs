00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.160
 Y 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.470
 ah 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.080
 good morning world already after you 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.849
 wake up with my beautiful alarm 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.910
 depending on what day of the week it is 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.619
 in the morning I go straight to the bathroom 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.750
 take a shower 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.550
 here I can pick up my hair to not 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.349
 wash hair or I can leave it loose 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.210
 depending on what day of the week it is 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.670
 and have to do that day so 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.000
 general side hair one day yes and 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.000
 another no 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.390
 and when I'm not the girl I pick it up 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.250
 a beautiful tail for what they talk and 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.040
 then we are going to go to the shower in 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.989
 where to look for super warm water and 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.870
 If I'm taking away my interest here 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.610
 until 2003 called par excellence once 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.470
 after the shower I wash my face with this 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.600
 premise of a came and then since I 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.050
 I put the soap on the whole body 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.990
 I'm going to start exfoliating with this salt 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.390
 sea ​​and then we will choose what I 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.090
 I'm going to put into dispute about basic a 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.090
 leader saw the little shirt and then as my 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.860
 shoes take down my bed to the 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.670
 just like in my portfolio the key to 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.670
 down is she 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.650
 Once I'm dressed I'll pass 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.450
 fix me and first let's apply 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.240
 this technique that helps me a lot with the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.430
 seborrhea that I have in my eyebrows now 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.100
 step to hydrate the whole face with this 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.570
 another creame that is from sea salts 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.850
 dead 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.310
 and this I love because I deserve the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.740
 expensive but it does not leave it super greasy 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.479
 and here they see how I have a great time 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.240
 in my daughters I have them super 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.920
 uncontrolled and then depending on the 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.960
 day of what I'm going to do I apply the 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.799
 makeup this is what is going to apply super 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.600
 light 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.369
 let's apply a little bit of powder in 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.280
 the face had previously put me 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:07.409
 corrector then added the powders a 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.409
 little bronze plus a little 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.580
 Y 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.400
 a delineated with a cream gel for 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.590
 that you can not see the eyes are off 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.690
 in this case I am using a brown one 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.970
 so it does not look as intense as 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.410
 black then applied the mask of 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.210
 tabs and now I do not have a way 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.140
 particular to put me because I know 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:33.049
 super weird the video 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.269
 and I already loose my hair and I combed it 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.829
 a little bit and how can you see me 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.420
 Super as well I do not have to 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.319
 pass the iron or anything like that is 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.319
 super fast 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.720
 and it is the truth to choose the complements 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.060
 in this case to use this caring that 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.730
 it seems that it is very much in harmony with the 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.160
 super casual outfit super chic super 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.230
 comfortable and I'm using this that says 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.610
 that this portfolio is of target 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.280
 they make up premium 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.050
 by max and this is very nice and they are from 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.150
 hollister and the shoes that I do not 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.800
 I did not buy an agreement but I love it 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.260
 because to give a touch I do not know how else 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.660
 classic to the outfit and they are super super 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.910
 comfortable and good girls but the weather of 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:20.550
 been this video I'm fine to give 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.550
