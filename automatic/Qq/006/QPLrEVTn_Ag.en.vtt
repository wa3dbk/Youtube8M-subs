00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.360
 good escaping Pan-American always 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:13.549
 a very important career 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:16.460
 by people 12 points and in large 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:20.210
 amount also because they represented 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:23.990
 your nation so good is a race 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.210
 more emotive emotional is always very 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.990
 important to represent your country 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.890
 action mention 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.680
 to say Pan-American I did not start a 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:38.370
 very very good season with two victories 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:42.450
 and a second place in Cyprus in a 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.850
 career more that is the highest of uci 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.700
 well I feel very good and it's the 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.740
 good preparation for my condition 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.240
 the movement is very very good 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.570
 I feel very well adapted 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.850
 the conditions of the height of everything else 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:02.210
 and I'm training in short I'm 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.690
 being close to the circuit 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.960
 the sensations are very good 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:13.610
 especially the people of the culture of 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:18.640
 Korean people this like that motivated me 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.640
 comedies and it leaves me very comfortable 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.220
 compete in height make a race 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.220
 important in height 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:35.659
 it's particularity 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:40.159
 with how the race is done is different 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:43.700
 what does not matter if you are alone 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:47.420
 you are as adapted or not to the height is 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:52.250
 different compete at the height of 2600 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.740
 or a lower level but good came in 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.140
 good shape of american bread I think that 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.630
 just for this detail of how 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.060
 experience of competing in height 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.899
 the Colombians draw blood that in a 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.270
 assembly or like pigs like all that is 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.580
 of height too 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.870
 stephen lighting air is the current 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:18.170
 Pan-American champion these can be 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:22.750
 stronger competitors but surely 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.750
 I'm going to do well this I tell you 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.150
 it is good to bring a pompadour 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.100
 important to colombia because today is like 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.270
 Colombia is like the capital of cycling 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:42.140
 Latin has by the route or by everything but 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:45.110
 people be for the culture of the 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.590
 competitive bicycle or not in colombia 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:52.040
 is is the Latin capital point by 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:55.120
 this I see as components eyes bring the 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.120
 Pan-American championship here 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.870
 we have the weather that we see today 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.520
 well when the portal arrived it was very 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.510
 dry 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:13.159
 Three days ago it started to rain 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.750
 and good what I can tell you that 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:19.630
 thinking about the Pan-Americans this can 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:24.070
 be a really big problem 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:27.100
 the circuit is tightly closed is slow not 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:30.040
 it's a very fast circuit so it's 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:33.150
 has a lot of unemployment will be very very 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.560
 difficult to make a good career 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.210
 mainly because the climbs are 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:43.730
 very the drops are very increase 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:47.870
 well of nothing then what is 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:50.209
 is the circuit is very very wet can 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.390
 be that it is not going to be a good race 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:57.440
 I hope the topic is better not until 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:04:00.860
 on the 29th we do not have much value because 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:05.510
 in the end it is a good race by itself 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:08.720
 there are only 200 points for the champion more 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.269
 the title with Mexican political q 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.980
 for some nations that play in this 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:16.100
 race so it 's a very career 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.000
 important I would like it to be nothing 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.570
 a career more like 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.490
 without many 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.490
 Exactly so 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:36.730
 I like estimated fresh 10 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:38.740
 you have the bike that's what 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:42.780
 let's do 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.780
 if for the Pan-American I think that 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:49.860
 the option the best option is the 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:51.240
 bicycle art or just suspension 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.220
 lead 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.860
 It is a circuit with very hard climbs 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:02.150
 of very short steep slopes so you have to 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:05.449
 have a very vivid bicycle 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:08.120
 I spoke with the type of eta 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:13.260
 this is the first race that takes the 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:16.170
 crown 36 of my life because yes 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.090
 out there it looks a bit harder 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:24.960
 that I 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:27.780
 the normal but good tires I have 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.139
 some decisions for now I have 26 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.139
 degrees 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.870
 2.25 in my solitude it stays like right now 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:41.780
 change throw tron 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.780
 and then change for something even worse 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.330
 good to see what happens but I have 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:52.020
 good visions of cover but sure 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:56.629
 that I'm going to compete with the part 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.629
 with bikes or front suspension 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:06.090
 efe 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:06.090
 elkin what is the configuration of the team 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:13.830
 good really light like mine is 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.960
 weighing about eight kilos 300 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.250
 a bicycle with 100 mm of 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.060
 course 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.060
 the front fork 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:26.900
 at the moment I have the tires covered 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.840
 2.25 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.160
 I think that this will be the 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:34.630
 configuration of my dishes for the 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.630
 Sunday 20 95 

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:44.979
 to evil this what we have spoken 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:52.910
 as something of responsibility 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:55.830
 Well, I think so, how did I talk about 

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:58.470
 another topic is how 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.720
 that today I am the principal 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:04.380
 Latin American representative the 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:07.350
 world stage this does bring training 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:11.680
 responsibility to more since 2013 that I am 

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:15.720
 the first world Pan-American 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:20.620
 good but the ranking says a lot yes 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:25.750
 but he says a lot about his regularity as 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:29.980
 he does all season so it's good 

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:33.770
 puts me among the favorites 

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:35.750
 to win the gold but 

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:39.710
 numbers are numbers of results are 

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:43.270
 results that I do not do this Sunday 

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:43.270
 a good race of ours
