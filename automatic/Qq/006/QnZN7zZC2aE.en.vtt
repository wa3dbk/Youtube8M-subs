00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
orchids fish I really think I think one

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.700 
orchids fish I really think I think one
more<00:04:21.470> big<00:04:21.650> fish<00:04:21.859> to<00:04:22.040> to<00:04:22.340> win<00:04:22.520> this<00:04:22.639> thing<00:04:22.700> and

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
more big fish to to win this thing and

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.640 
more big fish to to win this thing and
so<00:04:24.710> you<00:04:25.250> don't<00:04:25.400> get<00:04:25.460> into<00:04:25.639> the<00:04:25.730> top<00:04:25.880> 25<00:04:26.650> you

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
so you don't get into the top 25 you

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.390 
so you don't get into the top 25 you
know<00:04:28.419> it<00:04:29.419> really<00:04:29.680> doesn't<00:04:30.680> give<00:04:30.889> good<00:04:31.370> a

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
know it really doesn't give good a

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.290 
know it really doesn't give good a
matter<00:04:31.760> so<00:04:33.400> it<00:04:34.400> will<00:04:34.550> pick<00:04:34.730> up<00:04:34.850> better<00:04:35.000> slots

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
matter so it will pick up better slots
