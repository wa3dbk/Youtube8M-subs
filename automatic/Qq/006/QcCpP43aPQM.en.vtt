yeah pretty self-explanatory after you

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.199 
yeah pretty self-explanatory after you
do<00:02:17.880> that<00:02:17.910> then<00:02:18.890> just<00:02:19.890> record<00:02:20.280> something<00:02:20.580> like

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
do that then just record something like

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.660 
do that then just record something like
a<00:02:21.239> sound<00:02:21.540> factor<00:02:21.930> will<00:02:22.140> somewhat<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:25.430> if<00:02:26.430> it

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
a sound factor will somewhat and if it

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.979 
a sound factor will somewhat and if it
works<00:02:28.790> if<00:02:29.790> it<00:02:29.880> this<00:02:30.000> still<00:02:30.239> doesn't<00:02:30.480> work<00:02:30.690> then

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
works if it this still doesn't work then

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.310 
works if it this still doesn't work then
I<00:02:31.170> have<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.590> feeling<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:32.340> your<00:02:32.580> own<00:02:33.320> computer

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
I have a feeling that your own computer

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.710 
I have a feeling that your own computer
might<00:02:34.500> be<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.680> little<00:02:34.890> messed<00:02:35.130> up<00:02:35.340> so<00:02:38.600> alright

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
might be a little messed up so alright

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.290 
might be a little messed up so alright
yeah<00:02:41.650> so<00:02:41.890> if<00:02:42.250> you<00:02:42.430> just<00:02:42.640> wanted<00:02:42.850> to<00:02:42.940> record<00:02:43.060> a

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
yeah so if you just wanted to record a

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.670 
yeah so if you just wanted to record a
song<00:02:43.480> that<00:02:43.780> you<00:02:43.810> were<00:02:44.110> looking<00:02:44.320> for

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
song that you were looking for

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.340 
song that you were looking for
