00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
was a good sign you know each of these

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.119 
was a good sign you know each of these
each<00:02:06.450> game<00:02:06.810> in<00:02:07.079> its<00:02:07.229> own<00:02:07.320> way<00:02:07.560> will<00:02:07.740> present

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129

think this

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.120 
think this
is<00:02:12.550> a<00:02:12.610> battle-tested<00:02:13.060> group<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:14.020> and<00:02:14.560> we're

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
is a battle-tested group and and we're

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.800 
is a battle-tested group and and we're
not<00:02:15.250> dependent<00:02:15.700> on<00:02:15.760> one<00:02:15.970> person<00:02:16.450> so<00:02:16.630> that

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
not dependent on one person so that

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.620 
not dependent on one person so that
should<00:02:16.960> be<00:02:16.990> advantageous<00:02:18.000> obviously<00:02:19.000> for<00:02:19.240> a

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
should be advantageous obviously for a

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.030 
should be advantageous obviously for a
tournament<00:02:19.900> setting<00:02:20.230> like<00:02:20.380> this<00:02:20.530> but<00:02:20.770> again
