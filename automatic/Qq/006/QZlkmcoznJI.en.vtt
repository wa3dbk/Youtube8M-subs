for what you see now it's 50 swore mics
on<00:00:40.100> the<00:00:40.160> screen<00:00:40.550> and<00:00:40.760> their<00:00:41.300> ability<00:00:41.480> to<00:00:41.690> do

on the screen and their ability to do

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.130 
on the screen and their ability to do
this<00:00:42.909> you<00:00:43.909> have<00:00:44.030> direct<00:00:44.360> control<00:00:44.449> over<00:00:44.720> 50

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
this you have direct control over 50

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.040 
this you have direct control over 50
characters<00:00:45.379> at<00:00:45.589> once<00:00:47.350> moving<00:00:48.350> them<00:00:48.470> around<00:00:50.050> so

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
characters at once moving them around so

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.270 
characters at once moving them around so
the<00:00:51.170> idea<00:00:51.290> is<00:00:51.500> that<00:00:51.559> supposed<00:00:51.830> to<00:00:51.920> feel<00:00:52.070> like

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
can I can read the code in another video

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.580 
can I can read the code in another video
I'll<00:01:19.310> read<00:01:19.549> the<00:01:19.670> entire<00:01:19.969> code<00:01:20.270> or<00:01:20.659> on<00:01:21.110> all

guys soon good question Pete they can
move<00:01:32.570> they<00:01:32.990> can<00:01:33.170> huddle<00:01:33.409> together<00:01:34.000> huddle

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
move they can huddle together huddle

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.800 
move they can huddle together huddle
together<00:01:35.090> they<00:01:35.869> can<00:01:36.049> spread<00:01:36.500> apart<00:01:37.810> apart

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
together they can spread apart apart

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.020 
together they can spread apart apart
which<00:01:38.960> is<00:01:39.109> good<00:01:39.350> for<00:01:39.740> collecting<00:01:40.609> lots<00:01:40.820> of

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
which is good for collecting lots of

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.510 
which is good for collecting lots of
collectibles<00:01:41.659> all<00:01:41.929> the<00:01:42.049> ones<00:01:42.320> or<00:01:42.710> spreading
