00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.470
 reflections 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.470
 for the soul 

00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:10.509
 do not forget 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:13.509
 the main thing 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:15.969
 next to the legend 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:17.849
 a poor woman 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:20.189
 with a child in his arms 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.980
 He passed a cavern and heard a mysterious voice that from inside 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.640
 He said 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.130
 of diplomas 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.609
 everything you wish 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.609
 do not forget the main thing 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.390
 you should keep in mind that when you leave 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.600
 the door will close forever 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.540
 Thus 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.720
 take the opportunity 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.720
 but do not forget the main thing 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.190
 the woman 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.410
 He entered the cave and found many riches 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.890
 fascinated by gold and jewels 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.380
 He left the child on the floor and began gathering everything he could 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.700
 the bomu exterios 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.930
 and in this only eight minutes 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.780
 exhausted the eight minutes 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.250
 the woman 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.060
 loaded with gold and precious stones 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.510
 ran out of the cavern 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.170
 and the door closed 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.180
 He remembered that the boy had stayed in that place 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.180
 and the door was closed forever 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.780
 the riches 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.040
 they lasted only eight minutes 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.299
 Despair and anguish forever 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.260
 the same thing happens to us 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.790
 we have life limited to a few years in this world and the voice of God 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.930
 always warns us 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.930
 do not forget that the main thing 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.350
 what the main thing 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.900
 spiritual values 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.310
 the love towards our family 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.040
 our friends 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.040
 and a life full of faith and hope 

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:12.049
 this is the true wealth 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.049
 which can be stored in our heart 

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:18.579
 not the pleasures the money 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:19.829
 Fame 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.089
 the success 

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:23.359
 nor the power 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:27.759
 all these things distract us from what really matters 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.519
 and what it is 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.519
 the treasures of the dawn 

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:38.229
 When the door of your life closes forever 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.359
 nothing will be worth the lamentations 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:44.359
 The front 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.229
 and I think a moment 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:50.229
 what is and the main thing in your life 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.069
 never forget 

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:59.629
 reflections 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:00.560
 For the soul
