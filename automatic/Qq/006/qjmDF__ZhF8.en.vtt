 want them 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.250
 heroin cocaine spirulina the trio 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.530

 that spirulina 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.969
 ok then go ahead to be explained us 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.170

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.299
 spirulina I will explain to you what 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.430
 it's to start spirulina it's 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.909
 a micro algae so it's not a 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.770
 drug knows nothing and chemicals that's 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.770
 really a micro seaweed that is 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.280
 dried up and put in powder form or 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.049
 of tablet so what do you know this 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.030
 what are the benefits of aspirin 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.500
 this is me I know we take 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.360
 why because there are plenty of icco 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.920
 elements there are plenty of doing the 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.360
 carotene it's really good for the 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.800
 health full of vitamins and minerals 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.080
 which are therefore essential to your 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.330
 body to be at the top 10 others 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.250
 possible to antioxidants that's it 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.619
 not getting old by taking inspired that's it 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.090
 rejuvenates and in addition the advantage in particular 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.970
 for athletes is that it's going 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.190
 vegetable protein 80% protein at 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.380
 process neither sugar nor fat in it really 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.600
 a food found in the wild 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.670
 in nature that is desiccated and that 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.950
 is crazy of course that complements 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.240
 food is the star of accomplices 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.850
 or dietary supplements because 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.050
 that it contains the most 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.390
 nutrients 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.009
 we strongly advise you to take 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.410
 aspirin so we can take 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.330
 how much about each other so we 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.860
 what do we do if we take 1.3 g per day 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.050
 because we do it all year long 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.519
 after if you do some cures a little 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.510
 more intensive, ie if they 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.379
 did not want to take all year but 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.870
 since we have a little tired stroke 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.000
 to boost your 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.860
 list you can take up to 3.5 g 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.269
 here I think we did a little bit 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.860
 turn but if want more info go 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.810
 see on the blog then all in France 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.940
 see also other examples like this 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.650
 game 2 to bac more explanatory I 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.989
 just wanted to say that we the ones we 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.180
 use these of the aspirin pions so 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:37.120
 it's an aspirin that had no 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.480
 chemical treatment other than dried so 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.040
 there is no add-on here we use it 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.780
 in the form of seals because the 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.239
 powder we're not going to lie about it does not have a 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.530
 wonderful taste not used in form 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.480
 of stamps if you want to see which 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.319
 we use these village 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.489
 spirulina 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.870
 so you just go to the website 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.310
 village he inspired a point fr 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.280
 you have for 20 euros 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.140
 and if you take 3 g that it does this 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.410
 that we do between one and three grams per 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.760
 day 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.319
 well you have you will have for 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.269
 three months including 20 euros for three months 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.049
 it's okay it's not very expensive to know it's 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.519
 really interesting 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.190
 of course there is no miracle product 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.290
 okay take all the muscle very 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.909
 quickly you will not put your 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.609
 performance but swears it's just a 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:17.019
 a little bit higher we did rotate I 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.890
 believe that m so here we were 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.780
 often asked what are we 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.590
 prÃ´nons it's one of the complements 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.930
 food we like to take 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.700
 well for the moment not in any case 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.650
 think about joining us on the networks 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.810

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.160
 difficult to keep fishing 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.890
 in real big tell me me the truth you 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.620
