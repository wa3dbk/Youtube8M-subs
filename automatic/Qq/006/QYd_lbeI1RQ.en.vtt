00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.180

 iarc there will be a debut trailer 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.020
 so practically there will be all the 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.090
 explanation will make us see well that 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.039
 what will happen more than anything else? 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.789

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.880
 and the collector will also be presented 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.909
 edition of the game with all the contents 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.350
 so we will understand well which version to go 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.689
 to book also because it is missing 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.060
 exactly one month at the exit of the 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.549

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.869
 at least we go to book them we know one 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.210
 moment which version to pick up 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.119
 in addition of course to the presentation 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.750

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.700
 edition 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.490
 the participants will even be able to 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.500
 try this mode is a pity that 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.869
 Mamma mia we can't go to San 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.700
 diego al comicon because otherwise you think 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.009
 how nice we could go to try the 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.920
 zombie mode I think I would have entered 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.320
 the whole weekend is fine though 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.079

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.360
 week 9 July we will finally see 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.820
 what awaits us from this mode 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.140
 zombies that will be there to enhance it if it will be 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.610
 always very technological 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.590
 we saw the countryside there 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.710
 really in so much technology too 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.770
 because environmental in a and aphorisms 2025
