00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello very good as to all which here 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.029
 is about to comment on another example more 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.499
 of the black ops 2 but this is not a 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.380
 normal and current gameplay 

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:12.300
 this is an incredible game in low 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.880
 confirmed 6 against 6 do not win terrestrial 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.160
 but 6 on 6 ordinary of 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.640
 asserted low in which I make a 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.190
 incredible score of 82 casualties and 9 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.460
 deaths and not having things as a unit 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.680
 canine or dogs or swarm and so on 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.500
 not not having just the attack 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.739
 lightning the stealth helicopter and the 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.120
 I keep that was incredible this game 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.790
 I could not even believe it when I 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.380
 I took out although there are nine casualties that 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.960
 first glance may seem pretty 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.730
 but if you compare it with the 82 casualties that 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.730
 I have the truth is that it is a game 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.800
 incredible if I'm not wrong I was 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.090
 playing with a few friends in this 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.290
 starting right now I do not remember their 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.120
 names I think they were rectory 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.950
 etcetera so a greeting to all of them 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.320
 and well here I was very close and 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.879
 of the lightning attack but they killed me 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.610
 a friend who was covering me then 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.440
 nor could I see the one who killed me and he 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.600
 he started shooting both of them and he 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.640
 He cooked there completely 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.070
 I believe that confirmed low is a game 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.299
 in a gameplay is a model in which 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.159
 level up exceeded because you when 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.869
 you kill you get 50 points if I do not 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.869
 I'm wrong then to pick up a chapita 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.810
 you already get 100 or that is like 3 casualties 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.920
 or it's like a low and a half, that is, with 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.140
 doing a low is like doing in 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.610
 any other game mode a low and 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.399
 mean it is that it is amazing and over 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.759
 if you take the plates from your colleagues or 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.500
 be it as a more expensive stop or well 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.899
 so you're going to get more are many more 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.280
 points and if you refuse the losses that 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.780
 when killing a colleague of yours you 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.490
 have the low you're still going to get more 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.080
 points even if I give 100 is 25 but 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.190
 well it's also pretty and like 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.220
 we just saw here they killed me 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.080
 also at a low of the lightning attack 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.149
 for the second time but well I still do not 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.500
 I get tired and it's the good truth here already 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.000
 well three times yet but then already 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.789
 comes a rush of these that killed a 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.069
 montonazo and that if he saved is a 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:08.250
 streak that I love so much for the noise 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:10.080
 that does as its for the casualties that do 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.549
 because bunks good good good 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.440
 look, everything is fixed 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:14.820
 confirming here how fast 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.100
 uy sorry I'm killing fast 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:21.300
 all my mother is what I tell you I keep 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.070
 It's a low streak that I love because 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.410
 kill quite often kill around 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.510
 ten a thing like that and on top of it 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.370
 very much here I was praying because the 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.010
 repetition if he did not see me and give and not 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.090
 I had and would not turn around 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.770
 here I am already knowing the helicopter 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.330
 furtive very little I have left for the 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.490
 I keep and they kill me because I am a 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.960
 unhappy but I still do not lose 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.940
 hope we are going to get a little bit of 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.310
 this and this gameplay because I do not know what 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.140
 I did it when I do not know what 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.020
 level was when I took it out a low 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.360
 multiple if I'm not wrong with the this 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.500
 with the bass is very well the truth that 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.900
 the lightning attack is fine for 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.030
 get many casualties and also say 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.100
 a good one I'm playing with the vector in 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.720
 your k 10 vector rifle that is a weapon 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.570
 awesome as I said in my 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.400
 old previous gameplay island for me 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.550
 the best weapon in the game or at least 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.410
 the best your game rifle or is this 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.880
 marine fabric weapon what what you can 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.580
 take out of games with these scores 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.560
 incredible and here for all the time 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.120
 going after them once I do not know if 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.520
 in this gameplay but a backup in 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.320
 literally super fake plan I do not know 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.690
 it happens to me in this game but 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.460
 literally this is the white 2 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.010
 It also has a lot of errors in the 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:32.340
 you answer things that sometimes help you or 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.170
 it's even worse for you because you're 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.330
 so quiet I sometimes happens in domain 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.830
 that I am capturing a flag not another 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.120
 little by little from my mother's guard now 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.070
 what writing I'm always thinking 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.110
 how unfortunate that I am still like that he gets 82 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.940
 low of the marinera good 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.560
 I think about how unfortunate I am because 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.450
 sometimes toy capturing a flag only 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.460
 you see the radar that there is nobody and from 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.170
 suddenly some people appear behind you 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.880
 and they kill you and you stay like but how 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.380
 it can be if I am here it is impossible 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.450
 I had to appear someone in 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.120
 back if things like that happen and 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.620
 it bothers a lot but good what 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.810
 offered to six in this example and when 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.190
 It's good to see you here. 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.390
 are reappearing while I'm here or 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:12.020
 be one thing and what I said in 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.270
 this I do not know if they were this 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.370
 I appeared one literally in front 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.750
 good good good good one literally 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.150
 ahead that the only thing I had to do 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.450
 was to give r3 again here they kill me 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.550
 close to the sneaky helicopter 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.930
 I just had to stab him because 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.340
 literally it is that I appeared in front 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.350
 of the face the I do not know how it would have 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.120
 stayed that person but good here 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.640
 over I kill myself I risk again that 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.250
 I'm done, look, I'm playing like 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.620
 comment with the streak vector 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.820
 I have the borussia kept that 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.010
 stealth helicopter and attack 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.330
 lightning I put now the grenade 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.340
 because the truth is that people are in 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.170
 I do not like this game because I 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.730
 It gives the feeling that people are you 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.050
 when you look here it was want you have seen 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.180
 you have seen how it has reappeared 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.620
 right there in front of the face, if not 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.090
 you have seen him back out that 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.729
 false mother of mine the poor then 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:02.999
 I would be leaving everything but good 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.469
 what people are saying not me 

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:06.529
 I really like it because when they give me 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:09.659
 feeling that when I throw them then 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:11.939
 they are very pumped and it is something like 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:13.379
 I do not like it very much because I love them 

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:15.479
 try to sneak through a window or things 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:17.849
 well and it never comes to me, it does not reach me 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.620
 I left halfway yet 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:21.210
 when he threw some grenades 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.189
 fragmentation gives me the feeling that 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.180
 they go better 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:25.499
 so at the moment I'm using the 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.969
 of fragmentation although I have always 

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:29.099
 been using centex because I have been 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:31.050
 liked more and then gusts also 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:32.520
 I have this time the shocked now 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.629
 but now also instead of putting it 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.580
 how it worked now I'm getting 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:36.920
 the thing is that it's kind of like 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.870
 shoulder 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.210
 electric granadita that was the strip if 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.910
 it stuns you and the truth that seems very 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.490
 that grenade is very good because it stuns you 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.140
 literally very much or not you 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.540
 you can literally barely even 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.730
 move the vigilant weapon for 23 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.900
 second bone and then leave 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.310
 planted on the ground until it comes 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.230
 someone or I think it's a lot better 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.300
 and if you throw it away if there is no one you can 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.670
 pick up and throw again good 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.710
 here he has killed me 5 casualties or he gets 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.050
 5 casualties with the bones guard 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.910
 see how good it is here I have already 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.200
 tried to cover me little by little I think that 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.000
 this uy that I came one here 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.890
 tried to stab failure starts to give 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.740
 turns and confirmed the down but he killed him 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.180
 my partner and nothing here I keep shooting 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.640
 his answer starts to take out my little things 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.020
 and the gameplay is very little for 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.610
 please if you liked it a lot because I 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.010
 I think it's an incredible game or 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:27.230
 are 82 casualties in low confirmed something 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.210
 to be seen every day in not even 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.340
 is 2000 is that it is low confirmed that 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.600
 has a score limit and more if 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.620
 this is the time confirming the casualties 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.540
 What do I do? 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.000
 then please please see if we can 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.320
 already in this game the 200 I like will be 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.360
 One last because I think it's one of 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.160
 my best gameplays but the best 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.470
 because other 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.970
 with the streaks that I have that are nothing 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.160
 from the other world that swarms you get 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.780
 a swarm or a few dogs and you get yourself 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.260
 many more casualties this is not 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:56.360
 they are only lightning and control attacks 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.070
 furtive and I keep stable please and 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.900
 many casualties with the magneto weapon 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.490
