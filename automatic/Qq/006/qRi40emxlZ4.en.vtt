00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.780
 when we already have the four reasons 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:20.660
 United 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:25.020
 thus three points each 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:28.470
 leaving two spaces 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:31.650
 in the center part we're going to start 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.350
 to do this this reason that is the union 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.470
 the termination of the union of the 4 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.350
 then this is what we are going to do 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:45.960
 let's start making the union let's 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.960
 to do the first one in these 2 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:58.430
 I'm going to make a chain of 6 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:01:01.570
 1 2 3 4 5 6 slid the point to close 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.570
 this turn 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:11.400
 I go up with a chain of 3 and I'm going to do 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:14.120
 15 high points in this circle start 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.120
 one 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.360
 two 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.560
 4 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.560
 5 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.100
 6 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.659
 7 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.590
 8 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.590
 9 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.930
 10 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.409
 eleven 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.460
 12 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.960
 13 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.810
 14 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.399
 and 15 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.729
 with the chain of rise I will have 16 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:17.220
 story 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:17.220
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 and 16 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:26.920
 I'm going to slide the point in the third 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.920
 chain to close this loop 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:46.549
 I'm going to climb with a chain of 3 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.549
 marked the third subo with 3 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.740
 slid the point in that third 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.860
 I go up with two right now I'm going to do 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.019
 the first union at this point where 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.500
 I have the longest chain that is the 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.500
 5 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.739
 of made the low point with 2 and where 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.659
 I have that union of the three chains 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.659
 I return to slide to close 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.010
 there is left 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:32.300
 I make a high point 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.650
 at the next high point 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.650
 the three chains 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:43.450
 I close 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.450
 and I finish the first union 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.650
 let's do the second one I do 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.740
 Chain of separation in the next 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.940
 high point I return again to make a 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:59.050
 high point 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.440
 three chainlets 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.940
 slid in 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.000
 the base to close 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:11.880
 I climb with 2 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.880
 I take the next point here 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:21.370
 slipped the low with 2 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:26.940
 where I have 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.940
 the union slid the point to close 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:35.270
 I make the high point 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.810
 at the next high point the three 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.810
 chains 

00:04:38.649 --> 00:04:44.619
 slipped and closed here I already have the 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.619
 second 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.240
 union list 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.830
 we continue 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:01.729
 He stood with a chain in the next 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:04.160
 high point let's do again the 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:07.420
 high point 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.420
 the three chains 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.510
 slipped and closed 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.910
 two chains 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.380
 to this 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.300
 two chains 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.340
 here 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.540
 a high point 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.510
 the three chains 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.570
 and slid to close 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:14.729
 here is the second one we are going to do 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:14.729
 this 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:27.879
 a separation chain 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.879
 let's go now to the next high point 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.970
 the three chains 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:39.730
 slipped 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.730
 and I close 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.570
 two chains 

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:48.099
 as the next 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:58.680
 two chains 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:58.680
 where I have the union here slipped 

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.220
 here is 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:12.340
 I make the next high point 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:12.340
 and the three chains 

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:21.220
 a separation chain and the 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.220
 next high point 

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:31.210
 here these two were already done I'm going to 

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:36.330
 complete doing these and you're left 

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:36.330
 ready how the unions are made 

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:40.510
 ok this is the one we just finished 

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:43.600
 of doing 

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:46.220
 yet I have not cut the thread 

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:51.200
 it looks like 

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:54.350
 so it goes together that this is the way 

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.570
 to work on this point I hope that you 

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:58.810
 have liked and see you in a next 

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.810
 opportunity
