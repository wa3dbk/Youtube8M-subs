okay here we are back at Okies garage

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.619 
okay here we are back at Okies garage
and<00:00:03.950> today<00:00:04.950> what<00:00:05.190> we<00:00:05.460> got<00:00:05.730> our<00:00:05.940> assignment

and today what we got our assignment

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.770 
and today what we got our assignment
today<00:00:06.899> is<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.970> do<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.000> top<00:00:09.389> end

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
today is to do a top end

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:19.130 
today is to do a top end
rebuild<00:00:10.290> on<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:13.130> o6<00:00:15.139> yz250<00:00:16.139> f<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:17.869> as<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:19.020> can

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
rebuild on a o6 yz250 f and as you can

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.980 
rebuild on a o6 yz250 f and as you can
see<00:00:19.820> this<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:20.970> good<00:00:21.119> way<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.330> start<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.779> off

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
see this is a good way to start it off

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.870 
see this is a good way to start it off
is<00:00:22.260> that<00:00:22.500> this<00:00:22.830> everything<00:00:23.430> you're<00:00:23.699> going<00:00:23.789> to

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
is that this everything you're going to

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.660 
is that this everything you're going to
have<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.090> take<00:00:24.269> off<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.689> bike<00:00:24.900> in<00:00:25.430> order<00:00:26.430> to

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
have to take off the bike in order to

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:34.490 
have to take off the bike in order to
get<00:00:26.849> this<00:00:27.330> job<00:00:27.390> done<00:00:28.580> um<00:00:30.410> we're<00:00:31.410> going<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:33.500> at

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
get this job done um we're going to at

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.830 
get this job done um we're going to at
the<00:00:34.950> mag<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.700> off<00:00:36.090> because<00:00:36.390> we're<00:00:36.660> going<00:00:36.750> to

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
the mag is off because we're going to

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.970 
the mag is off because we're going to
change<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.410> timing<00:00:37.860> chain<00:00:39.260> which<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.620> think

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
change the timing chain which is I think

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.160 
change the timing chain which is I think
it's<00:00:41.460> great<00:00:42.090> idea<00:00:42.570> while<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.440> apart<00:00:45.170> um

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
it's great idea while this is apart um

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.080 
it's great idea while this is apart um
so<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.250> what<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.550> should<00:00:47.760> end<00:00:47.969> up

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
so this is what you should end up

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
so this is what you should end up
looking<00:00:48.149> like<00:00:48.500> when<00:00:49.500> you're<00:00:49.649> all<00:00:49.770> ready<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:51.110> do

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
looking like when you're all ready to do

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.610 
looking like when you're all ready to do
your<00:00:52.260> job<00:00:52.559> here<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.690> can<00:00:54.690> see<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.050> old<00:00:55.230> timing

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
your job here you can see the old timing

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.010 
your job here you can see the old timing
chains<00:00:55.860> just<00:00:56.280> hanging<00:00:56.640> out<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.910> cases<00:00:57.390> um

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
chains just hanging out of the cases um

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.389 
chains just hanging out of the cases um
ripped<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.739> all<00:00:58.890> down<00:01:01.219> everything<00:01:02.219> looks

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
ripped it all down everything looks

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.170 
ripped it all down everything looks
really<00:01:02.640> good<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:04.909> took<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> whole

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
back obviously the whole subframe off

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.280 
back obviously the whole subframe off
this<00:01:10.790> that's<00:01:11.790> sitting<00:01:12.210> over<00:01:12.390> here<00:01:12.450> one<00:01:13.049> thing

nice and easy to work on got the top end
off<00:02:02.040> got<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.579> cylinder<00:02:03.030> off<00:02:03.409> and<00:02:04.409> that's<00:02:04.619> over

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.350 
off got the cylinder off and that's over
here<00:02:05.310> with<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.790> bench<00:02:06.649> and<00:02:07.789> the<00:02:08.789> cylinder<00:02:09.209> looks

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
here with a bench and the cylinder looks

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.670

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
just fill the hash marks in there

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.840 
just fill the hash marks in there
doesn't<00:02:17.650> need<00:02:17.860> any<00:02:18.069> kind<00:02:18.220> of<00:02:18.340> honing<00:02:18.730> or

anything looks absolutely beautiful did
the<00:02:24.150> clearances<00:02:25.150> on<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:26.640> valves

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
the clearances on the valves

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.910 
the clearances on the valves
I<00:02:27.870> tested<00:02:28.870> check<00:02:29.560> those<00:02:29.739> all<00:02:30.010> out<00:02:31.890> have<00:02:32.890> to

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
I tested check those all out have to

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.670 
I tested check those all out have to
make<00:02:33.220> sure<00:02:33.400> that<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:34.000> cans<00:02:34.270> are<00:02:34.630> up<00:02:34.870> I<00:02:35.110> put<00:02:35.590> do

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
make sure that the cans are up I put do

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.020 
make sure that the cans are up I put do
it<00:02:35.800> on<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:36.010> bench<00:02:36.220> because<00:02:36.400> it's<00:02:36.640> easier<00:02:36.940> to

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
it on the bench because it's easier to

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.479 
it on the bench because it's easier to
do<00:02:37.239> put<00:02:37.660> all<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:38.020> caps<00:02:38.290> back<00:02:38.470> on<00:02:38.650> all<00:02:39.250> the

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
do put all the caps back on all the

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.050 
do put all the caps back on all the
bolts<00:02:39.790> back<00:02:39.970> on<00:02:40.030> torque<00:02:40.959> them<00:02:41.110> all<00:02:41.230> down<00:02:42.060> get

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
bolts back on torque them all down get

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.920 
bolts back on torque them all down get
so<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.570> cam<00:02:44.200> is<00:02:45.300> well<00:02:46.300> it's<00:02:46.480> kind<00:02:46.660> of<00:02:46.690> hard<00:02:46.870> to

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
so the cam is well it's kind of hard to

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.030 
so the cam is well it's kind of hard to
see<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.260> dots<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:47.800> stuff<00:02:48.010> on<00:02:48.220> this<00:02:48.400> but<00:02:50.040> once

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
see the dots and stuff on this but once

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.199 
see the dots and stuff on this but once
the<00:02:51.220> cams<00:02:51.489> are<00:02:51.790> all<00:02:51.940> in<00:02:52.180> position<00:02:52.750> you<00:02:53.739> do<00:02:53.920> your

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
the cams are all in position you do your

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.449 
the cams are all in position you do your
measurements<00:02:55.440> feeler<00:02:56.440> gauge<00:02:56.769> in<00:02:57.069> between

this is a bucket and Shimin bucket set

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.350 
this is a bucket and Shimin bucket set
up<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:04.120> all<00:03:04.360> measured<00:03:04.720> out<00:03:04.840> beautiful

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
up and it all measured out beautiful

compression piston you're obviously

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:24.090 
compression piston you're obviously
asking<00:04:22.960> for<00:04:23.020> a<00:04:23.229> little<00:04:23.530> bit<00:04:23.620> of<00:04:23.650> trouble

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
asking for a little bit of trouble

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.430 
asking for a little bit of trouble
because<00:04:24.430> you're<00:04:24.610> you're<00:04:25.449> putting<00:04:26.229> something

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
because you're you're putting something

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.159 
because you're you're putting something
in<00:04:26.590> that<00:04:26.800> really<00:04:26.979> wasn't<00:04:27.419> made<00:04:28.419> for<00:04:28.449> the<00:04:28.960> bike

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
in that really wasn't made for the bike

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.680 
in that really wasn't made for the bike
and<00:04:29.460> these<00:04:30.460> things<00:04:30.669> put<00:04:30.910> these<00:04:31.330> things<00:04:31.539> put

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
and these things put these things put

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.140 
and these things put these things put
out<00:04:31.840> enough<00:04:32.050> horsepower<00:04:32.380> now<00:04:32.820> but<00:04:33.820> that's

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
out enough horsepower now but that's

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.129 
out enough horsepower now but that's
what<00:04:34.240> we're<00:04:34.330> going<00:04:34.419> to<00:04:34.479> do<00:04:34.600> anyway<00:04:34.960> we're

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
what we're going to do anyway we're

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:36.540 
what we're going to do anyway we're
going<00:04:35.259> to<00:04:35.350> throw<00:04:35.500> a<00:04:35.530> high<00:04:35.650> compression<00:04:35.860> piston

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
going to throw a high compression piston

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.240 
going to throw a high compression piston
it<00:04:36.930> we're<00:04:37.930> going<00:04:38.110> to<00:04:40.380> put<00:04:41.380> a<00:04:41.410> new<00:04:41.590> timing<00:04:42.039> chain

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
it we're going to put a new timing chain

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:50.659 
it we're going to put a new timing chain
in<00:04:42.750> we<00:04:43.750> have<00:04:43.930> right<00:04:44.229> here<00:04:45.479> Weis<00:04:46.479> go<00:04:47.460> cam<00:04:48.460> chain

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
in we have right here Weis go cam chain

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.180 
in we have right here Weis go cam chain
and<00:04:52.169> the<00:04:53.169> only<00:04:53.320> reason<00:04:53.560> we<00:04:53.770> bought<00:04:53.919> a<00:04:53.979> white

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
and the only reason we bought a white

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.040 
and the only reason we bought a white
skull<00:04:54.460> one<00:04:54.729> is<00:04:54.910> because<00:04:55.270> it<00:04:55.419> came<00:04:55.599> in<00:04:55.780> a<00:04:55.810> little

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
skull one is because it came in a little

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.900 
skull one is because it came in a little
quicker<00:04:56.349> we<00:04:56.770> want<00:04:57.009> to<00:04:57.099> race<00:04:57.280> this<00:04:57.520> thing<00:04:57.759> this

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
quicker we want to race this thing this

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.360 
quicker we want to race this thing this
weekend<00:04:58.419> and<00:05:01.169> it's<00:05:02.169> important<00:05:02.770> to<00:05:02.889> put<00:05:03.160> a<00:05:03.190> new

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
weekend and it's important to put a new

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.210 
weekend and it's important to put a new
timing<00:05:03.789> chain<00:05:04.000> in<00:05:04.210> it<00:05:04.330> because<00:05:04.660> the<00:05:05.650> old

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
timing chain in it because the old

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.360 
timing chain in it because the old
timing<00:05:06.669> chains<00:05:06.970> the<00:05:07.840> OEM<00:05:08.259> timing<00:05:08.860> chains<00:05:09.070> can

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
timing chains the OEM timing chains can

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.210 
timing chains the OEM timing chains can
get<00:05:09.520> a<00:05:09.550> little<00:05:09.820> bit<00:05:10.060> stretched<00:05:10.419> out<00:05:10.690> and<00:05:11.220> once

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
get a little bit stretched out and once

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.219 
get a little bit stretched out and once
chained<00:05:12.910> stretches<00:05:13.479> out<00:05:13.630> a<00:05:13.659> little<00:05:13.930> bit<00:05:14.110> it

these things the four strokes are

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:56.890 
these things the four strokes are
putting<00:06:55.849> out<00:06:55.939> a<00:06:55.969> lot<00:06:56.180> of<00:06:56.210> power<00:06:56.509> they're

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:56.900 
putting out a lot of power they're

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.029 
putting out a lot of power they're
sharing<00:06:57.439> the<00:06:57.969> oil<00:06:58.969> with<00:06:59.419> the<00:06:59.719> top<00:07:00.110> end<00:07:00.409> and<00:07:00.590> the

sharing the oil with the top end and the

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:02.709 
sharing the oil with the top end and the
transmission<00:07:01.639> you<00:07:01.969> got<00:07:02.120> to<00:07:02.240> take<00:07:02.389> that<00:07:02.569> in

00:07:02.709 --> 00:07:02.719 
transmission you got to take that in

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:05.499 
transmission you got to take that in
consideration<00:07:02.750> that<00:07:03.710> they<00:07:04.699> shared<00:07:05.090> into

00:07:05.499 --> 00:07:05.509 
consideration that they shared into

consideration that they shared into
Honda's<00:07:06.020> they<00:07:06.439> have<00:07:06.650> separate<00:07:07.629> chambers<00:07:08.629> they

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 
Honda's they have separate chambers they

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.869 
Honda's they have separate chambers they
actually<00:07:09.349> do<00:07:09.500> the<00:07:09.680> top<00:07:10.460> end

00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:10.879 
actually do the top end

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:13.119 
actually do the top end
bottom<00:07:11.659> end<00:07:11.810> of<00:07:11.960> the<00:07:12.020> engine<00:07:12.529> and<00:07:13.069> the

00:07:13.119 --> 00:07:13.129 
bottom end of the engine and the

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:17.890 
bottom end of the engine and the
transmission<00:07:13.550> is<00:07:14.210> a<00:07:14.270> separate<00:07:14.839> oil<00:07:15.039> so<00:07:16.689> but<00:07:17.689> on

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:17.900 
transmission is a separate oil so but on

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.369 
transmission is a separate oil so but on
Yamahas<00:07:18.500> they<00:07:19.219> they<00:07:20.089> share<00:07:20.389> the<00:07:20.599> same<00:07:20.810> oil<00:07:21.080> so

00:07:21.369 --> 00:07:21.379 
Yamahas they they share the same oil so

00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:23.170 
Yamahas they they share the same oil so
you<00:07:21.409> got<00:07:21.650> to<00:07:21.740> change<00:07:22.009> that<00:07:22.279> all<00:07:22.460> the<00:07:22.699> time<00:07:22.909> and

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:23.180 
you got to change that all the time and

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.029 
you got to change that all the time and
obviously<00:07:23.779> this<00:07:23.900> guy<00:07:24.080> has<00:07:24.229> changed<00:07:24.620> its<00:07:24.740> oil<00:07:24.889> a

00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:25.039 
obviously this guy has changed its oil a

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:28.629 
obviously this guy has changed its oil a
lot<00:07:25.249> of<00:07:25.430> times<00:07:25.699> and<00:07:26.539> I'm<00:07:27.080> it<00:07:27.800> pays<00:07:28.129> off<00:07:28.339> because
