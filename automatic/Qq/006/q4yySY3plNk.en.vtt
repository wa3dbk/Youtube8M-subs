00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
appearance because their aspect ratio

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.850

has<00:01:27.060> changed<00:01:27.479> longer<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.170> relation<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.650> their

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.440

doesn't<00:01:37.920> require<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.250> whole<00:01:38.549> lot<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.909> branding
