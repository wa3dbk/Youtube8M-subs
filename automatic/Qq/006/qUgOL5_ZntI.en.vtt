00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.000
 people have studied together their whole lives in the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:18.240
 port has been known since the ten years 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.460

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.940
 today we are here at the dior event 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.770
 I said there, let's talk a minute 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.380
 She spoke to you not for obama. 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.829
 It's okay with her in the shaggy, of course. 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.829
 from the beginning I do not think in verse 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.809
 six times of the blog we already gave 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.239
 This interview has been with me since 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.030
 start how do you see 2015 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.070
 and I sent it a year and 2015 a lot 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.809
 It's uncertain for everyone, is not everyone? 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.020
 with a cold in the belly mainly 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.190
 for the retail is everyone a coconut is 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.690
 holding an ipad andrÃ© joking because 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.250
 No one knows what's going to happen, right? 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.920
 Finally, it is a moment of view for the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.570
 Brazil, I think unfortunately thanks to 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.060
 God dollar is now doing well is 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.430
 surpassing expectations despite the year 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.009
 will be a year of crisis but it is a year of 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.920
 enough growth is maturing 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.560
 the brand I think that thanks to god 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.040
 every collection the brand comes surpassing knows 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.530
 is both quality and product of 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.770
 product mix in August we will have a 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.750
 the parade you are going to have to cover is 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.329
 preparing with a lot of affection but now 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.000
 talking in your life but as a blogger 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.159
 businesswoman also thinks that because of 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.290
 Brazil is joking the events are 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.990
 decreasing how is it? 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.100
 so I think so, I think 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.380
 brands are holding 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.200
 they are not they are afraid of 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.720
 High investments then right knows I 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.270
 I think it's really a year to give a 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.080
 brake knows how to take the foot off the accelerator and 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.600
 you as one as you so began 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.820
 I'm going to create a blog and you're one of the 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.360
 biggest bloggers in Brazil like 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.459
 was this part I never pretended to 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.650
 Nothing when I started I did 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:18.400
 law school I worked in a 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.350
 women's clothing store and I left the 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.760
 shop to dedicate myself to college only 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.100
 gives a hint of reconciling the two should 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.260
 begin to do internship such that I spoke 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.540
 before I start interning I go 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.489
 take a few words of vacation and as such 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.040
 do nothing your college 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.350
 I avoid blog like time purse even 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.300
 It's my friend, they always called me. 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.739
 asking there who has tried to travel 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.140
 What's new is that I buy 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.090
 hair makeup products I 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.370
 I always really liked to give the tip then 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.370
 I started without pretense of in the area a 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.950
 thing that's been happening is that it's turned 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.120
 my job for a while right mine 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.010
 main focus 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.340
 today I'm more focused on music one 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.019
 I want to continue with the blog of 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.870
 way he is taboo without losing his 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.730
 his identity is I think I think it's cool 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.730
 under this thing of being a hobby 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:13.810
 It's really a good thing to tell a 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:16.450
 virtual diary do not want to miss it and 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.329
 now its relation with wheel has a 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.030
 so it expanded more and more into it there 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:24.130
 in the beginning we know that you always 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.290
 liked fashion but nowadays you have 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.739
 has become an enabler right 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.320
 The trends of the Indy Parade know by 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:36.100
 sign now goes on paris fashion week and 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:38.739
 of animated twitter and that I always 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.230
 I liked fashion my family works and the 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.810
 family has been working with fashion since 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.489
 So I do not know if you remember the 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.510
 friends' hats when I was 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.700
 brand new 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.220
 to do with eight or nine years always 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.980
 I liked fashion is that it's a week of 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.980
 fashion outside the country is cooler as it is 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.319
 this expectation is the maximum 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.360
 fashion week to everyone what you want 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.980
 Kind of like this is very crazy is different from 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.560
 brazil because here if your more games 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.989
 strangers are already twisting their nose there 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.299
 It's very cool so it's very glamorous and 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.849
 the children are mega productions of the parade 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:20.049
 time but is something that sites 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:22.840
 chin down know how do you guys 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.820
 They look good at home or you like 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.030
 travel long ago did quite a lot 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.880
 in the ballad and give it to me I always like 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.710
 to prioritize the family know is before 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.340
 I work before anything I 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.949
 Priority this is for example is the week 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.139
 of fashion he can follow then 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:42.610
 he always accompanies me and all the 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.650
 work travel because today I am 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.930
 here in the river I go back and I'll make a bat 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.699
 Come back to sleep at home, we have 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.340
 very much this is a relationship that 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:53.770
 complicity so we combined that 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.030
 Let's get married, then we'll go. 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.320
 trying to adapt he has a 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.139
 old restaurant also always 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.990
 That's exactly it, I guess. 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:04.389
 what has to be always 1 give up one 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.560
 tie is the couple has to give up 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:07.750
 certain things 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.680
 the best part is the worst part of having 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:14.919
 married there is the worst I think it is not 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.590
 the worst hope not discover has 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:20.800
 Something you will do in 2015 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:23.020
 What do you want to tell us is the 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.110
 several partnerships now and kill I'm going to launch 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.849

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.780

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.930
 the parade in August that I also already 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:41.060

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:45.230
