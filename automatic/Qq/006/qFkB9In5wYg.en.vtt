 he is now working with the toppers because celibacy is just about over 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:15.469
 that celibacy plays a role in this 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.469
 I don't think so 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:20.900
 I don't get into it 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.560
 my ideas about this act and you don't have that 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:27.980
 sat in it 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.310
 when the religious touched the priesthood 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.149
 smit 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:33.069
 a particular 

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:36.560
 disorder determine certain affective disorder 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.270
 and how did you get there eight years ago they were blindly selected who 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.630
 actress nathalie kramers showed psv twice how to find appearances in ashes 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.429
 in these countries they will be seen in time 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:49.180
 also like them 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.860
 Alex birthday boy in the newspaper said the museum but I am not going 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.590
 Florissant I said that's just the ball, frankly this is not 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.460
 just of course 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.600
 get rid of intimacy of course, of course it is unclear whether this 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.310
 countries where the euro is spent on work 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.250
 and why why 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.250
 who not so no why then that of now 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.120
 thanks to a personal 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.799
 situation counted out if you set that to yourself 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.670
 the art lead a happy life and mean all bands at the station 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.950
 from the beginning 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:24.710
 a road 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.990
 years there were probably people in the whole system too 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.060
 from the monastery 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.970
 from being electric to some unusual states where she was riding in 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.140
 Arnhem with the cake past 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.360
 there are still happening now too 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.590
 yes that is now the case, stay there for a moment even take it into account 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.020
 It's not that we no longer have a way to count in society 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.260
 brings nothing to see in the Netherlands We are certainly not in Amsterdam 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.080
 has been arrested 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.300
 In North Holland there are still less prosperous countries known at the same 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.950
 way attention to the matter that is going too far for life 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:57.900
 there we have to 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.170
 we have everyone can say what you think about it 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.010
 get celibacy look it is that 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.580
 in all churches Protestant Catholic Christian sexuality, of course, always 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:11.769
 less taboo subject again 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.519
 it was not in the center of attention 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.560
 a pity because the Jews have that truth 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.500
 I have I it is not so you can but history is that 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.819
 all can be explained 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.219
 but it happened 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:27.229
 so that the touchwiz catholic church means homosexuality 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.400
 and sexuality itself not exactly happy heard 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.799
 shape the experience 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.869
 I personally think that's a shame 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:41.019
 that if homosexuality is not really known as a variant in the church 

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:46.719
 I very much regret that a Celibate doctor said I was the source of all the misery 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:48.589
 I am very much in bed 

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:51.100
 priests and fathers dealt with I know 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.539
 how hard it is 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:55.809
 allaerts garad parties with girlfriends hidden 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:03:00.459
 scaled that guys that's just annoying and that's an asset behind that 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.229
 also comes that being able to experience sexuality in a normal way 

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:07.539
 That is not to say that Protestant clergy all made time because 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:11.729
 Let's face it sexuality is a complaint that it can no longer be normal 

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:15.779
 send it is it's trial and error plus start talking sexuality 

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:19.539
 celibacy is the tree of everything 

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:22.929
 nice site say a bit indiscriminate i think 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:25.429
 the body was released 

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:29.039
 volunteers get that they are actually saying with this record 

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:31.399
 it only got hurt 

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:32.200
 I was 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.279
 we have 34 years i am 

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:38.779
 the judge goes it 20 degrees in the east the students came out 

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:42.849
 well there you are in the world his assistants 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.099
 there they cashed in a new state, a strange one, but what I learned 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.779
 I agree with the volunteer in the monastery 

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:51.989
 from a jeep vs 6 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.969
 and what you shouldn't forget if you were such a monastery that spoke with 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:57.049
 no one 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:01.370
 so you properly emergency services the first zeeuwse year you don't even talk to 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.219
 your fellow man who many her own 

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:06.559
 that you can check that allow a wonderful 

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:07.879
 do you want to learn art 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:10.189
 because the 34 companies 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:12.779
 four ladies are killed in the former 

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:17.200
 the social academy what you need to refine and change the case 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.380
 among the teachers think doing best 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.969
 that has the village on the 

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:22.909
 in are the big favorites 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:25.860
 I was lucky to have the other half for a second half of the week 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.759
 can do 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:29.580
 but the celibacy there a link is also a power source 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.430
 of spirituality and I have very many people who will benefit us anyway 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.460
 his grandfather celibate and I also have married people who like it very much 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.400
 emotionally not fully grown it's just not all ok but sir 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.849
 kick I tell you retina is still stroke 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:48.400
 he says the meat is weak 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.460
 yes but that party should not exaggerate from me there this Friday 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.770
 know 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.870
 it was a bright light of the pears his steadfastness is very intelligent 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:58.720
 your body 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.659
 intermediate position 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:01.809
 your feeling and your mind 

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:05.979
 I know enough people and I became more annoying with a general I very annoying people 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:07.580
 who are very happy 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.389
 and have sexual contact 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:10.909
 but if the agenda was too small 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:13.809
 yes this as a married man that it will last 

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:17.499
 next to the wife and there are but they are in one alone 

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:21.199
 We are not only talking about sexuality, I am also talking about it 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:24.769
 intimacy and a lot with 27 June in a church 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:27.210
 good people for a date krumm 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.229
 fantastic emotional contact emotionally but you also want an intimate 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:32.949
 Contact 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:33.900
 then I think then
