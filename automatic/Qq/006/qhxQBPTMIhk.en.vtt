 convinced Elena Yakimenko 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:07.770
 for these purposes 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.770
 the backbone of a man 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.479
 everyone understands that 

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:16.479

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.009
 all these big projects 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.009
 Karaganda 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:29.249
 in the same time 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:30.630
 square 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.810
 which point beating the face 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.339
 Viktor Alder 

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:37.339

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.560
 Baku 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.520
 At first, I told him 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.100

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.170
 dollars if you fight fret 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.170
 Putin asked father and mother 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.630

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.560
 spoke 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.380
 that is a fact 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.280

 the first 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.750
 just for them I would like to 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.580

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.730

 in my opinion what to do 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:20.809
 At the beginning of June 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.579
 but an ATM 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.909
 was it an objective report 

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:58.719
