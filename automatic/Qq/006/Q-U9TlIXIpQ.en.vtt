00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.730 
so we'll get dirty like you can see
these<00:01:42.360> are<00:01:42.420> our<00:01:42.689> last<00:01:42.899> year<00:01:43.170> for<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.439> couple

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
these are our last year for a couple

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.830 
these are our last year for a couple
games<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.909> go<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.119> see<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.390> white<00:01:45.600> is

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
games and you go to see the white is

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.280 
games and you go to see the white is
kind<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.649> brown<00:01:47.720> now<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.810> difference<00:01:49.170> with

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
kind of brown now the difference with

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.700 
kind of brown now the difference with
the<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.729> wrist<00:01:50.939> lock<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.500> wrist

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
the the wrist lock is that the wrist

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.510 
the the wrist lock is that the wrist
lock<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.070> very<00:01:53.340> stretchy<00:01:53.790> light<00:01:54.180> material<00:01:55.520> not

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
lock is very stretchy light material not

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.249 
lock is very stretchy light material not
very<00:01:56.850> big<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.479> if<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.840> give<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.049> lot<00:01:58.140> of

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
very big so if I give a lot of

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.039 
very big so if I give a lot of
flexibility<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.540> it<00:02:00.540> conforms<00:02:00.990> to

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
flexibility in it and it conforms to

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.249 
flexibility in it and it conforms to
your<00:02:01.140> wrist<00:02:01.380> when<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.399> nike<00:02:02.700> one<00:02:03.140> with<00:02:04.140> the

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
your wrist when the nike one with the

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.450 
your wrist when the nike one with the
nike<00:02:04.439> one<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.890> don't<00:02:05.070> have<00:02:05.189> as<00:02:05.280> much

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
nike one you don't have as much

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.990 
nike one you don't have as much
flexibility<00:02:06.439> because<00:02:07.439> of<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.770> strap<00:02:08.069> of<00:02:08.190> the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
flexibility because of the strap of the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.900 
flexibility because of the strap of the
material<00:02:10.009> so<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.069> don't<00:02:11.220> have<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.370> lot<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.640> much

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
material so you don't have a lot of much

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.460 
material so you don't have a lot of much
pool<00:02:12.360> with<00:02:12.540> it

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
pool with it

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.750 
pool with it
even<00:02:13.830> though<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.100> velcro<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.520> a<00:02:14.580> little

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
even though the velcro is a little

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.230 
even though the velcro is a little
bigger<00:02:16.280> but<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:17.430> still<00:02:17.670> don't<00:02:17.730> have<00:02:17.940> as<00:02:18.060> much

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
bigger but you still don't have as much

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.240 
bigger but you still don't have as much
like<00:02:18.450> flexibility<00:02:19.080> is<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.350> if<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:19.890> would<00:02:20.070> even

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
like flexibility is it if you would even

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.880 
like flexibility is it if you would even
armor<00:02:21.000> one<00:02:21.180> in<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:22.290> dip<00:02:22.500> there<00:02:22.710> is<00:02:22.860> a

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
armor one in the dip there is a

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.250 
armor one in the dip there is a
difference<00:02:23.430> in<00:02:23.550> size<00:02:23.810> because<00:02:24.810> this<00:02:25.080> was<00:02:25.230> a

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
difference in size because this was a

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.810 
difference in size because this was a
compression<00:02:25.890> was<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.310> has<00:02:26.460> a<00:02:26.490> little<00:02:26.700> more

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
compression was so it has a little more

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.740 
compression was so it has a little more
like<00:02:27.180> stretch<00:02:27.920> stretch<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.220> it<00:02:29.250> so<00:02:29.690> these<00:02:30.690> are

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
like stretch stretch to it so these are

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.570 
like stretch stretch to it so these are
actually<00:02:31.290> extra<00:02:31.710> larges<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.340> these<00:02:32.430> are

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
actually extra larges and these are

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.350 
actually extra larges and these are
large<00:02:32.880> because<00:02:33.210> these<00:02:33.570> I<00:02:34.340> I<00:02:35.340> fit<00:02:35.880> in<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.120> large

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
large because these I I fit in a large

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.700 
large because these I I fit in a large
but<00:02:36.570> they're<00:02:36.720> they're<00:02:37.230> really<00:02:37.440> tight<00:02:37.680> and

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
but they're they're really tight and

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.560 
but they're they're really tight and
then<00:02:38.100> I<00:02:38.190> wear<00:02:38.670> extra<00:02:38.940> larges<00:02:39.270> but<00:02:39.450> they're

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
then I wear extra larges but they're

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.630 
then I wear extra larges but they're
little<00:02:39.780> loose<00:02:40.020> but<00:02:40.290> these<00:02:40.950> are<00:02:41.100> extra<00:02:41.400> larges

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
little loose but these are extra larges

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.080 
little loose but these are extra larges
and<00:02:41.940> they<00:02:42.120> fit<00:02:42.360> perfectly<00:02:43.100> so<00:02:44.100> honestly<00:02:45.030> I

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
and they fit perfectly so honestly I

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.140 
and they fit perfectly so honestly I
recommend<00:02:45.660> that<00:02:45.720> under<00:02:46.110> armour<00:02:46.230> f4<00:02:47.150> gloves

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150
