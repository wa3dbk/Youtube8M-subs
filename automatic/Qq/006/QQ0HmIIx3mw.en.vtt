I can then go onto e folios here the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.520 
I can then go onto e folios here the
picture<00:01:21.810> shows

text<00:01:41.820> let's<00:01:42.720> see<00:01:42.960> what<00:01:43.440> a<00:01:43.470> difference<00:01:43.530> that

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
text let's see what a difference that

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.510 
text let's see what a difference that
makes<00:01:44.810> also<00:01:45.810> in<00:01:46.110> PowerPoint<00:01:46.770> you're<00:01:47.009> able<00:01:47.369> to

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
makes also in PowerPoint you're able to

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.510 
makes also in PowerPoint you're able to
manipulate<00:01:47.790> your<00:01:48.300> images<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:49.399> would<00:01:50.399> suggest

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
manipulate your images I would suggest

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.850 
manipulate your images I would suggest
not<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.030> use<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.899> function<00:01:52.530> too<00:01:52.680> much

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
not to use this function too much

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.289 
not to use this function too much
because<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.369> more<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.580> stretched<00:01:54.030> your

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
because the more you stretched your

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.420 
because the more you stretched your
picture<00:01:55.940> the<00:01:56.940> more<00:01:57.149> distorted<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.869> becomes<00:01:58.430> so

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
picture the more distorted it becomes so

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.430 
picture the more distorted it becomes so
bear<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.909> mind<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.570> key<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.020> get<00:02:01.350> an

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
bear that in mind the key is to get an

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.020 
bear that in mind the key is to get an
image<00:02:01.590> large<00:02:02.100> enough<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:02.550> that<00:02:02.580> you<00:02:02.759> will<00:02:02.970> not

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
image large enough so that you will not

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.620 
image large enough so that you will not
have<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.509> do<00:02:03.810> too<00:02:04.020> much<00:02:04.170> manipulating<00:02:05.630> this

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
have to do too much manipulating this

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.960 
have to do too much manipulating this
image<00:02:07.619> could<00:02:07.800> very<00:02:08.039> easily<00:02:08.130> become<00:02:08.729> very

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
image could very easily become very

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.120 
image could very easily become very
small<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:11.300> if<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.510> wanted<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:12.900> make<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.920> a

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
small and if I wanted to make it a

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.229 
small and if I wanted to make it a
hyperlink<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:15.050> could<00:02:16.050> go<00:02:16.170> up<00:02:16.350> to<00:02:16.380> insert<00:02:17.239> come

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
hyperlink I could go up to insert come

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.370 
hyperlink I could go up to insert come
down<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.600> hyperlink

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.310 

if<00:02:23.860> we<00:02:24.070> can<00:02:24.250> remember<00:02:24.700> our<00:02:25.030> different<00:02:25.900> options

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
if we can remember our different options

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.020 
if we can remember our different options
we<00:02:26.440> can<00:02:26.560> go<00:02:26.650> to<00:02:26.710> a<00:02:26.860> web<00:02:27.040> page<00:02:27.070> a<00:02:27.310> place<00:02:27.760> in<00:02:27.910> this
