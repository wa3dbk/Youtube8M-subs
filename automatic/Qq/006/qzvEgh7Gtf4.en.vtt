let's open this baby up nope give me a
sec<00:01:27.280> here<00:01:27.429> guys<00:01:29.459> and<00:01:30.509> let's<00:01:31.509> take<00:01:31.780> out<00:01:32.050> the

00:01:32.339 --> 00:01:32.349 
sec here guys and let's take out the

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:35.279 
sec here guys and let's take out the
mouse<00:01:32.530> itself<00:01:33.280> so<00:01:33.789> the<00:01:34.420> first<00:01:34.690> thing<00:01:34.869> I<00:01:34.990> notice

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
mouse itself so the first thing I notice

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.139 
mouse itself so the first thing I notice
about<00:01:35.380> this<00:01:35.709> particular<00:01:36.369> Mouse<00:01:36.550> is<00:01:36.789> that<00:01:36.970> it

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
about this particular Mouse is that it

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.469 
about this particular Mouse is that it
is<00:01:37.420> in<00:01:37.750> economic<00:01:38.740> style<00:01:39.069> Mouse<00:01:39.310> so<00:01:40.119> what<00:01:40.330> that

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
is in economic style Mouse so what that

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.749 
is in economic style Mouse so what that
means<00:01:40.840> is<00:01:41.259> that<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:44.170> will<00:01:44.530> only<00:01:44.770> really<00:01:45.160> fit<00:01:45.490> in

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
means is that it will only really fit in

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.490 
means is that it will only really fit in
the<00:01:45.970> right<00:01:46.330> hand<00:01:46.630> if<00:01:46.840> you<00:01:46.929> try<00:01:47.080> to<00:01:47.140> use<00:01:47.349> this

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
the right hand if you try to use this

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.589 
the right hand if you try to use this
with<00:01:47.709> your<00:01:47.860> left<00:01:48.039> hand<00:01:48.250> it<00:01:48.490> is<00:01:48.640> not<00:01:48.880> going<00:01:49.420> to

00:01:49.589 --> 00:01:49.599 
with your left hand it is not going to

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:53.490 
with your left hand it is not going to
work<00:01:49.810> very<00:01:50.679> well<00:01:50.770> at<00:01:51.160> all<00:01:52.349> because<00:01:53.349> the

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
work very well at all because the

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.279 
work very well at all because the
positioning<00:01:54.099> will<00:01:54.250> be<00:01:54.399> all<00:01:54.640> wrong<00:01:55.060> however<00:01:56.050> if

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
positioning will be all wrong however if

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:58.020 
positioning will be all wrong however if
you<00:01:56.440> use<00:01:56.470> it<00:01:56.739> in<00:01:56.800> your<00:01:56.920> right<00:01:57.069> hand<00:01:57.099> this<00:01:57.610> is

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
you use it in your right hand this is

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.960 
you use it in your right hand this is
going<00:01:58.810> to<00:01:58.959> fit<00:01:59.229> like<00:01:59.679> a<00:01:59.920> glove<00:01:59.979> you<00:02:00.610> can<00:02:00.729> see

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
going to fit like a glove you can see

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.270 
going to fit like a glove you can see
actually<00:02:01.420> I<00:02:01.599> would<00:02:02.050> say<00:02:02.259> right<00:02:02.709> off<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:03.099> bat

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
actually I would say right off the bat

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.400 
actually I would say right off the bat
that<00:02:03.310> this<00:02:03.550> would<00:02:03.849> be<00:02:04.000> best<00:02:04.300> for<00:02:04.959> someone<00:02:05.110> with

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
that this would be best for someone with

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.290 
that this would be best for someone with
smaller<00:02:05.679> hands<00:02:06.009> like<00:02:06.429> myself<00:02:06.970> because<00:02:07.270> you

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
smaller hands like myself because you

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.330 
smaller hands like myself because you
can<00:02:07.539> see<00:02:07.690> that<00:02:07.840> fits<00:02:08.050> very<00:02:08.140> comfortably

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
can see that fits very comfortably

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.680 
can see that fits very comfortably
whereas<00:02:09.340> if<00:02:09.459> I<00:02:09.550> had<00:02:09.700> larger<00:02:10.179> hands<00:02:10.509> I<00:02:10.599> don't

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
whereas if I had larger hands I don't

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.760 
whereas if I had larger hands I don't
know<00:02:10.929> that<00:02:11.080> it<00:02:11.140> would<00:02:11.200> work<00:02:11.380> quite<00:02:11.620> as<00:02:11.739> well

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
know that it would work quite as well

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.070 
know that it would work quite as well
mind<00:02:12.280> you<00:02:12.489> if<00:02:12.910> you're<00:02:13.150> using<00:02:13.180> a<00:02:13.540> fingertip

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
grip or a claw style grip then a smaller

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.050 
grip or a claw style grip then a smaller
mouse<00:02:17.409> can<00:02:17.769> be<00:02:17.799> preferred<00:02:18.310> especially<00:02:18.459> if<00:02:18.969> you
