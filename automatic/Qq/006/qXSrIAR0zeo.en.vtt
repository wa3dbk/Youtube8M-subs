00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:04.379
 they have to worry that we are one side 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.710
 the white ones 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.049
 Baumann on the other side the blue 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.539
 Pieces here it can happen that we are something citizen something like Karl 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.170
 Thier so an insoluble dice stand there but you can easily 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:19.880
 Of course, I'm lucky 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.310
 and you happen to be wrong 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.869
 when the wrong position I should solve so up here 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.539
 Weisz 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.029
 Haki that is 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.029
 you also see the gold pretty much the most difficult position 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.420
 they have to be raised now 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.380
 Marlies Volkmer measures 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.380
 I turn out of the line of fire 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.590
 that the companies prices 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.410
 d'government a hundred and eighty degrees 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.460
 network issues 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.940
 the two wise men 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.390
 there will be this 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.260
 Driver Amalia around she ran up and already I have three parts above 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.290
 In order to address that, I now want to get this part that music from the 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.420
 Turn the firing line and that makes sense for them 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.009
 Now you come down this one and then it's on this one 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:09.940
 position 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.800
 to be from Toto this bit off 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.990
 Gribl at the atomic bomb 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.010
 the four and five 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.170
 and I can do it again 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.950
 Insert Book of Moses 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.180
 already have the novels Weissenbrunn all blue 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.360
 to make our forecasts 2 then right they are two of the 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.050
 right place that is 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.160
 for the honesty 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.049
 Clerici creates the problem here so fast for you 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.049
 ste 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.590
 so now we have 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.810
 the traps 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.200
 that nowhere are two important trades 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.270
 here for a white one 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.950
 because it does not 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.030
 here is not 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.900
 because it does not 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.370
 and he even recognizes when I live my life 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.800
 The No Angels are considered as an example 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.350
 is no longer solvable 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.439
 to be tipped king in Italy 

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:10.739
 he is completely wrong 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.590
 Again, this is the other way, red draw would have to sit some of the spot 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:18.130
 and green is wrong too if that happens 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.289
 then he admires the couple then we just have to dismiss all wise 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:25.289
 bring to the GAL on the blue side that's easy 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:28.469
 I do something 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:31.469
 paint free 

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:34.519
 Trier ots the shot out of the line of fire 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.039
 the white heron 

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:37.649
 and yet again 

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:39.419
 the inches up 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:41.149
 I have already 

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:44.149
 Hiring and promoted 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.959
 Greeks again 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.939
 and because I turn it back immediately 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:57.819
 Brier but the two 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.819
 on the air lease and he advises back 

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:02.980
 and I already screwed up 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.700
 and that's how it sown 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.579
 Now I have both of my own 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.849
 correct DEK pieces and can 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.139
 the new algorithm 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:15.419
 apply 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:18.569
 as long as other things wanted to learn reversed as well 

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:21.289
 with two experts 

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:25.559
 together but it is no longer the other of 2 times 2 

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:26.580
 act 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.719
 because we would mess things up in here 

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:33.309
 when we apply new algorithm units like the solved two ex- 

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:34.609
 Beatle forward 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.579
 and the further unresolved backwards 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.579
 here too, it can also be that they are diagonal 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.189
 then the whole two reminds you to make the important thing is "redeemed over 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:48.119
 Left in the front 

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:50.959
 located 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.579
 always redeemed in front of the longest runway 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.009
 either 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:57.059
 at two adjacent 

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:58.769
 is behind the 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.369
 solved times are long gone 

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:03.009
 or the u9 then here 

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:05.959
 after he made it there I got two 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.009
 solved and can make the ball well again 

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.989
 so 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.309
 Here we go 

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:12.220
 around 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.599
 the project was Jens Wischmann twice 2 comes through Nani 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.459
 cath um 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.870
 So so Stemer redeemed front left 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.389
 at the diagonal who now solved here in the crook of his arm because I now have two 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.699
 Because men lie forward and I want the two of us have the 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:34.699
 swap the two backs 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:37.059
 solved 

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:39.900
 unresolved no wrong position 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.340
 Guti became rhythm 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.210
 pretty easy to remember because every second f2 is pulled 

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:49.799
 and for that reason only the others are taken 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:53.669
 Steps to remember Klose 13 trains 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.529
 So every second 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:58.529
 Knuth it always f2 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:01.900
 Dell second 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.900
 f2p 

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:13.550
 he dreams 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.550
 we only get to learn three 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:20.969
 f2 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.039
 d 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:28.039
 f2 

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:32.930
 indisputable 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.930
 FCN 

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:42.309
 and we see that we have not solved any in Oberembt 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:46.659
 Center or with a partner brought it all over that great 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:49.659
 and do the same here 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.169
 I try to create it here in the takeover 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.080
 so now I have made the choice that we are here 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.139
 Inch diagonal 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:08.379
 right pieces have that what I've heard of hearing 

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:11.279
 I always want to make sense in tutorials to show all the cases 

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:12.639
 may occur 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:15.619
 okay because the untruth i put it on like that 

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:17.639
 solved and indeed a solved one 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:20.639
 and let's go again Elz Rheine 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.550
 f though one 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.610
 f2 on top of that, Kraft's choice 

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:33.969
 FC Union and FDP not f2 

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:36.159
 and 2 

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:38.430
 and we see now we have 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.400
 2 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.570
 two solved corners which are just next to other leagues and now you can 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.849
 Apply algorithm one last time around the back two corners 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:51.849
 to exchange with each other 

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:55.059
 Eleven names 

00:06:55.059 --> 00:06:57.080
 2 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.330
 U.N. 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.899
 Krafts 9 

00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:03.719
 and the big trumps in the hand 

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:06.180
 Fri 2 10 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.180
 de 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.319
 fixed 2 

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:14.930
 knitted 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.930
 f 2 

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.249
 or whole 

00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:24.610
 only birds whole grief is solved 

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.689
 I hope it was a bit fun this could do something with it 

00:07:27.689 --> 00:07:32.110
 This solution Smith would be two new middle twice the two years 

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:34.100
 solve and then around the 

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.009
 to take care of our two countries 

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:39.479
 if you have any questions just have a look 

00:07:39.479 --> 00:07:45.209
 on www v-WÃ¼rfel - Friedberg instead of PD and many thanks for listening
