00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
square that you see here it's a little

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.900 
square that you see here it's a little

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
it because it's smooth but at the same

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.960 
it because it's smooth but at the same
time<00:03:14.290> this<00:03:14.590> gives<00:03:14.980> you<00:03:15.540> traction<00:03:16.540> and<00:03:17.970> I

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
time this gives you traction and I

time this gives you traction and I
really<00:03:19.510> like<00:03:19.630> that<00:03:19.660> type<00:03:20.110> of<00:03:20.140> a<00:03:20.760> material

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
really like that type of a material

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.479 
really like that type of a material

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
because it goes in your pocket without

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.030 
because it goes in your pocket without
much<00:03:25.180> effort<00:03:25.480> and<00:03:26.019> it<00:03:26.320> will<00:03:26.470> not<00:03:26.650> rip<00:03:26.829> your

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
much effort and it will not rip your

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:35.360 
much effort and it will not rip your
pants<00:03:27.280> up<00:03:27.900> apart<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:30.820> blade<00:03:31.060> shape<00:03:33.269> it's<00:03:34.269> a

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
pants up apart the blade shape it's a

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.530 
pants up apart the blade shape it's a
modified<00:03:36.370> one<00:03:36.940> cliff<00:03:37.840> as<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:39.670> Spyderco<00:03:40.269> says

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
modified one cliff as the Spyderco says

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.199 
modified one cliff as the Spyderco says
although<00:03:41.100> it<00:03:42.100> really<00:03:42.370> doesn't<00:03:42.730> looks<00:03:42.940> like<00:03:43.180> a

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
although it really doesn't looks like a

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.530 
although it really doesn't looks like a
modified<00:03:43.750> one<00:03:44.230> clip<00:03:45.010> but<00:03:45.280> I<00:03:45.549> can<00:03:46.000> say<00:03:46.180> I<00:03:46.329> can

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
modified one clip but I can say I can

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.789 
modified one clip but I can say I can
see<00:03:46.720> why<00:03:46.930> because<00:03:47.320> there's<00:03:47.739> a<00:03:48.450> solid<00:03:49.450> drop<00:03:49.799> on

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
see why because there's a solid drop on

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.819 
see why because there's a solid drop on
this<00:03:51.010> part<00:03:51.340> and<00:03:51.670> this<00:03:52.630> toe<00:03:52.989> stretches<00:03:53.530> here

jimping and this knife is actually uh

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.710 
jimping and this knife is actually uh
you<00:07:27.590> can<00:07:27.740> carry<00:07:27.950> it<00:07:28.130> probably<00:07:28.580> in<00:07:29.300> most<00:07:29.510> of<00:07:29.630> the

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:29.720 
you can carry it probably in most of the

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.310 
you can carry it probably in most of the
states<00:07:29.960> because<00:07:30.230> it<00:07:31.180> it's<00:07:32.180> none<00:07:32.390> non-locking

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:33.320 
states because it it's none non-locking

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.780 
states because it it's none non-locking
so<00:07:33.890> it's<00:07:34.160> probably<00:07:34.520> legal<00:07:34.940> in<00:07:35.090> a<00:07:35.270> lot<00:07:35.450> of

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:36.790 
so it's probably legal in a lot of

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.370 
so it's probably legal in a lot of
places

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:38.380
