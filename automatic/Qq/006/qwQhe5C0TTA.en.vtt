the e the B the G and the low heat you

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.849 
the e the B the G and the low heat you
tune<00:00:17.670> them<00:00:17.850> all<00:00:17.970> down<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.600> half<00:00:18.960> step<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.590> whole

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
tune them all down a half step a whole

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:20.359 
tune them all down a half step a whole

two<00:00:20.699> frets<00:00:21.000> so<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:22.050> e<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.619> B<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.070> G<00:00:23.720> low<00:00:24.720> e<00:00:25.070> all

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
two frets so the e the B the G low e all

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.810 
two frets so the e the B the G low e all
tuned<00:00:26.789> down<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.390> whole<00:00:27.599> step<00:00:28.400> the<00:00:29.400> only<00:00:29.429> two

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
tuned down a whole step the only two

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.519 
tuned down a whole step the only two
strings<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.449> are<00:00:30.570> not<00:00:30.720> tuned<00:00:31.019> down<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.260> whole

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
strings that are not tuned down a whole

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.229 
strings that are not tuned down a whole
step<00:00:31.679> are<00:00:32.630> the<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.140> D<00:00:35.090> so<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.149> know

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
step are the a and the D so you know

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.330 
step are the a and the D so you know
it's<00:00:36.390> kind<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.570> interesting<00:00:37.010> so<00:00:38.010> now<00:00:38.129> if<00:00:38.219> you

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
it's kind of interesting so now if you

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.010 
it's kind of interesting so now if you
tune<00:00:38.579> down<00:00:38.820> those<00:00:39.059> strings<00:00:39.329> like<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.600> just<00:00:39.660> said

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
tune down those strings like I just said

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.040 
tune down those strings like I just said
the<00:00:40.170> e<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.980> B<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.489> G<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.969> low<00:00:42.120> heat<00:00:42.390> tune<00:00:42.899> them

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
the e the B the G the low heat tune them

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.190 
the e the B the G the low heat tune them
all<00:00:43.140> down<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> whole<00:00:43.710> step

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
all down a whole step

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.700 
all down a whole step
you<00:00:46.200> got<00:00:46.379> an<00:00:46.500> open<00:00:46.770> D<00:00:46.980> minor<00:00:48.350> conversely<00:00:49.350> if

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
you got an open D minor conversely if

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.770 
you got an open D minor conversely if
you<00:00:49.770> took<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.550> only<00:00:50.700> two<00:00:51.030> strings<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.480> didn't

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
you took the only two strings you didn't

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.709 
you took the only two strings you didn't
read<00:00:51.960> tune<00:00:52.170> which<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.980> D<00:00:53.010> and

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
read tune which is the a and the D and

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.279 
read tune which is the a and the D and
tune<00:00:54.719> them<00:00:54.960> up<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.590> whole<00:00:55.860> step<00:00:56.899> B<00:00:57.899> just<00:00:58.109> like<00:00:58.140> an

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
tune them up a whole step B just like an

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.529 
tune them up a whole step B just like an
E<00:00:58.440> minor<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:59.460> you're<00:00:59.579> doing<00:00:59.760> an<00:00:59.850> open<00:01:00.120> E<00:01:00.270> minor

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
E minor so you're doing an open E minor

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.299 
E minor so you're doing an open E minor
but<00:01:01.079> that's<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.620> know<00:01:01.649> you're<00:01:01.859> more<00:01:01.980> likely

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
but that's you know you're more likely

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.490 
but that's you know you're more likely
to<00:01:02.399> break<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.640> string<00:01:03.030> tuning<00:01:03.480> up<00:01:03.690> then<00:01:04.140> tuning

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
to break a string tuning up then tuning

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.690 
to break a string tuning up then tuning
down<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:05.040> most<00:01:05.670> people<00:01:06.060> would<00:01:06.240> tune<00:01:06.510> down<00:01:07.700> take

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
down so most people would tune down take

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.770 
down so most people would tune down take
these<00:01:08.880> four<00:01:09.090> strings<00:01:09.479> e<00:01:10.400> bg8<00:01:11.400> tuna<00:01:12.390> mold<00:01:12.600> down

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
these four strings e bg8 tuna mold down

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.240 
these four strings e bg8 tuna mold down
a<00:01:12.810> hole<00:01:13.080> how<00:01:13.740> would<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:13.979> do<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.159> well<00:01:14.430> easy

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
a hole how would you do it well easy

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.950 
a hole how would you do it well easy
rather<00:01:17.150> than<00:01:17.470> using<00:01:18.470> the<00:01:18.650> fifth<00:01:18.950> fret<00:01:19.960> take

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
rather than using the fifth fret take

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.490 
rather than using the fifth fret take
the<00:01:21.080> B<00:01:21.260> string<00:01:21.590> third<00:01:22.100> fret<00:01:22.960> to<00:01:23.960> the<00:01:24.140> e<00:01:24.170> string

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
the B string third fret to the e string

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:34.030 
the B string third fret to the e string
to<00:01:24.620> that<00:01:31.780> now<00:01:32.780> normally<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:33.500> fourth<00:01:33.770> fret

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
to that now normally the fourth fret

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.790 
to that now normally the fourth fret
would<00:01:34.610> be<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.820> same<00:01:35.030> as<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:35.270> open<00:01:35.540> B<00:01:35.720> you<00:01:36.620> want

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
would be the same as the open B you want

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.980 
would be the same as the open B you want
to<00:01:36.890> tune<00:01:37.010> it<00:01:37.160> down<00:01:37.190> a<00:01:37.340> whole<00:01:37.610> step<00:01:37.760> so<00:01:38.210> go<00:01:38.930> to

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
to tune it down a whole step so go to

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.930 
to tune it down a whole step so go to
the<00:01:39.140> second<00:01:39.470> fret<00:01:39.650> on<00:01:39.680> the<00:01:39.830> G<00:01:42.700> turn<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:43.820> B

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
the second fret on the G turn the B

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:53.020 
the second fret on the G turn the B
string<00:01:44.240> to<00:01:44.270> that<00:01:51.070> now<00:01:52.070> you<00:01:52.130> take<00:01:52.400> the<00:01:52.520> g<00:01:52.730> string

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
string to that now you take the g string

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.550 
string to that now you take the g string
tune<00:01:53.270> it<00:01:53.390> all<00:01:53.510> the<00:01:53.630> way<00:01:53.750> down<00:01:53.990> to<00:01:54.350> F<00:01:57.310> generally

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
tune it all the way down to F generally

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.690 
tune it all the way down to F generally
instead<00:02:00.560> instead<00:02:01.040> of<00:02:01.100> doing<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.400> fifth

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
instead instead of doing the fifth

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.040 
instead instead of doing the fifth
string<00:02:02.210> on<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:02.510> D

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
string on the D

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:16.460 
string on the D
usually<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.070> same<00:02:04.310> as<00:02:04.340> an<00:02:04.550> open<00:02:04.850> G<00:02:05.500> third<00:02:06.500> fret

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.089 

fine

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.759 

and<00:02:21.099> just<00:02:21.879> take<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.299> low<00:02:22.930> heat<00:02:23.200> tune<00:02:23.620> it<00:02:23.739> to

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
and just take the low heat tune it to

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:38.449 
and just take the low heat tune it to
the<00:02:23.950> same<00:02:24.159> as<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.400> high<00:02:24.579> e

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.530 

got<00:02:39.459> a<00:02:39.489> fine<00:02:39.730> tuner<00:02:39.970> because<00:02:40.209> you<00:02:40.300> know<00:02:40.420> when

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
got a fine tuner because you know when

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.670 
got a fine tuner because you know when
you're<00:02:40.660> doing<00:02:40.750> open<00:02:41.110> tuning<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.650> guitar

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
you're doing open tuning the guitar

you're doing open tuning the guitar
moves<00:02:42.160> a<00:02:42.370> little<00:02:42.489> and<00:02:43.239> each<00:02:43.360> time<00:02:43.630> you<00:02:43.660> redo<00:02:44.050> a
