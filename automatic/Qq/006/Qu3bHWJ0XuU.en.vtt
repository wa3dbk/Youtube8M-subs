and I want to show you the processor of

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.750 
and I want to show you the processor of

attempt<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.779> build<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.619> want<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.279> try<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:23.850> make

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
attempt to build I want to try and make

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.560 
attempt to build I want to try and make
a<00:00:24.000> totem<00:00:24.480> using<00:00:25.350> this<00:00:25.890> kind<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.640> design<00:00:27.000> that

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
a totem using this kind of design that

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.849 
a totem using this kind of design that
we<00:00:27.720> have<00:00:27.900> all<00:00:28.109> over<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.500> place<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:30.679> yes<00:00:31.679> this

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
we have all over the place and yes this

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.549 
we have all over the place and yes this
first<00:00:32.189> totem<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:32.969> just<00:00:33.180> going<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.480> be<00:00:33.559> over

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
first totem is just going to be over

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.680 
first totem is just going to be over
here<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.309> one<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.700> just<00:00:35.820> going<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.329> be<00:00:36.390> very

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
here this one is just going to be very

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.299 
here this one is just going to be very
small<00:00:37.050> one<00:00:37.640> and<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:39.629> think<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.230> also<00:00:40.440> want<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:40.980> add

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
small one and I think I also want to add

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.600 
small one and I think I also want to add
some<00:00:41.700> skulls<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.390> hats<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.620> chose<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
some skulls and hats in it I chose the

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.799 
some skulls and hats in it I chose the
materials<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.210> i<00:00:45.239> think<00:00:45.420> i'm<00:00:46.050> going<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.350> use

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
materials that i think i'm going to use

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.709 
materials that i think i'm going to use
not<00:00:48.809> sure<00:00:49.610> if<00:00:50.610> i'm<00:00:50.940> going<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.180> use<00:00:51.329> them<00:00:51.539> all

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
not sure if i'm going to use them all

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.810 
not sure if i'm going to use them all
and<00:00:51.930> just<00:00:52.440> probably<00:00:52.860> just<00:00:53.250> going<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.489> be<00:00:53.640> a

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
and just probably just going to be a

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.510 
and just probably just going to be a
very<00:00:54.210> short<00:00:54.809> video<00:00:55.260> but<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:55.949> really

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
very short video but this is just really

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.160 
very short video but this is just really
to<00:00:58.370> kind<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.520> get<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.760> feel<00:01:00.329> for<00:01:02.120> possible

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
to kind of get a feel for possible

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.710 
to kind of get a feel for possible
shrines<00:01:04.170> or<00:01:04.710> totems<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.000> could<00:01:06.420> use

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
shrines or totems that I could use

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.440 
shrines or totems that I could use
around<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.830> place<00:01:09.590> I'm<00:01:10.590> thinking<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.490> this

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
around this place I'm thinking of this

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.310 
around this place I'm thinking of this
maybe<00:01:14.030> maybe<00:01:15.030> like<00:01:16.009> like<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.659> then<00:01:19.200> we

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
maybe maybe like like this and then we

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.850 
maybe maybe like like this and then we
could<00:01:19.500> even<00:01:19.740> add<00:01:21.259> like<00:01:22.259> another<00:01:24.500> thing<00:01:25.500> over

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
could even add like another thing over

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.249 
could even add like another thing over
there<00:01:26.210> so<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.240> we<00:01:27.509> could<00:01:27.720> maybe<00:01:27.960> play

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
there so that we could maybe play

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.550 
there so that we could maybe play
someone<00:01:29.060> here<00:01:30.829> some<00:01:31.939> light<00:01:32.939> there<00:01:33.659> may<00:01:34.350> be<00:01:34.380> a

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
someone here some light there may be a

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.510 
someone here some light there may be a
skeleton<00:01:35.250> head<00:01:35.400> there<00:01:36.920> may<00:01:37.920> be<00:01:37.950> one<00:01:38.220> in<00:01:38.430> the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
skeleton head there may be one in the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.120 
skeleton head there may be one in the
back<00:01:38.700> here<00:01:39.030> we'll<00:01:39.420> leave<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.659> empty<00:01:40.259> just<00:01:40.920> so

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
back here we'll leave that empty just so

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.010 
back here we'll leave that empty just so
that<00:01:41.310> not<00:01:41.640> everything<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.960> being<00:01:43.439> used<00:01:45.020> let's

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
that not everything is being used let's

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.740 
that not everything is being used let's
see<00:01:47.149> how<00:01:48.149> this<00:01:48.420> will<00:01:48.659> look<00:01:48.950> when<00:01:49.950> we<00:01:50.159> add<00:01:50.750> or

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
see how this will look when we add or

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.260 
see how this will look when we add or
little<00:01:52.590> design<00:01:53.130> top<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:55.880> think<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.030> think

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
little design top of it I think I think

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.520 
little design top of it I think I think
this<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.540> going<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.020> work<00:01:59.689> maybe<00:02:00.689> if<00:02:01.079> we<00:02:01.140> do<00:02:01.409> it

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
this is going to work maybe if we do it

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.600 
this is going to work maybe if we do it
like<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:02.490> like<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.420> small<00:02:03.869> little<00:02:03.899> version

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
like this like a small little version

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.029 
like this like a small little version
and<00:02:08.270> slaps<00:02:09.270> on<00:02:09.509> top<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.200> yeah<00:02:10.649> well<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:10.890> think

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
and slaps on top of it yeah well I think

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.160 
and slaps on top of it yeah well I think
that<00:02:11.430> looks<00:02:11.760> quite<00:02:12.060> right<00:02:12.390> for<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:13.050> little

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
that looks quite right for a little

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.380 
that looks quite right for a little
shrine<00:02:14.450> oh<00:02:15.650> that<00:02:16.650> that<00:02:17.070> makes<00:02:17.310> this<00:02:17.520> really<00:02:18.180> a

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
shrine oh that that makes this really a

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.050 
shrine oh that that makes this really a
little<00:02:18.810> short<00:02:19.110> video<00:02:19.500> but<00:02:19.890> I<00:02:20.100> just<00:02:20.700> wanted<00:02:21.030> to

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
little short video but I just wanted to

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.390 
little short video but I just wanted to
