Why the World Didn't End Yesterday, presented by Science@NASA

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.640
Dec. 22, 2012: If you're watching this video, it means one thing: 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.320
The World Didn't End Yesterday.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.450
According to media reports of an ancient Maya prophecy, 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.690
the world was supposed to be destroyed on Dec. 21, 2012.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.000
But look around you.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.000
'The whole thing was a misconception from the very beginning,' 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.570
says Dr. John Carlson, director of the Center for Archaeoastronomy.  

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.710
'The Maya calendar did not end on Dec. 21, 2012, 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.170
and there were no Maya prophecies foretelling the end of the world on that date.'

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.270
The truth, he says, is more interesting than fiction.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.970
Carlson is a hard-nosed scientist--

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.690
a radio astronomer who earned his degree studying distant galaxies. 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.950
He became interested in the 2012 phenomenon 35 years ago 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.310
when he attended a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.130
and learned about the Maya.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.300
Where the rain forests of Mesoamerica now stand, 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.570
a great civilization once flourished. 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.330
The people of Maya society built vast cities 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.000
with a population density comparable to modern Los Angeles County. 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.020
They mastered astronomy and developed an elaborate written language. 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.980
Most impressive, to Carlson, 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.150
was their expansive sense of time. 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.290
'The times Mayas used dwarf those currently used by modern astronomers,' he explains.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.850
'According to our science, 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.360
the Big Bang occurred 13.7 billion years ago. 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.790
There are dates in Mayan ruins that stretch back 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.020
a billion billion times farther than that.'

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.630
The Maya Long Count Calendar was designed to keep track of such long intervals. 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.170
'It is the most complex calendar system ever developed.'

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.340
Written using modern typography, 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.540
the Long Count Calendar resembles the odometer in a car. 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.660
Because the digits rotate, 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.750
the calendar can 'roll over' and repeat itself; 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.350
this repetition is key to the 2012 phenomenon.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.360
According to Maya theology, 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.030
the world was created 5125 years ago, 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.170
on a date we would write 'August 11, 3114  BC.' 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.500
At the time, the Maya calendar looked like this: 13.0.0.0.0

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:21.000
On Dec. 21, 2012, it is exactly the same: 13.0.0.0.0

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.530
In the language of Maya scholars, 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.710
'13 Bak'tuns' elapsed between the two dates. 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.350
This was a significant interval in Maya theology, 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.290
but, stresses Carlson, 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.100
not a destructive one. 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.280
None of the thousands of ruins, tablets, 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.890
and standing stones that archeologists have examined 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.960
foretell an end of the world.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.120
Modern science agrees. 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.080
NASA experts recently gathered in a Google hangout to share their findings.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.940
Don Yeomans, head of NASA's Near-Earth Object Program, 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.230
stated that no known asteroids or comets were on a collision course with Earth.  

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.320
Neither is a rogue planet coming to destroy us. 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.380
'If there were anything out there like a planet headed for Earth,' 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.180
said NASA astrobiologist David Morrison, 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.880
'it would already be [one of the] brightest objects in the sky. 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.650
Everybody on Earth could see it. 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.990
You don't need to ask the government, just go out and look. 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.770
It's not there.'

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.260
Lika Guhathakurta, head of NASA's Living With a Star Program, 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.100
said the sun is not a threat, either. 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.510
'The sun has been flaring for billions of years--

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.140
long before the Maya even existed

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.340
--and it has never once destroyed the world.'

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.620
'Right now the sun is approaching the maximum of its 11-year activity cycle,' 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.510
she added, 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.640
'but this is the wimpiest solar cycle of the past 50 years. 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.950
Reports to the contrary are exaggerated.'

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.220
To Carlson, Dec. 21, 2012, is not a day of dread.  

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.790
On the contrary, he says, 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.620
'I have been waiting to experience this day for more than 30 years.'

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.480
For him, 'experiencing Dec. 21, 2012' 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.010
means visiting the Maya homeland in the Yucatan, 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.600
and thinking back to the height of Maya civilization, 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.560
when ancient humans contemplated expanses of time orders of magnitude 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.960
beyond modern horizons.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:02.870
And, of course, 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.540
appreciating the fact that The World Didn't End Yesterday.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.310
