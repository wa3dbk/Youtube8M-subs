has 355 pieces and it only cost about

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.410 
has 355 pieces and it only cost about
thirty<00:00:16.680> dollars<00:00:17.039> when<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:17.279> came<00:00:17.460> out<00:00:17.490> which<00:00:18.270> i

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
thirty dollars when it came out which i

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.570 
thirty dollars when it came out which i
think<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.779> pretty<00:00:18.960> good<00:00:19.140> for<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.470> set<00:00:19.680> because

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
think is pretty good for the set because

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.120 
think is pretty good for the set because
I<00:00:20.760> think<00:00:20.820> this<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.449> really<00:00:21.660> cool<00:00:21.869> set<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:23.010> of

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
I think this is a really cool set and of

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.920 
I think this is a really cool set and of
course<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.519> can<00:00:23.730> build<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.180> in<00:00:24.330> two<00:00:24.660> different

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
course you can build it in two different

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.480 
course you can build it in two different
things<00:00:25.760> first<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.970> do<00:00:27.090> have<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.300> log<00:00:27.720> cabin

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
things first you do have the log cabin

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.189 
things first you do have the log cabin
but<00:00:29.490> you've<00:00:29.640> also<00:00:29.789> got<00:00:30.090> these<00:00:30.330> two<00:00:30.599> down<00:00:30.779> here

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
but you've also got these two down here

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.440 
but you've also got these two down here
that<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.160> have<00:00:32.309> all<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.759> necessary<00:00:32.880> pieces

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
that you have all the necessary pieces

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.040 
that you have all the necessary pieces
to<00:00:33.780> build<00:00:33.890> into<00:00:35.210> and<00:00:36.210> see<00:00:36.450> them<00:00:36.600> better<00:00:36.750> on<00:00:36.960> the

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
to build into and see them better on the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.530 
to build into and see them better on the
back<00:00:37.290> here<00:00:38.329> there's<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.540> one<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:41.360> let's<00:00:42.360> see

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
back here there's the one and let's see

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.520 
back here there's the one and let's see
if<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.780> can<00:00:42.950> adjust<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.190> camera<00:00:44.910> up<00:00:45.260> so<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.350> can

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
if I can adjust the camera up so you can

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.889 
if I can adjust the camera up so you can
see<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.860> other<00:00:46.980> one<00:00:47.450> there's<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.660> other<00:00:48.780> one

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
see the other one there's the other one

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.060 
see the other one there's the other one
there<00:00:49.969> so<00:00:50.969> two<00:00:51.420> other<00:00:51.660> great<00:00:52.320> sets<00:00:52.680> if<00:00:52.949> you

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
there so two other great sets if you

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.490 
there so two other great sets if you
wanted<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.550> build<00:00:54.449> something<00:00:54.570> different<00:00:55.260> I

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
wanted to build something different I

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.849 
wanted to build something different I
personally<00:00:56.340> like<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.579> log<00:00:56.879> cabin<00:00:57.360> um<00:00:57.590> the<00:00:58.590> best

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
personally like a log cabin um the best

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.090 
personally like a log cabin um the best
which<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.340> why<00:00:59.609> that's<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.510> built

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
which is why that's the one that I built

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.270 
which is why that's the one that I built
but<00:01:02.100> that's<00:01:02.789> just<00:01:03.090> my<00:01:03.329> opinion<00:01:04.280> everyone's

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
but that's just my opinion everyone's

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.469 
but that's just my opinion everyone's
entitled<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.820> their<00:01:05.909> own<00:01:06.860> so<00:01:07.860> here<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.270> log

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
entitled to their own so here is the log

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.050 
entitled to their own so here is the log
cabin<00:01:09.810> version<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.560> set<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.670> do<00:01:11.850> get

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
cabin version of the set and you do get

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.260 
cabin version of the set and you do get
one<00:01:12.510> minifigure<00:01:12.960> with<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.560> just<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:15.240> know

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
one minifigure with it and just you know

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.130 
one minifigure with it and just you know
the<00:01:15.479> regular<00:01:16.049> guy<00:01:16.320> here<00:01:17.420> you<00:01:18.420> know<00:01:18.509> no<00:01:18.720> no

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
the regular guy here you know no no

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.859 
the regular guy here you know no no
printing<00:01:19.619> or<00:01:19.770> anything<00:01:20.100> nothing

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869

fantastically special or anything like

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.749 
fantastically special or anything like
that<00:01:23.540> but<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.960> nice<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.320> have<00:01:25.770> basic

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
that but it is nice to have basic

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.670 
that but it is nice to have basic
minifigures<00:01:27.330> sometimes<00:01:27.780> especially<00:01:28.380> if

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
minifigures sometimes especially if

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.850 
minifigures sometimes especially if
we're<00:01:28.920> doing<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:30.060> know<00:01:30.150> stop<00:01:30.479> motion<00:01:31.020> or<00:01:31.259> if

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
we're doing a you know stop motion or if

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.550 
we're doing a you know stop motion or if
you<00:01:32.340> wanted<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.850> create<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.540> custom<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.470> know

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
you wanted to create a custom you know

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.890 
you wanted to create a custom you know
this<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.920> perfect<00:01:35.400> torso<00:01:35.820> perfect<00:01:36.360> legs<00:01:36.570> to

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
this is a perfect torso perfect legs to

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.440 
this is a perfect torso perfect legs to
start<00:01:37.140> with<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:38.159> kind<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.430> thing<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:39.000> so

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
start with that kind of thing and so

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.539 
start with that kind of thing and so
it's<00:01:39.810> kind<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.110> useful<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.650> have<00:01:40.799> many<00:01:41.369> figures

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
it's kind of useful to have many figures

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.440 
it's kind of useful to have many figures
like<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.380> but<00:01:43.380> anyway<00:01:44.100> let's<00:01:45.030> look<00:01:45.180> at<00:01:45.329> the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
like this but anyway let's look at the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.410 
like this but anyway let's look at the
set<00:01:46.310> or<00:01:47.310> should<00:01:47.520> we<00:01:47.579> have<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.759> little<00:01:48.060> canoe

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
set or should we have a little canoe

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.990 
set or should we have a little canoe
over<00:01:48.840> here<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.100> little<00:01:50.579> paddle

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
over here you have the little paddle

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.100 
over here you have the little paddle
there<00:01:52.729> and<00:01:53.729> there's<00:01:54.180> none<00:01:54.390> at<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.570> bottom<00:01:54.960> of

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
there and there's none at the bottom of

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.260 
there and there's none at the bottom of
it<00:01:58.070> I'll<00:01:59.070> just<00:01:59.250> kind<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.460> set<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.850> over<00:02:00.030> to

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
it I'll just kind of set that over to

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.260 
it I'll just kind of set that over to
the<00:02:00.360> side<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.810> little<00:02:00.840> bit<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:02.210> here's<00:02:03.210> a

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
the side a little bit and here's a

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.959 
the side a little bit and here's a
little<00:02:03.299> tree<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.710> can<00:02:04.890> see<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.340> just<00:02:05.700> kind<00:02:05.909> of

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
little tree you can see it just kind of

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.730 
little tree you can see it just kind of
sits<00:02:06.240> next<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.780> this<00:02:06.899> it's<00:02:07.170> not<00:02:07.350> actually

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
sits next to this it's not actually

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.730 
sits next to this it's not actually
connected<00:02:09.830> push<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.009> top<00:02:11.220> with

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
connected push the top with

believes the thing I like about creator
sets<00:02:16.240> is<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:17.290> fact<00:02:17.470> that<00:02:17.530> you<00:02:17.740> get<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:17.920> lot<00:02:18.220> of

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
sets is the fact that you get a lot of

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.930 
sets is the fact that you get a lot of
useful<00:02:18.550> pieces<00:02:19.000> that<00:02:19.420> you<00:02:19.450> could<00:02:19.750> use<00:02:19.980> in<00:02:20.980> you

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
useful pieces that you could use in you

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.050 
useful pieces that you could use in you
know<00:02:22.030> mocks<00:02:22.420> or<00:02:22.900> same<00:02:23.650> building<00:02:24.220> for<00:02:24.400> brick

reason<00:02:27.460> why<00:02:27.640> I<00:02:27.760> get<00:02:28.090> creator<00:02:28.510> sets<00:02:28.870> I<00:02:29.670> didn't

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
reason why I get creator sets I didn't

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.880 
reason why I get creator sets I didn't
used<00:02:30.880> to<00:02:31.000> but<00:02:31.600> the<00:02:31.750> more<00:02:31.930> I<00:02:31.960> get<00:02:32.200> into<00:02:32.350> stop

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
used to but the more I get into stop

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.890 
used to but the more I get into stop
motion<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:33.520> customs<00:02:34.240> and<00:02:34.450> things<00:02:34.690> like<00:02:34.840> that

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
motion and customs and things like that

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.870 
motion and customs and things like that
the<00:02:35.710> more<00:02:35.950> I've<00:02:36.100> gotten<00:02:36.400> into<00:02:36.550> buying

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
the more I've gotten into buying

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.520 
the more I've gotten into buying
readerships<00:02:38.880> so<00:02:39.880> let's<00:02:40.360> look<00:02:40.540> at<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.350> log

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
readerships so let's look at the log

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.310 
readerships so let's look at the log
cabin<00:02:41.560> itself<00:02:42.330> first<00:02:43.330> you've<00:02:43.540> got<00:02:43.720> um<00:02:43.930> you

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
cabin itself first you've got um you

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.340 
cabin itself first you've got um you
know<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.680> space<00:02:45.340> plates<00:02:45.730> here<00:02:46.000> but<00:02:46.900> actually

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
know the space plates here but actually

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.340 
know the space plates here but actually
it's<00:02:48.130> a<00:02:48.340> square<00:02:48.790> that<00:02:49.060> stops<00:02:49.330> here<00:02:49.870> means

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
it's a square that stops here means

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.920 
it's a square that stops here means
either<00:02:50.530> line<00:02:50.890> there<00:02:51.220> so<00:02:52.210> from<00:02:52.480> there<00:02:52.660> to<00:02:52.780> there

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
either line there so from there to there

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.340 
either line there so from there to there
is<00:02:53.200> one<00:02:53.620> and<00:02:54.460> then<00:02:55.060> you've<00:02:55.180> got<00:02:55.360> up<00:02:55.570> this<00:02:55.900> long

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
is one and then you've got up this long

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.250 
is one and then you've got up this long
strip<00:02:56.860> one<00:02:57.160> here<00:02:57.580> the<00:02:57.940> green<00:02:58.270> then<00:02:58.960> you've<00:02:59.110> got

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
strip one here the green then you've got

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.140 
strip one here the green then you've got
the<00:02:59.380> blue<00:02:59.590> one<00:02:59.800> here<00:02:59.830> for<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.400> water<00:03:00.640> over<00:03:00.760> on

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
the blue one here for the water over on

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.560 
the blue one here for the water over on
the<00:03:01.270> side<00:03:01.480> there<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:03.310> can<00:03:03.570> completely

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
the side there and you can completely

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.780 
the side there and you can completely
lifts<00:03:04.960> the<00:03:05.080> roof<00:03:05.290> off<00:03:05.560> of<00:03:05.590> this<00:03:05.770> set<00:03:06.160> I<00:03:06.400> don't

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
lifts the roof off of this set I don't

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.550 
lifts the roof off of this set I don't
tear<00:03:07.000> it<00:03:07.090> up<00:03:08.400> pretty<00:03:09.400> easily<00:03:09.840> actually<00:03:10.840> to

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
tear it up pretty easily actually to

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.670 
tear it up pretty easily actually to
lift<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.280> roof<00:03:12.490> off<00:03:12.670> and<00:03:13.230> that's<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.320> end<00:03:14.530> of

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
lift the roof off and that's the end of

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.810 
lift the roof off and that's the end of
it<00:03:14.770> there<00:03:16.590> you<00:03:17.590> get<00:03:17.680> a<00:03:17.740> little<00:03:17.920> chimney<00:03:18.370> on<00:03:18.640> the

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
it there you get a little chimney on the

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.590 
it there you get a little chimney on the
top<00:03:19.230> and<00:03:20.760> this<00:03:21.760> right<00:03:21.940> here<00:03:21.970> has<00:03:22.300> a<00:03:22.330> lot<00:03:22.570> of

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
top and this right here has a lot of

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.510 
top and this right here has a lot of
useful<00:03:22.900> pieces<00:03:23.320> just<00:03:23.620> in<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.040> roof<00:03:25.410> you<00:03:26.410> know

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
useful pieces just in the roof you know

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.400 
useful pieces just in the roof you know
you<00:03:27.520> could<00:03:27.730> use<00:03:27.940> that<00:03:28.450> to<00:03:28.630> make<00:03:28.750> a<00:03:28.810> roof<00:03:29.380> for

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
you could use that to make a roof for

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.930 
you could use that to make a roof for
something<00:03:29.920> else<00:03:30.040> you<00:03:30.610> don't<00:03:30.760> have<00:03:30.850> to

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
something else you don't have to

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.840 
something else you don't have to
necessarily<00:03:31.090> make<00:03:31.630> it<00:03:31.660> just<00:03:32.320> like<00:03:32.500> that<00:03:32.850> but

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
necessarily make it just like that but

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.620 
necessarily make it just like that but
it<00:03:34.510> I<00:03:34.870> think<00:03:35.200> it's<00:03:35.350> pretty<00:03:35.770> useful<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:37.510> have

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
it I think it's pretty useful to have

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.840 
it I think it's pretty useful to have
all<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:37.900> pieces<00:03:38.080> like<00:03:38.410> this<00:03:38.590> got<00:03:39.460> the<00:03:39.580> door

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
all the pieces like this got the door

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.880 
all the pieces like this got the door
that<00:03:40.030> opens<00:03:40.360> right<00:03:40.540> there<00:03:40.780> I'm<00:03:41.350> kind<00:03:41.590> of<00:03:41.650> zoom

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
that opens right there I'm kind of zoom

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.250 
that opens right there I'm kind of zoom
in<00:03:42.070> so<00:03:42.310> you<00:03:42.370> can<00:03:42.550> see<00:03:42.790> more<00:03:43.060> what<00:03:43.810> I'm<00:03:43.900> talking

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
in so you can see more what I'm talking

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.780 
in so you can see more what I'm talking
about<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:46.150> you<00:03:46.600> can<00:03:46.630> cook<00:03:46.990> the<00:03:47.890> chicken<00:03:48.400> right

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
about and you can cook the chicken right

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.600 
about and you can cook the chicken right
there<00:03:48.850> over<00:03:49.810> the<00:03:49.930> open<00:03:50.260> fire<00:03:50.560> and<00:03:51.370> you've<00:03:51.490> got

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
there over the open fire and you've got

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.300 
there over the open fire and you've got
a<00:03:51.670> couple<00:03:51.910> of<00:03:52.180> uh<00:03:52.210> I<00:03:52.600> guess<00:03:53.200> schools<00:03:53.830> to<00:03:54.040> sit<00:03:54.280> on

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
a couple of uh I guess schools to sit on

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.020 
a couple of uh I guess schools to sit on
outside<00:03:55.800> you've<00:03:56.800> got<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.100> log<00:03:57.280> cabin<00:03:57.670> which

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
outside you've got the log cabin which

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.010 
outside you've got the log cabin which
is<00:03:58.180> why<00:03:58.530> you<00:03:59.530> know<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.860> the<00:04:00.430> sides<00:04:00.670> don't<00:04:01.020> meet

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 
is why you know the the sides don't meet

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.200 
is why you know the the sides don't meet
right<00:04:02.470> at<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:02.770> corner<00:04:03.070> you<00:04:03.760> know<00:04:03.850> that's<00:04:04.060> how

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.210 
right at the corner you know that's how

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.360 
right at the corner you know that's how
you<00:04:04.300> expect<00:04:04.810> a<00:04:04.900> log<00:04:05.080> cabin<00:04:05.530> to<00:04:05.740> to<00:04:06.010> be<00:04:06.130> built

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
you expect a log cabin to to be built

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.960 
you expect a log cabin to to be built
you<00:04:07.120> know<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:08.650> logs<00:04:08.920> stacked<00:04:09.340> up<00:04:09.580> like<00:04:09.610> that

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
you know the logs stacked up like that

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.949 
you know the logs stacked up like that
and<00:04:10.270> see<00:04:10.990> the<00:04:11.110> side<00:04:11.380> there<00:04:11.740> and<00:04:12.600> on<00:04:13.600> the<00:04:13.750> back

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
and see the side there and on the back

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:19.099 
and see the side there and on the back
here<00:04:15.630> back<00:04:16.630> actually<00:04:17.410> opens

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
here back actually opens

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.610 
here back actually opens
and<00:04:20.099> you<00:04:20.489> have<00:04:20.609> a<00:04:20.849> little<00:04:21.209> handle<00:04:21.599> here<00:04:21.629> or<00:04:22.109> if

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
and you have a little handle here or if

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.020 
and you have a little handle here or if
you<00:04:22.710> already<00:04:22.889> have<00:04:23.189> the<00:04:23.219> roof<00:04:23.430> off<00:04:23.639> you<00:04:23.849> can

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030
