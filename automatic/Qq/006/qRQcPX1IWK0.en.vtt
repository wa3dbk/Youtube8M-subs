00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.750
 while competitors launched their 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:17.720
 top of the line appliances 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.240
 sony is in her line that she had until 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.330
 she decided to release the sony xperia cq e 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.939
 Look at the peace the Japanese do not play in 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.800
 service not in the sony xperia i know already 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.679
 arrives as one of the smartest 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.329
 of the market so far 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:35.329
 you can already see the neat finish 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.550
 of the apparatus the edges are of fiber of 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.860
 glass polyamide to bring is 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.110
 textured and the buttons are aluminum 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.180
 It's not a small cell phone. 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.430
 if you have good ones you will need 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.680
 use both hands but it's not my case 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.410
 up here we have the headphone jack 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.199
 ear on the left of the micro connector 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.590
 usb on the right we have the volume buttons 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.989
 and one for connecting the camera and off 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.969
 indeed the position of this button is quite 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.790
 comfortable lots for cards 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.870
 micro-sim in micro usb are protected 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.420
 by a cap 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.190
 since the back cover does not open the size is 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.480
 justified with the 5-inch screen 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.160
 full hd 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.230
 He is the first to arrive in Brazil with 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.790
 this full hd screen is this there was the 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.110
 right this sony phone has 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.030
 resolution of a tv 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.160
 the display still has the technology of the 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.290
 to improve the quality of 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.050
 still it is scratch resistant 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.600
 but does not use the famous gorilla glass 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.210
 with this resolution viewing photos and movies is 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.520
 Appeal images look great 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.770
 by then it still has good sensitivity and good 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.110
 the virtual keyboard has keys 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.480
 great and android buttons make 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.670
 part of the screen but disappear when we are 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.260
 I watch a video for example and it's not just 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.540
 his screen that is top 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:52.580
 equipped with the quad-core processor 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.540
 1.5 gigahertz gpu adreno 322 gb 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.880
 RAM memory 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.250
 Osieck runs over competitors in 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.220
 benchmarks he hit the best grades 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.730
 from our lab until today at mtur 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:09.170
 he reached 18 1,692 points 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:12.830
 in the 8056 quadrant in cinemark 1 and 2 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.700
 it reached 59.8 frames per second is a 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.879
 monster 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.140
 we prove these results in practice 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.280
 open and close various applications 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.020
 All right. 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.990
 the motto we leave several applications 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.690
 open at the same time and we do not notice a 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:36.620
 chopped matches in all games 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:39.520
 the simplest as you lift it up 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.520
 Why do you pick Jorge? 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.950
 time flies two 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.470
 and we got the real racing 3 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.600
 They all ran smoothly. 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.950
 only with devices that went quite 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.960
 android 4.1.2 was customized 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.550
 no more playstation face 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.160
 other sony 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.350
 the interface is more pleasant and still 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.020
 has interesting features 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.390
 the multitasking button in addition to showing the 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.510
 open applications access programs 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.470
 simple as notepad calculator 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.690
 and recorder 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.870
 the device also has google nal 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.520
 we already know that in android 4.1.2 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.620
 You can not install applications on 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.200
 memory card so the sony xperia 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.570
 z that I saw with 16 gb of storage 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.240
 and you can install a 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.430
 card up to 64 gigabytes to your 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:30.460
 files in the connection is everything 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:32.980
 there 4g will fai bluetooth 4.0 dl n the gps and 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.130
 nfc gps has an american system 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:39.880
 and with Russian global and works very well 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:42.280
 micro usb output has mhl technology with 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.960
 adapter to connect the unit to the 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.810
 monitor via hdmi 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.030
 but the adapter does not come together and to 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.910
 enjoy the big screen and full HD output 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.100
 hl it plays many media files 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.020
 for who likes fm radio 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.360
 the feature is present the speaker 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.030
 it is no longer as powerful as the screen 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.450
 when the sun is too high and wait for a 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.450
 little 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.210
 the device has a sensor 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.639
 infrared and works as a 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.580
 remote control can control tv 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:24.710
 the dvd and blu ray from home or else take out 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:32.360
 win the others nothing but who decides 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:35.960
 use team turned off the old tv 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:39.349
 sony also caprichou in the camera she 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:42.169
 takes photos with up to 13 megapixels and thanks 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:45.229
 to the sensor the photos look good even 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:49.389
 in dark places also makes full videos 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:49.389
 hd and got a bomb 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.800
 you can adjust the exposure balance of 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.820
 I izzo white 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.520
 she has an image stabilizer 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:03.590
 hdr recognizes smiles makes photos 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.440
 panoramic and sequential 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:09.349
 the flash helps in low light conditions. 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.610
 Front camera takes 2 megapixel photos 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:12.650
 and full HD videos 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.409
 the detail is the location of the camera 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.360
 down here is strange because 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:19.729
 we're used to looking up here 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.110
 and care must be taken not to 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:22.789
 hand in front of lens 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:27.710
 since his battery is the big problem 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:28.699
 despite having 2,370 milan perez much more 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.190
 than the average 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:32.479
 the device could not stand the whole day in the 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.969
 our pattern 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:37.550
 we take the appliance out of the socket at 10 and 40 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:39.080
 in the morning and at six in the afternoon he had only 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.820
 10 percent load 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.639
 let's re-think the test the next day 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.380
 We had similar result that is has 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:47.360
 a loader always close by 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.789
 the Sony offers some ways to 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.020
 energy savings that help but do not 

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:53.210
 they are miracles 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.979
 also with this full hd screen and there 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:59.180
 There's going to be a lot of energy going around. 

00:06:54.979 --> 00:07:02.180
 even sony made beautiful that xperia c 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:04.370
 that it is the most up-to-date 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.090
 that has passed through here and is not 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.610
 toa 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:11.330
 besides the high performance it counts on the 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:13.940
 full hd screen 4g interface support 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:16.190
 nice and sleek design but warm 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:19.039
 enough with heavy applications 

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:21.159
 the position of the front camera bothers 

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:23.729
 even though it has a large capacity 

00:07:21.159 --> 00:07:25.469
 did not last all day but 

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:27.389
 information on the sony xperia be that 

00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:29.789
 you can find the link here in the description 

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:31.529
 of the video and to stay inside what the 

00:07:29.789 --> 00:07:34.020
 people are doing sign up for our 

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:36.499

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.499

 thanks
