 rice mold empty the mixture and 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.130
 hit to get the air that could 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.160
 have been baking at 180 degrees 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.650

 look nothing else as we have the cake 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.900
 As I was saying, look at that super high 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.940
 fluffy is a winning recipe is 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.080
 very good here we already have the bitumen what 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.200
 what are we going to do is we're going to put 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.430
 on the top by the sides 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.680
 Obviously, this is very artisanal, 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.300
 It has to be like pastry 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.070
 but this taste does not taste good 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.659
 What we do is we're going 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.700
 putting the center and then we're going to 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.190
 go down it just to give it a 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.750
 go along the banks and let's go what 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.630
 like doing like this and this is giving 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.479
 like a little touch more or less decorated 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.580
 they are going to see and obviously there are also 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.690
 let the cake cool down before 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.510
 put the beto because if not the 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.640
 butter we would sink them and good 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.070
 it is a torture literally for a 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.230
 birthday boy that the whole house already smells like 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.630
 cake is delicious all aromas 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.910
 how are we going to be holding on 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.280
 waiting until it cools to 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.470
 can we not eat and to put power 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.880
 put it on the knit the joke is that 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.250
 we remain as one or more plans or 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.940
 less rustic in this I say not very 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.890
 very decorated but covered in our 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.280
 our bitumen is practically not already 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.500
 it was covered 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.870
 let's give it one more ball 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.470
 more to give it a little more touch 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.470
 decorated 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.530
 we have ready nothing more than tasty 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.640
 we're done, the cake is ready 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.080

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.380
