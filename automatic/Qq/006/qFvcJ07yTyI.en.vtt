00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:10.880
 It is a method of using the iliopsomus well or being immersed in the iliopsomus but of course standing or walking 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:16.940
 I want to be able to use even when was it first, 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:18.030
 Since it is easy to turn on the switch if it is used in a state of four, it is introduced from that method 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:23.580
 I will 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:29.610
 First of all, I say that I get into a quarrel and turn the pelvis forward . 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:32.550
 Make the pelvis look forward, bend the hip joint and tighten the head firmly 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:37.620
 I will make an image at that time butt will turn up 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.050
 At that time I would like to be careful not at the waist but by the sol image 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.420
 Inguinal diameter 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:48.469
 Is it designed to float a minute left 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:55.909
 Yes you have the consciousness, such as to hold firmly the part that towards the consciousness in that part 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:57.050
 Lift the part and bend it there and your butt will float up Yes take your body away 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:58.700
 Please give me 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:04.180
 So first of all 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:07.660
 Practice to bend it from the natural state 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:11.870
 It's the groin area, so if it's good to bend it 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:18.620
 I will bend my back and pull my ass back 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:21.360
 Yes the point of caution at that time is to keep the state that the buttocks are facing up 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:27.200
 Yes back 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.200
 Yes keep your butt up 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:38.100
 Well then let's do this little bad example 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.100
 The butt will turn down when you play in the castle you think the butt is 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:46.600
 It is not good and I like this Yari person 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.600
 8 Return to the original position once again 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.580
 Yes 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:59.380
 As the tissue does not fall, the hip joint bends first and this tissue is 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:07.409
 Go and pull back so that it does not fall mer 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:08.649
 Within a range that does not fall down 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.590
 Yes 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.590
 Now back then , please try to play round ass 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:24.140
 Please be careful as this does not work well for the iliopsoas with this usage 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:29.680
 Yes this time again 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.680
 Thank you for telling me different ways
