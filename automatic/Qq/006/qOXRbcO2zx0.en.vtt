00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.870
 Hello everyone, Dmitry, and today I 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.240
 tell you about the legendary shield drone 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.760
 whose original bee is called 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.800
 better not read wikipedia descriptions 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.470
 more difficult personally I regretted it 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.169
 There are two ways to calculate this. 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.480
 available respectively without a girl and 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.120
 easy on affordable way 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.730
 get better in the heart of the desert cemetery 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.780
 kill hunter help you start a for 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.409
 easy to forest to kill the ancient or 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.309
 ancient 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:50.680
 In general, the start of the stress itself I advise you 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.559
 choose an option without control of the cross i 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:57.129
 as chance drop him drone 3 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.780
 percent well did you understand the number up situation 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.540
 complicates something else that you should not 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.909
 perform the last story mission then 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.610
 have kill wars and accrued here hands 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:09.760
 no special effect on the bill at all 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.620
 says fly like grandma it's all ours 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.659
 localizers through one place because 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.030
 what's not along the way about mohammed ali and 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.729
 not heard and because it is correct 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.229
 translated porhay as a butterfly in general 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.979
 due to this effect 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:27.460
 the shield has an extremely modest loan considering 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:30.100
 but a very high recharge rate but 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.390
 long recharge delay time 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.700
 but a very large increase in damage with 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.500
 one little correction 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:44.049
 Bacha 1.2.0 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.049
 reduced damage gain by about 10 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:50.380
 thousand increased recharge delay on 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:53.420
 two seconds or more and reduced speed 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.420
 recharging approximately 7 business 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.640
 Generally, if you follow all the rules 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.520
 move like a ninja go shield always 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.979
 charged one hundred percent you'll 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.280
 receive tremendous damage to bring down the raid 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.979
 bosses for 1 2 but if you run like 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:17.120
 dog behind the fire truck all tank 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:20.360
 then you will only die exactly on 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.030
 this I say goodbye to you do not forget 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.890

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.069

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.940
 did then give the channel to friends all 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.940
