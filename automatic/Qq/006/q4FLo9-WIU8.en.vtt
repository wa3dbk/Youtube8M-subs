you about how long before the effects of
apple<00:00:08.700> cider<00:00:08.849> vinegar<00:00:09.030> are<00:00:09.630> shown<00:00:10.070> this<00:00:11.070> is

apple cider vinegar are shown this is
kind<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.700> broad<00:00:12.000> question<00:00:12.030> it<00:00:12.690> really

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
kind of a broad question it really

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.570 
kind of a broad question it really
depends<00:00:13.349> on<00:00:13.440> what<00:00:13.620> type<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:13.889> effect<00:00:14.309> you're

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
depends on what type of effect you're

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.289 
depends on what type of effect you're
talking<00:00:15.000> about

for<00:00:15.929> example<00:00:16.350> apple<00:00:16.680> cider<00:00:16.800> vinegar<00:00:16.949> does

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
for example apple cider vinegar does

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.090 
for example apple cider vinegar does
tend<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.640> be<00:00:17.760> very<00:00:17.970> tart<00:00:18.420> so<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.470> effect<00:00:19.920> of

one of the studies that showed a modest

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.069 
one of the studies that showed a modest
effect<00:00:38.070> took<00:00:38.760> four<00:00:39.120> weeks<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.690> there<00:00:39.930> was

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
effect took four weeks and there was

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.650 
effect took four weeks and there was
only<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.440> two<00:00:40.649> pound<00:00:41.190> weight<00:00:41.730> loss<00:00:41.760> at<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.450> end

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
only a two pound weight loss at the end

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.690 
only a two pound weight loss at the end
of<00:00:42.899> those<00:00:43.020> four<00:00:43.379> weeks<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:44.190> again<00:00:44.520> that's

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
of those four weeks so again that's

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.150 
of those four weeks so again that's
that's<00:00:45.059> one<00:00:45.360> study<00:00:45.750> it's<00:00:46.680> about<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.980> only

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
that's one study it's about the only

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.090 
that's one study it's about the only
study<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.460> shown<00:00:47.910> very<00:00:48.450> very<00:00:49.200> much<00:00:49.469> effect

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
study that shown very very much effect

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.920 
study that shown very very much effect
for<00:00:50.730> weight<00:00:50.940> loss<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.239> particular<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.750> again

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
for weight loss in particular and again

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.619 
for weight loss in particular and again
it<00:00:52.020> was<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.170> very<00:00:52.230> modest<00:00:52.920> effect<00:00:53.370> as<00:00:53.640> far<00:00:54.120> as

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
it was a very modest effect as far as

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.720 
it was a very modest effect as far as
diabetes<00:00:55.620> goes<00:00:55.860> there's<00:00:56.129> actually<00:00:56.489> more

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
diabetes goes there's actually more

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.029 
diabetes goes there's actually more
research<00:00:57.210> being<00:00:57.480> done<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:58.140> area<00:00:58.770> and

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
research being done in that area and

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.040 
research being done in that area and
that's<00:00:59.609> something<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.180> did<00:01:00.359> show<00:01:00.570> more<00:01:00.930> of

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
that's something that did show more of

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.869 
that's something that did show more of
an<00:01:01.170> immediate<00:01:01.590> effect<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:02.039> some<00:01:02.250> people<00:01:02.699> in

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
an immediate effect in some people in

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.600 
an immediate effect in some people in
some<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.930> studies<00:01:04.350> typically<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.400> dose

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
some of the studies typically the dose

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.730 
some of the studies typically the dose
that<00:01:05.880> was<00:01:06.060> used<00:01:06.390> was<00:01:06.689> two<00:01:06.990> tablespoons

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
that was used was two tablespoons

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.550 
that was used was two tablespoons
immediately<00:01:08.610> before<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:09.060> meal<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:10.350> these

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
immediately before a meal and in these

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.190 
immediately before a meal and in these
people<00:01:10.979> they<00:01:11.130> did<00:01:11.280> see<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.850> reduction<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.960> their

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
people they did see a reduction in their

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.710 
people they did see a reduction in their
blood<00:01:13.590> glucose<00:01:13.979> values<00:01:14.549> after<00:01:14.850> their<00:01:15.330> meal<00:01:15.509> as

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
blood glucose values after their meal as

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.690 
blood glucose values after their meal as
compared<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.979> days<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.189> they<00:01:17.520> ate<00:01:17.670> a

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
compared to the days that they ate a

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.149 
compared to the days that they ate a
similar<00:01:18.180> meal<00:01:18.450> without<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.259> vinegar<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:19.950> that

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
similar meal without the vinegar so that

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.429 
similar meal without the vinegar so that
was<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.400> fairly<00:01:20.820> immediate<00:01:21.180> reaction<00:01:22.140> just

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
was a fairly immediate reaction just

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.140 
was a fairly immediate reaction just
however<00:01:22.890> long<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.310> took<00:01:23.460> them<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.729> actually

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
however long it took them to actually

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.940 
however long it took them to actually
eat<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.509> their<00:01:24.930> particular<00:01:25.170> meal<00:01:25.470> they

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
eat the their particular meal they

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.560 
eat the their particular meal they
waited<00:01:26.280> two<00:01:26.430> hours<00:01:26.460> after<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.330> then<00:01:27.450> they

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
waited two hours after and then they

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.929 
waited two hours after and then they
tested<00:01:28.020> their<00:01:28.170> blue<00:01:28.320> blood<00:01:28.770> glucose<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.340> it

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
tested their blue blood glucose and it

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.120 
tested their blue blood glucose and it
was<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.090> few<00:01:30.360> points<00:01:30.930> lower<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.470> believe<00:01:31.950> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
was a few points lower I believe the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.210 
was a few points lower I believe the
drop<00:01:32.400> was<00:01:32.670> between<00:01:32.970> 4<00:01:33.450> &amp;<00:01:33.750> 6<00:01:33.810> percent<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
drop was between 4 &amp; 6 percent in the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.399 
drop was between 4 &amp; 6 percent in the
groups<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.610> have<00:01:35.880> been<00:01:35.909> studied<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:37.079> for

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
groups that have been studied so for

groups that have been studied so for
diabetes<00:01:38.030> glucose<00:01:39.030> in<00:01:39.329> some<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.750> the
