00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.540
 hello to all here today in 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.090
 the soul not too line 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.640
 on a clio 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:20.710
 rs 4 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:25.920
 the 1014 because the tear not too line with 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:28.720
 driver card and plotter gps and gsm 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:33.550
 so here I am going to simulate a 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:39.540
 break-in there is the key and we will have 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.540
 a message on the dedicated mobile phone 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.630
 so giving an alert and the position 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.730
 of the vehicle 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:01:09.160
 so here I am going to simulate a 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:01:12.280
 tampering with the key with the guys 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.670
 also limiting and we should 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.670
 to have 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:26.850
 see a message on the phone if we 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:28.130
 said there is a small problem with the 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.880
 car 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.840
 here 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.969
 available for all types of vehicles 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.750
 so with this system 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:43.750
 the vehicle can also call you 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:48.189
 so that we can listen to alain therrien 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:50.679
 and know what's going on it's also a 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.250
 model car jacking so with drivers 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:53.229
 card 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:58.110
 these two little cards that allow 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:00.819
 of how to say to activate the tear if 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.220
 it is not near the vehicle 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:06.610
 so where there is a small little box 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.220
 the hot little line because we did 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.370
 a trigger sets a start system 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.430
 and stop a game but the vehicle off 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.430
 road 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.819
 LED flash which makes me 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.630
 corresponds to the search for drivers 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.250
 frame if there is a car jacking so a 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:32.410
 person taking quarters and 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:34.620
 walks away with the tear will go off 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.780
 the age 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.700
 I gave the cards I simulated a 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.950
 break-in as if someone wanted 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.700
 take the vehicle 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.940
 the vehicle and start the iott lectin 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.680
 we can not find the drivers card and it 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.700
 is going to be a trigger of alarmed 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.549
 with a shutdown of the engine at the next 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.540
 start-up 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:03.340
 So here it is to convey it under alert 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.420
 is going to see it even with the keys we can 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.550
 not stop when it is absolutely necessary 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:11.890
 than the drivers card 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:17.160
 be close to the vehicle here I have 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:20.160
 recovered the drivers card the blade was 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.160
 disabled
