00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.230 

okay<00:00:01.740> in<00:00:01.860> the<00:00:01.979> previous<00:00:02.370> three<00:00:02.580> tutorials<00:00:02.790> we

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
okay in the previous three tutorials we

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.090 
okay in the previous three tutorials we
looked<00:00:03.449> at<00:00:03.600> the<00:00:03.750> basic<00:00:03.899> setup<00:00:04.350> of<00:00:04.560> soft<00:00:04.859> body

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
looked at the basic setup of soft body

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.940 
looked at the basic setup of soft body
physics<00:00:05.640> and<00:00:06.620> working<00:00:07.620> with<00:00:07.770> these

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
physics and working with these

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.640 
physics and working with these
stretching<00:00:08.610> and<00:00:08.760> compression<00:00:09.389> settings<00:00:10.230> here

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
stretching and compression settings here

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.610 
stretching and compression settings here
and<00:00:11.179> then<00:00:12.179> one<00:00:12.929> of<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.110> other<00:00:13.290> things<00:00:13.500> we're

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
and then one of the other things we're

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.490 
and then one of the other things we're
going<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.860> do<00:00:13.950> is<00:00:14.099> we're<00:00:14.280> gonna<00:00:14.370> look<00:00:14.809> at<00:00:15.809> maybe

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
going to do is we're gonna look at maybe

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.410 
going to do is we're gonna look at maybe
running<00:00:16.949> this<00:00:17.250> maybe<00:00:17.520> make<00:00:17.730> this<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.940> vehicle

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
running this maybe make this a vehicle

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.450 
running this maybe make this a vehicle
we're<00:00:18.600> gonna<00:00:18.690> run<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.020> into<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.260> wall<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.859> crash

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
we're gonna run it into a wall and crash

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.910 
we're gonna run it into a wall and crash
it<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:21.210> know<00:00:21.330> if<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.869> was<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.109> rigid<00:00:22.500> body<00:00:22.680> we

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
it you know if this was a rigid body we

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.650 
it you know if this was a rigid body we
just<00:00:23.130> kind<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.400> bounce<00:00:23.670> off<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.180> go<00:00:24.269> bouncing

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
just kind of bounce off and go bouncing

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.689 
just kind of bounce off and go bouncing
everywhere<00:00:24.750> but<00:00:25.289> in<00:00:25.529> real<00:00:25.920> soft<00:00:26.130> body<00:00:26.310> physics

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
everywhere but in real soft body physics

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.640 
everywhere but in real soft body physics
this<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:26.939> gonna<00:00:27.060> kind<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.570> crunch<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.080> dent<00:00:28.410> in

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
this is gonna kind of crunch and dent in

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.189 
this is gonna kind of crunch and dent in
the<00:00:28.800> whole<00:00:28.920> nine<00:00:29.099> yards<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:29.810> I'll<00:00:30.810> go<00:00:30.929> into

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
the whole nine yards so I'll go into

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.080 
the whole nine yards so I'll go into
edit<00:00:31.560> mode<00:00:31.590> I'm<00:00:31.890> here's<00:00:32.130> my<00:00:32.309> basic<00:00:32.700> shape<00:00:32.940> that

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
edit mode I'm here's my basic shape that

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.690 
edit mode I'm here's my basic shape that
I<00:00:33.180> kind<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.450> just<00:00:33.630> built<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.110> advance<00:00:34.700> like

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
I kind of just built in advance like

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.650 
I kind of just built in advance like
this<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.300> I'll<00:00:37.170> go<00:00:37.350> into<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.620> vertex<00:00:38.010> group

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
this and I'll go into the vertex group

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.900 
this and I'll go into the vertex group
and<00:00:39.660> I'll<00:00:39.930> give<00:00:40.620> everything<00:00:41.010> instead<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.460> all

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
and I'll give everything instead of all

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.310 
and I'll give everything instead of all
right<00:00:42.149> well<00:00:42.420> let's<00:00:42.629> make<00:00:42.840> sure<00:00:42.899> they're<00:00:43.200> all

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
right well let's make sure they're all

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.410 
right well let's make sure they're all
set<00:00:43.590> at<00:00:43.710> zero<00:00:44.040> here<00:00:44.340> zero<00:00:44.370> here<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:44.910> I'll<00:00:45.120> sign

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
set at zero here zero here so I'll sign

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.940 
set at zero here zero here so I'll sign
it<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:45.750> know<00:00:45.870> they're<00:00:46.140> all<00:00:46.289> at<00:00:46.440> zero<00:00:46.739> right

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
it so I know they're all at zero right

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.279 
it so I know they're all at zero right
now<00:00:47.010> all<00:00:47.730> right<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:47.879> then<00:00:48.329> I'll<00:00:48.840> go<00:00:48.960> look<00:00:49.079> at<00:00:49.260> it

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
now all right so then I'll go look at it

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.180 
now all right so then I'll go look at it
in<00:00:50.000> ortho<00:00:51.000> mode<00:00:51.530> here<00:00:52.530> but<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.770> don't<00:00:52.949> want<00:00:53.100> them

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
in ortho mode here but I don't want them

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.850 
in ortho mode here but I don't want them
all<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.399> be<00:00:53.579> zero<00:00:54.000> maybe<00:00:54.270> right<00:00:54.690> at<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.050> maybe

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
all to be zero maybe right at the maybe

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.020 
all to be zero maybe right at the maybe
near<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.610> front<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.300> want<00:00:57.690> them<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.870> be<00:00:58.050> zero

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
near the front I want them to be zero

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.720 
near the front I want them to be zero
better<00:01:00.030> get<00:01:00.180> rid<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.480> see<00:01:00.960> all<00:01:01.800> right<00:01:01.949> and

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
better get rid of that see all right and

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.719 
better get rid of that see all right and
I'll<00:01:02.820> just<00:01:03.030> get<00:01:03.210> these<00:01:03.449> up<00:01:03.750> here<00:01:04.489> I'll<00:01:05.489> make

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
I'll just get these up here I'll make

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.480 
I'll just get these up here I'll make
sure<00:01:05.909> those<00:01:06.439> make<00:01:07.439> sure<00:01:07.470> well<00:01:07.979> those<00:01:08.189> will<00:01:08.369> be

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
sure those make sure well those will be

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.880 
sure those make sure well those will be
zero<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.180> don't<00:01:09.330> need<00:01:09.479> those<00:01:09.689> there<00:01:10.229> but

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
zero so I don't need those there but

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.590 
zero so I don't need those there but
let's<00:01:11.070> just<00:01:11.220> change<00:01:11.549> these<00:01:11.790> up<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.150> little<00:01:12.360> bit

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
let's just change these up a little bit

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.030 
let's just change these up a little bit
so<00:01:13.409> let's<00:01:13.619> get<00:01:13.830> instead<00:01:15.439> maybe<00:01:16.439> those<00:01:16.710> three

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
so let's get instead maybe those three

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.649 
so let's get instead maybe those three
will<00:01:17.130> be<00:01:17.310> zero<00:01:17.580> but<00:01:17.820> maybe<00:01:18.000> these<00:01:18.240> three<00:01:18.479> will

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
will be zero but maybe these three will

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.050 
will be zero but maybe these three will
be

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.160 

I<00:01:25.610> don't<00:01:26.610> know<00:01:26.700> point<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.420> remember<00:01:27.810> it's<00:01:28.080> only

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
I don't know point to remember it's only

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.500 
I don't know point to remember it's only
they're<00:01:28.560> only<00:01:28.770> frozen<00:01:29.369> in<00:01:29.700> place<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.330> I'll

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
they're only frozen in place and I'll

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.980 
they're only frozen in place and I'll
sign<00:01:30.750> those<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.590> only<00:01:31.770> frozen<00:01:31.979> in<00:01:32.280> place<00:01:32.430> if

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
sign those the only frozen in place if

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.770 
sign those the only frozen in place if
they're<00:01:33.990> set<00:01:34.320> at<00:01:34.440> a<00:01:34.500> value<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.799> one<00:01:35.390> ok<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:36.420> then

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
they're set at a value of one ok so then

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.120 
they're set at a value of one ok so then
I'm<00:01:36.900> going<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.049> leave<00:01:37.380> those<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.979> then<00:01:38.100> oh

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
I'm going to leave those and then oh

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.330 
I'm going to leave those and then oh
yeah<00:01:38.430> I'm<00:01:39.030> gonna<00:01:39.180> get<00:01:39.360> my<00:01:40.100> selection<00:01:41.100> tool<00:01:41.310> and

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
yeah I'm gonna get my selection tool and

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.109 
yeah I'm gonna get my selection tool and
then<00:01:41.610> maybe<00:01:41.909> these<00:01:42.560> here<00:01:46.520> I'll<00:01:47.520> make<00:01:47.759> point

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
then maybe these here I'll make point

00:01:48.119 --> 00:02:05.860 
then maybe these here I'll make point
four<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:50.780> assign<00:01:51.780> those<00:01:54.590> and<00:01:55.590> then

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:17.560 

these<00:02:06.710> may<00:02:06.980> be<00:02:07.010> 0.7<00:02:09.610> and<00:02:10.610> assign<00:02:11.120> those<00:02:16.570> and

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
these may be 0.7 and assign those and

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.440 
these may be 0.7 and assign those and
there's<00:02:17.720> maybe<00:02:17.870> point<00:02:18.350> nine<00:02:18.670> and<00:02:19.670> assigned

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
there's maybe point nine and assigned

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.640 
there's maybe point nine and assigned
those<00:02:20.630> so<00:02:20.840> I<00:02:20.870> had<00:02:21.050> to<00:02:21.110> change<00:02:21.350> the<00:02:21.530> value<00:02:23.650> for

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
those so I had to change the value for

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.620 
those so I had to change the value for
each<00:02:24.800> one<00:02:25.100> and<00:02:25.430> I'll<00:02:25.820> change<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.270> name<00:02:26.420> I'll

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
each one and I'll change the name I'll

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.690 
each one and I'll change the name I'll
call<00:02:26.660> a<00:02:26.870> car<00:02:29.440> okay<00:02:30.440> I'll<00:02:30.590> leave<00:02:30.740> edit<00:02:30.980> mode<00:02:31.160> all

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
call a car okay I'll leave edit mode all

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.760 
call a car okay I'll leave edit mode all
right<00:02:31.850> so<00:02:32.060> then<00:02:32.240> back<00:02:33.200> in<00:02:33.410> here<00:02:33.560> it<00:02:33.650> might

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
right so then back in here it might

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.680 
right so then back in here it might
still<00:02:34.010> have<00:02:34.100> my<00:02:34.220> wind<00:02:34.460> in<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.730> scene<00:02:34.970> so

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
still have my wind in the scene so

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.990 
still have my wind in the scene so
already<00:02:36.230> when<00:02:36.530> I<00:02:36.560> run<00:02:36.860> it<00:02:37.010> this<00:02:37.220> should<00:02:37.700> just

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
already when I run it this should just

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.600 
already when I run it this should just
start<00:02:38.240> moving<00:02:38.540> but<00:02:39.140> depending<00:02:40.040> upon<00:02:40.160> my

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
start moving but depending upon my

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.980 
start moving but depending upon my
current<00:02:41.030> settings<00:02:41.390> of<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.570> soft<00:02:41.780> body

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
current settings of the soft body

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.500 
current settings of the soft body
physics<00:02:42.530> right<00:02:43.190> now<00:02:43.400> this<00:02:43.730> thing<00:02:43.970> could<00:02:44.210> start

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
physics right now this thing could start

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.010 
physics right now this thing could start
crunching<00:02:45.050> so<00:02:45.530> let's<00:02:45.770> go<00:02:45.980> in<00:02:46.190> and<00:02:46.870> crank<00:02:47.870> up

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
crunching so let's go in and crank up

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.980 
crunching so let's go in and crank up
the<00:02:48.140> quads<00:02:48.410> stiff<00:02:48.950> quads<00:02:49.250> on<00:02:49.550> it<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:49.990> we'll

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
the quads stiff quads on it and we'll

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.900 
the quads stiff quads on it and we'll
crank<00:02:51.380> up<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:51.710> compression<00:02:52.340> on<00:02:52.490> it<00:02:52.520> so<00:02:52.880> I

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
crank up the compression on it so I

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.570 
crank up the compression on it so I
can't<00:02:53.270> compress<00:02:54.130> let's<00:02:55.130> just<00:02:55.310> see<00:02:55.460> what

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
can't compress let's just see what

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.910 
can't compress let's just see what
happens<00:02:56.000> oh<00:02:58.750> it's<00:02:59.750> compressing<00:03:00.470> already<00:03:00.770> you

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
happens oh it's compressing already you

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.530 
happens oh it's compressing already you
can<00:03:01.070> see<00:03:01.310> but<00:03:01.520> you<00:03:01.550> can<00:03:01.790> already<00:03:01.940> see<00:03:02.300> right

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
can see but you can already see right

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.230 
can see but you can already see right
here<00:03:02.870> that<00:03:03.410> it's<00:03:03.560> compressing<00:03:04.160> more<00:03:04.400> up<00:03:04.790> here

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
here that it's compressing more up here

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.360 
here that it's compressing more up here
towards<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.840> front<00:03:06.340> where<00:03:07.340> I<00:03:07.790> have<00:03:08.690> those

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
towards the front where I have those

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.960 
towards the front where I have those
vertex<00:03:10.370> groups<00:03:10.670> set<00:03:11.060> less<00:03:11.360> I<00:03:12.730> said<00:03:13.730> I'm<00:03:13.790> trying

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
vertex groups set less I said I'm trying

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.080 
vertex groups set less I said I'm trying
to<00:03:14.150> find<00:03:14.330> a<00:03:14.450> balance<00:03:14.630> between<00:03:15.970> you<00:03:16.970> know

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
to find a balance between you know

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.640 
to find a balance between you know
having<00:03:17.540> enough<00:03:17.750> wind<00:03:18.080> because<00:03:18.350> if<00:03:18.440> I<00:03:18.530> have

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
having enough wind because if I have

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.370 
having enough wind because if I have
enough<00:03:18.890> wind<00:03:19.130> it<00:03:19.370> should<00:03:19.520> push<00:03:19.760> it<00:03:19.880> along<00:03:20.380> but

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
enough wind it should push it along but

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.290 
enough wind it should push it along but
obviously<00:03:21.920> based<00:03:22.220> on<00:03:22.370> these<00:03:22.610> settings<00:03:23.030> it's

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
obviously based on these settings it's

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.030 
obviously based on these settings it's
you<00:03:23.600> know<00:03:23.750> not<00:03:25.810> it's<00:03:26.810> obviously<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.560> shape<00:03:27.890> of

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
you know not it's obviously the shape of

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.729 
you know not it's obviously the shape of
my<00:03:28.250> mesh<00:03:28.520> that's<00:03:29.270> being<00:03:29.660> affected<00:03:29.840> you<00:03:30.709> know

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
my mesh that's being affected you know

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.790 
my mesh that's being affected you know
because<00:03:31.040> if<00:03:31.160> you<00:03:31.190> imagined<00:03:32.140> from<00:03:33.140> in<00:03:33.350> here

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
because if you imagined from in here

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.100 
because if you imagined from in here
let's<00:03:34.310> see<00:03:34.520> yeah<00:03:35.330> if<00:03:35.420> you<00:03:35.540> imagine<00:03:35.720> these

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
let's see yeah if you imagine these

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.470 
let's see yeah if you imagine these
points<00:03:37.070> here<00:03:37.250> they're<00:03:37.430> gonna<00:03:37.489> compress

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
points here they're gonna compress

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.380 
points here they're gonna compress
easier<00:03:39.050> based<00:03:39.380> on<00:03:39.590> these<00:03:39.739> angles<00:03:40.250> so<00:03:40.520> probably

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
easier based on these angles so probably

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.610 
easier based on these angles so probably
would<00:03:41.480> have<00:03:41.570> been<00:03:41.660> better<00:03:41.870> off<00:03:42.050> with<00:03:42.230> a<00:03:42.260> square

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
would have been better off with a square

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.710 
would have been better off with a square
mesh<00:03:43.040> for<00:03:43.370> starters<00:03:43.850> but<00:03:44.120> this<00:03:44.330> kind<00:03:44.540> of<00:03:44.600> gives

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
mesh for starters but this kind of gives

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.020 
mesh for starters but this kind of gives
you<00:03:44.810> an<00:03:44.930> idea<00:03:45.400> let's<00:03:46.400> see<00:03:46.520> if<00:03:46.580> we<00:03:46.700> really

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
you an idea let's see if we really

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:55.150 
you an idea let's see if we really
cranked<00:03:47.810> up<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:49.330> wind<00:03:50.330> force<00:03:50.750> on<00:03:51.019> it<00:03:53.980> you<00:03:54.980> can

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
cranked up the wind force on it you can

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.070 
cranked up the wind force on it you can
see<00:03:55.459> it's<00:03:55.610> kind<00:03:55.850> of<00:03:55.940> pushing<00:03:56.269> it<00:03:56.390> along<00:03:56.480> it's

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
see it's kind of pushing it along it's

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.310 
see it's kind of pushing it along it's
trying<00:03:57.290> to<00:03:57.380> push<00:03:57.590> it<00:03:57.709> along<00:03:57.920> the<00:03:58.100> ground<00:03:59.320> so

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
trying to push it along the ground so

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.310 
trying to push it along the ground so
this<00:04:00.890> is<00:04:01.070> I<00:04:01.370> think<00:04:01.970> I<00:04:02.269> tell<00:04:02.840> you<00:04:02.900> what<00:04:03.019> we'll<00:04:03.140> do

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
this is I think I tell you what we'll do

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.380 
this is I think I tell you what we'll do
is<00:04:03.590> well<00:04:04.340> maybe<00:04:04.580> one<00:04:04.760> thing<00:04:04.970> is<00:04:07.030> we<00:04:08.030> won't<00:04:08.239> give

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
is well maybe one thing is we won't give

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.120 
is well maybe one thing is we won't give
it<00:04:08.480> as<00:04:08.570> much<00:04:08.600> force<00:04:09.080> we'll<00:04:09.320> go<00:04:09.410> back<00:04:09.620> into<00:04:09.800> here

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
it as much force we'll go back into here

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.490 
it as much force we'll go back into here
and<00:04:10.610> hold<00:04:10.790> these<00:04:10.940> last<00:04:11.239> values<00:04:11.690> for<00:04:12.410> the

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
and hold these last values for the

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.819 
and hold these last values for the
vertex<00:04:12.830> group<00:04:13.160> let's<00:04:14.060> don't<00:04:15.049> leave<00:04:15.410> him<00:04:15.590> so

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
vertex group let's don't leave him so

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.650 
vertex group let's don't leave him so
fixed<00:04:16.220> in<00:04:16.340> place<00:04:16.549> let's<00:04:16.820> make<00:04:16.970> those<00:04:17.120> points

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
fixed in place let's make those points

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.119 
fixed in place let's make those points
seven<00:04:17.989> also

00:04:19.119 --> 00:04:19.129 
seven also

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:21.199 
seven also
let's<00:04:20.129> see<00:04:20.250> how<00:04:20.430> much<00:04:20.549> of<00:04:20.699> a<00:04:20.759> difference<00:04:21.060> that

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
let's see how much of a difference that

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.550 
let's see how much of a difference that
makes<00:04:21.509> could<00:04:21.810> halt<00:04:22.199> a<00:04:23.990> now<00:04:24.990> you<00:04:25.199> can<00:04:25.319> see<00:04:25.470> it

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
makes could halt a now you can see it

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.080 
makes could halt a now you can see it
wants<00:04:25.770> to<00:04:25.889> move<00:04:26.039> along<00:04:26.310> a<00:04:26.370> little<00:04:26.729> bit<00:04:26.819> quicker

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
wants to move along a little bit quicker

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.890 
wants to move along a little bit quicker
because<00:04:27.330> of<00:04:27.599> it

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
because of it

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.790 
because of it
so<00:04:28.560> maybe<00:04:29.539> alright<00:04:30.539> let's<00:04:31.319> try<00:04:31.470> it<00:04:31.590> this<00:04:31.740> way

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
so maybe alright let's try it this way

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:38.110 
so maybe alright let's try it this way
let's<00:04:32.310> just<00:04:32.759> make<00:04:33.000> that<00:04:33.030> half<00:04:33.449> in<00:04:33.629> the<00:04:33.720> car

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.890 

we'll<00:04:39.120> just<00:04:39.330> wait<00:04:39.569> it<00:04:39.750> at<00:04:40.110> point<00:04:40.740> five<00:04:41.900> sign

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
we'll just wait it at point five sign

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.409 
we'll just wait it at point five sign
that<00:04:43.229> all<00:04:44.159> right<00:04:44.310> so<00:04:44.340> it's<00:04:44.699> fairly<00:04:44.970> free<00:04:45.300> to

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
that all right so it's fairly free to

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.029 
that all right so it's fairly free to
move<00:04:45.569> and<00:04:45.750> these<00:04:45.900> were<00:04:46.080> really<00:04:46.349> compressible

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
move and these were really compressible

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:48.770 
move and these were really compressible
to<00:04:47.159> move<00:04:47.370> all<00:04:47.849> right<00:04:47.879> let's<00:04:48.090> see<00:04:48.240> what<00:04:48.449> happens

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
to move all right let's see what happens

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.350 
to move all right let's see what happens
they're<00:04:48.990> called<00:04:49.319> a<00:04:49.530> at<00:04:50.190> the<00:04:50.280> beginning<00:04:50.550> all

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
they're called a at the beginning all

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.550 
they're called a at the beginning all
right<00:04:51.449> so<00:04:51.630> now<00:04:51.780> it's<00:04:51.900> pushing<00:04:52.139> it<00:04:52.380> further

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
right so now it's pushing it further

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.100 
right so now it's pushing it further
along<00:04:52.979> all<00:04:53.819> right<00:04:53.909> who<00:04:54.240> gets<00:04:54.509> to<00:04:54.720> about<00:04:54.780> there

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
along all right who gets to about there

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.350 
along all right who gets to about there
so<00:04:55.139> it's<00:04:55.500> close<00:04:55.979> we're<00:04:56.250> not<00:04:56.370> it's<00:04:56.789> not<00:04:56.940> exact

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
so it's close we're not it's not exact

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.240 
so it's close we're not it's not exact
but<00:04:57.449> I<00:04:57.539> think<00:04:57.720> it'll<00:04:58.560> give<00:04:58.770> you<00:04:58.860> enough<00:04:59.039> of<00:04:59.130> an

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
but I think it'll give you enough of an

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.620 
but I think it'll give you enough of an
idea<00:04:59.520> to<00:04:59.669> get<00:04:59.819> working<00:05:00.030> with<00:05:00.270> this<00:05:00.389> so<00:05:00.539> I'm

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
idea to get working with this so I'm

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.629 
idea to get working with this so I'm
gonna<00:05:00.690> add<00:05:00.930> a<00:05:00.960> plane<00:05:01.259> to<00:05:01.289> the<00:05:01.470> scene<00:05:01.800> real

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
gonna add a plane to the scene real

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.070 
gonna add a plane to the scene real
quick<00:05:02.880> and<00:05:03.060> I'll<00:05:03.150> just<00:05:03.330> scale<00:05:03.630> it<00:05:03.659> a<00:05:03.840> little

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
quick and I'll just scale it a little

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.420 
quick and I'll just scale it a little
bit<00:05:04.229> I<00:05:05.120> can<00:05:06.120> rotate<00:05:06.419> it<00:05:06.720> or<00:05:06.840> Y<00:05:08.180> maybe<00:05:09.180> ninety

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
bit I can rotate it or Y maybe ninety

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.920 
bit I can rotate it or Y maybe ninety
and<00:05:11.430> move<00:05:11.610> it<00:05:11.729> back<00:05:11.909> here<00:05:12.180> so<00:05:12.210> it's<00:05:12.539> kind<00:05:12.750> of<00:05:12.780> in

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
and move it back here so it's kind of in

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.379 
and move it back here so it's kind of in
front<00:05:13.259> of<00:05:13.349> the<00:05:13.500> vehicle<00:05:13.949> like<00:05:14.699> this<00:05:14.969> and<00:05:15.300> then

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
front of the vehicle like this and then

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.020 
front of the vehicle like this and then
I'll<00:05:15.479> move<00:05:15.630> that<00:05:15.900> they're<00:05:16.500> fairly<00:05:17.430> close<00:05:17.699> by

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
I'll move that they're fairly close by

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.450 
I'll move that they're fairly close by
since<00:05:18.870> they<00:05:18.990> can't<00:05:19.349> be<00:05:19.560> pushing<00:05:19.889> it<00:05:19.979> very<00:05:20.190> far

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
since they can't be pushing it very far

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.070 
since they can't be pushing it very far
yet<00:05:20.759> and<00:05:20.940> then<00:05:21.360> I'm<00:05:21.419> gonna<00:05:21.539> go<00:05:21.690> make<00:05:21.840> this<00:05:22.020> a

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
yet and then I'm gonna go make this a

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.249 
yet and then I'm gonna go make this a
collision<00:05:22.620> based<00:05:22.830> object<00:05:23.310> as<00:05:23.430> well<00:05:24.259> alright

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 
collision based object as well alright

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:32.029 
collision based object as well alright
so<00:05:25.319> now<00:05:26.039> let's<00:05:26.069> run<00:05:26.430> it<00:05:28.969> it's<00:05:29.969> gotta<00:05:30.120> start<00:05:31.039> and

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
so now let's run it it's gotta start and

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:34.519 
so now let's run it it's gotta start and
then<00:05:32.940> you<00:05:33.000> see<00:05:33.180> it's<00:05:33.330> crashing<00:05:33.780> more<00:05:33.960> see<00:05:34.409> if

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:34.529 
then you see it's crashing more see if

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:36.320 
then you see it's crashing more see if
compresses<00:05:35.159> older<00:05:35.430> self<00:05:35.639> because<00:05:35.789> it<00:05:35.849> can't

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
compresses older self because it can't

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:42.709 
compresses older self because it can't
get<00:05:36.449> past<00:05:36.719> that<00:05:40.099> alright<00:05:41.099> and<00:05:41.400> so<00:05:41.940> well<00:05:42.569> you

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:42.719 
get past that alright and so well you

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:44.029 
get past that alright and so well you
know<00:05:42.810> what<00:05:42.930> the<00:05:43.020> nice<00:05:43.139> thing<00:05:43.349> about<00:05:43.380> this<00:05:43.770> is

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
know what the nice thing about this is

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:46.939 
know what the nice thing about this is
this<00:05:44.310> is<00:05:44.370> the<00:05:45.180> simulation<00:05:45.810> is<00:05:45.960> significantly

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:46.949 
this is the simulation is significantly

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:49.100 
this is the simulation is significantly
faster<00:05:47.039> than<00:05:47.520> my<00:05:47.639> older<00:05:47.880> computer<00:05:48.360> everyone

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
faster than my older computer everyone

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.019 
faster than my older computer everyone
haven't<00:05:49.319> done<00:05:49.409> much<00:05:49.560> soft<00:05:49.860> body<00:05:50.039> physics<00:05:50.490> in<00:05:50.759> I

00:05:51.019 --> 00:05:51.029 
haven't done much soft body physics in I

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:53.839 
haven't done much soft body physics in I
mean<00:05:51.690> years<00:05:52.080> back<00:05:52.889> since<00:05:53.190> like<00:05:53.400> two<00:05:53.610> point

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:53.849 
mean years back since like two point

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:56.029 
mean years back since like two point
three<00:05:54.060> seven<00:05:54.270> a<00:05:54.449> a<00:05:54.479> lot<00:05:54.719> of<00:05:54.840> that<00:05:54.960> was<00:05:55.199> my<00:05:55.979> two

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 
three seven a a lot of that was my two

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:58.430 
three seven a a lot of that was my two
early<00:05:56.699> early<00:05:57.150> tornado<00:05:57.630> animations<00:05:58.199> I<00:05:58.289> had<00:05:58.409> a

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
early early tornado animations I had a

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.040 
early early tornado animations I had a
lot<00:05:58.650> of<00:05:58.680> soft<00:05:58.949> body<00:05:59.479> results<00:06:00.479> in<00:06:00.539> it<00:06:00.659> but<00:06:00.810> it

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
lot of soft body results in it but it

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.870 
lot of soft body results in it but it
was<00:06:01.080> pain<00:06:01.440> painful<00:06:01.949> the<00:06:02.400> amount<00:06:02.580> of<00:06:02.669> time<00:06:02.849> that

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
was pain painful the amount of time that

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.909 
was pain painful the amount of time that
it<00:06:03.090> would<00:06:03.150> take<00:06:03.210> to<00:06:03.599> render<00:06:03.960> it<00:06:04.080> but<00:06:04.529> I<00:06:04.560> can<00:06:04.740> see

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
it would take to render it but I can see

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:07.700 
it would take to render it but I can see
this<00:06:05.099> is<00:06:05.279> a<00:06:05.310> huge<00:06:05.659> change<00:06:06.659> in<00:06:06.840> performance<00:06:07.080> so

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
this is a huge change in performance so

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.320 
this is a huge change in performance so
I'm<00:06:08.069> gonna<00:06:08.340> have<00:06:08.460> to<00:06:08.490> crank<00:06:08.759> up<00:06:08.909> and<00:06:09.090> start

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
I'm gonna have to crank up and start

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.320 
I'm gonna have to crank up and start
doing<00:06:09.569> some<00:06:09.750> more<00:06:09.779> fun<00:06:10.770> stuff<00:06:11.000> always<00:06:12.000> soft

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
doing some more fun stuff always soft

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.209 
doing some more fun stuff always soft
body<00:06:12.509> physics<00:06:12.900> okay<00:06:13.380> well<00:06:13.740> that's<00:06:13.889> it<00:06:13.949> for<00:06:14.099> now

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:14.219 
body physics okay well that's it for now

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:17.360 
body physics okay well that's it for now
and<00:06:14.520> I'll<00:06:14.819> see<00:06:14.909> you<00:06:14.969> in<00:06:15.029> the<00:06:15.090> next<00:06:15.270> video
