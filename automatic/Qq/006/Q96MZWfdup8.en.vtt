00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
thing I think is if you start make a

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:19.550 
thing I think is if you start make a
restart<00:01:12.050> with<00:01:13.050> a<00:01:13.080> backup<00:01:13.500> game<00:01:17.869> it<00:01:18.869> goes<00:01:19.170> into

realized<00:02:50.620> that<00:02:51.620> it's<00:02:52.310> time<00:02:52.610> for<00:02:52.640> a<00:02:52.940> new<00:02:53.090> chip<00:02:53.360> I

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.050 

believe<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:57.410> first<00:02:57.680> time<00:02:57.860> I<00:02:58.250> saw<00:02:58.459> this<00:02:58.640> videos

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
believe the first time I saw this videos

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:06.420 
believe the first time I saw this videos
that<00:02:59.420> this<00:02:59.959> is<00:03:00.110> possible<00:03:02.799> but<00:03:03.799> now<00:03:04.040> I<00:03:04.430> think

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
that this is possible but now I think

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.470 
that this is possible but now I think
they<00:03:07.430> can't<00:03:07.730> make<00:03:07.819> it<00:03:08.120> better<00:03:10.359> that's<00:03:11.359> the

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
they can't make it better that's the

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.650 
they can't make it better that's the
best<00:03:11.780> ship<00:03:12.109> ever<00:03:12.410> for<00:03:12.739> use<00:03:13.100> -<00:03:14.650> ok
