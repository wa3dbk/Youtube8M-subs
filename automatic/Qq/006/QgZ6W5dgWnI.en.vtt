the yarn or the thread and wrap around
it<00:03:08.690> a<00:03:08.780> few<00:03:08.990> times<00:03:09.140> and<00:03:09.410> just<00:03:09.680> pull<00:03:09.860> tight<00:03:10.930> it

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
it a few times and just pull tight it

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.420 
it a few times and just pull tight it
helps<00:03:12.200> to<00:03:12.320> compress<00:03:12.680> it<00:03:12.950> while<00:03:13.280> you're

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
helps to compress it while you're

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.720 
helps to compress it while you're
wrapping<00:03:13.820> it<00:03:14.890> that<00:03:15.890> way<00:03:16.040> it's<00:03:16.190> not<00:03:16.310> all<00:03:16.550> your

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
wrapping it that way it's not all your

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.300 
wrapping it that way it's not all your
fingers<00:03:17.120> that<00:03:17.930> are<00:03:18.100> getting<00:03:19.100> all<00:03:19.190> the

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
fingers that are getting all the

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.000 
fingers that are getting all the
pressure<00:03:19.519> from<00:03:19.880> tying<00:03:20.209> it<00:03:20.650> could<00:03:21.650> be<00:03:21.769> kind<00:03:21.980> of

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
pressure from tying it could be kind of

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:48.710 
pressure from tying it could be kind of
painful

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.480 

so<00:03:49.720> I<00:03:49.750> started<00:03:50.230> out<00:03:50.380> with<00:03:50.650> a<00:03:50.920> ball<00:03:51.100> that<00:03:51.130> was

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
so I started out with a ball that was

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.980 
so I started out with a ball that was
about<00:03:51.670> ten<00:03:51.970> and<00:03:52.090> a<00:03:52.270> half<00:03:52.360> inches

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
about ten and a half inches

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.860 
about ten and a half inches
after<00:03:53.590> adding<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.010> gauze<00:03:54.220> and<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:55.240> over<00:03:55.690> wool

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
after adding the gauze and the over wool

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.900 
after adding the gauze and the over wool
and<00:03:56.170> pulling<00:03:56.410> it<00:03:56.500> tight<00:03:56.740> it<00:03:56.980> does<00:03:57.220> compress<00:03:57.670> it

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
and pulling it tight it does compress it

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.000 
and pulling it tight it does compress it
I<00:03:58.120> want<00:03:58.780> a<00:03:58.810> head<00:03:58.990> that<00:03:59.170> ends<00:03:59.410> up<00:03:59.500> about<00:03:59.650> nine

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
I want a head that ends up about nine

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.650 
I want a head that ends up about nine
inches<00:04:00.520> around<00:04:02.700> this<00:04:03.700> one<00:04:03.910> right<00:04:04.090> now<00:04:04.300> is

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
inches around this one right now is

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.960 
inches around this one right now is
still<00:04:05.230> about<00:04:05.560> ten<00:04:07.440> so<00:04:08.440> as<00:04:08.680> I<00:04:09.070> tied<00:04:09.370> the<00:04:09.610> strings

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
still about ten so as I tied the strings

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:16.020 
still about ten so as I tied the strings
around<00:04:10.150> it<00:04:10.450> it<00:04:10.600> will<00:04:10.750> get<00:04:10.900> smaller<00:04:11.230> so<00:04:15.030> now

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
around it it will get smaller so now

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.710 
around it it will get smaller so now
we're<00:04:16.209> going<00:04:16.450> to<00:04:16.540> do<00:04:16.750> the<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:19.209> string<00:04:19.510> that

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
we're going to do the the string that

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.630 
we're going to do the the string that
goes<00:04:19.780> underneath<00:04:20.410> the<00:04:20.530> chin<00:04:20.980> to<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.250> top<00:04:21.489> of

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
goes underneath the chin to the top of

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.180 
goes underneath the chin to the top of
the<00:04:21.730> head<00:04:21.910> again<00:04:22.750> about<00:04:23.110> two<00:04:23.380> yards<00:04:23.740> doubled

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
the head again about two yards doubled

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:40.680 
the head again about two yards doubled
over<00:04:24.460> I<00:04:38.820> hold<00:04:39.820> it<00:04:40.090> tight

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
over I hold it tight

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.660 
over I hold it tight
straight<00:04:41.320> over<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:41.800> top<00:04:41.980> of<00:04:42.010> the<00:04:42.190> head<00:04:42.340> I<00:04:42.370> try

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
straight over the top of the head I try

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.990 
straight over the top of the head I try
to<00:04:42.730> keep<00:04:42.970> it<00:04:43.120> centered<00:04:45.030> just<00:04:46.030> pull<00:04:46.450> it<00:04:46.660> down

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
to keep it centered just pull it down

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.410 
to keep it centered just pull it down
and<00:04:49.000> now<00:04:49.300> I<00:04:49.600> do<00:04:49.750> my<00:04:50.080> heads<00:04:50.550> very<00:04:51.550> firm<00:04:51.970> at<00:04:52.240> the

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 
and now I do my heads very firm at the

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.050 
and now I do my heads very firm at the
core<00:04:52.690> and<00:04:53.500> a<00:04:53.560> little<00:04:54.250> bit<00:04:54.460> softer<00:04:54.940> on<00:04:54.970> the

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
core and a little bit softer on the

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.080 
core and a little bit softer on the
outside<00:04:55.480> so<00:04:55.780> that<00:04:55.810> they're<00:04:56.200> easier<00:04:56.680> to

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
outside so that they're easier to

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.930 
outside so that they're easier to
compress<00:04:58.290> and<00:04:59.290> get<00:04:59.530> a<00:04:59.770> bunch<00:05:00.340> of<00:05:00.460> a<00:05:00.670> lot

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
compress and get a bunch of a lot

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.790 
compress and get a bunch of a lot
definition<00:05:01.630> I<00:05:01.690> like<00:05:01.840> a<00:05:01.930> lot<00:05:02.080> of<00:05:02.110> definition<00:05:02.680> in

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
definition I like a lot of definition in

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.820 
definition I like a lot of definition in
my<00:05:02.890> cheeks<00:05:03.510> and<00:05:04.510> in<00:05:05.020> the<00:05:05.500> chin<00:05:05.740> area<00:05:07.620> so<00:05:08.620> this

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
my cheeks and in the chin area so this

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.490 
my cheeks and in the chin area so this
is<00:05:09.010> good<00:05:10.200> it<00:05:11.200> still<00:05:11.980> creates<00:05:12.340> a<00:05:12.640> hard<00:05:12.910> head

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
is good it still creates a hard head

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.620 
is good it still creates a hard head
because<00:05:14.700> you're<00:05:15.700> pulling<00:05:16.030> the<00:05:16.150> strings<00:05:16.450> as

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
because you're pulling the strings as

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.530 
because you're pulling the strings as
tight<00:05:16.870> as<00:05:17.020> you<00:05:17.140> can<00:05:17.170> and<00:05:17.710> so<00:05:18.370> it<00:05:18.520> does<00:05:18.700> make<00:05:19.330> the

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
tight as you can and so it does make the

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:29.379 
tight as you can and so it does make the
head<00:05:19.690> quite<00:05:20.020> hard<00:05:20.700> when<00:05:21.700> it's<00:05:21.850> done

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:32.709 

if<00:05:30.080> you<00:05:30.379> start<00:05:30.710> with<00:05:30.889> a<00:05:31.159> firmer<00:05:31.550> or<00:05:32.060> hard<00:05:32.360> ball

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:32.719 
if you start with a firmer or hard ball

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:34.659 
if you start with a firmer or hard ball
in<00:05:32.990> the<00:05:33.080> center<00:05:33.439> you<00:05:34.039> might<00:05:34.159> be<00:05:34.310> able<00:05:34.430> to<00:05:34.490> get

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
in the center you might be able to get

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.399 
in the center you might be able to get
as<00:05:34.819> much<00:05:34.969> definition<00:05:35.389> and<00:05:35.840> that's<00:05:35.930> fine<00:05:36.169> I

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:36.409 
as much definition and that's fine I

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:37.570 
as much definition and that's fine I
mean<00:05:36.560> if<00:05:36.710> that's<00:05:36.830> the<00:05:36.979> look<00:05:37.219> that<00:05:37.280> you're

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
mean if that's the look that you're

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.070 
mean if that's the look that you're
going<00:05:37.729> for<00:05:37.879> there's<00:05:38.599> nothing<00:05:38.870> wrong<00:05:38.990> with

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
going for there's nothing wrong with

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.770 
going for there's nothing wrong with
that<00:05:39.819> you<00:05:40.819> just<00:05:41.000> want<00:05:41.210> to<00:05:41.240> start<00:05:41.479> with<00:05:41.629> the

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
that you just want to start with the

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.619 
that you just want to start with the
firmer<00:05:42.199> ball<00:05:42.469> and<00:05:42.860> then<00:05:43.189> you<00:05:44.150> won't<00:05:44.360> pull<00:05:44.539> the

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:44.629 
firmer ball and then you won't pull the

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:49.779 
firmer ball and then you won't pull the
string<00:05:44.900> so<00:05:45.110> tight<00:05:47.770> so<00:05:48.770> again<00:05:49.129> we're<00:05:49.520> going<00:05:49.669> to

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:49.789 
string so tight so again we're going to

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:58.570 
string so tight so again we're going to
take<00:05:49.969> two<00:05:50.389> yards<00:05:50.780> doubled<00:05:51.199> over<00:05:51.530> and<00:05:57.250> go<00:05:58.250> for

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
take two yards doubled over and go for

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:05.499 
take two yards doubled over and go for
the<00:05:58.669> eye<00:05:58.699> line<00:06:03.520> just<00:06:04.520> Center<00:06:04.849> it<00:06:04.879> right<00:06:05.210> in<00:06:05.389> the

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:05.509 
the eye line just Center it right in the

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:17.020 
the eye line just Center it right in the
middle<00:06:05.719> of<00:06:05.870> the<00:06:06.050> face

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.250 

take<00:06:17.750> your<00:06:18.140> time<00:06:18.380> and<00:06:18.680> line<00:06:18.860> it<00:06:18.890> up<00:06:20.080> wrap<00:06:21.080> it

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:21.260 
take your time and line it up wrap it

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.870 
take your time and line it up wrap it
around<00:06:21.380> once<00:06:21.800> and<00:06:22.130> they<00:06:22.220> come<00:06:22.430> back<00:06:22.460> to<00:06:22.610> the

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 
around once and they come back to the

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:31.380 
around once and they come back to the
front

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:31.390 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.940 

you're<00:06:32.390> just<00:06:32.600> not<00:06:32.840> poor<00:06:33.140> until<00:06:33.590> you<00:06:33.740> give<00:06:33.920> it

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:33.950 
you're just not poor until you give it

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.860
