00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
like it was one of the main things that

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.740

kind of forced it to come up early and

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.049 
kind of forced it to come up early and
if<00:01:03.260> it<00:01:03.410> maybe<00:01:03.650> had<00:01:03.950> spent<00:01:04.280> you<00:01:04.519> know<00:01:04.549> waited<00:01:04.970> a

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
if it maybe had spent you know waited a

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.550 
if it maybe had spent you know waited a
couple<00:01:05.089> of<00:01:05.420> months<00:01:05.600> it<00:01:06.049> probably<00:01:06.409> would<00:01:06.500> have

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
couple of months it probably would have

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.289

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
released with less issues or maybe it

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:09.580

were actually releasing maps so

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.409 
were actually releasing maps so
hopefully<00:04:47.919> they<00:04:48.190> pull<00:04:48.430> off<00:04:48.580> with<00:04:48.970> this<00:04:49.180> I
