00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.150
 yes hello and welcome to the minecraft 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.590
 chelsea example tips where i am 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.740
 meanwhile the really cool things 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.059
 show and explain in minecraft 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.970
 Now that we have the hidden door 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.640
 had something more special now 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.240
 namely a timer and that 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.050
 no eternal profession boring with 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.520
 redstone but there are those too 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.840
 We do not need it for now 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.100
 a really simple variant of the one 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.829
 basic feature of minecraft uses 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.110
 namely the five minutes of stature with 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:42.220
 we need blocks to disappear 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:45.280
 once a dispens a pressure plate 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:51.690
 made of wood which is triggered by objects 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.690
 can be and one 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:07.070
 and zack so and an inverter then 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:08.150
 back to the dispenser that runs 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.670
 Of course you can also add one whole 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.750
 little 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.840
 although that's not it 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.580
 most compact that actually goes 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.120
 that does not have to be born now 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.710
 So that's how we do it 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.920
 First of all, complete the down 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.430
 then he filled something with something 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.650
 and then when you put on it but 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.270
 is then briefly directly to torch 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.399
 the active 1 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:39.350
 but that will activate the fatal idea 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:40.210
 activates and thereby becomes briefly once 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.910
 taken away 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.830
 and when the stone disappears, so do I. 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.990
 just do my stone with it 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.670
 You'll see you fly longer for a long time 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.590
 what is left on it is the torch 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.570
 disabled and then after five 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.790
 minutes if all the blocks somehow 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.410
 so fly around on the ground 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.959
 you see the disappearances after five 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.130
 minutes as long as you are nearby 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:02.530
 it is always too far away then 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.800
 timer stopped 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.450
 after five different blog then and 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.180
 the torch will be activated and it will be on 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.690
 new blog on the kick plate on it 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.990
 shot 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.330
 so that the stone is not like that 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.459
 case you saw that here that he 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.540
 sometimes fly over it or something should 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.420
 That's her too 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:29.349
 somehow dress up safely 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:32.510
 no, and so that you do not see 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:34.130
 I still can not show it anymore 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.099
 that is once running here so see 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.620
 better and then it is for that 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.390
 he always took care of it 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.060
 falls and the recording simulates now 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:48.140
 just the disappearance of the block 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:52.099
 five minutes and so you can then to 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.360
 example, automatic farms build the 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.190
 I'll explain you in the next video 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.450
 So I still know that really 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.450
 what is happening is visible 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.489
 You have a spencer to the edge 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.099
 with something full is then one 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:13.010
 redstone is the one in here 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:15.410
 Werther is the then follows in the 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.080
 dispenser works and so you have quasi 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.599
 An endless so are not endlessly long 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.410
 but sometimes I'm 64 now 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.760
 likely take place 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.500
 but as much as five minutes 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.670
 time interval circuit 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.610
 if you have any live anything 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.330
 can make them especially unless the 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.010
 automatic then have the next 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.720
 to be explained again it writes in the 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.060
