00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.730
 hello I am smart and smart woman 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:20.010
 is intro today we dedicate ourselves to my 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.090
 What do these creative people come from? 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.289
 outgrowth of german language moment 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.910
 hello I was a bit the yesterday 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.529
 dolls on the way he is doing the nail 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.300
 If you hit him you have to hit his head 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.830
 to lay yourself there you are on the 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.079
 holzweg and I have to pay for now 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.090
 he will experience your blue wonder 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.860
 I'll have to go to ascot 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.960
 they radiate like honey cake horse the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.399
 potent a possible line is 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.440
 earlier in the zoo in berlin the 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.120
 figurines were called troops 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.559
 Now you wanted to be the target of you 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.899
 formerly still outside the city was 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.410
 You have to walk very far to quasi 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.410
 in the dolls 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.530
 this phrase comes from the 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.000
 protect language earlier featured 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.559
 a small nail the center of gravity 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.939
 target and so should the shooter 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.170
 hit the nail on the head 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.880
 that probably comes from the 17th 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.380
 century the then it was considered a 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.729
 spice every dish as 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.350
 to be more enjoyable and so on 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.330
 Served all sorts of words 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.630
 Every court is if you wanted it 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.280
 or not on the wood path in forests 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.049
 are some abatement due to misuse 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.310
 he is followed by wood as a hiker 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.020
 you do not reach your desired goal 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.400
 and you are on the holzweg in 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.140
 it used to be public baths 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.150
 Duty of the last guest of the 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.350
 to pour out several used water 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.549
 and to clean the bathroom 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.259
 Fortunately, that is not so much the case today 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.880
 early 16th century had the color 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.220
 Blue does not mean hope 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.540
 but of lying and deception and that 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.670
 probably comes from the craft 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.140
 the dye colored it a bit blue 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.939
 the color still reacted with the 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.530
 oxygen and it resulted in a completely 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.450
 other sound and so you could hard 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.009
 but to experience a nasty surprise 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.719
 a blue miracle is an old one 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.189
 colloquial meaning for hump 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.270
 and that refers to the 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.270
 posture while laughing 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.959
 that's probably an oral one 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.840
 lore from the government 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.610
 King Wenzel of the second from Bohemia in 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.650
 The result of a heavy winter suffered 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.500
 villagers hunger and so ordered 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.360
 The king wiggles all the honey cake and 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.519
 This honey cake reminded in his 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.140
 form fighting to walk and so the 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.180
 Villagers like the honey cake horse 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.620
 but again learned many thanks for 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.099
 your attention and until the next 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.090
 times 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.090
 her wife sleep
