00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
so one of the reasons i got the 3d

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.769 
so one of the reasons i got the 3d
printer<00:00:19.619> actually<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.790> main<00:00:20.970> reason<00:00:21.029> was<00:00:21.720> to

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
printer actually the main reason was to

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.030 
printer actually the main reason was to
be<00:00:22.080> able<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.700> produce<00:00:23.700> little<00:00:24.330> objects<00:00:25.040> every

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.040 
be able to produce little objects every

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.800 
be able to produce little objects every
now<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.369> then<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.700> we<00:00:26.849> need<00:00:27.240> in<00:00:27.540> the

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
now and then that we need in the

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.480 
now and then that we need in the
construction<00:00:28.230> industry<00:00:28.439> that<00:00:28.980> are<00:00:29.130> kind<00:00:29.430> of

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
construction industry that are kind of

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.920 
construction industry that are kind of
custom<00:00:30.119> in<00:00:30.860> size<00:00:31.860> and<00:00:32.460> shape<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.240> that<00:00:33.720> you'll

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
custom in size and shape and that you'll

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.229 
custom in size and shape and that you'll
see<00:00:34.200> what<00:00:34.560> i'm<00:00:34.650> going<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.980> use<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.520> one<00:00:35.820> for

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
see what i'm going to use this one for

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.090 
see what i'm going to use this one for
in<00:00:36.980> just<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.160> bit<00:00:38.430> what<00:00:39.180> we<00:00:39.329> had<00:00:39.570> was<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:40.230> sump

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
in just a bit what we had was a sump

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.170 
in just a bit what we had was a sump
pump<00:00:41.370> basin<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.149> sewer<00:00:42.510> ejector<00:00:43.140> pump<00:00:43.350> basin

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180

that<00:00:45.180> after<00:00:45.840> about<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.020> year<00:00:46.109> some<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
that after about a year some of the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.000 
that after about a year some of the
grommets<00:00:47.370> were<00:00:47.550> lost<00:00:48.019> and<00:00:49.019> so<00:00:49.350> we're<00:00:49.739> trying

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
grommets were lost and so we're trying

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.310 
grommets were lost and so we're trying
to<00:00:50.219> do<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.340> punchless<00:00:50.850> now<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.660> one<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.170> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
to do a punchless now this is one of the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.709 
to do a punchless now this is one of the
items<00:00:52.500> on<00:00:52.859> our<00:00:52.980> punch<00:00:53.280> list<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:54.329> i<00:00:54.359> have<00:00:54.600> to

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
items on our punch list so i have to

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.779 
items on our punch list so i have to
come<00:00:54.870> up<00:00:54.929> with<00:00:55.019> a<00:00:55.199> solution<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:56.340> instead<00:00:56.699> of

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
come up with a solution and instead of

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.930 
come up with a solution and instead of
purchasing<00:00:57.510> an<00:00:57.690> entire<00:00:58.019> new<00:00:58.350> kit<00:00:59.070> just<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.760> get

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
purchasing an entire new kit just to get

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.529 
purchasing an entire new kit just to get
grommets<00:01:00.510> i'm<00:01:01.079> going<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.800> make<00:01:02.100> one<00:01:02.399> i<00:01:03.000> have

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
grommets i'm going to make one i have

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.870 
grommets i'm going to make one i have
here<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.899> just<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.199> circle<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.949> think<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:05.610> two

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
here is just a circle I think it's two

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.670 
here is just a circle I think it's two
to<00:01:06.090> seven<00:01:06.420> eight<00:01:06.690> you<00:01:07.200> have<00:01:07.320> two<00:01:07.530> and

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
to seven eight you have two and

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.800 
to seven eight you have two and
seven-eighths<00:01:08.100> diameter<00:01:08.730> so<00:01:09.390> what<00:01:09.540> I'm<00:01:09.630> going

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
seven-eighths diameter so what I'm going

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.560 
seven-eighths diameter so what I'm going
to<00:01:09.900> do<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.260> create<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.680> slot<00:01:13.159> and<00:01:14.159> then<00:01:14.570> print

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
to do is create a slot and then print

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.179 
to do is create a slot and then print
two<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.990> them<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:17.420> you'll<00:01:18.420> see<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:19.740> when<00:01:20.009> we

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
two of them and you'll see that when we

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.170 
two of them and you'll see that when we
do<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.810> will<00:01:21.810> actually<00:01:22.020> be<00:01:22.470> creating<00:01:23.009> a

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
do this will actually be creating a

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.350 
do this will actually be creating a
grommet<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.540> we<00:01:24.689> can<00:01:24.930> use<00:01:25.430> to<00:01:26.430> seal<00:01:26.970> up<00:01:27.180> this

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
grommet that we can use to seal up this

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.770 
grommet that we can use to seal up this
whole<00:01:28.159> okay<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.220> that's<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.640> center<00:01:30.030> line<00:01:30.240> so

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
whole okay so that's the center line so

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.649 
whole okay so that's the center line so
I<00:01:31.079> want<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.770> come<00:01:32.040> back<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.670> quarter<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.270> an<00:01:33.479> inch

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
I want to come back a quarter of an inch

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.450 
I want to come back a quarter of an inch
and<00:01:34.700> put<00:01:35.700> some<00:01:35.939> little<00:01:36.979> eight<00:01:37.979> inch<00:01:38.310> holes

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
and put some little eight inch holes

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.620 
and put some little eight inch holes
just<00:01:41.460> even<00:01:41.939> if<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.420> was<00:01:42.540> just<00:01:42.570> something<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.200> be

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
just even if it was just something to be

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.899 
just even if it was just something to be
able<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.780> start<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.380> screw<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:48.020> now<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.049> can<00:01:49.909> get

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
able to start a screw in now I can get

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.300 
able to start a screw in now I can get
rid<00:01:50.969> of<00:01:51.180> all<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.570> stuff<00:01:54.920> I'll<00:01:55.920> sure<00:01:56.130> what
