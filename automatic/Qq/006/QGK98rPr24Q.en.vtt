00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.430
 Hello I am both teams now want to go for them a minister without 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.369
 cooperate to prepare costing 

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:11.999
 Besides, I've had white beans in cold over here overnight 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:15.089
 Let water soak the soaking water, I'll give it again 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.499
 Law 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:20.859
 and then put the beans 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:24.099
 you understand with dad fresh water 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.890
 This is 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.060
 two Brugger leaves 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.530
 a nice piece 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.260
 almost a whole knob hole role 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.830
 the whole tuber well I'm doing something like that and thank you »branches draw 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.560
 for later on that is certainly to 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.740
 a good shot of olive oil 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.320
 the lid on it 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.750
 and let everything boil up once it is cooked, namely the 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.490
 Way down to side reduce the heat and that all in even 90 minutes 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.300
 nice to cook soft 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.210
 fit for the Witten 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.280
 as the mind would otherwise 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.410
 moreover, it will happen 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.410
 Clothes slip 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.470
 finely chopped rosemary and chili pepper 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.950
 short term easy 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.950
 with one are sprinkling these sugars 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.110
 Hamburg ots primary schools 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.790
 and then with a small sip 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.790
 but they are already 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.150
 and the whole thing already 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.740
 White wine 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.740
 and pour in a little water 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.399
 that's all I have now 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.759
 and even simmer open for 30 to 40 minutes so the water almost has to 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.759
 completely a reduced and the Quince Foster case 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.270
 my Munich is already so far and I have 15 minutes ahead of time 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.700
 Finally salted again simply from the act 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.540
 for this reason 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.540
 otherwise she would have unnecessarily extended the cooking time 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:11.149
 Here I get the beautiful from now on 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:14.149
 the beautiful bacon piece just out I write that again 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:18.039
 fine stripes that way so ban 

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:19.939
 and then off 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:23.209
 then you need black SID in this direction 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.629
 of course I set aside 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.919
 So here again through 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:32.019
 the others too, of course 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.429
 wonderful 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:39.959
 if I pour off now by this a victory and that of the poem on and with it 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.619
 maybe the whole after 

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:44.619
 second time to you 

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:49.489
 at the second meeting here 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.489
 I have already preheated the little bit again before this duel 

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:56.229
 and the minced bacon strips 

00:02:57.229 --> 00:03:00.079
 Small cut carrots 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.959
 Riedel 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.919
 something celery 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:08.289
 and at the end 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:10.590
 by the cries for help the show was on 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.179
 have chopped finely 

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:13.729
 that is it 

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:15.349
 finally is missed 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.349
 slowly to himself 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:23.019
 now a spoonful of tomato paste to do something 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.239
 unruly 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.609
 Jena the whole actually 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:27.839
 it will also be short with 

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:31.189
 she should be tempered by the tomato something may be 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:32.359
 they also see it that way 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:35.359
 the beans 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:40.229
 So again briefly through the media 

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:43.920
 with almost the whole of the beans South 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.920
 back to the are 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:51.999
 a beautiful rosemary branch and the last lober leaf 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:58.849
 and all that is covered again now even 30 minutes again 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:01.849
 slowly several 

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:06.249
 For the last five minutes, take me to the beans again 

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:09.249
 Third place and small cut savoy cabbage 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:13.189
 Robbe Garden wants 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:14.779
 8th 

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:17.779
 from a group of men 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.199
 why the whole thing with pepper 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.520
 and again and a bit salty 

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:31.249
 he delivers again stir well 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:32.750
 under the light 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.669
 already a small herbal oil 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.669
 Here I have canceled the smooth parsley 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:41.469
 and April 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:45.009
 and all for myself 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.009
 Sixth graders fill up with olive oil 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:54.059
 eat 

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:56.740
 Topic was Hamburg ots aside 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.140
 Now we come to solve 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.309
 Antje Beyer this Italian bacon 

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:02.520
 I give that here 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.520
 again in an already slightly preheated Fonda 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:10.540
 the whole thing very crispy in a very small heat 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.270
 from Borken 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.909
 I got some of the roasted slices of bread out of the oven 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:22.880
 You can start now 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.880
 These wonderful quinces fit with something 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.129
 to refine 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:33.840
 a two tablespoons all over again hand by Meng 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:35.950
 and that the heat 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.040
 that this without stress miraculously records it again 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:43.639
 it should be with pride my 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:46.759

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.360

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.840

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.840
 Brandstätter just on top 

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:02.970
 she can already be here 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.089

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:08.039

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:10.610
 our super 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.610
 These are already so far that they can be done 

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:17.449
 Conti is like giving on the plate 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:20.449
 Here's some broth 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.270

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.710
 Ott not quite at the end 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.659
