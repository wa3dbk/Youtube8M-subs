00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.759
 bookmarks often fall out of books and 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.849
 get lost so that this does not happen 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:24.480
 need to make unusual bookmarks 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:27.119
 magnetic bookmarks start manufacturing 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.240
 Bookmarks are needed with a choice of color 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.550
 cardboard I chose yellow because 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.180
 I want my bookmark to look like 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.280
 sponge bob cut a small long 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.460
 rectangle in my case 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.160
 four and a half rectangle by 11 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.579
 centimeters then this rectangle 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.180
 bend in half inside this cardboard 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.399
 blanks should appear two small 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.870
 vinyl magnet you for sure with such 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.309
 faced it those who bend easily 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.059
 one of the unnecessary vinyl magnets 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.840
 can cut into pieces cut two 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.710
 small rectangle and fix them 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.560
 universal glue 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:15.560
 small things on the front side 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.470
 portray face spongebob eyes 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.020
 I'll draw and cut out white cardboard 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.310
 here are all the other elements draw 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.720
 pens and felt-tip pens with time 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.979
 tab from not using 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:34.520
 ruffled her need to protect the role of protection 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:37.729
 perform transparent tape stick 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.899
 it over the bookmark and cut off the excess 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:43.729
 It turned out a kind of lamination effect 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:46.909
 bright bookmark on magnets 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.130
 completed if you can't draw yes 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.610
 and in general you do not want something like that 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.590
 bookmarks can be printed on the printer 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.039
 true magnet inside all the same paste 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.039
