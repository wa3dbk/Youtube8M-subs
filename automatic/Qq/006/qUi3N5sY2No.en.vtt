00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:09.070
 hello that such friends my name is Jorge and 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.920
 you are in your channel up see review 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:16.390
 in this video I bring you one that 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:19.180
 it seemed amazing I thought it was excellent and 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:23.410
 is an application to draw your name 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.750
 it's two ideas is the entrepreneur the 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.220
 creator of photoshop of designer premier and 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.700
 of most applications 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.190
 you should know that by the majority 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:37.809
 they are very expensive this one had a price of 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:41.610
 125 pesos friends that is something that is 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:43.530
 very much and that not in another 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.750
 in another situation I do not think that it arrives 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.940
 we could pay for it good in my 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.160
 case I would not spend 125 pesos for the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.530
 application but I'm now dependent 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.050
 everyone who is this application that the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.030
 it's so amazing what makes her so 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.280
 amazing is the ability of what 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.340
 you can do as you can see we are in 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.860
 an ipod 4 and because your provider is no longer 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.350
 the most optimal to run all the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.030
 applications and right now you are 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.510
 asking for a 4s so that the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.130
 applications run perfectly and that 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.979
 that there are some that still takes you out of 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.530
 4s good what he does is the wonderful 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.190
 this application is that it is excellent 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.190
 for the drawing 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.430
 that is, you can write your name you can 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.690
 draw has five options that could 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.390
 be paint bucket 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:36.600
 what could you paint the light details 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.820
 you can paint the text you can paint what 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.690
 that is and if you do not like it you have a 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.920
 option to go back and in this way 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:49.310
 you will be able to draw perfectly 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.960
 you have four options of brushes one 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.130
 it is down 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.130
 this is the pen 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.460
 down 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.460
 Brush 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.570
 and pencil 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:09.320
 pencil pen 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.320
 down 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.870
 and the brush has a very fat rubber and 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.270
 that we can choose its size simply 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.860
 sliding your finger if you pressed it well 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.940
 that a bar appears to me and from here 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:29.210
 we can see the size of the pixel ag but 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.130
 if you are if you want to erase everything 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.590
 example you did is something like that simply 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.040
 you are going to give a double touch and how can you 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.740
 see disappears and immediately has a 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.050
 option as you have seen are 5 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.540
 you can put the opacity you know what it is 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.310
 the opacity opacity is how strong 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.310
 is going to see for example 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.840
 let's give it a little more size 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.880
 this is a 100 percent opacity 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.840
 but if it was lowered to 8 percent it goes 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:04.170
 to see well you notice the change not after that 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.420
 grays and everything more delgadito good those 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.210
 opacity in the color part te 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.800
 Five colors appear by default in the 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.010
 most applications you have a 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.230
 Defined palette but it's not got something 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.660
 very amazing apart from that we can 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.390
 select the color from here in case 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.860
 we make some combination we can 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.980
 select what is from the palette of 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:30.250
 colors we go to what is color 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.680
 next and as you can see we are going to 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.519
 appear another palette with which we can 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:41.700
 want to create amazing colors has 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:44.370
 Three types rgb hsv and the themes 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.890
 that and everyone can use it to their 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.989
 way you have an option to share by 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.810
 Email or we can share 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:55.020
 Between twitter save on reel assign 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.930
 a contract or copy the drawing 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:01.170
 you can do it you can do it that is the 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.360
 adolf right cloud synchronization but 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.610
 I'm going to give him no, because the 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.580
 description of the video I do not stay very 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:12.310
 well understood 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.310
 if that installs it was going to charge 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.940
 good that this application has more 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.490
 our application that appears that if 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.430
 you want to delete some drawing 

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:27.330
 simply the basales select 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.330
 it appears 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.040
 if you want to set some 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.030
 configurations what is your account your 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.970
 preferences everything you want 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.370
 if you want to duplicate some file for 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.530
 that this option serves if you become a 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.570
 drawing that you love that you like 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.610
 too much that you would like to modify it to 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:50.390
 see if you can improve it simply 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:54.170
 we are going to duplicate and use and you would 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:57.230
 play in this drawing that way if in 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:59.230
 case you say no failure fifth 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.510
 simply they would have to 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:06.650
 delete it and in this way you follow 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.120
 keeping your perfect drawing good by 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.490
 my part that's all about this 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.310

 I'm not aware of how much longer 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:24.770
 is going to be this price so cheap but 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:28.270
