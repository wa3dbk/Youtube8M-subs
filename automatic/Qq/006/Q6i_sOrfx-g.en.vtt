of a new copy of Minecraft and so uh so
what<00:00:19.619> I've<00:00:19.740> made<00:00:20.010> here<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:21.000> made<00:00:21.660> this<00:00:21.689> earlier

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
what I've made here I made this earlier

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.910 
what I've made here I made this earlier
today<00:00:22.439> it's<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:23.100> giant<00:00:23.960> machine<00:00:24.960> basically

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
today it's a giant machine basically

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.429 
today it's a giant machine basically
that<00:00:26.189> uh<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.849> comes<00:00:27.119> up<00:00:27.300> with<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.510> random

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
that uh that comes up with a random

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.650 
that uh that comes up with a random
number<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:29.279> generates<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.939> totally<00:00:30.420> random

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
number it generates a totally random

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.690 
number it generates a totally random
number<00:00:31.109> about<00:00:31.380> marianum<00:00:32.160> as<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.430> could<00:00:32.550> ever

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
number about marianum as you could ever

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.770 
number about marianum as you could ever
want<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.059> get<00:00:33.410> it<00:00:34.410> goes<00:00:34.590> through<00:00:34.890> binary<00:00:35.780> and

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
want to get it goes through binary and

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.650 
want to get it goes through binary and
this<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.469> right<00:00:37.739> here<00:00:38.329> converts<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.540> into

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
this this right here converts it into

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.950 
this this right here converts it into
the<00:00:40.230> decimal<00:00:40.800> system<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.879> sends<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.809> out

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
the decimal system and it sends it out

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.750 
the decimal system and it sends it out
through<00:00:43.230> these<00:00:43.410> wires<00:00:43.590> onto<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.219> display

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
through these wires onto this display

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.580 
through these wires onto this display
basically<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.360> seven<00:00:45.750> segment<00:00:46.200> display<00:00:46.559> just

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
basically a seven segment display just

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.130 
basically a seven segment display just
like<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.219> have<00:00:47.370> known<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.879> your<00:00:48.629> alarm<00:00:48.930> clock

basically you just press this button and
these<00:00:55.710> guys<00:00:55.949> down<00:00:56.160> hopping<00:00:56.879> down<00:00:57.030> here<00:00:57.449> all

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
these guys down hopping down here all

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.500 
these guys down hopping down here all
these<00:00:58.050> little<00:00:58.199> villagers<00:00:58.850> are<00:00:59.850> opening<00:01:00.359> and

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
these little villagers are opening and

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.560 
these little villagers are opening and
closing<00:01:00.570> circuits<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.879> there<00:01:02.879> we<00:01:03.000> go<00:01:03.180> we<00:01:03.420> get

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
closing circuits and there we go we get

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.740 
closing circuits and there we go we get
a<00:01:03.629> random<00:01:03.960> number<00:01:05.210> every<00:01:06.210> time<00:01:06.240> we<00:01:06.570> click

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
a random number every time we click

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.500 
a random number every time we click
we're<00:01:07.049> gonna<00:01:07.140> get<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> totally<00:01:07.799> random<00:01:08.070> number

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.000 

and<00:01:13.430> 27<00:01:15.290> can't<00:01:16.290> figure<00:01:16.440> out<00:01:16.560> why<00:01:16.740> it's<00:01:16.950> a

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
and 27 can't figure out why it's a

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.450 
and 27 can't figure out why it's a
little<00:01:17.250> glitchy<00:01:18.230> the<00:01:19.230> screen<00:01:19.620> but<00:01:19.890> what<00:01:20.250> looks

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
little glitchy the screen but what looks

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.580 
little glitchy the screen but what looks
like<00:01:20.610> it's<00:01:20.790> really<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.210> doing<00:01:21.510> some<00:01:22.170> super

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
like it's really in doing some super

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.180 
like it's really in doing some super
duper<00:01:22.620> processing<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.700> there<00:01:24.230> and<00:01:25.230> by<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:25.980> way

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
duper processing in there and by the way

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.100 
duper processing in there and by the way
we're<00:01:26.370> going<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.550> be<00:01:26.760> live<00:01:27.450> streaming<00:01:27.960> the
