with<00:00:14.580> me<00:00:14.790> is<00:00:15.089> Justin<00:00:15.990> we're<00:00:16.650> going<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.830> talk

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
with me is Justin we're going to talk

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.310 
with me is Justin we're going to talk
about<00:00:17.070> air<00:00:17.340> masses<00:00:17.550> today

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.730 

air<00:00:21.100> mass<00:00:21.400> is<00:00:21.699> a<00:00:21.760> large<00:00:22.150> body<00:00:22.449> of<00:00:22.660> air<00:00:22.990> with

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
air mass is a large body of air with

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.310 
air mass is a large body of air with
fairly<00:00:24.100> uniform<00:00:24.670> temperature<00:00:25.210> and<00:00:25.450> moisture

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
fairly uniform temperature and moisture

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.249 
fairly uniform temperature and moisture
and<00:00:26.920> the<00:00:26.949> source<00:00:27.880> region<00:00:28.029> is<00:00:28.540> the<00:00:28.720> area<00:00:28.930> where

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:29.259 
and the source region is the area where

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.470 
and the source region is the area where
the<00:00:29.320> air<00:00:29.650> mass<00:00:29.890> picks<00:00:30.279> up<00:00:30.460> its<00:00:30.640> properties<00:00:31.180> and

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
the air mass picks up its properties and

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.819 
the air mass picks up its properties and
these<00:00:32.349> four<00:00:32.619> properties<00:00:33.070> are<00:00:33.489> maritime

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
these four properties are maritime

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.850 
these four properties are maritime
continental<00:00:35.829> tropical<00:00:36.790> and<00:00:37.090> polar<00:00:37.120> so<00:00:37.960> if<00:00:38.590> an

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
continental tropical and polar so if an

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.430 
continental tropical and polar so if an
air<00:00:39.070> mass<00:00:39.309> is<00:00:39.610> coming<00:00:39.910> from<00:00:40.059> the<00:00:40.269> north<00:00:40.570> it'll

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
air mass is coming from the north it'll

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.240 
air mass is coming from the north it'll
be<00:00:41.620> cold<00:00:41.980> so<00:00:42.640> it'll<00:00:42.820> be<00:00:42.850> a<00:00:42.970> polar<00:00:43.449> region<00:00:44.350> if

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
be cold so it'll be a polar region if

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.850 
be cold so it'll be a polar region if
the<00:00:46.239> air<00:00:46.390> mass<00:00:46.629> is<00:00:46.839> coming<00:00:47.230> closer<00:00:47.500> to<00:00:47.769> the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
the air mass is coming closer to the

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.560 
the air mass is coming closer to the
equator<00:00:48.330> it'll<00:00:49.330> be<00:00:49.510> tropical<00:00:50.370> region<00:00:51.570> aside

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
equator it'll be tropical region aside

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.069 
equator it'll be tropical region aside
from<00:00:52.809> the<00:00:52.989> tropical<00:00:53.469> and<00:00:53.649> polar<00:00:53.680> we<00:00:54.190> also<00:00:54.370> have

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
from the tropical and polar we also have

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.350 
from the tropical and polar we also have
continental<00:00:56.079> and<00:00:56.350> maritime<00:00:57.360> continental

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
continental and maritime continental

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.869 
continental and maritime continental
will<00:00:58.930> be<00:00:59.190> over<00:01:00.190> the<00:01:00.820> land<00:01:01.120> and<00:01:01.449> maritime<00:01:02.879> will

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
will be over the land and maritime will

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.490 
will be over the land and maritime will
be<00:01:04.030> an<00:01:04.119> Airbus<00:01:04.710> over<00:01:05.710> the<00:01:06.190> water<00:01:06.720> not<00:01:07.720> only<00:01:08.080> are

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
be an Airbus over the water not only are

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.290 
be an Airbus over the water not only are
there<00:01:08.710> the<00:01:08.740> Ford<00:01:09.070> properties<00:01:09.640> but<00:01:09.910> for<00:01:10.210> it<00:01:10.240> to

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
there the Ford properties but for it to

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.480 
there the Ford properties but for it to
be<00:01:10.509> an<00:01:10.600> air<00:01:10.750> mass<00:01:11.020> it<00:01:11.380> needs<00:01:11.590> temperature<00:01:12.220> and

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
be an air mass it needs temperature and

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.770 
be an air mass it needs temperature and
moisture<00:01:13.360> so<00:01:14.289> if<00:01:14.590> an<00:01:15.130> air<00:01:15.340> mass<00:01:15.670> is<00:01:16.000> over<00:01:16.450> the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
moisture so if an air mass is over the

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.950 
moisture so if an air mass is over the
ocean<00:01:17.289> and<00:01:17.530> it's<00:01:18.130> north<00:01:18.520> so<00:01:18.729> it's<00:01:18.880> cold<00:01:19.300> it

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
ocean and it's north so it's cold it

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.780 
ocean and it's north so it's cold it
will<00:01:20.440> be<00:01:20.619> maritime<00:01:21.490> polar<00:01:22.500> but<00:01:23.500> if<00:01:23.950> it's<00:01:24.549> still

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
will be maritime polar but if it's still

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.840 
will be maritime polar but if it's still
up<00:01:24.970> north<00:01:25.240> yet<00:01:26.020> it's<00:01:26.290> over<00:01:26.710> land<00:01:27.040> it<00:01:27.430> will<00:01:27.490> be

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
up north yet it's over land it will be

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.359 
up north yet it's over land it will be
there<00:01:28.659> polar<00:01:29.490> continental<00:01:31.200> then<00:01:32.200> if<00:01:33.159> we

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
there polar continental then if we

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:36.719 
there polar continental then if we
continue<00:01:33.850> down<00:01:34.380> or<00:01:35.380> over<00:01:35.799> the<00:01:35.890> ocean<00:01:36.369> it's

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
continue down or over the ocean it's

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.530 
continue down or over the ocean it's
tropical<00:01:37.259> it'll<00:01:38.259> be<00:01:38.409> tropical<00:01:39.210> maritime<00:01:40.210> air

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
tropical it'll be tropical maritime air

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.440 
tropical it'll be tropical maritime air
mass<00:01:40.780> now<00:01:41.740> we<00:01:41.799> keep<00:01:42.189> on<00:01:42.340> moving<00:01:43.470> stay<00:01:44.470> tropical

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
mass now we keep on moving stay tropical

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.560 
mass now we keep on moving stay tropical
but<00:01:46.450> it<00:01:46.570> will<00:01:46.689> be<00:01:46.720> over<00:01:46.990> land<00:01:47.380> so<00:01:47.710> it<00:01:47.860> will<00:01:47.950> be

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
but it will be over land so it will be

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.560 
but it will be over land so it will be
continental<00:01:49.570> as<00:01:50.290> well<00:01:50.880> modification<00:01:51.880> is<00:01:52.180> when

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
continental as well modification is when

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.870 
continental as well modification is when
an<00:01:52.720> air<00:01:52.960> mass<00:01:53.229> moves<00:01:53.590> over<00:01:53.920> a<00:01:53.950> new<00:01:54.159> region<00:01:54.430> and

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
an air mass moves over a new region and

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.969 
an air mass moves over a new region and
it<00:01:55.390> begins<00:01:55.509> to<00:01:55.840> take<00:01:56.079> on<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.350> properties<00:01:56.829> of

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
it begins to take on the properties of

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.050 
it begins to take on the properties of
that<00:01:57.340> new<00:01:57.549> region<00:01:58.000> all<00:01:58.990> right<00:01:59.350> so<00:02:00.189> we<00:02:00.820> have<00:02:00.939> an

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
that new region all right so we have an

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.680 
that new region all right so we have an
air<00:02:01.210> mass<00:02:01.479> that<00:02:01.720> is<00:02:01.869> very

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
air mass that is very

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.610 
air mass that is very
polar<00:02:02.960> over<00:02:03.890> in<00:02:04.190> the<00:02:04.370> Northwest<00:02:04.850> region<00:02:05.620> so

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
polar over in the Northwest region so

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.580 
polar over in the Northwest region so
due<00:02:06.920> to<00:02:06.980> modification<00:02:07.760> the<00:02:08.479> air<00:02:08.990> mass<00:02:09.320> is

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
due to modification the air mass is

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.850 
due to modification the air mass is
going<00:02:09.800> to<00:02:09.860> want<00:02:10.010> to<00:02:10.130> take<00:02:10.340> up<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:11.650> regions<00:02:12.650> of

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
going to want to take up the regions of

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.380 
going to want to take up the regions of
temperature<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:13.610> moisture<00:02:13.730> that<00:02:14.060> it<00:02:14.210> goes

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
temperature and moisture that it goes

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.050 
temperature and moisture that it goes
over<00:02:14.600> so<00:02:15.530> as<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:16.280> center<00:02:16.490> of<00:02:16.520> mass<00:02:16.640> is<00:02:16.700> moving

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
over so as the center of mass is moving

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.110 
over so as the center of mass is moving
along<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:17.840> it<00:02:18.620> comes<00:02:19.040> over<00:02:19.370> Landon's<00:02:19.910> no

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
along and it comes over Landon's no

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.110 
along and it comes over Landon's no
longer<00:02:20.480> over<00:02:20.960> the<00:02:21.110> ocean<00:02:21.620> it<00:02:21.890> is<00:02:22.850> going<00:02:23.060> to

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
longer over the ocean it is going to

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.900 
longer over the ocean it is going to
change<00:02:23.420> from<00:02:23.930> maritime<00:02:24.650> polar<00:02:25.040> to

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
change from maritime polar to

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.110 
change from maritime polar to
continental<00:02:26.630> polar<00:02:26.950> so<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:28.250> continue<00:02:28.790> to

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
continental polar so to continue to

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.600 
continental polar so to continue to
describe<00:02:29.800> modification<00:02:30.800> will<00:02:31.130> take<00:02:31.340> an<00:02:31.460> air

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
describe modification will take an air

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.800 
describe modification will take an air
mass<00:02:31.880> that<00:02:32.180> is<00:02:32.660> tropical<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:34.810> tropical

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
mass that is tropical and tropical

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.800 
mass that is tropical and tropical
continental<00:02:36.800> so<00:02:37.190> this<00:02:37.550> tropical<00:02:38.060> continental

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
continental so this tropical continental

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.340 
continental so this tropical continental
air<00:02:39.140> mass<00:02:39.560> as<00:02:39.920> it<00:02:40.640> moves<00:02:40.970> along<00:02:41.240> goes<00:02:41.840> over<00:02:42.230> the

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
air mass as it moves along goes over the

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.790 
air mass as it moves along goes over the
Gulf<00:02:42.620> it<00:02:43.400> will<00:02:43.700> change<00:02:44.200> to<00:02:45.280> tropical<00:02:46.280> maritime

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
Gulf it will change to tropical maritime

00:02:47.800 --> 00:03:05.960 
Gulf it will change to tropical maritime
and<00:02:49.420> thanks<00:02:50.420> for<00:02:50.570> joining<00:02:50.600> us<00:02:51.020> at<00:02:51.200> Utah

okay<00:03:10.459> so<00:03:11.030> if<00:03:11.209> an<00:03:11.360> air<00:03:11.540> mass<00:03:11.780> is<00:03:12.050> over<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.440> polar

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
okay so if an air mass is over the polar

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:19.410 
okay so if an air mass is over the polar
region<00:03:14.270> and<00:03:14.630> we<00:03:14.900> have<00:03:15.020> north<00:03:15.440> near<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.830> poles

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:26.229 

now<00:03:20.420> start<00:03:20.890> now<00:03:21.890> start<00:03:24.459> well<00:03:25.459> I<00:03:25.490> 30<00:03:25.760> say<00:03:26.030> ready
