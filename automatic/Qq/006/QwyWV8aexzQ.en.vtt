early stages as you see the leaves are

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.790 
early stages as you see the leaves are
starting<00:00:34.370> to<00:00:34.460> curl<00:00:35.170> but<00:00:36.170> I<00:00:36.200> don't<00:00:36.470> see<00:00:36.590> any<00:00:36.710> the

powdery mildew on the surface of the

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:39.850 
powdery mildew on the surface of the
leaf<00:00:38.450> so<00:00:38.630> it's<00:00:38.750> very<00:00:38.930> early<00:00:39.170> isn't<00:00:39.440> it<00:00:39.620> that's

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
leaf so it's very early isn't it that's

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.650 
leaf so it's very early isn't it that's
true<00:00:40.190> but<00:00:40.520> what<00:00:40.640> you're<00:00:40.820> seeing<00:00:41.030> is<00:00:41.239> the<00:00:41.360> front

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
side if you turn the leaf over you can

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.250 
side if you turn the leaf over you can
see<00:00:43.760> the<00:00:43.910> beginnings<00:00:44.450> of<00:00:44.690> that<00:00:44.899> powdery

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260

see the beginnings of that powdery
mildew<00:00:45.649> see<00:00:45.860> here<00:00:47.920> that's<00:00:48.920> correct<00:00:50.770> as<00:00:51.770> the

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
mildew see here that's correct as the

powdery mildew progresses it tends to

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.790 
powdery mildew progresses it tends to
make<00:00:55.399> the<00:00:55.579> leaves<00:00:55.790> turn<00:00:56.239> brown<00:00:56.570> and<00:00:56.930> shrivel

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
make the leaves turn brown and shrivel

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.500 
make the leaves turn brown and shrivel
as<00:00:57.950> you<00:00:58.219> can<00:00:58.430> see<00:00:58.640> here<00:01:00.790> this<00:01:01.790> is<00:01:01.850> what<00:01:02.149> pottery

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.419 
it sure is as you can see this leaf is
brown<00:01:46.669> on<00:01:47.149> the<00:01:47.270> tips<00:01:47.569> and<00:01:47.840> green<00:01:48.289> in<00:01:48.590> the

brown on the tips and green in the
center<00:01:49.819> that's<00:01:50.569> a<00:01:50.719> key<00:01:51.259> factor<00:01:52.009> that<00:01:52.249> shows

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
center that's a key factor that shows

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.889 
center that's a key factor that shows
you<00:01:52.669> this<00:01:52.849> is<00:01:52.939> what<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.240> real<00:01:53.389> problem<00:01:53.869> here

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
you this is what the real problem here

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.080 
you this is what the real problem here
is<00:01:54.259> this<00:01:54.439> this<00:01:54.919> plant<00:01:55.310> is<00:01:55.549> not<00:01:55.759> getting

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
is this this plant is not getting

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.050 
is this this plant is not getting
sufficient<00:01:56.299> water<00:01:56.749> and<00:01:57.499> then<00:01:58.009> heat<00:01:58.789> just

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
sufficient water and then heat just

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.429 
sufficient water and then heat just
really<00:01:59.450> aggravates<00:01:59.959> that<00:02:00.169> that's<00:02:00.409> correct

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
really aggravates that that's correct

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.570 
really aggravates that that's correct
well<00:02:03.439> this<00:02:03.590> plant<00:02:03.830> looks<00:02:04.009> like<00:02:04.159> is<00:02:04.280> in<00:02:04.400> really

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
well this plant looks like is in really

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.980 
well this plant looks like is in really
bad<00:02:04.700> shape<00:02:04.909> what<00:02:05.360> happened<00:02:05.659> here

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
bad shape what happened here

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.899 
bad shape what happened here
you're<00:02:06.500> right<00:02:06.710> Curtis<00:02:07.070> this<00:02:07.310> is<00:02:07.369> an<00:02:07.580> example

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
you're right Curtis this is an example

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.479 
you're right Curtis this is an example
of<00:02:08.179> what<00:02:08.420> happens<00:02:08.810> when<00:02:09.080> we<00:02:10.009> have<00:02:10.160> late

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
of what happens when we have late

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.750 
of what happens when we have late
freezes<00:02:10.910> in<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.420> springtime<00:02:12.280> this<00:02:13.280> rose<00:02:13.520> was

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
freezes in the springtime this rose was

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.330 
freezes in the springtime this rose was
badly<00:02:14.030> damaged<00:02:14.690> in<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.110> spring<00:02:15.440> and<00:02:15.800> has

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
badly damaged in the spring and has

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.520 
badly damaged in the spring and has
managed<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.910> hang<00:02:17.239> on<00:02:17.540> throughout<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.290> summer

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
managed to hang on throughout the summer

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.590 
managed to hang on throughout the summer
however<00:02:18.830> it<00:02:19.220> is<00:02:19.370> now<00:02:19.550> giving<00:02:19.940> up<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.180> ghost

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
however it is now giving up the ghost

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.350 
however it is now giving up the ghost
see<00:02:20.720> how<00:02:20.840> it's<00:02:20.989> beginning<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.410> shrivel<00:02:21.739> yes<00:02:22.360> if

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
see how it's beginning to shrivel yes if

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.059 
see how it's beginning to shrivel yes if
you<00:02:23.540> left<00:02:23.750> it<00:02:23.870> here<00:02:24.020> just<00:02:24.260> be<00:02:24.380> a<00:02:24.410> stick<00:02:24.860> by

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
you left it here just be a stick by

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.830 
you left it here just be a stick by
spring<00:02:25.459> that's<00:02:25.730> absolutely<00:02:26.270> right<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:26.540> it

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
spring that's absolutely right and it

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.110 
spring that's absolutely right and it
will<00:02:27.020> have<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.260> be<00:02:27.410> dug<00:02:27.680> out<00:02:27.830> so<00:02:28.610> it's<00:02:28.760> a<00:02:29.000> good

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
will have to be dug out so it's a good

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.100 
will have to be dug out so it's a good
example<00:02:29.239> of<00:02:29.510> what<00:02:29.630> needs<00:02:29.810> to<00:02:29.840> be<00:02:29.930> replaced

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
example of what needs to be replaced

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.210 
example of what needs to be replaced
that<00:02:30.500> is<00:02:30.709> correct

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
that is correct
