00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
basic steps the first step you're going

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.980 
basic steps the first step you're going
to<00:00:13.710> start<00:00:13.980> with<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:15.210> have<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.420> piece<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.839> wood

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
to start with is to have a piece of wood

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.140 
to start with is to have a piece of wood
this<00:00:16.139> wood<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:17.220> comes<00:00:17.699> from<00:00:17.880> Stuart

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
this wood is a comes from Stuart

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.210 
this wood is a comes from Stuart
McDonald<00:00:18.690> that's<00:00:18.869> for<00:00:19.080> making<00:00:19.289> glue<00:00:19.680> in<00:00:19.859> necks

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
McDonald that's for making glue in necks

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.040 
McDonald that's for making glue in necks
I<00:00:20.550> think<00:00:21.539> it's<00:00:22.519> like<00:00:23.519> three<00:00:24.119> by<00:00:24.480> two<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.019> a

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
I think it's like three by two and a

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.620 
I think it's like three by two and a
half<00:00:25.230> something<00:00:25.800> like<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:27.180> want<00:00:27.390> to

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
half something like that you want to

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.419 
half something like that you want to
first<00:00:27.960> run<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.320> on<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.529> jointer<00:00:28.830> make<00:00:29.250> sure

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
first run it on the jointer make sure

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.490 
first run it on the jointer make sure
all<00:00:29.609> four<00:00:29.640> sides<00:00:30.179> are<00:00:30.359> perfectly<00:00:30.689> flat<00:00:31.140> and

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
have the flat fingerboard that we talked

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.830 
have the flat fingerboard that we talked
about<00:00:38.010> before<00:00:38.390> first<00:00:39.390> thing<00:00:39.540> you're<00:00:39.690> going<00:00:39.780> to

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
about before first thing you're going to

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
do with it is use the side cutting

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.760 
do with it is use the side cutting
template<00:00:41.969> you'll<00:00:42.809> put<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.140> template<00:00:43.590> onto

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
template you'll put this template onto

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.250 
template you'll put this template onto
the<00:00:44.040> wood<00:00:44.219> you'll<00:00:44.879> mark<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.600> you'll<00:00:45.989> cut

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
the wood you'll mark it and you'll cut

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.319 
the wood you'll mark it and you'll cut
this<00:00:46.410> out<00:00:46.590> on<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.890> bandsaw<00:00:47.370> just<00:00:47.910> like<00:00:48.059> this

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
this out on the bandsaw just like this

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.940 
this out on the bandsaw just like this
don't<00:00:49.079> do<00:00:49.170> anything<00:00:49.440> else

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
don't do anything else

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.740 
don't do anything else
don't<00:00:50.610> cut<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.879> out<00:00:51.000> from<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.270> top<00:00:51.300> yet

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
don't cut it out from the top yet

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.380 
don't cut it out from the top yet
because<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.559> next<00:00:52.890> step<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.969> route<00:00:54.149> the

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
because the next step is to route the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.330 
because the next step is to route the
truss<00:00:54.690> rod<00:00:54.809> channel<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.770> you're<00:00:56.160> going<00:00:56.280> to

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
truss rod channel in it you're going to

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.860 
truss rod channel in it you're going to
use<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.699> little<00:00:56.850> router<00:00:57.180> table<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
use the little router table in the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.720 
use the little router table in the
dremel<00:00:58.199> tool<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:59.070> we<00:00:59.190> showed<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.699> earlier

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
dremel tool that we showed you earlier

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.810 
dremel tool that we showed you earlier
and<00:01:00.590> this<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.920> show<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.609> what<00:01:02.789> a

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
and this is to show you this is what a

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.929 
and this is to show you this is what a
router<00:01:03.589> will<00:01:04.589> do<00:01:04.799> with<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.159> appropriate<00:01:05.670> bit

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
router will do with the appropriate bit

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.000 
router will do with the appropriate bit
you'll<00:01:06.420> route<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.080> entire<00:01:07.380> length<00:01:07.710> of

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
you'll route this the entire length of

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.410 
you'll route this the entire length of
this<00:01:08.729> neck<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.570> you've<00:01:09.750> cut<00:01:10.020> out<00:01:11.420> except

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
this neck that you've cut out except

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.590 
this neck that you've cut out except
you'll<00:01:12.600> stop<00:01:13.130> approximately<00:01:14.130> here<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:15.479> is

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
you'll stop approximately here this is

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.929 
you'll stop approximately here this is
where<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.840> end<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.200> truss<00:01:16.439> rod<00:01:16.560> will<00:01:16.799> be

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
where the end of the truss rod will be

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:22.240 
where the end of the truss rod will be
and<00:01:18.680> once<00:01:19.680> you've<00:01:19.860> done<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.810> you<00:01:21.810> can<00:01:21.840> then

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
and once you've done that you can then

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.030 
and once you've done that you can then

place this template on the top of the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.100 
place this template on the top of the
wood<00:01:26.220> which<00:01:27.090> will<00:01:27.270> be<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.479> piece<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.930> have

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
wood which will be the piece you have

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.310 
wood which will be the piece you have
cut<00:01:28.350> out<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:29.060> trace<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.509> then<00:01:30.930> cut<00:01:31.170> this

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
cut out and trace it and then cut this

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.560 
cut out and trace it and then cut this
out<00:01:31.500> as<00:01:31.680> well<00:01:31.829> now<00:01:32.220> if<00:01:32.369> you'll<00:01:32.549> notice<00:01:32.610> when
