didn't<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.960> didn't<00:01:28.200> train<00:01:28.350> him<00:01:28.380> as<00:01:28.530> much<00:01:28.680> Jade

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
didn't you didn't train him as much Jade

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.740 
didn't you didn't train him as much Jade
one<00:01:29.430> day<00:01:29.579> before<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.000> introduction<00:01:30.299> masters

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
one day before the introduction masters

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.200 
one day before the introduction masters
and<00:01:30.930> then<00:01:31.320> like<00:01:31.530> two<00:01:31.770> days<00:01:31.920> after<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.610> actually

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
and then like two days after so actually

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.149 
and then like two days after so actually
we<00:01:33.270> haven't<00:01:33.390> trained<00:01:33.689> much<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.710> we<00:01:34.860> had<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.979> lot

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
we haven't trained much so we had a lot

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.880 
we haven't trained much so we had a lot
of<00:01:35.189> theories<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.450> electrical<00:01:37.140> thinking<00:01:37.470> like

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
of theories to electrical thinking like

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.160 
of theories to electrical thinking like
what<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.159> good<00:01:38.369> he<00:01:38.520> saw<00:01:38.670> what's<00:01:38.880> coming<00:01:39.390> like

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
what is good he saw what's coming like

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.569 
what is good he saw what's coming like
the<00:01:40.290> Cossacks<00:01:40.650> kind<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.950> surprising<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.460> he

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
the Cossacks kind of surprising that he

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.819 
the Cossacks kind of surprising that he
didn't<00:01:41.820> get<00:01:41.880> picked<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.180> chess<00:01:42.329> game<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.840> then

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
didn't get picked a chess game and then

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.940 
didn't get picked a chess game and then
just<00:01:44.520> did<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.329> solution<00:01:45.810> yeah<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.770> came

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
just did a solution yeah and you came

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.170 
just did a solution yeah and you came
into<00:01:47.159> this<00:01:47.280> match<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.850> was<00:01:47.970> very

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
happening in your

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.070 
happening in your
you<00:02:09.460> know<00:02:09.550> how<00:02:09.850> you<00:02:09.910> play<00:02:10.150> this<00:02:10.240> out<00:02:10.390> okay<00:02:11.020> so

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
you know how you play this out okay so

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.200 
you know how you play this out okay so
we<00:02:11.500> saw<00:02:11.890> that<00:02:12.010> they<00:02:12.160> are<00:02:12.220> split<00:02:12.520> on<00:02:12.550> two<00:02:13.030> sides

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
we saw that they are split on two sides

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.690 
we saw that they are split on two sides
pretty<00:02:13.720> much<00:02:13.840> from<00:02:14.050> our<00:02:14.260> fund<00:02:14.560> FL<00:02:15.190> of<00:02:15.310> movement

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
pretty much from our fund FL of movement

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.890 
pretty much from our fund FL of movement
speed<00:02:15.850> so<00:02:16.000> we<00:02:16.030> have<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.270> decide<00:02:16.450> on<00:02:16.510> which<00:02:16.690> side

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
speed so we have to decide on which side

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.570 
speed so we have to decide on which side
we<00:02:17.050> get<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.320> see<00:02:17.470> it's<00:02:17.830> at<00:02:17.980> one<00:02:18.130> point<00:02:18.250> we<00:02:18.430> see

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
we get to see it's at one point we see

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.070 
we get to see it's at one point we see
here<00:02:18.760> jinx<00:02:19.150> is<00:02:19.210> all<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:19.330> position<00:02:19.690> be<00:02:19.750> chasing

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
here jinx is all the position be chasing

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.930 
here jinx is all the position be chasing
her<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.380> then<00:02:20.980> we<00:02:21.160> all<00:02:21.280> could<00:02:21.430> put<00:02:21.610> a<00:02:21.640> left<00:02:21.820> at

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
her and then we all could put a left at

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.340 
her and then we all could put a left at
then<00:02:22.090> we<00:02:22.180> see<00:02:22.300> the<00:02:22.360> Karma<00:02:22.690> we<00:02:22.810> go<00:02:22.930> further<00:02:23.080> and

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
then we see the Karma we go further and

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.080 
then we see the Karma we go further and
then<00:02:23.890> I<00:02:24.070> tried<00:02:24.310> to<00:02:24.460> split<00:02:24.670> them<00:02:24.820> up<00:02:24.910> with

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
then I tried to split them up with

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.190 
then I tried to split them up with
devotee<00:02:25.360> of<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.510> back<00:02:25.690> and<00:02:25.810> then<00:02:25.930> I<00:02:25.990> hit<00:02:26.110> the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
devotee of the back and then I hit the

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.410 
devotee of the back and then I hit the
yeah<00:02:27.040> so<00:02:27.160> as<00:02:27.250> well<00:02:27.460> we<00:02:27.640> focused<00:02:27.940> yeah<00:02:28.060> so<00:02:28.210> here

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
yeah so as well we focused yeah so here

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.850 
yeah so as well we focused yeah so here
then<00:02:28.960> pretty<00:02:29.140> much<00:02:29.200> you<00:02:29.350> have<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.470> just<00:02:29.680> clean

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
then pretty much you have to just clean

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.230 
then pretty much you have to just clean
up<00:02:29.950> rotate<00:02:30.310> foot<00:02:30.520> split<00:02:30.730> all<00:02:30.880> over<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.120> map

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
up rotate foot split all over the map

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.060 
up rotate foot split all over the map
and<00:02:31.480> we<00:02:31.810> are<00:02:31.930> really<00:02:32.320> strong<00:02:32.650> chick<00:02:32.860> fights

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
and we are really strong chick fights

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.010 
and we are really strong chick fights
and<00:02:33.460> they<00:02:33.850> try<00:02:34.000> to<00:02:34.060> chase<00:02:34.330> us<00:02:34.510> in<00:02:34.660> about<00:02:34.840> the

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
and they try to chase us in about the

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.540 
and they try to chase us in about the
can<00:02:35.260> be<00:02:35.380> killed<00:02:35.680> at<00:02:35.770> any<00:02:35.860> one<00:02:36.070> of<00:02:36.100> us<00:02:36.250> when<00:02:36.430> we

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
can be killed at any one of us when we

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.490 
can be killed at any one of us when we
go<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.670> track<00:02:37.270> and<00:02:37.540> inertia<00:02:37.960> of<00:02:38.110> this<00:02:38.260> world

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500

go to track and inertia of this world

is<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:48.690> benefit<00:02:49.690> line<00:02:49.870> I<00:02:50.610> think<00:02:51.610> that<00:02:51.640> no

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
is the benefit line I think that no

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.430 
is the benefit line I think that no

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
severe for better laning phase but we

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.440 
severe for better laning phase but we
actually<00:03:21.070> fought<00:03:21.370> back<00:03:21.520> to<00:03:21.610> civil<00:03:21.880> 14<00:03:22.239> fights

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450
