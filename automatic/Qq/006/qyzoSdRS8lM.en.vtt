so<00:00:07.890> this<00:00:08.189> is<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.400> 32<00:00:09.650> oval<00:00:10.650> chiming<00:00:11.130> we<00:00:11.849> also

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
so this is a 32 oval chiming we also

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.950 
so this is a 32 oval chiming we also
have<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.780> 34<00:00:13.769> version<00:00:14.219> it<00:00:14.519> has<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.240> narrow<00:00:15.630> white

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
have a 34 version it has a narrow white

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.310 
have a 34 version it has a narrow white
profiles<00:00:16.670> that<00:00:17.670> narrow<00:00:18.000> eye<00:00:18.090> profiles<00:00:18.720> are<00:00:18.990> a

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
profiles that narrow eye profiles are a

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.560 
profiles that narrow eye profiles are a
trickle<00:00:20.220> down<00:00:20.250> from<00:00:20.460> our<00:00:21.119> state-of-the-art

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
trickle down from our state-of-the-art

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.470 
trickle down from our state-of-the-art
absolute<00:00:22.500> black<00:00:23.359> technology<00:00:24.949> we<00:00:25.949> use<00:00:26.480> best

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
absolute black technology we use best

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.349 
absolute black technology we use best
materials<00:00:28.109> on<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.439> market<00:00:28.470> right<00:00:29.010> now<00:00:29.359> which

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
materials on the market right now which

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.930 
materials on the market right now which
is<00:00:30.390> aluminium<00:00:30.890> 7075<00:00:31.890> with<00:00:32.219> our<00:00:32.369> special

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
is aluminium 7075 with our special

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.900 
is aluminium 7075 with our special
treatment<00:00:33.420> just<00:00:34.020> for<00:00:34.230> us<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:35.070> why<00:00:35.250> do<00:00:35.309> shape

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
treatment just for us so why do shape

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.889 
treatment just for us so why do shape
humans<00:00:36.690> are<00:00:36.960> basically<00:00:37.680> not<00:00:38.160> machines<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:39.239> we

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
humans are basically not machines so we

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.750 
humans are basically not machines so we
cannot<00:00:40.230> paddle<00:00:40.829> full<00:00:41.100> circles

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
cannot paddle full circles

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.619 
cannot paddle full circles
I<00:00:41.940> mean<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:43.469> crank<00:00:43.770> rotates<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.969> circle<00:00:45.420> yes

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
I mean the crank rotates in a circle yes

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:46.490 
I mean the crank rotates in a circle yes
that's<00:00:45.930> correct

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
that's correct

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.310 
that's correct
but<00:00:47.190> if<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.670> look<00:00:47.940> at<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.329> biomechanics<00:00:48.660> of

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
but if you look at the biomechanics of

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.549 
but if you look at the biomechanics of
the<00:00:49.770> body<00:00:49.950> we<00:00:50.730> are<00:00:50.760> able<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.480> push<00:00:51.899> your<00:00:52.199> paddle

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
the body we are able to push your paddle

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.819 
the body we are able to push your paddle
only<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.250> very<00:00:53.489> limited<00:00:54.180> area<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.530> pedal

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
only in very limited area of the pedal

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.389 
only in very limited area of the pedal
stroke<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.730> if<00:00:56.910> we<00:00:57.120> look<00:00:57.329> at<00:00:57.710> like<00:00:58.710> at<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
stroke so if we look at like at the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.760 
stroke so if we look at like at the
clock<00:00:59.699> you<00:01:00.449> are<00:01:00.600> able<00:01:00.750> only<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.260> paddle

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
clock you are able only to paddle

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.359 
clock you are able only to paddle
between<00:01:01.920> three<00:01:02.340> o'clock<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.049> five<00:01:04.049> o'clock

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
between three o'clock and five o'clock

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.700 
between three o'clock and five o'clock
everything<00:01:05.369> else<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.270> kind<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.260> pressing

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
everything else is is kind of pressing

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.830 
everything else is is kind of pressing
on<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.890> paddle<00:01:08.280> but<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.939> don't<00:01:09.270> live<00:01:09.600> at<00:01:09.750> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
on a paddle but you don't live at the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.060 
on a paddle but you don't live at the
biggest<00:01:09.960> force<00:01:10.409> we<00:01:10.890> use<00:01:11.220> design<00:01:11.720> which<00:01:12.720> is

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
biggest force we use design which is

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.460 
biggest force we use design which is
optimized<00:01:14.070> for<00:01:14.810> more<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.020> do<00:01:16.229> riding<00:01:17.210> and<00:01:18.470> eh

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
optimized for more and do riding and eh

racing<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.060> chairing<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.630> not<00:01:21.900> as<00:01:22.080> light

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
racing that the chairing is not as light

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.670 
racing that the chairing is not as light
as<00:01:22.740> absolute<00:01:23.189> back<00:01:23.460> by<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.180> also<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:25.140> more

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
as absolute back by is also a more

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.429 
as absolute back by is also a more
robust<00:01:26.100> version<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.420> 32<00:01:27.960> chainring

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
robust version of it the 32 chainring

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.760 
robust version of it the 32 chainring
has<00:01:29.100> built-in<00:01:29.909> spaces<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.110> threads<00:01:31.500> just

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
has built-in spaces and threads just

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.920 
has built-in spaces and threads just
because<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.700> ability<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.509> chain<00:01:33.750> ring

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
because the ability of the chain ring

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.670 
because the ability of the chain ring
requires<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:36.150> 32<00:01:36.720> chain<00:01:37.200> ring<00:01:37.380> has

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
requires that it the 32 chain ring has

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.510 
requires that it the 32 chain ring has
the<00:01:38.119> quality<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.560> 34<00:01:40.560> in<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.920> biggest<00:01:41.250> sport

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
the quality of 34 in the biggest sport

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.880 
the quality of 34 in the biggest sport
and<00:01:41.700> authority<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.079> smallest<00:01:43.320> sport<00:01:43.710> and

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
and authority in the smallest sport and

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.630 
and authority in the smallest sport and
because<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:45.090> have<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.570> incorporate

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
because of that you have to incorporate

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.609 
because of that you have to incorporate
spaces<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.939> thread<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:48.509> actually<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.320> use

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
spaces and a thread so actually you use

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.330 
spaces and a thread so actually you use
a<00:01:50.270> longer<00:01:51.270> bolts<00:01:51.750> like<00:01:51.930> from<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.320> double<00:01:52.649> crank

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
a longer bolts like from a double crank

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.359 
a longer bolts like from a double crank
serve<00:01:53.670> bolts<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.750> mount<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.409> chain<00:01:55.740> ring<00:01:55.920> the

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
serve bolts to mount that chain ring the

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.590 
serve bolts to mount that chain ring the
34<00:01:57.119> oval<00:01:57.570> has<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.500> standard<00:01:59.159> holes<00:01:59.640> so<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.240> can

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
34 oval has a standard holes so you can

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.249 
34 oval has a standard holes so you can
use<00:02:00.869> single<00:02:01.530> boards<00:02:01.979> for<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.700> mount<00:02:03.259> the

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
use single boards for that to mount the

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.999 
use single boards for that to mount the
34<00:02:04.950> has<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.610> Valatie<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.380> 36<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.680> biggest

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
34 has a Valatie of 36 in the biggest

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.080 
34 has a Valatie of 36 in the biggest
point<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:09.569> 32<00:02:10.110> in<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.950> smallest<00:02:11.310> point<00:02:11.489> so

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
point and the 32 in a smallest point so

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.290 
point and the 32 in a smallest point so
all<00:02:12.330> those<00:02:12.569> two<00:02:12.810> chain

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
all those two chain

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.360 
all those two chain
use<00:02:13.950> plus<00:02:14.950> 3<00:02:15.220> minus<00:02:15.670> 2<00:02:15.910> from<00:02:16.590> nominal<00:02:17.590> nominal

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
use plus 3 minus 2 from nominal nominal

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.750 
use plus 3 minus 2 from nominal nominal
size<00:02:19.150> so<00:02:19.780> if<00:02:19.960> we<00:02:20.170> have<00:02:20.380> a<00:02:20.410> 34<00:02:21.130> you<00:02:21.790> have<00:02:22.150> 36<00:02:22.930> 32

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
size so if we have a 34 you have 36 32

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.230 
size so if we have a 34 you have 36 32
oval<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:24.940> if<00:02:25.240> you<00:02:25.420> have<00:02:25.630> a<00:02:25.660> 32<00:02:26.290> or<00:02:26.470> we<00:02:26.680> have<00:02:27.240> 34

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
oval and if you have a 32 or we have 34

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.940 
oval and if you have a 32 or we have 34
and<00:02:28.570> 30s<00:02:29.550> as<00:02:30.550> a<00:02:30.610> divided<00:02:31.390> to<00:02:31.510> shave<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:32.560> can<00:02:32.800> be

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
and 30s as a divided to shave you can be

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.360 
and 30s as a divided to shave you can be

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
quicker riding goggle not by riding

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.270 
quicker riding goggle not by riding
actually<00:02:37.000> faster<00:02:37.570> but<00:02:38.140> you<00:02:38.320> can<00:02:38.500> maintain<00:02:38.740> the

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
actually faster but you can maintain the

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.180 
actually faster but you can maintain the
same<00:02:39.310> speed<00:02:39.910> for<00:02:40.240> much<00:02:40.780> longer<00:02:41.020> so<00:02:41.470> if<00:02:41.710> we<00:02:41.950> take

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
same speed for much longer so if we take

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.590 
same speed for much longer so if we take
a<00:02:42.490> distance<00:02:43.480> from<00:02:43.660> A<00:02:43.870> to<00:02:43.930> B<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.760> measure<00:02:46.390> the

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
a distance from A to B and measure the

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.930 
a distance from A to B and measure the
time<00:02:46.840> you'll<00:02:47.620> be<00:02:47.680> quicker<00:02:48.160> with<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.580> oval

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
time you'll be quicker with the oval

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.630 
time you'll be quicker with the oval
just<00:02:49.390> because<00:02:49.780> you<00:02:50.230> are<00:02:50.680> less<00:02:50.860> side<00:02:51.160> so<00:02:51.580> you

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
just because you are less side so you

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.630 
just because you are less side so you
can<00:02:51.880> keep<00:02:52.180> exactly<00:02:52.870> same<00:02:53.080> speed<00:02:53.380> for<00:02:53.650> long<00:02:53.800> or

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
can keep exactly same speed for long or

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.540 
can keep exactly same speed for long or
for<00:02:55.330> much<00:02:55.600> longer<00:02:55.840> than<00:02:56.530> with<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:56.980> round<00:02:57.190> you

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
for much longer than with the round you

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.280 
for much longer than with the round you
always<00:02:57.760> ask<00:02:58.030> for<00:02:58.180> feedback<00:02:58.510> and<00:03:00.990> three<00:03:01.990> things

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
always ask for feedback and three things

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.010 
always ask for feedback and three things
always<00:03:02.590> came<00:03:02.980> up<00:03:03.120> I'm<00:03:04.120> surprised<00:03:04.720> it's<00:03:04.960> not

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
always came up I'm surprised it's not

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.520 
always came up I'm surprised it's not
wobbly<00:03:05.500> it<00:03:06.220> just<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:07.810> don't<00:03:07.930> believe<00:03:08.290> it's

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
wobbly it just you don't believe it's

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.660 
wobbly it just you don't believe it's
tasmad<00:03:09.220> and<00:03:09.810> second<00:03:10.810> thing<00:03:11.020> is<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.680> traction

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
tasmad and second thing is the traction

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.330 
tasmad and second thing is the traction
is<00:03:12.820> is<00:03:13.030> much<00:03:13.810> greatly<00:03:14.350> improved<00:03:14.740> on<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.190> MIDI

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
is is much greatly improved on the MIDI

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.540 
is is much greatly improved on the MIDI
appeals<00:03:15.760> and<00:03:16.050> third<00:03:17.050> thing<00:03:17.380> is<00:03:17.650> that<00:03:18.040> they

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
appeals and third thing is that they

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.280 
appeals and third thing is that they
really<00:03:19.000> feel<00:03:19.240> less<00:03:19.540> tired

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
really feel less tired

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.740 
really feel less tired
at<00:03:20.740> the<00:03:21.070> end<00:03:21.190> of<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.459> ride<00:03:21.640> we<00:03:22.300> came<00:03:22.570> with<00:03:22.720> a

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
at the end of the ride we came with a

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.430 
at the end of the ride we came with a
product<00:03:23.170> we<00:03:23.380> actually<00:03:23.980> can<00:03:24.310> deliver<00:03:24.640> a<00:03:25.440> huge

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
product we actually can deliver a huge

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.520 
product we actually can deliver a huge
benefit<00:03:26.890> with<00:03:27.850> a<00:03:27.880> fraction<00:03:28.660> of<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:28.930> cost<00:03:29.200> what

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
benefit with a fraction of the cost what

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:36.660 
benefit with a fraction of the cost what
everyone<00:03:30.040> else<00:03:31.260> advertise<00:03:32.260> right<00:03:32.500> now
