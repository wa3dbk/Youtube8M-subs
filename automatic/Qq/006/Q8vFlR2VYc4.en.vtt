00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.469
 ask jonas how about one 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.480
 video to the teaching timing quietly too 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.980
 times an opinion like that 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.720
 me very well if opinion is once 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.800
 better because you get no facts 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:26.490
 call so kambeck loading and internet 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.349
 consolidate youtube germany still 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.939
 not enough talked about how much 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.380
 there 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.210
 I'll give it to you right now 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.700
 and then maybe add mine 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.960
 opinion with 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.570
 So my opinion is that you just 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.670
 too much weight is placed on it 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.890
 through the timing of nutrients were 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.450
 how much is not really in there 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.750
 Verifiable, that gives you somewhere out in 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.039
 draws the real effective benefit 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.350
 I think it's that easy 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.670
 then you should eat to be best 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.350
 if you get the best with it 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.550
 there are people who like it 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.379
 not having breakfast at all 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.110
 There are people who want to be in the former 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.840
 Eating 1000 calories with hope 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.729
 quality and there I would the meinerser 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.930
 handle as simon gets the best 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.520
 this is of course an important point 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.000
 you should of course have to make 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.680
 how to formulate myself and I just now 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.720
 everything as you are naturally in 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.310
 strength training then in training better 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.080
 for shaping the best 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.990
 If I say I can be two hours from 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.200
 training shows me because otherwise I puke 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.759
 then it does not bring me two hours 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.900
 what to force one has so before that 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.970
 Of course, influence on mine 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.030
 performance and performance then has 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.119
 in the secondary course, of course, always cut 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.170
 of course on mine on mine 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:47.150
 training success, so to speak, then individually 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.729
 to more fabric parts it stops 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.530
 few studies compared with each other 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.850
 and then there really has 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.830
 found out that it was actually for 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.080
 the fat loss muscle build-up no big 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.180
 difference does not excuse any 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.680
 significant difference and in the 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.880
 scientific language to stay because of it 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.409
 maybe already has a difference 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.070
 but so little that you look 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.479
 really should not worry 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.450
 very short two sentences still car pack 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.150
 loading and internet festhing 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.700
 caroline is a story on 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:21.230
 very very studded studies 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.360
 The inventive Kardex inventor has it 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.830
 it really did succeed 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.810
 Studies even increase individual studies 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.269
 and certain results from this 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.060
 a study with in his system too 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:37.370
 but take the same study also has 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.150
 brought another result to light 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.100
 and they let out then 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.280
 comeback loading works the same way 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.010
 like any other nutritional form 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.959
 also seems to be that easy 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.090
 these studies are behind it and 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.530
 that's something where you want it to be 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.070
 see the most demanding so it is supposed that 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.730
 always cherry picking only 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.769
 because one 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.930
 I'd say an excerpt from a 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.459
 study suits me right in my mind 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.630
 I'll just say a story now 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.060
 Of course I can not do that because it is 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.310
 with a reputable I would say with 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.140
 a reputable journalism or a 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.220
 lake 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.720
 reputable knowledge instead of the 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.910
 scientist teams of course nothing 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.900
 to do and it is loading at qadbak 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.640
 Opportunities the case at inter medium term 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.459
 There are two different systems out there 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.380
 it's this 16 8 system so I'm eating 16 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:33.580
 There was nothing for nearly 108 hours 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.050
 vinegar so that it can also turn to a 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.570
 history that it is actually the 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.670
 really work better like others 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.230
 why say that but of course no 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.220
 direct comparison under this system 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.330
 give 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.430
 which it never will know whether 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.080
 no one is interested in a study 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.420
 will finance where people themselves 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.640
 and do not go in or just shit 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.930
 Eat so after the chapter or in the 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.360
 principle sorry that I say so 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.540
 because that's still a lot of it 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.209
 about fsb cm tall excited from 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.760
 not always efficient microsoft that 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.920
 but makes in the end over capped 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.590
 proper no black excites me 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.030
 find it which I find now totally and 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.530
 it will be like I said this compare 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.970
 there will never be and there is at all 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.919
 Systems are successful, so stay tuned 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.310
 I am only one conclusion 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:27.880
 is in fact not significant 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.130
 important when what is supplied if you 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.900
 So you should know about it 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.040
 then you have to say on your body 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.370
 hear and say okay 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.440
 that gets me and in addition and that 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.970
 get time gets better 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.600
 or worse or what do I know what 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.160
 and that influences my training 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.050
 Getting in touch with a system 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:51.889
 Hang out and do great there 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:54.169
 to expect miracles that is wrong and it 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.900
 will be one again every year 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.240
 new sow driven through the village and the 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:03.800
 is called zigzag and next time 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.270
 is hiphop.de course hot that the 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.550
 I'll call it the next time I have it 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.919
 No more hurry or calories 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.960
 page link.de and we have it here 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:15.500
 To be invented, register a patent and 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:18.319
 then make out system as said that 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.090
 objective literature says it all there 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:23.539
 clearly that there are no significant 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.430
 difference makes me miss you too 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:27.139
 down here if it really is me 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.870
 down on the from all anger and 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:31.759
 research review I hope I can 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.210
 all studies if you left it then 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:37.430
 I'll let you all in here below 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.800
 about this whole topic down there 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.690
 and I hope you will be mentioned then 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.909
 then it is smarter and they are all 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:47.900
 Good theories and practice 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:51.430
 somehow all result and what something 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:54.020
 otherwise if it were not legal if I were 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.440
 otherwise something will not be a result 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.440
 bring
