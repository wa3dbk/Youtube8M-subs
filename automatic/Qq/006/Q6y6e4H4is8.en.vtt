00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
you're wanting to have bent ribbon in a

you're wanting to have bent ribbon in a
diagonal<00:00:57.110> and<00:00:57.290> you're<00:00:57.410> going<00:00:57.560> to<00:00:57.620> measure<00:00:57.950> it

diagonal and you're going to measure it
against<00:00:58.610> your<00:00:58.760> three<00:00:59.150> inch<00:00:59.180> ribbon<00:00:59.780> the<00:01:00.500> idea

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
against your three inch ribbon the idea

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.500 
against your three inch ribbon the idea
is<00:01:01.070> that<00:01:01.130> you<00:01:01.340> don't<00:01:01.670> want<00:01:01.850> it<00:01:01.910> to<00:01:02.000> be<00:01:02.120> straight

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
is that you don't want it to be straight

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:03.250 
is that you don't want it to be straight
across

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
across

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.110 
across
it'll<00:01:03.470> look<00:01:03.710> cooler<00:01:04.160> if<00:01:04.339> you<00:01:04.370> do<00:01:04.760> it<00:01:04.910> in<00:01:05.030> an

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.120 
it'll look cooler if you do it in an

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.600 
it'll look cooler if you do it in an
angle<00:01:05.540> like<00:01:05.690> this<00:01:05.920> flip<00:01:06.920> over<00:01:07.130> your<00:01:07.369> top

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
angle like this flip over your top

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.040 
angle like this flip over your top
ribbon<00:01:07.910> and<00:01:08.300> then<00:01:08.450> you're<00:01:08.630> going<00:01:08.720> to<00:01:08.780> want<00:01:09.020> to

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
ribbon and then you're going to want to

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.500 
ribbon and then you're going to want to
spread<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:09.530> glue<00:01:09.770> I<00:01:10.040> find<00:01:10.729> if<00:01:10.850> you<00:01:10.940> do<00:01:11.150> it<00:01:11.270> in<00:01:11.420> a

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
spread the glue I find if you do it in a

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.800 
spread the glue I find if you do it in a
wavy<00:01:11.780> line<00:01:12.290> once<00:01:13.100> like<00:01:13.369> this<00:01:13.700> and<00:01:14.030> then<00:01:14.540> come

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
wavy line once like this and then come

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.040 
wavy line once like this and then come
back<00:01:15.160> you'll<00:01:16.160> get<00:01:16.400> most<00:01:16.760> of<00:01:17.119> the<00:01:17.300> edges<00:01:17.810> and

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
back you'll get most of the edges and

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.070 
back you'll get most of the edges and
it'll<00:01:18.410> stick<00:01:18.710> really<00:01:19.190> well<00:01:19.690> without<00:01:20.690> getting

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
it'll stick really well without getting

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.440 
it'll stick really well without getting
too<00:01:21.320> much<00:01:21.500> glue<00:01:21.830> everywhere

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.149 

now<00:01:25.110> you're<00:01:25.259> going<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.439> pick<00:01:25.650> up<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.860> one<00:01:26.009> and

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
now you're going to pick up the one and

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.520 
now you're going to pick up the one and
a<00:01:26.189> half<00:01:26.400> inch<00:01:26.640> ribbon<00:01:26.880> flip<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.450> over<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.900> just

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
a half inch ribbon flip it over and just

a half inch ribbon flip it over and just
gently<00:01:28.830> lay<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.369> on<00:01:29.490> top<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.939> 3-inch

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
gently lay it on top of the 3-inch

you'll<00:01:32.530> want<00:01:32.710> to<00:01:32.770> smooth<00:01:33.100> it<00:01:33.250> out<00:01:33.369> so<00:01:33.430> that

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
you'll want to smooth it out so that

there aren't any bumps but not too much

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.920 
there aren't any bumps but not too much

then<00:03:14.350> put<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.739> rubber<00:03:14.950> band<00:03:15.310> on<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.670> back<00:03:15.880> of

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
then put the rubber band on the back of

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.410 
then put the rubber band on the back of
it

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
it

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.059 
it
a<00:03:16.450> lot<00:03:16.810> of<00:03:16.840> people<00:03:17.260> have<00:03:17.380> asked<00:03:17.739> me<00:03:17.769> why<00:03:18.040> I

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
a lot of people have asked me why I

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.430 
a lot of people have asked me why I
don't<00:03:18.400> put<00:03:18.609> the<00:03:18.760> rubber<00:03:19.000> band<00:03:19.299> inside<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:20.200> zip

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
don't put the rubber band inside the zip

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.770 
don't put the rubber band inside the zip
tie<00:03:20.739> I<00:03:21.069> find<00:03:21.700> that<00:03:21.790> they<00:03:21.940> rub<00:03:22.209> against<00:03:22.630> each

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
tie I find that they rub against each

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.660 
tie I find that they rub against each
other<00:03:23.049> and<00:03:23.290> then<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.590> rubber<00:03:23.769> band<00:03:24.099> tends<00:03:24.489> to

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
other and then the rubber band tends to

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.360 
other and then the rubber band tends to
break<00:03:24.849> instead<00:03:25.480> I<00:03:25.750> just<00:03:25.989> use<00:03:26.530> hot<00:03:26.829> glue<00:03:26.859> and

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
break instead I just use hot glue and

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.339 
break instead I just use hot glue and
glue<00:03:27.849> it<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.239> back<00:03:28.540> of<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.810> bow<00:03:29.049> just

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
glue it to the back of the bow just

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.370 
glue it to the back of the bow just
right<00:03:29.950> there<00:03:30.190> on<00:03:30.310> top<00:03:30.340> of<00:03:30.609> the<00:03:31.000> zip<00:03:31.209> tie<00:03:31.419> when

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
right there on top of the zip tie when

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.990 
right there on top of the zip tie when
you<00:03:32.500> take<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:32.799> rubber<00:03:33.010> band<00:03:33.099> and<00:03:33.549> you<00:03:33.730> stick

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
you take the rubber band and you stick

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.360 
you take the rubber band and you stick
it<00:03:34.120> down<00:03:34.269> there<00:03:34.329> it's<00:03:34.989> going<00:03:35.319> to<00:03:35.410> be<00:03:35.560> hot<00:03:35.950> so<00:03:36.280> if

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
it down there it's going to be hot so if

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.789 
it down there it's going to be hot so if
your<00:03:36.519> fingers<00:03:36.760> aren't<00:03:37.150> used<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.660> hot<00:03:37.870> glue<00:03:38.139> you

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
your fingers aren't used to hot glue you

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.380 
your fingers aren't used to hot glue you
might<00:03:38.980> want<00:03:39.220> to<00:03:39.280> use<00:03:39.489> like<00:03:39.700> a<00:03:39.760> stick<00:03:40.209> a

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
might want to use like a stick a

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.750 
might want to use like a stick a
popsicle<00:03:40.930> stick<00:03:41.140> or<00:03:41.349> something<00:03:41.799> to<00:03:42.280> hold<00:03:42.549> it

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
popsicle stick or something to hold it

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.190 
popsicle stick or something to hold it
in<00:03:42.909> place<00:03:43.090> you're<00:03:43.510> going<00:03:43.659> to<00:03:43.720> want<00:03:43.870> to<00:03:43.930> hold<00:03:44.019> it

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
in place you're going to want to hold it

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.340 
in place you're going to want to hold it
for

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
for

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.440 
for
second<00:03:44.770> or<00:03:44.860> two<00:03:45.070> so<00:03:45.580> that<00:03:45.790> the<00:03:45.910> rubberband

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
second or two so that the rubberband

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.590 
second or two so that the rubberband
sits<00:03:46.840> in<00:03:47.050> the<00:03:47.170> right<00:03:47.380> place<00:03:47.740> on<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:48.040> boat<00:03:48.600> once

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
sits in the right place on the boat once

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.730 
sits in the right place on the boat once
that's<00:03:49.720> finished<00:03:49.930> we're<00:03:50.350> going<00:03:50.440> to<00:03:50.530> do<00:03:50.590> the

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
that's finished we're going to do the

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.380 
that's finished we're going to do the
center<00:03:51.040> or<00:03:51.190> not<00:03:51.340> I<00:03:51.610> just<00:03:51.640> took<00:03:52.060> a<00:03:52.180> piece<00:03:52.360> of

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
center or not I just took a piece of

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.900 
center or not I just took a piece of
ribbon<00:03:52.780> and<00:03:53.050> tied<00:03:53.830> a<00:03:53.860> little<00:03:54.190> knot<00:03:54.430> in<00:03:54.460> it<00:03:54.760> I'm

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
ribbon and tied a little knot in it I'm

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.970 
ribbon and tied a little knot in it I'm
going<00:03:55.090> to<00:03:55.150> flip<00:03:55.420> my<00:03:55.450> bow<00:03:55.750> over<00:03:55.990> and<00:03:56.350> I'm<00:03:56.710> going

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
going to flip my bow over and I'm going

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.190 
going to flip my bow over and I'm going
to<00:03:57.010> glue<00:03:57.430> that<00:03:57.460> to<00:03:58.180> the<00:03:58.300> very<00:03:58.600> front<00:03:58.870> it's

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
to glue that to the very front it's

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.990 
to glue that to the very front it's
important<00:03:59.620> if<00:03:59.770> you<00:03:59.890> do<00:04:00.070> the<00:04:00.220> knot<00:04:00.430> that<00:04:00.940> you

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
important if you do the knot that you

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.930 
important if you do the knot that you
glue<00:04:01.450> that<00:04:01.720> first<00:04:02.200> because<00:04:03.070> you<00:04:03.460> want<00:04:03.700> it<00:04:03.760> to

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
glue that first because you want it to

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.540 
glue that first because you want it to
be<00:04:04.060> perfectly<00:04:04.540> in<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:04.840> center<00:04:04.870> if<00:04:05.680> you<00:04:06.220> do<00:04:06.430> it

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
be perfectly in the center if you do it

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.110 
be perfectly in the center if you do it
like<00:04:06.700> this

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
like this

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.850 
like this
make<00:04:07.450> sure<00:04:07.630> you<00:04:07.720> don't<00:04:07.840> use<00:04:08.110> too<00:04:08.410> much<00:04:08.800> glue

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
make sure you don't use too much glue

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.070 
make sure you don't use too much glue
because<00:04:09.760> this<00:04:09.940> is<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:10.300> very<00:04:10.600> front<00:04:10.930> of<00:04:10.990> your

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
because this is the very front of your

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.110 
because this is the very front of your
bow<00:04:11.380> and<00:04:11.680> it<00:04:11.770> can<00:04:11.950> squish<00:04:12.280> out<00:04:12.460> on<00:04:12.580> either<00:04:12.790> side

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
bow and it can squish out on either side

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.790 
bow and it can squish out on either side
and<00:04:13.270> look<00:04:13.390> really<00:04:13.570> crappy<00:04:13.960> now<00:04:14.500> you're<00:04:14.650> going

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
and look really crappy now you're going

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.830 
and look really crappy now you're going
to<00:04:14.860> flip<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.220> bow<00:04:15.400> over<00:04:15.730> and<00:04:16.120> glue<00:04:16.360> the<00:04:16.660> back

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
to flip the bow over and glue the back

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.350 
to flip the bow over and glue the back
sides<00:04:17.230> I<00:04:17.620> always<00:04:18.190> flew<00:04:18.430> the<00:04:18.610> bottom<00:04:19.090> side

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:19.360 
sides I always flew the bottom side

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.410 
sides I always flew the bottom side
first<00:04:19.960> and<00:04:20.350> then<00:04:20.470> the<00:04:21.010> top<00:04:21.489> part<00:04:21.520> because<00:04:22.240> when

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
first and then the top part because when

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.110 
first and then the top part because when
they<00:04:22.540> overlap<00:04:22.750> I<00:04:23.710> want<00:04:24.160> the<00:04:24.280> top<00:04:24.520> part<00:04:24.820> to<00:04:24.880> look

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
they overlap I want the top part to look

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.700 
they overlap I want the top part to look
like<00:04:25.300> it's<00:04:25.480> coming<00:04:25.870> over<00:04:26.200> and<00:04:26.350> it<00:04:26.440> doesn't

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
like it's coming over and it doesn't

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.380 
like it's coming over and it doesn't
really<00:04:26.800> matter<00:04:27.040> what<00:04:27.370> the<00:04:27.520> bottom<00:04:27.880> side<00:04:28.090> looks

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
really matter what the bottom side looks

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.600 
really matter what the bottom side looks
like<00:04:28.590> now<00:04:29.590> you're<00:04:29.830> going<00:04:29.980> to<00:04:30.040> want<00:04:30.220> to<00:04:30.280> hold

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
like now you're going to want to hold

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.120 
like now you're going to want to hold
that<00:04:30.790> down<00:04:31.240> for<00:04:31.570> a<00:04:31.630> second<00:04:32.140> or<00:04:32.260> two<00:04:32.470> just<00:04:32.770> to

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
that down for a second or two just to

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.040 
that down for a second or two just to
make<00:04:33.190> sure<00:04:33.340> it's<00:04:33.610> stuck<00:04:33.880> really<00:04:34.330> good<00:04:34.720> and

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
make sure it's stuck really good and

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.610 
make sure it's stuck really good and
then<00:04:35.680> you<00:04:35.830> have<00:04:36.010> your<00:04:36.190> cheer<00:04:36.400> bow
