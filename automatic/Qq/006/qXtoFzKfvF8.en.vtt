before<00:02:06.760> the<00:02:06.880> events<00:02:07.510> and<00:02:07.770> yeah<00:02:08.770> it<00:02:08.920> was<00:02:09.130> I

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
before the events and yeah it was I

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.000 
before the events and yeah it was I
think<00:02:10.030> that<00:02:10.179> that<00:02:10.750> was<00:02:10.929> very<00:02:11.500> important<00:02:11.980> for

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
think that that was very important for

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.229 
think that that was very important for
us<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.550> we<00:02:13.060> lost<00:02:13.180> it<00:02:13.420> before<00:02:13.630> is<00:02:14.110> a<00:02:14.290> bc<00:02:14.650> and

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
us and we lost it before is a bc and

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.229 
us and we lost it before is a bc and
basically<00:02:16.239> we<00:02:16.630> just<00:02:16.660> practiced<00:02:17.530> before<00:02:18.370> this

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
basically we just practiced before this

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
out very well we didn't really shook up

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.780 
out very well we didn't really shook up
our<00:02:24.220> friends<00:02:24.700> and<00:02:25.390> we<00:02:26.140> didn't<00:02:26.500> like<00:02:26.790> update

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
our friends and we didn't like update

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
the maps with proper strategies but as

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.490 
the maps with proper strategies but as
you<00:02:31.330> see<00:02:31.890> we<00:02:32.890> didn't<00:02:33.130> deserve<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:33.430> win<00:02:33.580> if<00:02:34.500> if

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
you see we didn't deserve to win if if

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.199 
you see we didn't deserve to win if if
there<00:02:35.709> are<00:02:35.800> such<00:02:36.010> problems<00:02:36.430> if<00:02:36.580> we<00:02:36.730> cannot<00:02:37.000> get

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
there are such problems if we cannot get

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.260 
there are such problems if we cannot get
