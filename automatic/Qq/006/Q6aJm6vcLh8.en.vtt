00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
and I hope it helped it is a very short

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.160 
and I hope it helped it is a very short
video<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.099> know<00:02:08.720> but<00:02:09.720> if<00:02:09.810> there<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.050> more

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
video I know but if there is more

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.650 
video I know but if there is more
information<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:11.310> is<00:02:11.370> required<00:02:11.790> if<00:02:12.420> there's

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
information that is required if there's

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.820 
information that is required if there's
a<00:02:12.720> lot<00:02:12.900> of<00:02:13.080> room<00:02:13.379> i'll<00:02:13.530> room

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
a lot of room i'll room

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.450 
a lot of room i'll room
making<00:02:14.040> video<00:02:14.250> but<00:02:15.150> if<00:02:15.270> not<00:02:15.540> then<00:02:16.460> it'll

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
making video but if not then it'll

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.800 
making video but if not then it'll
probably<00:02:17.700> just<00:02:17.850> be<00:02:18.060> an<00:02:18.150> annotation<00:02:18.360> so<00:02:18.780> I

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
probably just be an annotation so I

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.300 
probably just be an annotation so I
would<00:02:19.170> recommend<00:02:19.320> the<00:02:19.620> annotations<00:02:20.160> on

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
would recommend the annotations on

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.830 
would recommend the annotations on
because<00:02:20.580> annotations<00:02:21.060> will<00:02:21.150> be<00:02:21.270> up<00:02:21.390> now<00:02:21.630> if

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
because annotations will be up now if

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.360 
because annotations will be up now if
there<00:02:21.990> is<00:02:22.020> anything<00:02:22.290> changed<00:02:22.770> however<00:02:22.950> I

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
there is anything changed however I

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.860 
there is anything changed however I
can't<00:02:23.640> imagine<00:02:23.730> anything<00:02:24.120> changing<00:02:24.660> because

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
can't imagine anything changing because

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.930 
can't imagine anything changing because
I<00:02:25.080> think<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.620> build<00:02:25.800> works<00:02:26.010> fine<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.610> the

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
I think the build works fine and the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.690 
I think the build works fine and the
item<00:02:27.240> and<00:02:27.450> generally<00:02:27.900> is<00:02:28.140> kind<00:02:28.470> of<00:02:28.560> it's<00:02:29.520> not

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
item and generally is kind of it's not

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.220 
item and generally is kind of it's not
the<00:02:29.880> most<00:02:30.150> difficult<00:02:30.330> things<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.960> work<00:02:31.110> out

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
the most difficult things to work out

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.800 
the most difficult things to work out
