guitar<00:01:21.149> players<00:01:21.420> started<00:01:21.869> plugging<00:01:22.080> into

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
guitar players started plugging into

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.440 
guitar players started plugging into
this<00:01:22.680> guitar<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.460> amplifier<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.210> found

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
this guitar this amplifier and found

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.320 
this guitar this amplifier and found
what<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> great<00:01:25.470> sound<00:01:25.800> it<00:01:26.009> was<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.910> it<00:01:27.030> sort<00:01:27.270> of

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
what a great sound it was so it sort of

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.719 
what a great sound it was so it sort of
became<00:01:28.050> adopted<00:01:28.619> by<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.800> guitar<00:01:29.220> community

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
became adopted by the guitar community

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.370 
became adopted by the guitar community
and<00:01:29.970> also<00:01:30.119> as<00:01:30.770> probably<00:01:31.770> one<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:32.039> the<00:01:32.190> most

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
and also as probably one of the most

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.300 
and also as probably one of the most
original<00:01:34.910> tube<00:01:35.910> amp<00:01:36.149> circuits<00:01:36.860> ever<00:01:37.860> designed

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
original tube amp circuits ever designed

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.730 
original tube amp circuits ever designed
from<00:01:38.550> which<00:01:38.780> basically<00:01:39.780> every<00:01:40.200> app<00:01:40.350> since

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
from which basically every app since

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.190 
from which basically every app since
then<00:01:41.009> has<00:01:41.250> AHS<00:01:41.910> its<00:01:42.210> heritage<00:01:42.660> to<00:01:43.080> this

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
then has AHS its heritage to this

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.609 
then has AHS its heritage to this
amplifier<00:01:43.920> here<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:45.180> fender<00:01:45.570> decided<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.440> put

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
amplifier here so fender decided to put

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.260 
amplifier here so fender decided to put
out<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.770> reissue<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:47.940> is<00:01:48.060> called

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
out a reissue of this and this is called

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.730 
out a reissue of this and this is called
the<00:01:48.390> basement<00:01:48.840> limited<00:01:49.490> it's<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.700> four<00:01:51.390> input

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
the basement limited it's a four input

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.020 
the basement limited it's a four input
amplifier<00:01:54.259> there<00:01:55.259> is<00:01:55.440> no<00:01:55.649> effects<00:01:56.520> loop<00:01:56.759> there

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
amplifier there is no effects loop there

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.510 
amplifier there is no effects loop there
were<00:01:57.119> no<00:01:57.270> reverb<00:01:57.720> there<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.770> no<00:01:59.009> channel

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
were no reverb there is no channel

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.249 
were no reverb there is no channel
switching<00:01:59.910> on<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.209> it's<00:02:00.360> just<00:02:00.539> a<00:02:00.630> basically<00:02:01.110> a

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
switching on it it's just a basically a

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.850 
switching on it it's just a basically a
great<00:02:01.770> plug-in<00:02:02.220> and<00:02:02.670> play<00:02:03.060> amplifier<00:02:03.860> it

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
great plug-in and play amplifier it

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.999 
great plug-in and play amplifier it
takes<00:02:05.130> pedals<00:02:05.520> very<00:02:05.819> very<00:02:06.060> nicely<00:02:06.330> and

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
takes pedals very very nicely and

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.559 
takes pedals very very nicely and
essentially<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.250> more<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.520> turn<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.880> up<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
essentially the more you turn it up the

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.220 
essentially the more you turn it up the
louder<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.080> thing<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.470> gets<00:02:11.630> it's<00:02:12.630> 50<00:02:13.050> watts

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
louder the thing it gets it's 50 watts

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.360 
louder the thing it gets it's 50 watts
into<00:02:13.590> 2<00:02:14.040> ohms<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.880> has<00:02:15.180> four<00:02:15.480> jensen<00:02:16.370> 10-inch

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
into 2 ohms it has four jensen 10-inch

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.550 
into 2 ohms it has four jensen 10-inch
speakers<00:02:18.020> it's<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.140> lacquered<00:02:19.530> tweed<00:02:19.560> cabinet

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
speakers it's a lacquered tweed cabinet

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.540 
speakers it's a lacquered tweed cabinet
to<00:02:22.560> 6l6<00:02:23.840> groove<00:02:24.840> tubes<00:02:25.200> for<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:25.980> power

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
to 6l6 groove tubes for the power

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:34.610 
to 6l6 groove tubes for the power
section<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.300> three<00:02:28.730> 12ax7<00:02:29.840> tubes<00:02:31.069> so

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.170 

here<00:02:35.580> is<00:02:35.700> our<00:02:36.800> normal<00:02:37.800> sound<00:02:38.489> and<00:02:38.849> this<00:02:39.030> is

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
here is our normal sound and this is

00:02:39.180 --> 00:03:02.520 
here is our normal sound and this is
input<00:02:39.540> one<00:02:39.750> of<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.930> normal<00:02:40.459> channel

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.840 

now<00:03:03.530> this<00:03:03.680> is<00:03:03.830> through<00:03:03.980> a<00:03:04.040> Stratocaster<00:03:04.430> with

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
now this is through a Stratocaster with

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.430 
now this is through a Stratocaster with
a<00:03:04.880> single<00:03:05.300> coil<00:03:06.730> sound<00:03:07.730> in<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:08.000> neck<00:03:08.240> if<00:03:09.230> I

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
a single coil sound in the neck if I

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.230 
a single coil sound in the neck if I
were<00:03:09.560> to<00:03:09.650> take<00:03:09.800> that<00:03:10.010> same<00:03:10.250> sound<00:03:10.610> and<00:03:11.030> use<00:03:11.210> a

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
were to take that same sound and use a

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.450 
were to take that same sound and use a
humbucker<00:03:11.750> you'll<00:03:12.380> start<00:03:12.830> to<00:03:12.920> hear<00:03:13.100> how<00:03:13.310> this

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
humbucker you'll start to hear how this

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:29.960 
humbucker you'll start to hear how this
amp<00:03:13.700> will<00:03:13.850> start<00:03:14.060> to<00:03:14.180> break<00:03:14.390> up

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.250 

so<00:03:30.970> once<00:03:31.150> again<00:03:31.270> it's<00:03:31.540> very<00:03:31.600> very<00:03:31.810> touch

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
so once again it's very very touch

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.080 
so once again it's very very touch
sensitive<00:03:32.860> it's<00:03:33.190> sort<00:03:33.400> of<00:03:33.460> like<00:03:33.610> the<00:03:33.760> harder

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
sensitive it's sort of like the harder

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.430 
sensitive it's sort of like the harder
you<00:03:34.180> hit<00:03:34.210> the<00:03:34.450> amplifier<00:03:34.900> the<00:03:35.140> more<00:03:35.320> it's

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
you hit the amplifier the more it's

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.070 
you hit the amplifier the more it's
going<00:03:35.590> to<00:03:35.680> respond<00:03:36.390> if<00:03:37.390> we<00:03:37.570> go<00:03:37.720> over<00:03:37.750> to<00:03:37.870> the

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
going to respond if we go over to the

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.050 
going to respond if we go over to the
bright<00:03:38.320> sound<00:03:41.340> get<00:03:42.340> an<00:03:42.460> idea<00:03:42.730> what<00:03:42.910> this

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
bright sound get an idea what this

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.760 
bright sound get an idea what this
sounds<00:03:43.420> like<00:03:43.480> and<00:03:43.840> this<00:03:43.930> is<00:03:44.050> again<00:03:44.350> through

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
sounds like and this is again through

00:03:44.770 --> 00:04:04.140 
sounds like and this is again through
the<00:03:44.890> neck<00:03:45.040> pickup<00:03:45.340> of<00:03:45.520> a<00:03:45.580> strap<00:04:02.820> you<00:04:03.820> can<00:04:03.940> also

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
the neck pickup of a strap you can also

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.050 
the neck pickup of a strap you can also
jump<00:04:04.600> the<00:04:04.750> channels<00:04:05.340> for<00:04:06.340> with<00:04:06.490> fender<00:04:06.850> calls

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
jump the channels for with fender calls

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.760 
jump the channels for with fender calls
a<00:04:07.209> channel<00:04:07.630> blender<00:04:08.020> so<00:04:08.230> you're<00:04:08.410> getting<00:04:08.680> the

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
a channel blender so you're getting the

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.040 
a channel blender so you're getting the
best<00:04:08.980> of<00:04:09.160> both<00:04:09.220> worlds<00:04:09.430> the<00:04:09.970> normal<00:04:10.360> input<00:04:10.570> and

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
best of both worlds the normal input and

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.860 
best of both worlds the normal input and
the<00:04:11.620> bright<00:04:11.830> input<00:04:12.310> and<00:04:12.610> I<00:04:12.700> think<00:04:13.270> we<00:04:13.630> have<00:04:13.840> a

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
the bright input and I think we have a

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.050 
the bright input and I think we have a
channel<00:04:14.530> jumper<00:04:15.040> around<00:04:15.340> here<00:04:15.550> somewhere

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
channel jumper around here somewhere

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:23.690 
channel jumper around here somewhere
which<00:04:16.959> we<00:04:17.140> shall<00:04:17.350> get

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.710 

so<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.480> idea<00:04:24.810> is<00:04:24.870> to<00:04:25.260> jump<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:27.330> normal

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
so the idea is to jump the normal

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:36.010 
so the idea is to jump the normal
channel<00:04:28.140> of<00:04:28.350> one<00:04:30.530> into<00:04:31.700> the<00:04:32.700> right<00:04:33.030> channel<00:04:33.330> of

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
channel of one into the right channel of

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.220 
channel of one into the right channel of
channel<00:04:37.020> 2<00:04:38.210> so<00:04:39.210> here's<00:04:39.450> what<00:04:39.660> it<00:04:39.780> sounds<00:04:39.960> like

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
channel 2 so here's what it sounds like

00:04:40.230 --> 00:05:08.590 
channel 2 so here's what it sounds like
when<00:04:40.830> both<00:04:41.610> of<00:04:41.640> these<00:04:41.880> channels<00:04:42.180> are<00:04:42.450> jumped

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.040 

once<00:05:09.600> again<00:05:09.720> very<00:05:10.050> very<00:05:10.169> touch-sensitive

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
once again very very touch-sensitive

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.310 
once again very very touch-sensitive
surprisingly<00:05:13.050> versatile<00:05:13.800> for<00:05:14.130> a<00:05:14.720> you<00:05:15.720> know<00:05:15.840> as

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
surprisingly versatile for a you know as

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.800 
surprisingly versatile for a you know as
an<00:05:16.740> essentially<00:05:17.370> very<00:05:17.610> simple<00:05:18.090> amp<00:05:18.330> circuit

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
an essentially very simple amp circuit

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.050 
an essentially very simple amp circuit
and<00:05:18.990> simple<00:05:19.320> design<00:05:19.490> so<00:05:20.490> there<00:05:20.639> you<00:05:20.759> have<00:05:20.789> it

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
and simple design so there you have it

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.909 
and simple design so there you have it
this<00:05:21.150> is<00:05:21.210> the<00:05:21.449> Fender<00:05:21.780> Bassman<00:05:21.990> limited<00:05:22.710> it's
