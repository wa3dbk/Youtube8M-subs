under black light and the moon has some
ultraviolet<00:01:33.090> light<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.020> get<00:01:34.110> this

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
ultraviolet light and so you get this

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.899 
ultraviolet light and so you get this
beautiful<00:01:34.560> glow<00:01:34.890> that's<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.340> way<00:01:35.490> as<00:01:35.610> well

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
again when the light goes off then this

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
it's really called zinc sulfide and zinc

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.710 
it's really called zinc sulfide and zinc
sulfide<00:01:53.880> see<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.060> made<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.390> little<00:01:54.509> pepper

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
can actually write with light go really

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.950 
can actually write with light go really
close<00:02:14.740> to<00:02:14.950> it<00:02:15.040> ready<00:02:15.280> look<00:02:15.940> at<00:02:16.000> this<00:02:16.210> so<00:02:16.900> you

close to it ready look at this so you

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.320 
close to it ready look at this so you
see<00:02:17.020> how<00:02:17.230> you<00:02:17.260> write<00:02:17.620> with<00:02:17.800> light<00:02:18.330> because

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
see how you write with light because

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.970 
see how you write with light because
we've<00:02:19.510> got<00:02:19.690> that<00:02:19.810> material<00:02:20.380> there<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:20.710> now

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980

we've got that material there and now
it's<00:02:21.250> actually<00:02:21.520> absorbing<00:02:21.880> some<00:02:22.300> of<00:02:22.390> the

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
it's actually absorbing some of the

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.060 
it's actually absorbing some of the
energy<00:02:22.780> and<00:02:22.960> it<00:02:23.140> still<00:02:23.350> glows<00:02:23.620> a<00:02:23.650> little<00:02:23.980> bit

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
energy and it still glows a little bit

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.530 
energy and it still glows a little bit
when<00:02:24.190> it<00:02:24.280> comes<00:02:24.430> back<00:02:24.610> here's<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.240> one<00:02:25.360> from
