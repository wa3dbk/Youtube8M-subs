00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 Hi, I'm alexandre rossi, I'm here. 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.810
 with a golden puppy to show 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.370
 for you as we can teach 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:17.580
 the dogs to pee in the right place 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:19.529
 It is super important that the dog understands 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.500
 Where does he have to pee? 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.600
 before we give or break the scold 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.600
 in fact it could end up worsening stream 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.149
 We can at first put more 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.940
 bathrooms and it's legal to put 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.370
 something that absorbed pee because the 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.610
 dog he likes to pee in 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.079
 sites that nonsense preferably 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.059
 hygienic carpets than the newspaper that 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.920
 does not absorb so it's cool to have a space 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.809
 relatively large 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.770
 even if it is a small dog 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.960
 to increase his chances of hitting me 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.539
 I'm going to use these two frogs for me. 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.300
 help drive the RIDING 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.760
 dog leaves the area that we want 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.890
 And then how do I have it on my lap for a while? 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.939
 with that dog he is already in order 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.240
 of peeing 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.530
 I'll try leaving him here in the 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.200
 local 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.000
 if he pees around here I do not have 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.920
 that scold because otherwise he can 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.869
 understand that you should not pee here 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.630
 I can enjoy the pee he made 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.909
 wrong to give a little scent 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.229
 but it's important not to get wet 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.150
 because like I said the dog does not 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.860
 likes to pee in place a look 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.860
 They do not like to look at everything. 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:40.799
 I have to have a little patience. 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.869
 because it may take a little while but if 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.970
 the dog is not related 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.750
 He goes to bed and wants to play in that 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.119
 Now you can keep him on his lap. 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.490
 or put it for example in a small house 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.030
 which can be really good for him with 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:00.329
 15 things to do in five minutes 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.549
 I picked up again and offer the place 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.970
 Right to Pee 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.880
 these little quickies that usually stay in the 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.580
 kitchen and in the service area are very 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.080
 tempting for the puppies and even 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.349
 for others who have not yet learned 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.650
 front swear right then the best thing 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:22.590
 is to collect them until we are sure of 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.530
 that he will learn very well to do 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.540
 needs solid right let's see 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.470
 now if you're comfortable 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.470
 [Music] 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.470
 a care not to clap for not 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.640
 get too excited because people 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:45.359
 It can end up frightening and that's where the 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.310
 snack prepared to reward the 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.209
 dog because with time what goes 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.920
 to happen 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.989
 They'll want to pee to 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.780
 to win the PT, the ideal is to have a 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.970
 bathroom very close to where you stay 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.120
 where the dog stays so he can 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.000
 relieving when you feel like it and 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.370
 time you can reduce the number of 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.360
 toilets there pro the dog until he 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.320
 learn to do only one location 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.320
