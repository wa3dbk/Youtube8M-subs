how<00:00:00.840> do<00:00:01.310> hey<00:00:02.310> I've<00:00:02.879> been<00:00:03.060> kind<00:00:03.240> of<00:00:03.300> struggling

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
how do hey I've been kind of struggling

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.300 
how do hey I've been kind of struggling
trying<00:00:04.020> to<00:00:04.110> decide<00:00:04.410> whether<00:00:04.650> I<00:00:04.770> wanted<00:00:05.100> to<00:00:05.160> use

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
trying to decide whether I wanted to use

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.140 
trying to decide whether I wanted to use
the<00:00:05.460> Aguila<00:00:06.020> sniper<00:00:07.020> subsonic<00:00:07.770> on<00:00:07.890> my<00:00:08.849> next

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
the Aguila sniper subsonic on my next

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.589 
the Aguila sniper subsonic on my next
hog<00:00:09.330> hunt<00:00:09.630> or<00:00:09.830> what<00:00:10.830> I<00:00:10.860> prefer<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:12.090> go<00:00:12.210> with<00:00:12.420> the

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
hog hunt or what I prefer to go with the

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.000 
hog hunt or what I prefer to go with the
gym<00:00:13.380> tech<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:14.900> it's<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:16.020> subsonic<00:00:16.379> round<00:00:16.770> also

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
gym tech and it's a subsonic round also

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.340 
gym tech and it's a subsonic round also
so<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:17.970> thought<00:00:18.240> I'd<00:00:18.390> do<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.539> little<00:00:18.630> compare<00:00:19.199> and

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
so I thought I'd do a little compare and

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.529 
so I thought I'd do a little compare and
contrast<00:00:19.439> with<00:00:20.010> them<00:00:20.130> on<00:00:20.699> paper<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.240> see<00:00:21.390> which

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
contrast with them on paper to see which

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.179 
contrast with them on paper to see which
one's<00:00:21.779> more<00:00:22.020> accurate<00:00:22.439> see<00:00:22.800> if<00:00:22.890> there's<00:00:23.039> any

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
one's more accurate see if there's any

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.550 
one's more accurate see if there's any
keyhole<00:00:23.699> in<00:00:23.850> from<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.119> tequila<00:00:24.390> from<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.260> one<00:00:25.439> in

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
keyhole in from a tequila from a one in

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.060 
keyhole in from a tequila from a one in
16-inch<00:00:26.160> twist<00:00:26.490> on<00:00:26.699> my<00:00:26.910> rifle<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:28.039> also<00:00:29.039> I

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
16-inch twist on my rifle and also I

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.070 
16-inch twist on my rifle and also I
thought<00:00:29.369> I'd<00:00:29.580> maybe<00:00:30.119> take<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.570> shot<00:00:30.810> at<00:00:31.019> a

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
thought I'd maybe take a shot at a

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.799 
thought I'd maybe take a shot at a
couple<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.700> immature<00:00:32.750> watermelons<00:00:33.750> that

couple of immature watermelons that

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.190 
couple of immature watermelons that
didn't<00:00:34.440> quite<00:00:34.590> make<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:34.980> through<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.309> anyway

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
didn't quite make it through the anyway

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.720 
didn't quite make it through the anyway
take<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.230> look<00:00:37.440> see<00:00:37.680> what<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:37.890> think<00:00:38.129> if<00:00:38.579> you

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
take a look see what you think if you

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.549 
take a look see what you think if you
see<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.000> either<00:00:39.120> one<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.450> these<00:00:39.570> rounds<00:00:39.809> it

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
see it either one of these rounds it

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.470 
see it either one of these rounds it
might<00:00:40.890> be<00:00:41.040> useful<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.820> if<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.090> shoot<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
might be useful to you if you shoot the

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.590 
might be useful to you if you shoot the
the<00:00:42.750> savage<00:00:43.110> mark<00:00:43.410> -<00:00:44.030> this<00:00:45.030> might<00:00:45.270> be<00:00:45.300> some

the savage mark - this might be some

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.360 
the savage mark - this might be some
useful<00:00:45.780> information<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.860> as<00:00:46.980> well<00:00:47.129> but

useful information to you as well but
I'll<00:00:47.520> be<00:00:47.640> shooting<00:00:47.789> basically<00:00:48.600> at<00:00:48.719> 38<00:00:49.170> yards

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
I'll be shooting basically at 38 yards

I'll be shooting basically at 38 yards
in<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.940> prone<00:00:51.180> position<00:00:51.210> I've<00:00:51.840> got<00:00:52.020> some

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.529 
in the prone position I've got some
sandbags<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.800> help<00:00:52.980> stabilize<00:00:53.219> me<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:53.850> I'm

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
sandbags to help stabilize me so I'm

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.080 
sandbags to help stabilize me so I'm
trying<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:54.989> reduce<00:00:55.379> as<00:00:55.530> much<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.090> shooter

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
trying to reduce as much of the shooter

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.939

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
factor as I can and just try to get it

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.920 
factor as I can and just try to get it
as<00:00:59.070> much<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.609> mechanical<00:01:00.329> aspect<00:01:00.780> of

these rounds as possible anyway take a

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:14.340 
these rounds as possible anyway take a
look<00:01:04.470> see<00:01:04.710> what<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.949> think

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350

I just don't know if it's quite accurate

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.910 
I just don't know if it's quite accurate
enough<00:02:31.489> to<00:02:31.670> hit<00:02:31.790> a<00:02:31.819> squirrel<00:02:32.150> in<00:02:32.329> the<00:02:32.420> head

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
enough to hit a squirrel in the head

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.099 
enough to hit a squirrel in the head
38-yard<00:02:33.920> you're<00:02:34.219> not<00:02:34.569> let's<00:02:35.569> go<00:02:35.689> have<00:02:35.870> a<00:02:35.900> look

38-yard you're not let's go have a look
at<00:02:36.200> that<00:02:36.349> target<00:02:36.620> so<00:02:37.189> it's<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.459> Agena

sniper subsonic it looks like la I would
have<00:02:44.870> called<00:02:45.079> that<00:02:45.260> a<00:02:45.290> Kehoe<00:02:45.680> but<00:02:45.890> I<00:02:45.950> think

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:46.159 
have called that a Kehoe but I think

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:47.530 
have called that a Kehoe but I think
there<00:02:46.310> was<00:02:46.370> two<00:02:46.609> bullets<00:02:47.000> went<00:02:47.209> through<00:02:47.269> that

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
there was two bullets went through that

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.449 
there was two bullets went through that
hole

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
hole

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.649 
hole
either<00:02:49.459> that<00:02:49.670> or<00:02:49.730> there<00:02:50.030> I'll<00:02:50.209> have<00:02:50.359> to<00:02:50.480> check

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:50.659 
either that or there I'll have to check

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.559 
either that or there I'll have to check
the<00:02:50.720> rewind<00:02:51.200> on<00:02:51.500> this<00:02:51.709> and<00:02:51.920> see<00:02:52.099> but<00:02:52.569> anyway

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
the rewind on this and see but anyway

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.960 
the rewind on this and see but anyway
that's<00:02:53.950> I'd<00:02:54.950> like<00:02:55.159> to<00:02:55.280> see<00:02:55.459> it<00:02:55.579> a<00:02:55.639> little<00:02:55.670> bit

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
that's I'd like to see it a little bit

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.940 
that's I'd like to see it a little bit
better<00:02:56.180> than<00:02:56.450> that<00:02:56.629> all<00:02:57.260> right<00:02:57.379> now<00:02:57.590> I've<00:02:57.739> got

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
better than that all right now I've got

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.619 
better than that all right now I've got
two<00:02:58.189> five<00:02:58.879> rounds<00:02:59.359> of<00:02:59.450> this<00:03:00.129> Jim<00:03:01.129> tech<00:03:01.629> it

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
two five rounds of this Jim tech it

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.819 
two five rounds of this Jim tech it
travels<00:03:03.109> at<00:03:03.430> 1020<00:03:04.430> feet<00:03:04.579> per<00:03:04.760> second<00:03:05.829> subsonic

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
travels at 1020 feet per second subsonic

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:12.280 
travels at 1020 feet per second subsonic
and<00:03:07.760> I<00:03:08.090> believe<00:03:08.329> it's<00:03:08.480> 42<00:03:08.870> grain<00:03:10.959> let's<00:03:11.959> see<00:03:12.200> if

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
and I believe it's 42 grain let's see if

00:03:12.290 --> 00:04:09.450 
and I believe it's 42 grain let's see if
we<00:03:12.409> can<00:03:12.530> get<00:03:12.650> any<00:03:12.859> better<00:03:13.010> accuracy<00:03:13.459> out<00:03:13.849> of<00:03:13.970> it

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.460 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.260 

alright<00:04:10.460> let's<00:04:10.640> go<00:04:10.760> have<00:04:10.940> a<00:04:10.970> look<00:04:11.120> at<00:04:11.180> that

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
alright let's go have a look at that

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.140 
alright let's go have a look at that
target<00:04:12.130> well<00:04:13.130> here's<00:04:13.340> a<00:04:13.430> comparison<00:04:14.000> between

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
target well here's a comparison between

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.590 
target well here's a comparison between
the<00:04:14.420> twos<00:04:15.020> and<00:04:15.200> the<00:04:15.320> accuracy<00:04:15.740> out<00:04:15.890> of<00:04:16.190> the

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
the twos and the accuracy out of the

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.720 
the twos and the accuracy out of the
savage<00:04:17.600> mark<00:04:17.870> two<00:04:18.110> with<00:04:19.040> a<00:04:19.070> one<00:04:19.310> and<00:04:19.340> sixteen

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
savage mark two with a one and sixteen

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.380 
savage mark two with a one and sixteen
twist<00:04:20.239> it's<00:04:21.200> pretty<00:04:21.410> calm<00:04:21.680> out<00:04:21.950> here<00:04:22.360> now<00:04:23.360> I

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
twist it's pretty calm out here now I

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.370 
twist it's pretty calm out here now I
really<00:04:23.870> like<00:04:24.020> this<00:04:24.080> gem<00:04:24.590> tech'<00:04:24.860> 42<00:04:25.760> grain

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
really like this gem tech' 42 grain

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.870 
really like this gem tech' 42 grain
travels<00:04:27.380> it<00:04:27.500> a<00:04:27.770> little<00:04:28.070> over<00:04:28.250> a<00:04:28.280> thousand<00:04:28.760> feet

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
travels it a little over a thousand feet

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.760 
travels it a little over a thousand feet
per<00:04:28.940> second<00:04:29.480> but<00:04:29.780> man<00:04:30.260> that's<00:04:30.440> a<00:04:30.530> really

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
per second but man that's a really

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.590 
per second but man that's a really
pretty<00:04:30.890> good<00:04:31.160> group<00:04:31.430> I<00:04:31.670> would<00:04:31.730> say<00:04:31.970> at<00:04:32.150> 38

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
pretty good group I would say at 38

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.770 
pretty good group I would say at 38
yards<00:04:33.400> it's<00:04:34.400> not<00:04:34.580> you<00:04:34.940> know<00:04:35.030> adjusted<00:04:35.600> with

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
yards it's not you know adjusted with

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.800 
yards it's not you know adjusted with
the<00:04:35.930> site<00:04:36.200> to<00:04:36.560> be<00:04:36.950> hitting<00:04:37.250> the<00:04:37.340> bull's<00:04:37.550> eye

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
the site to be hitting the bull's eye

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.350 
the site to be hitting the bull's eye
this<00:04:38.980> Aguila<00:04:39.980> 60<00:04:40.370> grain<00:04:40.610> is<00:04:40.790> what<00:04:40.940> I<00:04:40.970> have<00:04:41.180> the

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
this Aguila 60 grain is what I have the

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.530 
this Aguila 60 grain is what I have the
rifle<00:04:42.140> sighted<00:04:42.380> in<00:04:42.680> for<00:04:42.920> and<00:04:43.300> the<00:04:44.300> first

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
rifle sighted in for and the first

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.690 
rifle sighted in for and the first
strike<00:04:44.870> was<00:04:45.110> dead<00:04:45.440> center<00:04:46.100> which<00:04:46.280> I<00:04:46.400> really

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
strike was dead center which I really

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.380 
strike was dead center which I really
liked

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
liked

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.330 
liked
but<00:04:48.020> then<00:04:48.200> the<00:04:48.350> group<00:04:48.560> opened<00:04:48.800> up<00:04:49.160> I<00:04:49.310> think

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
but then the group opened up I think

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.980 
but then the group opened up I think
there<00:04:49.640> were<00:04:49.760> two<00:04:49.970> strikes<00:04:50.330> right<00:04:50.600> here<00:04:50.810> that

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
there were two strikes right here that

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.860 
there were two strikes right here that
wasn't<00:04:51.170> really<00:04:51.350> key<00:04:51.650> holy<00:04:51.890> and<00:04:52.330> then<00:04:53.330> got<00:04:53.840> a

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
wasn't really key holy and then got a

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.930 
wasn't really key holy and then got a
couple<00:04:54.140> other<00:04:54.380> shots<00:04:54.680> that<00:04:54.950> one<00:04:55.130> maybe<00:04:55.490> had<00:04:55.910> a

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
couple other shots that one maybe had a

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.330 
couple other shots that one maybe had a
little<00:04:56.270> bit<00:04:56.570> of<00:04:56.720> a<00:04:56.840> angle<00:04:57.440> as<00:04:57.590> it<00:04:57.740> went<00:04:58.040> into

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
little bit of a angle as it went into

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.440 
little bit of a angle as it went into
the<00:04:58.370> target<00:04:58.910> but<00:04:59.320> overall<00:05:00.320> the<00:05:01.090> key<00:05:02.090> holding

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
the target but overall the key holding

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.210 
the target but overall the key holding
doesn't<00:05:02.810> seem<00:05:02.990> to<00:05:03.080> be<00:05:03.230> too<00:05:03.440> bad<00:05:03.680> out<00:05:03.950> of<00:05:04.100> this

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
doesn't seem to be too bad out of this

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.450 
doesn't seem to be too bad out of this
gun<00:05:05.110> 38<00:05:06.110> yards<00:05:06.470> one<00:05:06.620> in<00:05:06.770> 16-inch<00:05:07.370> twists<00:05:07.700> so

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
gun 38 yards one in 16-inch twists so

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.820 
gun 38 yards one in 16-inch twists so
between<00:05:10.460> the<00:05:10.700> two<00:05:10.730> I<00:05:11.210> really<00:05:12.110> like<00:05:12.470> the

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
between the two I really like the

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.150 
between the two I really like the
accuracy<00:05:13.580> of<00:05:13.610> the<00:05:14.290> Jim<00:05:15.290> tech<00:05:15.560> it's<00:05:15.860> hard<00:05:16.040> to

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
accuracy of the Jim tech it's hard to

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.370 
accuracy of the Jim tech it's hard to
beat<00:05:16.340> a<00:05:16.370> group<00:05:16.940> like<00:05:17.180> that<00:05:17.210> at<00:05:17.570> 38<00:05:17.990> yards

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
beat a group like that at 38 yards

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.620 
beat a group like that at 38 yards
that's<00:05:19.160> probably<00:05:19.550> about<00:05:19.670> a<00:05:19.790> quarter<00:05:20.150> I<00:05:20.360> could

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
that's probably about a quarter I could

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.270 
that's probably about a quarter I could
cover<00:05:20.810> that<00:05:20.930> with<00:05:21.200> a<00:05:21.230> quarter<00:05:21.740> and<00:05:21.890> over<00:05:22.070> here

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
cover that with a quarter and over here

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.120 
cover that with a quarter and over here
take<00:05:22.610> care<00:05:22.850> a<00:05:22.880> bit<00:05:23.090> of<00:05:23.240> a<00:05:23.300> $0.50<00:05:23.900> theta<00:05:24.169> believe

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
take care a bit of a $0.50 theta believe

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.190 
take care a bit of a $0.50 theta believe
you<00:05:25.280> get<00:05:25.400> that<00:05:25.550> covered<00:05:25.910> but<00:05:26.060> let's<00:05:26.840> do<00:05:27.020> one

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
you get that covered but let's do one

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.980 
you get that covered but let's do one
more<00:05:27.230> test<00:05:27.620> I've<00:05:27.890> got<00:05:28.070> some<00:05:28.600> watermelon<00:05:29.600> that

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
more test I've got some watermelon that

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.330 
more test I've got some watermelon that
came<00:05:30.260> out<00:05:30.440> of<00:05:30.560> the<00:05:30.650> garden<00:05:30.830> that<00:05:31.130> weren't

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
came out of the garden that weren't

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.920 
came out of the garden that weren't
quite<00:05:31.580> mature<00:05:32.060> by<00:05:32.300> the<00:05:32.360> end<00:05:32.600> of<00:05:32.690> the<00:05:32.780> growing

cavitation on the inside of that melon I

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.909 
cavitation on the inside of that melon I
don't<00:07:02.780> know<00:07:02.840> how<00:07:02.930> well<00:07:03.110> you<00:07:03.169> can<00:07:03.229> see<00:07:03.500> that<00:07:03.710> but

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:03.919 
don't know how well you can see that but

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:07.090 
don't know how well you can see that but
it's<00:07:04.070> missing<00:07:04.910> some<00:07:05.210> meat<00:07:05.419> in<00:07:05.449> there<00:07:05.780> and<00:07:06.100> then

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:07.100 
it's missing some meat in there and then

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.240 
it's missing some meat in there and then
this<00:07:07.280> is<00:07:07.340> the<00:07:07.669> Aguila<00:07:08.150> now<00:07:08.539> I<00:07:08.570> did

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:09.250 
this is the Aguila now I did

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.190 
this is the Aguila now I did
I'm<00:07:10.250> sorry<00:07:10.520> here's<00:07:10.850> the<00:07:10.970> Aguila<00:07:11.419> you<00:07:11.600> can<00:07:11.780> see

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:12.200 
I'm sorry here's the Aguila you can see

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.920 
I'm sorry here's the Aguila you can see
well<00:07:12.530> maybe<00:07:12.710> you<00:07:12.889> can<00:07:13.010> see<00:07:13.220> it<00:07:13.690> really<00:07:14.690> did<00:07:14.900> a

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:14.930 
well maybe you can see it really did a

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.520 
well maybe you can see it really did a
cavity<00:07:15.440> job<00:07:15.710> on<00:07:15.950> the<00:07:16.100> backside<00:07:16.789> of<00:07:16.820> this<00:07:17.030> melon

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:17.530 
cavity job on the backside of this melon

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:22.150 
cavity job on the backside of this melon
so<00:07:18.669> overall<00:07:19.669> I'd<00:07:20.060> have<00:07:20.210> to<00:07:20.360> say<00:07:20.950> points<00:07:21.950> go<00:07:22.130> to

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 
so overall I'd have to say points go to

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.589 
so overall I'd have to say points go to
Aguila<00:07:23.260> certainly<00:07:24.260> for<00:07:24.500> the<00:07:25.599> carnal

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:26.599 
Aguila certainly for the carnal

00:07:26.599 --> 00:07:30.279 
Aguila certainly for the carnal
destruction<00:07:27.610> but<00:07:28.610> in<00:07:29.210> terms<00:07:29.539> of<00:07:29.750> the<00:07:29.840> accuracy

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:30.289 
destruction but in terms of the accuracy

00:07:30.289 --> 00:07:33.490 
destruction but in terms of the accuracy
I<00:07:30.820> guess<00:07:31.820> it<00:07:32.090> still<00:07:32.750> looks<00:07:33.020> like<00:07:33.200> it's<00:07:33.380> going

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:33.500 
I guess it still looks like it's going

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.250 
I guess it still looks like it's going
to<00:07:33.590> go<00:07:33.800> over<00:07:34.070> to<00:07:34.220> the<00:07:34.370> gym<00:07:34.880> tech<00:07:35.180> but<00:07:35.419> I<00:07:35.660> guess

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:36.260 
to go over to the gym tech but I guess

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.879 
to go over to the gym tech but I guess
it's<00:07:36.440> what<00:07:36.620> you<00:07:37.060> really<00:07:38.060> need<00:07:38.389> if<00:07:38.690> you<00:07:38.840> if<00:07:39.710> you

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:39.889 
it's what you really need if you if you

00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:41.200 
it's what you really need if you if you
think<00:07:40.130> you<00:07:40.250> can<00:07:40.370> put<00:07:40.520> the<00:07:40.639> round<00:07:40.849> where<00:07:41.090> you

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:41.210 
think you can put the round where you

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.779 
think you can put the round where you
want<00:07:41.419> it<00:07:41.620> and<00:07:42.620> I<00:07:42.740> believe<00:07:42.979> I<00:07:43.070> can<00:07:43.099> with<00:07:43.490> a<00:07:43.520> hog

00:07:43.779 --> 00:07:43.789 
want it and I believe I can with a hog

00:07:43.789 --> 00:07:47.680 
want it and I believe I can with a hog
and<00:07:45.039> do<00:07:46.039> a<00:07:46.070> pretty<00:07:46.310> good<00:07:46.430> job<00:07:46.580> on<00:07:46.880> shot

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:47.690 
and do a pretty good job on shot

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.450 
and do a pretty good job on shot
placement<00:07:47.960> then<00:07:48.320> I'm<00:07:48.440> going<00:07:48.590> to<00:07:48.620> try<00:07:49.250> and<00:07:49.370> go

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:49.460 
placement then I'm going to try and go

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.219 
placement then I'm going to try and go
with<00:07:49.490> the<00:07:49.760> Aguila<00:07:50.120> on<00:07:50.240> the<00:07:50.389> hog<00:07:50.570> and<00:07:50.840> see<00:07:51.020> if<00:07:51.139> I

00:07:51.219 --> 00:07:51.229 
with the Aguila on the hog and see if I

00:07:51.229 --> 00:07:53.560 
with the Aguila on the hog and see if I
can't<00:07:51.440> get<00:07:51.590> a<00:07:51.760> knockdown<00:07:52.760> right<00:07:53.240> straight

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:53.570 
can't get a knockdown right straight
