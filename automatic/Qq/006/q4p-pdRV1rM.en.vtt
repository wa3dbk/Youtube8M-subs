00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
that's as bright as it goes and now I'll

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.810 
that's as bright as it goes and now I'll

cheap it came with no game but it did

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.650 
cheap it came with no game but it did
come<00:02:56.230> with<00:02:56.350> the<00:02:56.470> system<00:02:56.890> and<00:02:57.280> a<00:02:58.120> charger

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
come with the system and a charger

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.600

they're<00:02:59.530> both<00:02:59.709> used<00:02:59.980> but<00:03:00.190> they<00:03:00.280> both<00:03:00.370> work

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610

great<00:03:00.720> one<00:03:01.720> thing<00:03:01.870> I'm<00:03:01.959> really<00:03:01.990> surprised

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
great one thing I'm really surprised

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.260 
great one thing I'm really surprised
about<00:03:02.709> what<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.040> system<00:03:03.220> is<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.940> battery

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
about what the system is the battery

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.750 
about what the system is the battery
life<00:03:04.450> I<00:03:04.750> mean<00:03:05.140> you<00:03:05.500> charge<00:03:05.800> it<00:03:05.950> for<00:03:06.130> two<00:03:06.640> or

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
life I mean you charge it for two or

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.340 
life I mean you charge it for two or
three<00:03:06.880> hours<00:03:06.910> and<00:03:07.420> then<00:03:07.540> you<00:03:07.810> can<00:03:08.110> probably

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
three hours and then you can probably

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.710 
three hours and then you can probably
play<00:03:08.560> it<00:03:08.680> for<00:03:08.890> weeks<00:03:09.160> without<00:03:10.030> ever<00:03:10.390> having<00:03:10.510> to

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
play it for weeks without ever having to

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.350 
play it for weeks without ever having to
recharge<00:03:11.110> it<00:03:11.340> it's<00:03:12.340> got<00:03:12.489> a<00:03:12.520> real<00:03:12.850> real<00:03:13.120> good

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
recharge it it's got a real real good

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.240 
recharge it it's got a real real good
battery<00:03:13.630> time<00:03:13.810> I'm<00:03:14.440> assuming<00:03:14.860> just<00:03:15.010> goes<00:03:15.130> with

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
battery time I'm assuming just goes with

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.610 
battery time I'm assuming just goes with
a<00:03:15.280> very<00:03:15.430> small<00:03:15.700> screen<00:03:16.320> there's<00:03:17.320> only<00:03:17.410> one

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
a very small screen there's only one

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.740 
a very small screen there's only one
speaker<00:03:18.070> there's<00:03:18.550> not<00:03:18.730> too<00:03:18.970> like<00:03:19.540> most

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
speaker there's not too like most

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.970 
speaker there's not too like most
systems<00:03:20.140> so<00:03:21.130> it's<00:03:21.730> very<00:03:21.880> simple<00:03:22.500> real<00:03:23.500> cool<00:03:23.739> I

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980
