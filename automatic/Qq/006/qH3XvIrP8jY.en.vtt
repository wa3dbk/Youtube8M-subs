 Yes, that 's possible 

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:25.542
 Man can fly 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:31.916
 No, it 's not happening 

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:35.785
 ...rooster? How strange 

00:01:35.862 --> 00:01:38.831
 And even if a flightless bird of its kind was able to climb into the machine 

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:41.833
 The lack of oxygen will make breathing impossible 

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:44.335
 Also, he is wearing pajamas ... so apparently it is simple 

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:45.962
 Dream. 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.668

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:57.962
 - London England - 

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:02.644
 - Bank of England -! The bank was robbed 

00:02:02.722 --> 00:02:05.850
 Quickly surround the building - 

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:08.792
 Go there! And you go away 

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:18.700
 !here he is 

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:21.638
 Come on, people, 

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:49.466
 That way 

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:16.120
 He went away, I'm sure of that! 

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:18.562
 Come on, friend! 

00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:25.237
 "Sorry, sir 

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:51.795
 Today is the day when I will be able to do what many thought was impossible 

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:55.493
 The person can break the 50 miles per hour barrier 

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:58.765
 And you're lucky to take part, Pierre 

00:03:58.838 --> 00:04:01.500
 My name is Jean Michel, sir. 

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:05.237
 , We will make a history of our own. Or we will die while trying 

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:08.606
 This thing is very exciting - 

00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:12.048
 that's it! I refuse to inject, by throwing stones 

00:04:12.118 --> 00:04:16.316
 To be electrocuted, or to contribute my body to science 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.056
 !I quit 

00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:24.919
 He 's the most morbid person 

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:30.101
 Electrocution was not my fault 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.764
 You refused to wear your rubber panties 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.865
 We're looking for a bank robber 

00:04:38.244 --> 00:04:41.077
 Is there a man brave enough to be my personal servant? 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.653
 I am your new personal servant 

00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:52.418
 But, I have to give ... the role of the personal servant 

00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:57.724
 And I'm sure that in heaven you know it well, only the French 

00:04:57.797 --> 00:05:00.994
 Of course, sorry, yes, yes 

00:05:01.067 --> 00:05:04.696
 I come from a French family with a tradition of personal service 

00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:07.797
 On my father's side, very, very French 

00:05:07.874 --> 00:05:12.402
 But your accent. My French father, he never spoke- 

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:17.506
 , My mother was Chinese and never shut her mouth. All the children got her accent 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.412
 .Fine 

00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:25.014
 Would you be willing to risk your life in order to challenge the laws of physics? 

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:29.585
 Yes, and I also know how to sing great. Put this hat on you - 

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:32.825
 He must have been here! 

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:41.273
 And the throttle in your right hand controls your speed 

00:05:46.312 --> 00:05:49.804
 How do I stop myself! 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.467
 Twenty-five miles an hour, the pressure is steady 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.134
 We need more speed, man 

00:06:21.247 --> 00:06:24.614
 , Forty miles per hour. Hold tight, personal good 

00:06:30.156 --> 00:06:32.420
 ...Forty seven 

00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:34.050
 ...Forty-eight 

00:06:34.127 --> 00:06:35.924
 ...forty nine 

00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:37.986
 I succeeded! We have succeeded in doing so 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:52.534
 Sorry, sorry, good morning 

00:06:52.612 --> 00:06:56.378
 I 'm looking for a man with ... I' m here. 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:58.212
 Here it is, my personal servant 

00:07:01.454 --> 00:07:03.752
 .Sorry! New server 

00:07:20.907 --> 00:07:23.603
 Good morning. Good morning. 

00:07:24.476 --> 00:07:26.977
 You can let go of your grasp. In a few seconds 

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:28.947
 The tank will be empty of steam 

00:07:29.015 --> 00:07:33.782
 Three, two, one 

00:07:33.853 --> 00:07:35.616
 .now 

00:07:35.688 --> 00:07:37.986
 !Bend over 

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.056
 All the respect, we broke the barrier of human speed 

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.099
 "Goodbye, sir 

00:07:47.166 --> 00:07:50.192
 It was nice to serve you 

00:07:51.037 --> 00:07:54.370
 We will do it again as soon as possible 

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.702
 Wait a minute, wait 

00:07:55.775 --> 00:07:59.541
 , Together with you as my personal servant. I will be able to examine all my inventions 

00:08:00.346 --> 00:08:01.677
 !No 

00:08:01.747 --> 00:08:03.271
 Spread on the surface 

00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:05.078
 - Yeah, yeah. 

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:07.984
 - I 'il take the job! 

00:08:08.054 --> 00:08:10.215
 I'm just so eager to present my achievement to the Royal Academy 

00:08:12.124 --> 00:08:15.787
 Kindly, thank you 

00:08:15.862 --> 00:08:20.526
 For the grant for the development of the application 

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.933
 Dr. Ramsey invented it 

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.434
 , Should not even say that the Royal Academy of Science 

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:34.503
 , Declared this puzzling thing, useless 

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:38.778
 And sent his crazy inventor to isolation 

00:08:40.286 --> 00:08:43.551
 Sir, I have an urgent message for you, here 

00:08:43.623 --> 00:08:46.558
 Do not just stand there, read it 

00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:52.390
 , We announce with great sorrow " 

00:08:52.465 --> 00:08:55.161
 , Which the Scottish royal court informs " 

00:08:55.234 --> 00:08:58.101
 "The Bank of England was robbed 

00:08:59.238 --> 00:09:03.197
 My stolen Buddha statue was stolen, you 're a piece of damage 

00:09:03.276 --> 00:09:06.905
 You gave me every promise that the Bank of England is impenetrable 

00:09:06.979 --> 00:09:09.573
 "Sir, sir, I said," invulnerable 

00:09:09.649 --> 00:09:12.482
 It 's the same, you moron 

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:16.719
 Please, please, just not the colums 

00:09:16.789 --> 00:09:18.222
 Lord Salisbury 

00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:22.751
 , Please contact Champion Fang and let her know that if I do not have the Buddha statue, then there is no deal 

00:09:22.828 --> 00:09:26.730
 Forget your commitment to me. It would be disrespectful, Lord Kelvin 

00:09:27.466 --> 00:09:30.367
 A woman at the Royal Academy 

00:09:30.436 --> 00:09:34.202
 The Buddha statue was safely transferred by us to the Bank of England 

00:09:34.273 --> 00:09:38.437
 What happens to a statue while it is in its hands is British... It is certainly your personal concern 

00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:41.639
 , Colonel Kitchener, head of the Scottish court 

00:09:41.714 --> 00:09:46.117
 Please tell Pang if other items were stolen from the bank 

00:09:46.185 --> 00:09:49.677
 Nothing else 

00:09:49.755 --> 00:09:51.188
 .exactly 

00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:56.285
 , Probably the small conflict in your country. He poured himself to the shores of our noble country 

00:09:56.362 --> 00:09:59.024
 , Until the Buddha statue is not restored to my strength 

00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:04.297
 , Neither you nor your agents. You will not get any military help from Britain 

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:05.632
 Kitschner 

00:10:08.541 --> 00:10:12.910
 Agents will return to you the statue of the Lord, Lord Kelvin 

00:10:12.979 --> 00:10:16.938
 But this time, do not let him slip through your fingers 

00:10:34.033 --> 00:10:36.194
 Female command 

00:10:36.268 --> 00:10:39.829
 What a pathetic man gets instructions from a woman 

00:10:43.542 --> 00:10:45.601
 !Cool 

00:10:45.678 --> 00:10:49.205

 She passes fresh air into the house 

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:05.623
 Kitchen accessories are located on the white belt 

00:11:05.698 --> 00:11:07.791
 And blue is for laundry 

00:11:07.867 --> 00:11:10.233

00:11:10.302 --> 00:11:13.931
 Continuous power supply

 This is my comprehensive information log that contains all the basic rules 

00:11:21.781 --> 00:11:25.842
 It's quite simple, do not distract me and turn it into one of my plans 

00:11:25.918 --> 00:11:28.443
 I must live my life with absolute efficiency 

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:31.046
 , In order to increase the number of inventions 

00:11:31.123 --> 00:11:34.684
 Which will enable me to derive from myself the maximum for the future of humanity 

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:39.493
 Mr. Fogg, you are a noble and precise master 

00:11:39.565 --> 00:11:44.901

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:07.550
 Not exactly, just a scientific invention ... that has not yet been published 

00:12:07.626 --> 00:12:10.356
 From an American named Thomas Edison 

00:12:10.429 --> 00:12:12.590
 They turn on by whistling 

00:12:15.301 --> 00:12:18.270
 Please do not 

00:12:18.871 --> 00:12:24.171
 I see that your eyes are drawn to what I hope will one day become my greatest invention 

00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:26.438
 Giant bat 

00:12:27.913 --> 00:12:30.939
 This is a flying machine - this thing can fly - 

00:12:31.016 --> 00:12:33.348
 .Yes 

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:35.979
 No, but it will fly someday 

00:12:36.055 --> 00:12:38.922
 I've recently solved the problem of steering the ropes of it 

00:12:38.991 --> 00:12:41.152
 And that damn chicken 

00:12:41.227 --> 00:12:44.526
 One day this thing will pass people through the air 

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.827
 And perhaps even beyond the passage of whole oceans 

00:12:50.569 --> 00:12:53.936
 I am afraid that I will have to legislate against it 

00:13:06.552 --> 00:13:08.713
 Dear Father 

00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:12.747
 Soon I will find the fastest way back to China 

00:13:12.825 --> 00:13:16.056
 To make our village safe from dangers again 

00:13:31.177 --> 00:13:32.667
 Passeparto 

00:13:32.745 --> 00:13:37.614
 Exit immediately to the Royal Scientific Academy in about 2 minutes 

00:13:37.683 --> 00:13:41.175
 Take my urban transportation with you 

00:13:41.687 --> 00:13:44.789
 These are the shoes with the little wheels 

00:13:47.292 --> 00:13:48.987
 Open a path 

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:51.460
 Mr. Fogg! Caution 

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.655
 Excuse me, get out of the way 

00:13:56.234 --> 00:13:57.997
 - Get out of the way. 

00:13:58.069 --> 00:14:00.435
 Hey, 

00:14:00.505 --> 00:14:03.838
 Exactly 10 minutes before noon 

00:14:03.875 --> 00:14:05.433
 .That's enough 

00:14:09.881 --> 00:14:11.746
 Gentlemen 

00:14:11.816 --> 00:14:19.823
 Today I have proved that man can break the fifty mile barrier without hurting his limbs 

00:14:20.959 --> 00:14:24.486
 And where exactly is your confirmation from the Royal Academy of Science? 

00:14:24.562 --> 00:14:26.962
 What did I think? What a fool 

00:14:27.031 --> 00:14:30.159
 It actually implied that you were a real scientist 

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:37.103
 According to your definition, the true purpose of the scientist will be to prevent humanity from advancing 

00:14:37.976 --> 00:14:40.137
 We live in the Golden Age, Fog 

00:14:40.211 --> 00:14:43.271
 Everything that was worth it 

00:14:43.348 --> 00:14:48.883
 , And there are still sober dreamers, like you, for example ... who dream of an imaginary past full of dinosaurs 

00:14:48.953 --> 00:14:50.477
 .Oabolotziot 

00:14:50.555 --> 00:14:54.758
 , And your future is full of motorized vehicles 

00:14:54.826 --> 00:14:57.158
 ,radio waves 

00:14:57.228 --> 00:14:59.162
 And aircraft 

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:02.461
 I'm sick of it! The damn bank of England is a madhouse 

00:15:04.369 --> 00:15:07.304
 The rumor is that the thief is a stranger, an Asian guy 

00:15:08.373 --> 00:15:10.807
 The rumor is that the thief is a stranger 

00:15:14.245 --> 00:15:15.576
 .is nothing 

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:23.510
 Yes, I heard it was a Chinese boy, and he acted alone 

00:15:29.994 --> 00:15:34.192
 No, actually. They say he was a Norwegian 

00:15:38.169 --> 00:15:41.434
 In fact, they say, it was a group of Norwegian seniors 

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.765
 Yes, I heard about it from a very reliable source 

00:15:44.842 --> 00:15:47.777
 It was a bunch of Norwegians with red hair 

00:15:47.845 --> 00:15:49.544
 With very small legs 

00:15:51.549 --> 00:15:55.143
 If you ask me, the time has come. Somebody will rob this bank 

00:15:56.019 --> 00:15:59.546
 , Just like this institution. The Bank of England is out of date 

00:16:00.623 --> 00:16:02.883
 And as usual, your contempt for tradition is simply horrifying 

00:16:02.894 --> 00:16:05.954
 , You will continue to lean on your tradition if you wish 

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:10.364
 , But, just like in the case of this thief. The process is not waiting for anyone 

00:16:10.601 --> 00:16:14.000
 So now you've made me an expert. I've been stealing from banks as well 

00:16:14.038 --> 00:16:17.205
 Do with us the good and save yourself. Your wisdom is indescribable, Fog 

00:16:20.111 --> 00:16:23.410
 About 26 minutes ago, a ship left the town of Dover in the direction of Paris 

00:16:23.481 --> 00:16:26.143
 , From there, the thief will take a fast night train 

00:16:26.217 --> 00:16:29.618
 , And then he would take a ship from Istanbul to India 

00:16:29.687 --> 00:16:32.612
 , In a period of just over a month. This man can reach China 

00:16:33.057 --> 00:16:39.999
 If we follow Fogg's calculations, this man will circumnavigate the world and return to England at midnight 

00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:50.571
 In fact, according to my calculations, it will be closer to exactly 80 days 

00:16:57.615 --> 00:16:59.879
 .Great idea 

00:16:59.951 --> 00:17:01.919
 Well, Fogg 

00:17:01.986 --> 00:17:07.356
 Let's see you around the world in 80 days 

00:17:08.226 --> 00:17:13.224
 I ... it would be a waste, a waste of my own time 

00:17:13.225 --> 00:17:18.334
 ... I am now preoccupied with far more limitless ... countless scientific breakthroughs 

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:21.999
 You're a coward, thank you. This is impossible 

00:17:22.307 --> 00:17:26.174
 .It is possible! I can do it 

00:17:26.243 --> 00:17:27.575
 B 

00:17:27.645 --> 00:17:30.876
 About ten thousand pounds 

00:17:31.516 --> 00:17:35.317
 , Unlike you and your colleagues. Money is not a source of inspiration for me 

00:17:35.353 --> 00:17:39.119
 I believe everyone has a price 

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:43.286
 Even you, the noble Phileas Fogg 

00:17:43.361 --> 00:17:47.991
 Sure there's something interesting I can offer you to be worth your time 

00:17:51.069 --> 00:17:55.566
 There is one thing, your place. As head of the Royal Academy 

00:17:58.543 --> 00:18:04.173
 With the help of the Queen, I will be able to lead Britain and the world into a new era of progress and discovery 

00:18:07.385 --> 00:18:09.714
 What? 

00:18:11.055 --> 00:18:14.821
 I, Lord Calvin, swear by that 

00:18:14.892 --> 00:18:19.563
 That I would give up my throne as head of the Royal Academy of Phileas Fogg 

00:18:19.564 --> 00:18:21.657
 !no no! No- 

00:18:21.733 --> 00:18:25.635
 ... if he could surround the world 

00:18:25.703 --> 00:18:28.297
 B. No more than 80 days 

00:18:30.007 --> 00:18:32.100
 , But if not 

00:18:32.176 --> 00:18:36.272
 He would never be allowed to set foot in this academy 

00:18:36.781 --> 00:18:42.185
 He would have to dismantle this ugly and ugly thing he calls a lab 

00:18:42.253 --> 00:18:44.813
 ... and he will have to swear 

00:18:44.889 --> 00:18:48.249
 He will never invent again 

00:18:51.662 --> 00:18:54.264
 Just as I always thought, Fogg 

00:18:54.265 --> 00:18:57.523
 You promise so much 

00:18:58.902 --> 00:18:59.694
 .Nothing 

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.970
 - I 'il take your bet, what did you say? 

00:19:06.377 --> 00:19:08.311
 I 'il take your bet 

00:19:09.347 --> 00:19:10.712
 He took it 

00:19:14.352 --> 00:19:16.149
 Then everything is settled 

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:20.520
 A man who never set foot for the outside of Britain, surrounds the world 

00:19:22.226 --> 00:19:24.717
 It's going to be so funny 

00:19:26.998 --> 00:19:31.735
 , History will not remember your amusement, Lord Kelvin, but it will be hard to forget the moment 

00:19:31.736 --> 00:19:36.135
 Where I will stand at the top of the Royal Academy of Sciences 

00:19:37.707 --> 00:19:39.351
 , At exactly midnight 

00:19:39.377 --> 00:19:46.075
 , After I, Phileas Fogg. I surrounded the world in 80 days 

00:19:52.757 --> 00:19:54.156
 Good God 

00:19:55.226 --> 00:20:00.664
 Mr. Fogg, are we packed and ready to go out? Mr. Fogg, are you there? 

00:20:00.731 --> 00:20:03.928
 Pilias! Phileas! Phileas 

00:20:05.336 --> 00:20:08.066
 Mr. Fogg, are you feeling well, sir? 

00:20:10.007 --> 00:20:11.941
 Passeparto 

00:20:13.044 --> 00:20:16.013
 Would you be kind enough to sit with me for a moment? 

00:20:21.619 --> 00:20:22.711
 .Yes sir 

00:20:28.092 --> 00:20:31.493
 I risked everything 

00:20:32.797 --> 00:20:35.823
 For what you believe in 

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.926
 Nothing seems more logical than that, sir 

00:20:44.308 --> 00:20:46.999
 You're a respectable man, Passeparto 

00:20:47.478 --> 00:20:51.573
 But I'm afraid it was a terrible thing to do 

00:20:55.353 --> 00:20:57.048
 - Mr. Fogg? 

00:20:57.755 --> 00:21:01.999
 ... perhaps you will inform your family about this. There is not a single person alive to tell him about it - 

00:21:02.026 --> 00:21:05.291
 This house and my inventions are all I have left 

00:21:09.834 --> 00:21:15.531
 And a courageous French personal servant who will help you get around the world in 80 days 

00:21:19.644 --> 00:21:22.511
 Do you really believe that we can succeed? -Yes 

00:21:23.147 --> 00:21:25.945
 !Yes Yes Yes 

00:21:26.017 --> 00:21:29.809
 You're crazy, we'll turn into pieces before we get to India 

00:21:31.956 --> 00:21:33.389
 We support you, sir 

00:21:36.961 --> 00:21:38.656
 !Successfully 

00:21:43.467 --> 00:21:45.332
 !under arrest 

00:21:48.072 --> 00:21:51.667
 "You have a strange contraption here, Mr. Fogg. Thank you, Detective- 

00:21:51.742 --> 00:21:57.544
 But I'm afraid I'll have to follow you, and you're in custody until further notice 

00:21:57.615 --> 00:22:02.718
 This thing you have here is a blunt violation of the city's new automotive code 

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.278
 • Vehicle code 

00:22:04.955 --> 00:22:07.118
 Code 431 

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:11.286
 All vehicles must be driven by horses 

00:22:11.361 --> 00:22:14.195
 ... or four-legged animals that are like a description 

00:22:14.265 --> 00:22:16.130
 Except for the giraffes and 

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:21.462
 You talk nonsense, move aside, I'm going up to the deck of a wonderful journey around the world 

00:22:21.538 --> 00:22:23.999
 But not in this monster, no 

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:26.074
 .It's hot 

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:27.775
 !It is not... 

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:42.088
 It 's time to go. We have a ship to catch 

00:22:42.159 --> 00:22:45.595
 To steal a police vehicle is an unacceptable way to start the burden 

00:22:45.663 --> 00:22:48.528
 Do not steal, lend ... forgive us - 

00:22:48.532 --> 00:22:50.901
 We borrow this vehicle to catch a ship going to Paris 

00:22:50.968 --> 00:22:53.766
 If only someone can inform the authorities 

00:23:02.913 --> 00:23:06.076
 !damn it! My brain is leaking 

00:23:09.487 --> 00:23:11.977
 Damn that fool, Peaks 

00:23:12.055 --> 00:23:13.887
 ... What's the point of hiring a fake corrupt cop? 

00:23:13.958 --> 00:23:16.126
 If he can not use the law in a corrupt way 

00:23:16.193 --> 00:23:17.626
 Yes, sir. 

00:23:17.695 --> 00:23:19.629
 Tell Packix to pack 

00:23:19.697 --> 00:23:21.722
 He's going for a little walk. Right away, sir- 

00:23:23.595 --> 00:23:26.340
 Return the Buddha statue to Paris 

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.124
 ... and in connection with Lao Zing 

00:23:29.628 --> 00:23:31.853
 They killed him 

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:58.940
 - The 2nd Day - Paris - 

00:24:13.119 --> 00:24:14.211
 .smart man 

00:24:14.287 --> 00:24:21.226
 Passeparto is supposed to be insolent, that if we do not leave within six and a half hours, we will lose our contact in Constantinople 

00:24:21.294 --> 00:24:24.195
 ,Yes sir. Please ... we are in a hurry 

00:24:24.263 --> 00:24:25.525
 - Yes, 

00:24:25.598 --> 00:24:27.657
 French 

00:24:40.098 --> 00:24:41.057
 You're dumb 

00:24:46.018 --> 00:24:47.713
 ?what did he say 

00:24:48.721 --> 00:24:49.745
 ...he said 

00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:59.760
 what? "He does not have to worry." 

00:24:59.832 --> 00:25:03.928
 , The next train leaves in five hours. There is time to visit resorts 

00:25:04.003 --> 00:25:07.598
 Passeparto, this is a science expedition, not a vacation 

00:25:07.673 --> 00:25:09.766
 I will not miss this train 

00:25:13.446 --> 00:25:15.175
 It 's just amazing. 

00:25:15.248 --> 00:25:16.840
 ?What it means 

00:25:16.916 --> 00:25:19.316
 Eddie Thomson will present his inventions today 

00:25:19.385 --> 00:25:21.615
 Thomas Edison, here in Paris 

00:25:21.687 --> 00:25:24.679
 This is a good opportunity for you to meet another great inventor 

00:25:24.757 --> 00:25:28.420
 I'd love to tell him about the improvement I made with the whistle 

00:25:28.494 --> 00:25:29.620
 .A good idea 

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.225
 Here 's an exhibition, science 

00:25:50.883 --> 00:25:53.750
 I assure you that these are not Thomas Edison's works 

00:25:53.819 --> 00:25:56.344
 I think he's somewhere around 

00:25:56.889 --> 00:26:00.757
 Wait a second, it 's not science 

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.289
 This is art 

00:26:03.362 --> 00:26:04.795
 .Yes 

00:26:04.864 --> 00:26:07.059
 , This painting is really inaccurate 

00:26:07.133 --> 00:26:09.897
 It should not be accurate 

00:26:11.037 --> 00:26:14.939
 The artist sees reality through imagination 

00:26:15.007 --> 00:26:18.238
 And not just copying it 

00:26:18.311 --> 00:26:21.007
 This is called Impressionism 

00:26:22.381 --> 00:26:25.578
 Well, it really did not impress me 

00:26:25.651 --> 00:26:29.212
 , Trees are not purple. And the tree is not gray 

00:26:29.288 --> 00:26:31.153
 ... and no one can 

00:26:41.934 --> 00:26:43.401
 .fly 

00:26:43.469 --> 00:26:45.460
 You feel something 

00:26:45.972 --> 00:26:47.803
 You dream of flying 

00:26:47.873 --> 00:26:50.569
 Or you dream of naked guys 

00:26:50.643 --> 00:26:53.111
 ...sometimes 

00:26:53.179 --> 00:26:56.342
 On the flight. Not the naked guys 

00:26:56.415 --> 00:26:59.350
 I'm glad you liked my painting, Monique Laroche 

00:26:59.418 --> 00:27:03.650
 Phileas Fogg, and I must say that this painting is much better than all the other amateurs 

00:27:03.723 --> 00:27:05.782
 ?what did he say 

00:27:08.427 --> 00:27:08.990
 .Oh no 

00:27:09.542 --> 00:27:10.339
 .Not again 

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:17.540
 Who is responsible for this vandalism? 

00:27:17.841 --> 00:27:19.740
 It 's mine sir, it satisfies you 

00:27:19.741 --> 00:27:21.341
 ?satisfies me 

00:27:23.942 --> 00:27:26.942
 You want to hang something? 

00:27:26.943 --> 00:27:30.043
 , So go and hang people's coats. That's exactly what you're getting for 

00:27:30.044 --> 00:27:30.844
 But sir 

00:27:30.945 --> 00:27:31.345
 Actually, no 

00:27:32.546 --> 00:27:33.546
 .You're fired 

00:27:34.848 --> 00:27:36.548
 Leave the art to the artists 

00:27:40.393 --> 00:27:43.226
 - Jesus Christ, what was that? 

00:27:43.295 --> 00:27:47.231
 Well, a rich man bought my painting. He paid a lot of money for it 

00:27:48.034 --> 00:27:49.831
 Champagne for everyone 

00:28:02.982 --> 00:28:07.043
 I 'm still looking for Mr. Eddie. Nice painting by the way 

00:28:09.755 --> 00:28:12.451
 Have you considered a career in schematic painting? 

00:28:13.159 --> 00:28:15.855
 No, it would be too limited 

00:28:15.928 --> 00:28:18.226
 At least your work shows great success 

00:28:19.665 --> 00:28:23.601
 Thank you, these. I painted a few months ago 

00:28:23.669 --> 00:28:25.603
 I lacked inspiration 

00:28:25.671 --> 00:28:29.300
 I found some people to help me find Mr. Edimon 

00:28:30.409 --> 00:28:33.344
 Please, thank you very much. 

00:28:35.181 --> 00:28:36.580
 He is very enthusiastic 

00:28:38.751 --> 00:28:40.150
 .Caught him 

00:28:47.927 --> 00:28:51.920
 No, no, no. It's awfully ugly 

00:28:51.997 --> 00:28:53.521
 No, no 

00:28:53.599 --> 00:28:54.861
 "Yes 

00:28:54.934 --> 00:28:56.128
 .Yes 

00:28:56.635 --> 00:28:58.125
 , Is a clown 

00:28:58.204 --> 00:29:00.263
 ...Yet 

00:29:00.339 --> 00:29:02.569
 He's very nervous 

00:29:02.641 --> 00:29:06.099
 The irony of this is simply appalling 

00:29:06.178 --> 00:29:08.169
 Is it good - is it really - 

00:29:37.643 --> 00:29:39.042
 ,It is interesting 

00:29:40.479 --> 00:29:43.642
 , But you see that without a thumbs, a dog in life can not play poker 

00:29:43.716 --> 00:29:45.946
 He could 

00:29:46.018 --> 00:29:48.009
 Where exactly did you see a dog playing poker? 

00:29:48.888 --> 00:29:50.651
 Here, here 

00:30:23.956 --> 00:30:26.220
 Maybe I'm not such a good judge 

00:30:28.561 --> 00:30:33.689
 Criminals, they came to steal all the paintings. 

00:30:41.674 --> 00:30:44.973
 Quickly, come here! 

00:30:47.913 --> 00:30:48.811
 Go 

00:31:12.641 --> 00:31:15.311
 Thank you, Mrs Laroche. You've just saved our trip 

00:31:16.478 --> 00:31:18.856
 I'd like to pay you back 

00:31:18.886 --> 00:31:20.104
 Then take me with you 

00:31:20.271 --> 00:31:21.105
 ?what 

00:31:21.272 --> 00:31:22.941
 I 'm suffocating here 

00:31:23.107 --> 00:31:24.234
 Like I was in a cage 

00:31:24.359 --> 00:31:26.945
 They think I'm worth something. Just as the coat girl 

00:31:27.946 --> 00:31:29.447
 ?Why 

00:31:29.572 --> 00:31:31.115
 Because I'm really the coat girl 

00:31:31.741 --> 00:31:38.498
 Look what one of the critics wrote about my painting 

00:31:39.499 --> 00:31:41.084
 I can 't read it. I think it' s in French 

00:31:41.251 --> 00:31:42.585
 I wish I could not 

00:31:42.586 --> 00:31:43.737
 Why do you carry it with you? 

00:31:43.946 --> 00:31:46.490
 , For the time when I can. So I can throw it in his face 

00:31:46.615 --> 00:31:51.286
 But now, I need a journey around the world to inspire me 

00:31:55.541 --> 00:31:58.001
 We are all inspired to bring us back to the schedule 

00:32:00.128 --> 00:32:01.380
 ...lets see 

00:32:01.547 --> 00:32:04.216
 , The wind volume is approximately 20 knots 

00:32:04.508 --> 00:32:08.178
 The air density is excellent 

00:32:08.303 --> 00:32:11.139
 Paceparto 

00:32:18.647 --> 00:32:21.233
 There you go, Passeparto is supposed to keep the change 

00:32:25.821 --> 00:32:28.115
 We will be around the world in eighty days 

00:32:28.574 --> 00:32:29.825
 God Almighty 

00:32:30.287 --> 00:32:31.746
 They 're crazy 

00:32:34.155 --> 00:32:36.372
 Please, Mrs. Laroche, the balloon can not bear that weight 

00:32:36.373 --> 00:32:39.126
 Your hot weather will compensate for this 

00:32:39.376 --> 00:32:43.088
 Take it easy 

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.220
 ?What are they doing 

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:51.847
 They are rioting 

00:32:52.014 --> 00:32:53.307
 Hey, get it 

00:32:53.473 --> 00:32:56.810
 Passeparto, my suitcase 

00:32:56.977 --> 00:32:58.854
 All my money is there 

00:33:10.824 --> 00:33:13.035
 Hey, lady, this is my bag 

00:33:13.202 --> 00:33:14.703
 No, that's my bag 

00:33:14.995 --> 00:33:16.205
 This is not your case 

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:18.707
 This is my bag, you're crazy 

00:33:22.294 --> 00:33:24.713
 It tickles 

00:33:30.969 --> 00:33:32.054
 He took my bag 

00:33:32.221 --> 00:33:33.430
 Mr. Fogg 

00:33:35.933 --> 00:33:37.184
 Good idea. Thank you. 

00:33:55.452 --> 00:33:57.329
 These are the robbers from the gallery 

00:34:14.972 --> 00:34:18.225
 That bastard stole my wallet 

00:34:41.665 --> 00:34:43.458
 My bag, he stole my wallet 

00:34:45.544 --> 00:34:47.671
 They gave the old woman her purse 

00:34:52.593 --> 00:34:53.969
 We must help Passeparto 

00:34:54.178 --> 00:34:55.470
 How do I lower it? 

00:34:56.805 --> 00:34:57.681
 ?What do you do 

00:34:57.806 --> 00:35:00.934
 Weight reduction will not help 

00:35:01.101 --> 00:35:02.644
 Yes, it will help 

00:35:06.648 --> 00:35:07.816
 Physics, no 

00:35:08.775 --> 00:35:10.027
 .Yes 

00:35:42.309 --> 00:35:44.061
 .Good Morning 

00:35:45.479 --> 00:35:47.272
 .Goodbye 

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:56.365
 Lady, get up 

00:36:00.118 --> 00:36:03.163
 "Wake up, ma'am 

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.340
 I'll see you Mom 

00:36:13.549 --> 00:36:15.676
 See you baby 

00:36:26.103 --> 00:36:27.354
 .very impressive 

00:36:27.563 --> 00:36:29.606
 I would have left the rope already 

00:36:33.694 --> 00:36:35.445
 The sculptor grabs his pants 

00:36:36.446 --> 00:36:38.448
 I do not think he does it on purpose 

00:36:52.254 --> 00:36:54.339
 .Woe 

00:37:15.319 --> 00:37:16.612
 All right, Passeparto 

00:37:16.945 --> 00:37:19.364
 We're still on schedule. Despite these thieves 

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:21.783
 Yes, yes, thank you 

00:37:25.662 --> 00:37:29.041
 These thieves from the Art Gallery have identified you 

00:37:29.666 --> 00:37:31.251
 I look like someone they know 

00:37:32.127 --> 00:37:34.254
 Maybe a Frenchman 

00:37:36.673 --> 00:37:39.801
 So ... where can we get you off? 

00:37:41.261 --> 00:37:42.262
 We do not stop 

00:37:42.554 --> 00:37:44.306
 , As soon as we land in Munich 

00:37:44.598 --> 00:37:45.724
 And you are free to go 

00:37:45.849 --> 00:37:47.726
 .Thank you very much 

00:37:47.976 --> 00:37:49.102
 ?What 

00:37:49.269 --> 00:37:50.854
 .. that you say I'm free to come with you 

00:37:51.063 --> 00:37:53.273
 I didn 't say you' re free to come with me 

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.441
 I said you were free to go 

00:37:54.608 --> 00:37:55.859
 ?where 

00:37:56.109 --> 00:37:57.277
 .Everywhere 

00:37:57.444 --> 00:37:59.238
 Yes, thank you, I'll go with you 

00:38:00.322 --> 00:38:03.158
 No, no, Mrs. Laroche! Monique- 

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:04.284
 Mrs. Monique 

00:38:05.619 --> 00:38:07.621
 Fine, now we get along 

00:38:16.922 --> 00:38:19.258
 Look at the sunrise 

00:38:19.675 --> 00:38:22.719
 There is only one word that can describe it - magical 

00:38:23.136 --> 00:38:24.763
 Mrs. Laroche 

00:38:24.972 --> 00:38:27.599
 I refuse to allow you to continue traveling with us 

00:38:27.766 --> 00:38:29.351
 I 'm not walking with you 

00:38:29.601 --> 00:38:31.061
 I'm walking myself 

00:38:31.478 --> 00:38:33.105
 Maybe you do not have to travel with me 

00:38:33.564 --> 00:38:35.691
 ... that's what happens when you leave home 

00:38:36.066 --> 00:38:37.860
 You meet ... people 

00:38:47.452 --> 00:38:51.456
 Why do you keep using this trick? 

00:38:54.084 --> 00:38:55.836
 Maybe I'll let Mr Fogg know 

00:38:56.044 --> 00:38:58.964
 He and I can deal with speculations together 

00:39:08.974 --> 00:39:12.060
 , A very sacred object was stolen from my village 

00:39:13.187 --> 00:39:14.813
 I took him back 

00:39:25.699 --> 00:39:27.284
 .Stunning 

00:39:27.451 --> 00:39:28.744
 For hundreds of years 

00:39:28.869 --> 00:39:30.913
 The Buddha statue protected the people of my village 

00:39:31.288 --> 00:39:35.334
 And he never left our village, until now. 

00:39:37.461 --> 00:39:40.631
 Those thieves from the Art Gallery, who are they? 

00:39:40.797 --> 00:39:42.049
 "The Black Scorpions" 

00:39:42.466 --> 00:39:45.302
 They work for evil control, Fang 

00:39:45.469 --> 00:39:48.096
 She wants the Buddha statue so she can take control of my village 

00:39:48.263 --> 00:39:52.351
 I have to return the Buddha statue. To protect Lanzhou 

00:39:52.935 --> 00:39:55.229
 Mr. Fogg is the fastest route 

00:39:57.564 --> 00:40:00.943
 ... then maybe we can help each other 

00:40:01.735 --> 00:40:03.362
 I 'il keep your secret 

00:40:03.779 --> 00:40:07.741
 And you will persuade Mr. Fogg to agree to take me for a walk around the world with you 

00:40:15.165 --> 00:40:17.960
 , Watch out for this person to stay in his place. Otherwise we'll throw him out 

00:40:21.338 --> 00:40:23.342
 ... I told them that 

00:40:23.551 --> 00:40:28.095
 If they adjust coal consumption, the speed will be maximized 

00:40:30.848 --> 00:40:32.975
 ... when we get to Constantinople 

00:40:33.183 --> 00:40:35.143
 I suggest you get on another train of ours 

00:40:36.645 --> 00:40:39.231
 Master Fogg, she must come with us 

00:40:39.398 --> 00:40:40.649
 ?and why so 

00:40:40.983 --> 00:40:46.196
 We have just discovered that we are relatives 

00:40:48.699 --> 00:40:53.245
 I'm a second cousin from her mother's side 

00:40:53.453 --> 00:40:55.330
 .French 

00:40:55.873 --> 00:40:57.040
 , Mr. Fogg 

00:40:57.207 --> 00:40:59.877
 If I make this train go faster, then I can come with you, right? 

00:41:01.962 --> 00:41:03.797
 .Yes 

00:41:05.966 --> 00:41:08.635
 Mrs. Laroche 

00:41:23.317 --> 00:41:26.778
 If you need anything else, let us know, Mrs. Laroche 

00:41:26.987 --> 00:41:33.702
 Her first-class champagne, Mrs. Laroche 

00:41:34.369 --> 00:41:36.205
 .Thanks 

00:41:37.122 --> 00:41:38.707
 .No thanks 

00:41:41.251 --> 00:41:42.336
 .Thanks 

00:41:50.093 --> 00:41:51.970
 ?tea 

00:42:14.827 --> 00:42:16.453
 .Everything is fine 

00:42:18.622 --> 00:42:20.833
 "How to make English tea" 

00:42:21.792 --> 00:42:25.587
 Exactly ninety-six degrees 

00:42:32.469 --> 00:42:34.471
 Excuse me, sir 

00:42:35.305 --> 00:42:37.224
 Mr. Fogg 's servant 

00:42:37.558 --> 00:42:39.226
 The Buddha Statue 

00:42:39.351 --> 00:42:41.562
 - It 's not the Buddha. 

00:42:42.062 --> 00:42:44.648
 Well, you're right. But I'm not a servant 

00:42:44.982 --> 00:42:46.984
 ?really 

00:42:50.571 --> 00:42:52.948
 I'm bleeding from the nose! 

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:56.451
 You'll pay for that bastard 

00:43:12.259 --> 00:43:13.927
 Now I've caught you 

00:43:21.476 --> 00:43:23.562
 You stop 

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.985
 !Sorry 

00:43:42.372 --> 00:43:43.957
 - Turkey - 

00:43:46.877 --> 00:43:48.337
 Why the devil we stop? 

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:53.342
 - The 10th day - Istanbul - 

00:43:56.678 --> 00:44:01.767
 The Epic Prince is honored to host Mr. Fogg and his companions for a feast in his palace 

00:44:01.975 --> 00:44:03.060
 How flattering 

00:44:03.227 --> 00:44:07.105
 Just tell the epic prince that we have a tight schedule 

00:44:08.524 --> 00:44:10.776
 The epic prince demands it 

00:44:11.819 --> 00:44:18.116
 So the epic prince will have to get used to it. Do not get everything he wants 

00:44:25.565 --> 00:44:27.201
 It's just great 

00:44:27.202 --> 00:44:30.035
 Mr. Fogg, his house is bigger than yours 

00:44:30.105 --> 00:44:33.905
 His collection, his taste, is simply excellent 

00:44:33.975 --> 00:44:35.465
 ...Right 

00:44:36.811 --> 00:44:39.837
 ... not good, very old. Look, broken 

00:44:39.915 --> 00:44:42.884
 And where is His Highness? 

00:44:51.426 --> 00:44:55.226
 Prince is also a very talented musician 

00:44:55.297 --> 00:45:00.226
 If I had been in the palace all day, I would have learned a few notes 

00:45:13.148 --> 00:45:15.776
 Let's make it short and to the point. I'll show some pictures 

00:45:15.850 --> 00:45:17.841
 , (I'll wear a tarbush (Turkish hat 

00:45:17.919 --> 00:45:19.409
 Madam 

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:26.753
 How magical is that our paths intersect? You believe in fate 

00:45:26.828 --> 00:45:28.420
 That's what you call it 

00:45:28.496 --> 00:45:31.158
 When a train is stopped and its passengers are kidnapped 

00:45:31.233 --> 00:45:33.326
 Phyllis Fogg 

00:45:33.401 --> 00:45:34.925
 !Please forgive me 

00:45:35.003 --> 00:45:39.667
 But I feel as if Aphrodite herself has landed on our land 

00:45:40.508 --> 00:45:42.499
 You amazing woman 

00:45:44.479 --> 00:45:49.416
 I never think when I'm naked. Yes, in the bath- 

00:45:49.484 --> 00:45:51.247
 Yes, well I mean, 

00:45:51.319 --> 00:45:53.310
 !do not touch it 

00:45:53.388 --> 00:45:58.792
 . This is the most precious object to me ... I just pointed out, I- 

00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:00.725
 Do not even vote 

00:46:00.795 --> 00:46:02.422
 .dictator 

00:46:02.497 --> 00:46:05.625
 Yes, Rodin 

00:46:07.168 --> 00:46:10.660
 I have never seen such muscular design in my life 

00:46:10.739 --> 00:46:14.732
 I promise you that I am in better shape now 

00:46:14.809 --> 00:46:18.074
 Amazing, it 's a statue of you 

00:46:18.146 --> 00:46:19.340
 .Yes 

00:46:19.414 --> 00:46:22.508
 Happy Birthday 

00:46:22.584 --> 00:46:25.917
 Come, my dear, we will be together together. 

00:46:27.789 --> 00:46:30.758
 Mr. Fogg, come join us 

00:46:30.825 --> 00:46:32.816
 No, sorry but we are very stressed in our schedule 

00:46:32.894 --> 00:46:35.886
 We 'il join you, but only for one drink 

00:46:41.836 --> 00:46:45.135
 , After the Baron and the Dutch sat in the bath 

00:46:45.206 --> 00:46:47.868
 I forgot I was not wearing my bathing suit 

00:46:53.882 --> 00:46:55.213
 I 'm such a fool 

00:46:55.283 --> 00:46:59.344
 I always embarrass myself in front of distinguished people 

00:46:59.421 --> 00:47:02.481
 But you know how it is, Phil 

00:47:02.557 --> 00:47:04.525
 .Yes 

00:47:04.592 --> 00:47:07.322
 My name is Phileas 

00:47:07.395 --> 00:47:11.058
 So Foggy, tell me, I heard you 're making up 

00:47:11.132 --> 00:47:17.163
 Well, I always try to think of new ways to help humanity, if that's what you mean 

00:47:17.238 --> 00:47:19.172
 Well, I'm not making up 

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:22.869
 But I managed to develop a way to water dry land 

00:47:22.944 --> 00:47:25.913
 So no one in the state will ever be hungry 

00:47:29.117 --> 00:47:31.210
 Mr. Fogg invented shoes with wheels 

00:47:34.656 --> 00:47:36.624
 Not now, Passeparto 

00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:43.754
 Mrs Laroche 

00:47:43.832 --> 00:47:48.030
 It's amazing how your face lights up 

00:47:49.371 --> 00:47:52.169
 The color of her face can be due to an allergy 

00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:54.902
 Or because of the metabolic reaction 

00:47:57.112 --> 00:48:04.179
 I also noticed that her face lit up while she was painting 

00:48:04.252 --> 00:48:08.814
 And sometimes when she concentrates ... on her last job 

00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:11.450
 Her ears flutter 

00:48:14.195 --> 00:48:18.791
 It's just lovely, guess who else was in that bath- 

00:48:18.867 --> 00:48:21.927
 President of the United States, Ruthford Hayes 

00:48:23.738 --> 00:48:26.434
 We don 't have to move! 

00:48:26.508 --> 00:48:28.567
 Thank you for your hospitality, Prince Hippie 

00:48:28.643 --> 00:48:32.340
 , It was very exciting. But I'm afraid we have to move 

00:48:32.414 --> 00:48:33.438
 .Yes 

00:48:33.515 --> 00:48:35.483
 All right, the gentlemen are free to go 

00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:39.077
 But Mrs Laroche stays here with me 

00:48:39.754 --> 00:48:41.779
 To be my wife 

00:48:41.856 --> 00:48:44.450
 Yes, woman number seven 

00:48:45.193 --> 00:48:48.458
 Do you have 7 women? One for every day of the week - 

00:48:51.065 --> 00:48:54.501
 It's just ridiculous! 

00:48:54.569 --> 00:48:56.036
 Prince Hippie said his word 

00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:02.335
 Well, we really said we had only one drink left 

00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:04.537
 I can feel it when we're not wanted 

00:49:08.683 --> 00:49:09.707
 Mr. Fogg 

00:49:10.919 --> 00:49:13.183
 Is Tuesday suitable for you? 

00:49:14.222 --> 00:49:16.986
 - Thank you. 

00:49:20.962 --> 00:49:23.396
 !!!No 

00:49:24.432 --> 00:49:25.490
 !under arrest 

00:49:26.067 --> 00:49:27.659
 Or that my nose is crashing 

00:49:27.735 --> 00:49:31.865
 Please, everything except my statue 

00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:35.535
 Mrs. Laroche Please join us, if you will 

00:49:36.945 --> 00:49:41.405
 All of you will throw away your weapons, do as he says, 

00:49:42.717 --> 00:49:45.447
 Go into the tent all of you. 

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:48.921
 Now let's go, 

00:49:55.396 --> 00:49:59.730
 Now, take off your clothes and throw them away 

00:49:59.801 --> 00:50:03.737
 I assure you that nothing happened to the statue 

00:50:19.287 --> 00:50:22.188
 Catch them 

00:50:25.159 --> 00:50:26.592
 His arm 

00:50:27.896 --> 00:50:30.160
 Thank you, Phileas. It was heroic 

00:50:30.231 --> 00:50:32.893
 Yes, a waste of time 

00:50:32.967 --> 00:50:36.232
 That's exactly why I was forbidden to let you come with us 

00:50:36.304 --> 00:50:37.532
 Kill them 

00:50:38.206 --> 00:50:41.903
 I want my arm back 

00:50:41.976 --> 00:50:45.104
 !No 

00:50:45.179 --> 00:50:48.910
 I got a letter from Detective Pix 

00:50:48.983 --> 00:50:54.517
 That the pirate and the servant of Fogg is the same person 

00:50:54.589 --> 00:50:57.649
 Fogg does not even know that he's driving the bank thief with him 

00:50:57.725 --> 00:51:02.094
 Or, yes, he left the city in great haste 

00:51:02.163 --> 00:51:04.131
 - Yes, Lord Rhodes 

00:51:04.198 --> 00:51:06.132
 Yes, Lord Salisbury 

00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:08.225
 , Avoiding arrest 

00:51:08.303 --> 00:51:10.669
 , Stealing a police vehicle 

00:51:10.738 --> 00:51:13.468
 Sounds pretty incriminating to me 

00:51:13.541 --> 00:51:15.441
 , We can conclude from this 

00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:20.439
 That all this intervention was a trick to escape 

00:51:21.215 --> 00:51:25.049
 No, Lord Kelvin? -Yes 

00:51:25.119 --> 00:51:26.780
 Brilliant, Lord Salisbury 

00:51:26.854 --> 00:51:30.654
 I need to read some meat for you, Kitchener 

00:51:30.725 --> 00:51:32.818
 Yes sir. - Inform your people, in the Scottish court 

00:51:32.894 --> 00:51:38.355
 Spielias Fogg is no doubt the man who robbed the Bank of England 

00:51:38.433 --> 00:51:41.960
 Where are they now? They cross India by train - 

00:51:42.036 --> 00:51:43.594
 From Mumbai to Calcutta 

00:51:43.671 --> 00:51:45.935
 Thank God we rule India 

00:51:46.007 --> 00:51:48.373
 I want their faces, all our police stations 

00:51:48.443 --> 00:51:51.864
 , Army bases, postal authorities, railway stations and all India 

00:51:51.865 --> 00:51:58.681
 We're going to stop Fogg and get back the Buddha statue by all means 

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.000
 - India - 

00:52:06.527 --> 00:52:09.121
 We'll catch them in Agra 

00:52:17.372 --> 00:52:19.704
 Stop them in Agra 

00:52:19.774 --> 00:52:21.503
 Keep going, Carter 

00:52:21.576 --> 00:52:24.010
 !come on come on 

00:52:28.845 --> 00:52:31.235
 - 24th day - by train to Larga - 

00:52:35.056 --> 00:52:37.957
 And they were the best kung fu boxers 

00:52:38.026 --> 00:52:40.551
 The Ten Tigers of Canton 

00:52:40.628 --> 00:52:41.959
 .brothers in Arms 

00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:44.794
 They fought to keep order and justice in China 

00:52:44.866 --> 00:52:48.324
 The most famous of these is Wang Hefei Heng 

00:52:53.174 --> 00:52:55.642
 Only armed with bamboo sticks 

00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:57.769
 "It's drooling, please 

00:52:57.845 --> 00:52:59.335
 That 's your goat 

00:52:59.414 --> 00:53:01.575
 They really fought like tigers 

00:53:01.649 --> 00:53:04.914
 Every tiger has its own animal fighting style 

00:53:04.986 --> 00:53:07.284
 , Like a tiger 

00:53:07.355 --> 00:53:10.449
 Snake, snake head, snake tail, snake mouth, and tongue of snake 

00:53:11.459 --> 00:53:13.188
 Where are my calculations? 

00:53:13.261 --> 00:53:14.660
 !monkey 

00:53:15.730 --> 00:53:19.359
 goat! Paseparto I am attacked by a cruel animal 

00:53:20.501 --> 00:53:23.527
 She has small horns. Sorry, Mr. Fogg- 

00:53:23.604 --> 00:53:26.505
 Please remove this selfish animal from me 

00:53:26.574 --> 00:53:28.633
 And get away from your unimportant business 

00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:31.611
 Why do not you like him? (His story, Mr. Frog 

00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:33.909
 My name is Fogg, Phileas Fogg 

00:53:34.582 --> 00:53:39.076
 , How a person can learn to defend himself ... when he sees animals acting like 

00:53:39.153 --> 00:53:41.553
 This is a famous legend - 

00:53:41.622 --> 00:53:45.615
 A morbid legend. Most legends are made from real stories 

00:53:45.693 --> 00:53:47.456
 ...Yes 

00:53:47.528 --> 00:53:53.761
 , But all truths are created, solid, concrete facts that can be calculated 

00:53:53.835 --> 00:53:55.564
 And written on paper 

00:53:55.636 --> 00:53:59.470
 Then eaten by a goat 

00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:02.600
 Mr. Magoch, when I tell, this story 

00:54:02.677 --> 00:54:05.942
 About a man who travels around 

00:54:06.013 --> 00:54:08.345
 Would that be a fairy tale? 

00:54:11.185 --> 00:54:14.315
 Only with his name was Phileas Frog 

00:54:18.626 --> 00:54:23.290
 What the hell happened now. Come on, 

00:54:23.364 --> 00:54:26.231
 Be alert, now catch them 

00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:27.858
 You'll find these people 

00:54:27.935 --> 00:54:32.963
 It's time to move, they think. We robbed the English bank 

00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:37.540
 It's just ridiculous, it's a desperate attempt by Lord Kelvin to prevent me from completing the journey 

00:54:37.545 --> 00:54:40.036
 I am a British citizen. I have nothing to fear 

00:54:42.350 --> 00:54:44.375
 Except bullets 

00:54:45.386 --> 00:54:47.684
 Have you seen these people? 

00:54:49.357 --> 00:54:51.450
 !forward 

00:55:03.838 --> 00:55:05.772
 Is there anything new about bank thieves, sir? 

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:08.468
 They were on the train 

00:55:08.543 --> 00:55:10.067
 They will not pass us, sir 

00:55:12.079 --> 00:55:14.741
 Ladies, have you seen these people? 

00:55:16.117 --> 00:55:19.484
 Look closely, they are very dangerous 

00:55:19.554 --> 00:55:22.614
 They are everywhere. It will not work 

00:55:22.690 --> 00:55:26.285
 Stay calm and behave like women. 

00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:29.193
 .Hello 

00:55:30.531 --> 00:55:33.796
 I feel pale, Phileas, women are not that weak - 

00:55:33.868 --> 00:55:36.098
 No. But I do 

00:55:42.577 --> 00:55:45.876
 Hello, darling, what can I do for you? 

00:55:50.251 --> 00:55:55.279
 What a handsome hand, a beautiful eye. Beautiful hair 

00:55:56.290 --> 00:55:58.417
 .Wait a moment 

00:56:01.796 --> 00:56:04.788
 Mr. Fogg, what are you doing? This is not the time to sleep 

00:56:04.866 --> 00:56:06.561
 Stop, stop 

00:56:08.803 --> 00:56:12.739
 Get out of Agra, quickly 

00:56:12.807 --> 00:56:15.105
 We did it 

00:56:20.414 --> 00:56:22.405
 .Wrong Turn 

00:56:28.356 --> 00:56:30.517
 Pilias, no 

00:56:34.896 --> 00:56:37.160
 Run the Passeparto 

00:56:40.668 --> 00:56:42.499
 Fogg 's servant 

00:56:43.070 --> 00:56:45.300
 What are you doing, now I've got you 

00:56:45.806 --> 00:56:47.467
 Pass me the Buddha statue 

00:56:51.812 --> 00:56:55.646
 You 're under arrest, watch out for my eggs 

00:57:00.221 --> 00:57:04.021
 See, now you really got him angry! let's go 

00:57:04.091 --> 00:57:06.286
 Stop, or I'll stop you too 

00:57:15.303 --> 00:57:17.294
 - Run! 

00:57:18.639 --> 00:57:20.834
 What direction? 

00:57:20.908 --> 00:57:22.899
 !again 

00:57:24.278 --> 00:57:25.540
 .down 

00:57:28.149 --> 00:57:29.309
 - Jump! 

00:57:32.887 --> 00:57:35.856
 What 's so annoying about him, 

00:57:35.923 --> 00:57:38.756
 He also wants the Buddha statue. So give it to him- 

00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:46.464
 Please, you have to go. 

00:57:47.468 --> 00:57:51.404
 My husband will be home soon Pilias- 

00:58:09.924 --> 00:58:11.585
 Felias, help me 

00:58:11.659 --> 00:58:13.559
 Leave her alone, I 'il protect you 

00:58:16.564 --> 00:58:18.122
 I'm here dear 

00:58:18.199 --> 00:58:21.225
 This was just a means to gain time 

00:58:22.236 --> 00:58:25.535
 This stick does not really stick 

00:58:25.606 --> 00:58:30.407
 If I press this button, I will have a more deadly weapon of your own 

00:58:34.015 --> 00:58:36.575
 That 's it 

00:58:36.650 --> 00:58:39.346
 A strange knife 

00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:40.910
 Is not this a navigation device? 

00:58:41.789 --> 00:58:43.780
 .Yes 

00:58:56.003 --> 00:59:00.531
 Are you okay, my dear, Phyllias, it 's really not right for you. 

00:59:00.608 --> 00:59:02.542
 Come on with me 

00:59:02.610 --> 00:59:05.841
 Better put it on you 

00:59:05.913 --> 00:59:08.677
 Maybe I should wear my dress more often 

00:59:15.389 --> 00:59:16.947
 We'd better run 

00:59:17.024 --> 00:59:18.958
 ?now 

00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:21.518
 Yes, we'd better run 

00:59:25.866 --> 00:59:27.959
 - Break the door. 

00:59:29.370 --> 00:59:30.598
 No, not me stupid 

00:59:43.217 --> 00:59:45.708
 Give me the Buddha statue! All right, 

00:59:45.786 --> 00:59:47.549
 What a Buddha 

00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:52.720
 Get ready to jump 

01:00:06.574 --> 01:00:09.839
 This is the Englishman who robbed the Bank of England 

01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:12.606
 He 's running away in this wagon 

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:15.046
 !here he is 

01:00:16.450 --> 01:00:19.010
 They would check all the trains going east 

01:00:19.086 --> 01:00:23.455
 Even if we get to the beach, we can not sail to Singapore or Hong Kong 

01:00:23.524 --> 01:00:26.857
 Are England colonies controlled by all of Asia-
