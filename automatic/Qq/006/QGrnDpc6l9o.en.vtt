00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
securing that chieftain kill which could

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.139 
securing that chieftain kill which could
be<00:00:43.010> quite<00:00:43.219> good<00:00:43.430> because<00:00:43.579> they<00:00:43.820> do<00:00:43.880> have<00:00:44.059> the

their players into the hinge to try and

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.660 
their players into the hinge to try and

very<00:02:14.030> hard<00:02:14.330> it<00:02:14.720> does<00:02:14.870> look<00:02:14.900> like<00:02:15.290> though<00:02:15.560> they

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
very hard it does look like though they

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.350 
very hard it does look like though they
are<00:02:15.920> still<00:02:16.250> starting<00:02:16.640> to<00:02:16.790> break<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.180> back<00:02:17.330> of

matchless<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.080> we<00:02:18.140> are<00:02:18.290> seen<00:02:18.530> a<00:02:18.709> couple<00:02:19.220> of

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
matchless and we are seen a couple of

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.920 
matchless and we are seen a couple of
players<00:02:19.580> go<00:02:19.790> down<00:02:20.000> we<00:02:20.209> do<00:02:20.360> see<00:02:20.540> that<00:02:20.660> smiley

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
players go down we do see that smiley

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.510 
players go down we do see that smiley
buff<00:02:21.170> go<00:02:21.319> down<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:21.739> of<00:02:22.220> course<00:02:22.400> that's

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
buff go down and of course that's

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.150 
buff go down and of course that's
massively<00:02:23.300> jumped<00:02:23.959> up<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.560> point<00:02:24.830> leader

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
massively jumped up the the point leader

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.620 
massively jumped up the the point leader
you<00:02:25.310> can<00:02:25.489> see<00:02:25.610> that<00:02:25.640> point<00:02:26.090> different<00:02:26.480> just

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
you can see that point different just

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.300 
you can see that point different just
absolutely<00:02:27.140> huge<00:02:27.560> at<00:02:27.739> this<00:02:27.890> early<00:02:28.040> in<00:02:28.280> the

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
absolutely huge at this early in the

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.850 
absolutely huge at this early in the
game<00:02:28.400> so<00:02:29.390> it<00:02:29.540> does<00:02:29.720> look<00:02:29.930> like<00:02:29.959> they're<00:02:30.739> not

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
game so it does look like they're not

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.050 
game so it does look like they're not
going<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:31.010> be<00:02:31.100> able<00:02:31.130> to<00:02:31.310> hang<00:02:31.430> on<00:02:31.580> here<00:02:31.610> for<00:02:31.880> too

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
going to be able to hang on here for too

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.600 
going to be able to hang on here for too
long<00:02:32.270> this<00:02:32.480> this<00:02:32.810> 5v<00:02:33.319> I<00:02:33.530> guess<00:02:33.739> it's<00:02:33.890> a<00:02:33.950> 5v<00:02:34.280> 2<00:02:34.459> or

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
long this this 5v I guess it's a 5v 2 or

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.820 
long this this 5v I guess it's a 5v 2 or
a<00:02:34.640> 5<00:02:34.700> v<00:02:35.030> one<00:02:35.209> scenario<00:02:35.540> yeah<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.380> it<00:02:36.470> does<00:02:36.620> look

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
a 5 v one scenario yeah and it does look

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.020 
a 5 v one scenario yeah and it does look
like<00:02:36.980> all<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.310> matchless<00:02:37.640> players<00:02:37.880> are

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
like all the matchless players are

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.550 
like all the matchless players are
dropping<00:02:38.090> like<00:02:38.330> flies<00:02:38.450> at<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:38.989> moment<00:02:39.290> yeah

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
dropping like flies at the moment yeah

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.960 
dropping like flies at the moment yeah
but<00:02:39.890> I<00:02:39.920> think<00:02:40.010> they<00:02:40.250> just<00:02:40.280> held<00:02:40.640> on<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:40.910> that

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
but I think they just held on to that

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.880 
but I think they just held on to that
triple<00:02:41.330> cap<00:02:41.540> just<00:02:41.750> for<00:02:41.959> a<00:02:41.989> bit<00:02:42.230> too<00:02:42.470> long<00:02:42.709> I

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
triple cap just for a bit too long I

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.470 
triple cap just for a bit too long I
mean<00:02:43.069> they've<00:02:43.550> got<00:02:43.670> a<00:02:43.700> hundred<00:02:43.970> point<00:02:44.330> lead

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
mean they've got a hundred point lead

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.759 
mean they've got a hundred point lead
here<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:44.780> that<00:02:44.870> was<00:02:44.989> purely<00:02:45.349> because<00:02:45.560> that

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
here and that was purely because that

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.530 
here and that was purely because that

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
obviously that doesn't make any

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.039 
obviously that doesn't make any
difference<00:02:58.190> at<00:02:58.430> all<00:02:58.610> yeah<00:02:59.480> I<00:02:59.540> really<00:02:59.750> felt

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049

strategy<00:03:02.360> but<00:03:02.569> they<00:03:02.720> really<00:03:03.080> needed<00:03:03.290> to<00:03:03.530> have

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
strategy but they really needed to have

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.470 
strategy but they really needed to have
cleaned<00:03:04.220> that<00:03:04.310> out<00:03:04.370> as<00:03:04.610> quickly<00:03:04.910> as<00:03:05.120> possible

a<00:03:30.680> very<00:03:30.769> defensive<00:03:31.280> style<00:03:31.459> to<00:03:31.640> hold<00:03:31.790> on<00:03:31.910> to

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
a very defensive style to hold on to

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.069 
a very defensive style to hold on to
that<00:03:32.090> capture<00:03:32.450> point<00:03:32.660> which<00:03:32.810> was<00:03:32.989> the

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
that capture point which was the

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.110 
that capture point which was the
appropriate<00:03:33.350> response<00:03:33.579> we<00:03:34.579> do<00:03:34.760> see<00:03:34.940> though<00:03:35.090> I

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
appropriate response we do see though I

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.150 
appropriate response we do see though I
just<00:03:35.540> sort<00:03:35.660> of<00:03:35.690> a<00:03:35.750> transition<00:03:36.290> into<00:03:36.410> we've<00:03:37.040> got

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
just sort of a transition into we've got

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.800 
just sort of a transition into we've got
the<00:03:37.250> whirlwind<00:03:37.579> dropping<00:03:37.880> down<00:03:37.970> here<00:03:38.299> and<00:03:38.480> it

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
the whirlwind dropping down here and it

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.090 
the whirlwind dropping down here and it
does<00:03:38.989> look<00:03:39.140> like<00:03:39.290> it's<00:03:39.470> broken<00:03:39.590> out<00:03:39.829> into<00:03:39.950> an

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
does look like it's broken out into an

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.220 
does look like it's broken out into an
all-out<00:03:40.280> fight<00:03:40.760> from<00:03:41.030> both<00:03:41.209> teams<00:03:41.450> yeah<00:03:42.079> we

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
all-out fight from both teams yeah we

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.780 
all-out fight from both teams yeah we
can<00:03:42.380> see<00:03:42.470> that<00:03:42.590> Nico<00:03:42.950> popping<00:03:43.340> into<00:03:43.459> licked

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
can see that Nico popping into licked

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.300 
can see that Nico popping into licked
mode<00:03:44.060> to<00:03:44.239> try<00:03:44.450> and<00:03:44.650> mixed<00:03:45.650> form<00:03:45.859> try<00:03:46.070> to<00:03:46.130> do

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
mode to try and mixed form try to do

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.920 
mode to try and mixed form try to do
some<00:03:46.459> extra<00:03:46.700> damage<00:03:46.940> defend<00:03:47.480> that<00:03:47.540> point<00:03:47.810> as

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
some extra damage defend that point as

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.900 
some extra damage defend that point as
much<00:03:48.109> as<00:03:48.290> possible<00:03:48.440> and<00:03:48.920> I<00:03:49.250> think<00:03:49.700> this<00:03:49.790> is

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
much as possible and I think this is

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.280 
much as possible and I think this is
just<00:03:49.940> really<00:03:50.150> smart<00:03:50.600> just<00:03:50.810> staying<00:03:51.079> in<00:03:51.260> that

them a little bit too long I thought

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.530 
them a little bit too long I thought
they<00:04:55.280> should<00:04:55.310> have<00:04:55.550> abandoned<00:04:56.090> that<00:04:56.180> strategy

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
they should have abandoned that strategy

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.610 
they should have abandoned that strategy
a<00:04:56.630> little<00:04:56.900> bit<00:04:56.990> early<00:04:57.260> on<00:04:57.380> you<00:04:57.590> know

working<00:05:01.370> out<00:05:01.550> for<00:05:01.610> us<00:05:01.790> we've<00:05:02.030> got<00:05:02.060> a<00:05:02.210> really

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
working out for us we've got a really

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.940 
working out for us we've got a really
split<00:05:02.720> up<00:05:02.840> now<00:05:02.870> if<00:05:03.110> we<00:05:03.260> have<00:05:03.380> any<00:05:03.530> chance<00:05:03.590> of

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
split up now if we have any chance of

getting back into this game and that

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.520 
getting back into this game and that
looks<00:05:05.480> like<00:05:05.660> what<00:05:05.870> they're<00:05:06.050> doing<00:05:06.350> at<00:05:06.440> the

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
looks like what they're doing at the

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.170 
looks like what they're doing at the
moment<00:05:06.710> we<00:05:06.890> can<00:05:07.010> see<00:05:07.130> all<00:05:07.280> points<00:05:07.580> contested

moment we can see all points contested
yeah<00:05:08.990> I<00:05:09.020> mean<00:05:09.200> with<00:05:09.470> all<00:05:09.680> the<00:05:09.830> points

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
contested now we do see young the kid go

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.720 
contested now we do see young the kid go
down<00:05:12.050> for<00:05:12.290> matchless<00:05:12.650> but<00:05:12.890> having<00:05:13.520> all<00:05:13.640> those

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
down for matchless but having all those

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.100 
down for matchless but having all those
point<00:05:13.970> contestants<00:05:14.510> is<00:05:14.660> telling<00:05:14.990> me<00:05:15.020> that

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
point contestants is telling me that

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.630 
point contestants is telling me that
they've<00:05:15.380> gone<00:05:15.530> you<00:05:15.800> know<00:05:15.890> what<00:05:16.100> it<00:05:16.340> looks<00:05:16.370> like

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
they've gone you know what it looks like

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.950 
they've gone you know what it looks like
we're<00:05:16.790> going<00:05:16.880> to<00:05:16.970> have<00:05:17.060> to<00:05:17.180> split<00:05:17.480> up<00:05:17.540> and<00:05:17.810> you

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
we're going to have to split up and you

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.270 
we're going to have to split up and you
know<00:05:18.050> this<00:05:18.230> isn't<00:05:18.470> going<00:05:18.560> to<00:05:18.620> work<00:05:18.710> for<00:05:18.980> us<00:05:19.010> so

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
know this isn't going to work for us so

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.340 
know this isn't going to work for us so
you<00:05:19.820> know<00:05:19.910> I<00:05:19.940> reckon<00:05:20.750> that's<00:05:20.870> a<00:05:20.960> great

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
you know I reckon that's a great

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:22.720 
you know I reckon that's a great
strategy<00:05:21.800> for<00:05:21.950> them<00:05:22.070> at<00:05:22.160> the<00:05:22.250> moment<00:05:22.520> but<00:05:22.610> it

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
strategy for them at the moment but it

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.010 
strategy for them at the moment but it
does<00:05:22.910> look<00:05:22.940> like<00:05:23.120> they're<00:05:23.450> two<00:05:23.570> points<00:05:23.870> down

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
does look like they're two points down

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.500 
does look like they're two points down
now<00:05:24.260> and<00:05:24.440> they<00:05:25.040> are<00:05:25.070> in<00:05:25.370> inner<00:05:25.790> they<00:05:26.180> do<00:05:26.240> have<00:05:26.450> a

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
now and they are in inner they do have a

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.180 
now and they are in inner they do have a
lot<00:05:26.690> of<00:05:26.750> catching<00:05:27.110> up<00:05:27.170> to<00:05:27.290> do<00:05:27.440> i'm<00:05:27.620> not<00:05:27.800> sure<00:05:28.010> if

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
lot of catching up to do i'm not sure if

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:29.080 
lot of catching up to do i'm not sure if
they're<00:05:28.280> going<00:05:28.370> to<00:05:28.460> be<00:05:28.520> able<00:05:28.610> to<00:05:28.760> hold<00:05:28.850> on<00:05:29.030> for

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
they're going to be able to hold on for

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.360 
they're going to be able to hold on for
much<00:05:29.600> longer<00:05:29.840> doesn't<00:05:30.830> look<00:05:30.920> like<00:05:31.130> they'll<00:05:31.280> be

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
much longer doesn't look like they'll be

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.580 
much longer doesn't look like they'll be
able<00:05:31.460> to<00:05:31.550> pull<00:05:31.760> back<00:05:31.910> from<00:05:32.120> this<00:05:32.390> sir<00:05:32.690> will

this<00:05:33.740> lead<00:05:33.980> that<00:05:34.280> match<00:05:34.700> this<00:05:34.880> has<00:05:35.060> yeah<00:05:35.600> we're

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
this lead that match this has yeah we're

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.270 
this lead that match this has yeah we're
seeing<00:05:36.020> a<00:05:36.080> lot<00:05:36.110> of<00:05:36.320> kills<00:05:36.590> coming<00:05:36.950> out<00:05:37.010> here

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
seeing a lot of kills coming out here

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.100 
seeing a lot of kills coming out here
for<00:05:37.310> matchless<00:05:37.790> at<00:05:37.940> the<00:05:38.030> moment<00:05:38.360> I<00:05:38.480> think

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
for matchless at the moment I think

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.630 
for matchless at the moment I think
they're<00:05:39.260> just<00:05:39.290> trying<00:05:39.980> to<00:05:40.040> hold<00:05:40.160> them<00:05:40.310> off<00:05:40.430> and

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
they're just trying to hold them off and

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.640 
they're just trying to hold them off and
disrupt<00:05:41.450> them<00:05:41.600> as<00:05:41.720> much<00:05:41.810> as<00:05:41.990> they<00:05:42.020> can<00:05:42.170> while

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
disrupt them as much as they can while

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.190 
disrupt them as much as they can while
they<00:05:42.800> can<00:05:42.860> sort<00:05:43.250> of<00:05:43.310> trickle<00:05:44.000> past<00:05:44.270> ahead<00:05:44.660> you

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
they can sort of trickle past ahead you

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.240 
they can sort of trickle past ahead you
know<00:05:45.290> the<00:05:45.440> longer<00:05:45.620> this<00:05:45.770> game<00:05:45.980> is<00:05:46.130> in

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
know the longer this game is in

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.010 
know the longer this game is in
essentially<00:05:47.060> a<00:05:47.090> stalemate<00:05:47.480> the<00:05:47.810> more

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
essentially a stalemate the more

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.590 
essentially a stalemate the more
matchless<00:05:48.470> is<00:05:48.650> going<00:05:48.890> to<00:05:49.010> be<00:05:49.160> ahead<00:05:49.490> so<00:05:49.970> match

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 
matchless is going to be ahead so match

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.000 
matchless is going to be ahead so match
let's<00:05:50.810> really<00:05:51.050> just<00:05:51.380> want<00:05:51.590> to<00:05:51.650> hold<00:05:51.740> them<00:05:51.920> off

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
let's really just want to hold them off

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.850 
let's really just want to hold them off
here<00:05:52.040> and<00:05:52.460> add<00:05:52.580> secure<00:05:52.910> that<00:05:53.030> win<00:05:53.590> we<00:05:54.590> can<00:05:54.710> see

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
here and add secure that win we can see

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.380 
here and add secure that win we can see
they've<00:05:55.040> got<00:05:55.220> a<00:05:55.250> player<00:05:55.610> to<00:05:55.790> hedge<00:05:55.970> just<00:05:56.300> to

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
they've got a player to hedge just to

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:00.100 
they've got a player to hedge just to
try<00:05:56.540> and<00:05:56.570> defend<00:05:56.870> that<00:05:57.080> in<00:05:57.260> case<00:05:58.990> sorry<00:05:59.990> in

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
try and defend that in case sorry in

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.720 
try and defend that in case sorry in
case<00:06:00.290> condemned<00:06:00.710> tries<00:06:01.040> to<00:06:01.160> take<00:06:01.310> that<00:06:01.430> point

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:01.730 
case condemned tries to take that point

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.660 
case condemned tries to take that point
back<00:06:01.940> which<00:06:02.600> it<00:06:02.720> looks<00:06:02.780> like<00:06:02.900> they<00:06:03.140> have

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:03.670 
back which it looks like they have

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.800 
back which it looks like they have
condemned<00:06:04.670> with<00:06:04.850> two<00:06:05.030> at<00:06:05.180> the<00:06:05.270> moment<00:06:05.600> is<00:06:05.720> 0

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
condemned with two at the moment is 0

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.270 
condemned with two at the moment is 0
this<00:06:05.960> is<00:06:06.290> just<00:06:06.470> with<00:06:06.590> the<00:06:06.680> key<00:06:06.830> so<00:06:07.100> that's

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
this is just with the key so that's

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.800 
this is just with the key so that's
splitting<00:06:07.580> up<00:06:07.730> doing<00:06:07.970> a<00:06:08.030> good<00:06:08.150> job<00:06:08.210> but<00:06:08.630> i

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
to see that triple cap it was a really

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.780 
to see that triple cap it was a really
interesting<00:06:27.080> strategy<00:06:27.890> that<00:06:28.130> condemned<00:06:28.520> went

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:28.790 
interesting strategy that condemned went

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.910 
interesting strategy that condemned went
for<00:06:29.270> going<00:06:29.480> that<00:06:29.600> sort<00:06:29.840> of<00:06:29.870> five<00:06:30.200> man<00:06:30.500> try<00:06:30.890> and

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:30.920 
for going that sort of five man try and

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.890 
for going that sort of five man try and
quickly<00:06:31.310> roll<00:06:31.550> matchless<00:06:32.030> but<00:06:32.750> it

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 
quickly roll matchless but it

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.150 
quickly roll matchless but it
unfortunately<00:06:33.500> they<00:06:33.590> just<00:06:33.770> held<00:06:33.950> it<00:06:34.010> off<00:06:34.130> for

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 
unfortunately they just held it off for

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.830
