like they're the best one to go for and

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.600

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.150 
so I ran off and I was in for a free
consultation<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.600> was<00:01:19.470> bit<00:01:19.620> nervous<00:01:19.860> because

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
got four bit of needles so this

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.070 
got four bit of needles so this
treatment<00:01:25.230> wasn't<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.710> best

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
obviously the first session was quite

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.100 
obviously the first session was quite
it's<00:02:38.280> quite<00:02:38.519> scary<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:39.150> what<00:02:39.810> you<00:02:39.930> don't
