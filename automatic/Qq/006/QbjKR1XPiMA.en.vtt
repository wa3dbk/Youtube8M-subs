00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 and it's facebook and as you can see I'm a 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.570
 little bit cold and now I really wanted 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.360
 do this tutorial taking advantage of that already 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.820
 New Year is almost nochevieja this 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.160
 tutorial is inspired by fashion is 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.470
 100 is a makeup that is usually very 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.109
 dark and I received the request the other day 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.080
 by apps and the truth is that I thought 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.699
 very interesting to try it is something 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.099
 a lot darker than I usually 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.140
 do but I hope you like it 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.820
 you enjoy the tutorial the first one 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.469
 let's go to cannes to apply the base to 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.050
 little touches in this movement 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.050
 as always as well battier masters 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.340
 with translucent powders we are going to seal 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.150
 and to ensure that no glitter is left 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.150
 in our makeup 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.300
 with a slightly darker peach tone 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.680
 that our skin tone are going to 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.330
 spread it all over the eyelid 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.330
 reaching the limits 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.320
 then with a brown tone pulling a 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.990
 little more to the gray action we're going to 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.570
 extend it also by the mobile eyelid 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.460
 but not reaching as to limit as 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.320
 we arrived with the previous shadow but a 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.780
 little bit more back 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.150
 and now with the black shadow we are going to 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.310
 extend it by the mobile eyelid but 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.720
 just sticking to what is the 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.720
 mobile eyelid without leaving 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.909
 now with a blue pencil we are going to delineate 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.909
 the entire lower outer line 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.450
 and with round clouds we are going to mix 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.770
 very very very good all colors 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.770
 previous on the mobile eyelid 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:13.970
 with eyeliner we are going to draw a final 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.970
 very thick cat's eye 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:30.260
 and as always you already know that I like 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.330
 mix well the eyeliner with shadow 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.190
 eyes in this case I'm mixing a 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.010
 little black and a little dark brown 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.890
 chocolate color and let's extend it 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.230
 since the completion of the delineation 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.580
 up to create a kind of 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.140
 uve 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.520
 remember that it has to look good 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.740
 blurred 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.260
 then it's time to add mask 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.150
 eyelashes we can add two or three 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.850
 even layers of false eyelashes if 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.580
 we want I'm just going to leave it in 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.770
 eyelash mask since being a 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.270
 party makeup the sweat of dancing 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.850
 in the clubs you can make us 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.180
 take off the lashes and we do not want that 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.180
 obviously 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.510
 with bronze I'm going to mark more my cheekbone and 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.170
 remarking just what is below the 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.170
 bone of the cheekbone 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:35.250
 and I'm going to add a long blush 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.250
 blush form 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.550
 and finally a peach-colored gloss 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:46.530
 and that's the end result 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.600
 I hope you liked this tutorial 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.760
 it requires a little bit of practical time 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.540
 because they are all in dark colors 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.879
 dark brown blacks 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.349
 and it takes a little bit of practice 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:00.079
 to control these colors that are 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:03.769
 let's say the most difficult to manage 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:05.150
 so that they look good well, but with 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.650
 a little bit of practice or just 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.780
 start with a little more time the 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.450
 that you had planned to start I think that 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.129
 right away you can control a lot 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.870
 well because within what fits I think 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.820
 which is a pretty simple tutorial 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.620
 I hope you liked it remember
