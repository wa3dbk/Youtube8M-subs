00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.550 

so<00:00:00.450> we<00:00:00.510> get<00:00:00.599> a<00:00:00.630> lot<00:00:00.780> of<00:00:00.810> questions<00:00:01.020> on<00:00:01.350> how<00:00:01.380> we

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560 
so we get a lot of questions on how we

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.730 
so we get a lot of questions on how we
face<00:00:02.490> mount<00:00:02.760> two<00:00:02.879> acrylic<00:00:03.149> and<00:00:03.560> so<00:00:04.560> I<00:00:04.589> just

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
face mount two acrylic and so I just

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.660 
face mount two acrylic and so I just
wanted<00:00:04.950> to<00:00:05.040> show<00:00:05.190> a<00:00:05.220> little<00:00:05.370> bit<00:00:05.490> of<00:00:05.580> the

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
wanted to show a little bit of the

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.849 
wanted to show a little bit of the
process<00:00:06.089> here<00:00:06.420> and<00:00:07.200> what<00:00:07.350> we're<00:00:07.500> doing<00:00:07.710> right

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
process here and what we're doing right

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.660 
process here and what we're doing right
now<00:00:07.919> is<00:00:08.370> we've<00:00:09.030> got<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.450> print<00:00:10.320> came<00:00:11.250> off<00:00:11.460> our

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
now is we've got the print came off our

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.140 
now is we've got the print came off our
HP<00:00:12.150> designjet<00:00:12.690> 6100<00:00:13.530> it's<00:00:13.860> an<00:00:13.920> inkjet<00:00:14.190> print

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
HP designjet 6100 it's an inkjet print

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.660 
HP designjet 6100 it's an inkjet print
and<00:00:15.420> right<00:00:16.410> now<00:00:16.560> we're<00:00:16.710> putting<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.980> adhesive

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
and right now we're putting the adhesive

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.730 
and right now we're putting the adhesive
it's<00:00:18.000> called<00:00:18.240> optimum<00:00:18.810> it's<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.260> double-sided

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
it's called optimum it's a double-sided

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.090 
it's called optimum it's a double-sided
adhesive<00:00:20.990> and<00:00:21.990> it's<00:00:22.170> going<00:00:22.320> basically<00:00:22.859> put

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
adhesive and it's going basically put

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.750 
adhesive and it's going basically put
the<00:00:23.189> print<00:00:23.430> on<00:00:23.519> what's<00:00:23.699> called<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:24.000> sled<00:00:24.330> and

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
the print on what's called a sled and

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.089 
the print on what's called a sled and
this<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:26.910> process<00:00:27.420> number<00:00:27.660> one<00:00:27.990> it's<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.650> it's<00:00:29.039> a

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
this is process number one it's a it's a

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.609 
this is process number one it's a it's a
rather<00:00:29.250> involved<00:00:29.640> process<00:00:30.080> to<00:00:31.080> do<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.380> not<00:00:31.590> a

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
rather involved process to do this not a

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.690 
rather involved process to do this not a
lot<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:31.859> shops<00:00:32.070> do<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.460> but<00:00:33.710> first<00:00:34.710> off<00:00:34.950> we<00:00:35.280> got

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
lot of shops do it but first off we got

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.170 
lot of shops do it but first off we got
the<00:00:35.969> optimum<00:00:36.300> out<00:00:36.360> here<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:36.780> Peters

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
the optimum out here so Peters

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.600 
the optimum out here so Peters
ultimately<00:00:39.180> going<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.540> peel<00:00:40.110> back<00:00:40.309> one<00:00:41.309> side

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
ultimately going to peel back one side

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.180 
ultimately going to peel back one side
of<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.940> adhesive<00:00:42.530> it's<00:00:43.530> always<00:00:43.770> fun<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.010> do

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
of the adhesive it's always fun to do

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.970 
of the adhesive it's always fun to do
it's<00:00:44.309> hard<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.579> get<00:00:44.730> your<00:00:45.649> hard<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.710> get<00:00:46.829> your

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
it's hard to get your hard to get your

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.560 
it's hard to get your hard to get your
thumb<00:00:47.219> around<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.730> get<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> adhesive<00:00:48.059> or

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
thumb around that to get the adhesive or

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.450 
thumb around that to get the adhesive or
the<00:00:48.840> liner<00:00:49.170> pulled<00:00:49.469> back<00:00:51.559> so<00:00:52.559> right<00:00:53.010> now<00:00:53.190> like

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
the liner pulled back so right now like

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.360 
the liner pulled back so right now like
I<00:00:53.550> said<00:00:53.610> we're<00:00:54.000> pulling<00:00:54.750> back<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.110> liner<00:00:55.500> you

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
I said we're pulling back that liner you

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.280 
I said we're pulling back that liner you
want<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.640> create<00:00:56.940> give<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.329> good<00:00:57.449> crease

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.800 

nice<00:01:04.290> thing<00:01:04.530> about<00:01:04.939> this<00:01:05.939> process<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.510> once

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
nice thing about this process is once

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.969 
nice thing about this process is once
it's<00:01:06.990> finished<00:01:07.490> the<00:01:09.500> clarity<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
it's finished the clarity in the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.859 
it's finished the clarity in the
vibrancy<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.640> print<00:01:11.970> really<00:01:12.210> pop<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.540> let

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
vibrancy of the print really pop you let

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.859 
vibrancy of the print really pop you let
acrylic<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.409> that's<00:01:13.590> that's<00:01:13.950> what<00:01:14.549> people

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
acrylic and that's that's what people

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.800 
acrylic and that's that's what people
really<00:01:15.869> love<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.229> process<00:01:17.330> so<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.420> send<00:01:18.689> it

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
really love this process so you send it

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.190 
really love this process so you send it
just<00:01:19.080> through<00:01:20.390> just<00:01:21.390> before<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.869> release

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
just through just before the release

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.170 
just through just before the release
liner

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.980 

flip<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:28.900> back<00:01:29.080> through

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.190 

we've<00:01:34.830> got<00:01:35.010> some<00:01:35.190> canned<00:01:35.490> deer<00:01:35.700> here<00:01:35.940> to<00:01:36.420> nut

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
we've got some canned deer here to nut

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.980 
we've got some canned deer here to nut
canned<00:01:37.500> ear<00:01:37.740> hair<00:01:38.070> but<00:01:38.670> can<00:01:38.880> hahaha<00:01:39.660> they're

canned ear hair but can hahaha they're

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.370 
canned ear hair but can hahaha they're
here<00:01:41.180> to<00:01:42.180> get<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> dust<00:01:42.960> particles<00:01:43.380> off<00:01:45.260> so<00:01:46.260> this

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
here to get a dust particles off so this

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.990 
here to get a dust particles off so this
is<00:01:46.560> definitely<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.950> vital<00:01:47.460> part<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:47.910> the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
is definitely a vital part of the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.130 
is definitely a vital part of the
process<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.390> wanna<00:01:48.570> make<00:01:48.690> sure<00:01:48.810> there's<00:01:48.990> not

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
process you wanna make sure there's not

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.690 
process you wanna make sure there's not
one<00:01:49.380> little<00:01:49.620> speck<00:01:49.800> of<00:01:49.920> dust<00:01:50.040> on<00:01:50.280> there<00:01:50.430> or

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
one little speck of dust on there or

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.980 
one little speck of dust on there or
your<00:01:50.940> it's<00:01:51.270> going<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.510> be<00:01:51.570> seen<00:01:53.570> so<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.750> key

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
your it's going to be seen so the key

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.430 
your it's going to be seen so the key
when<00:01:55.280> pulling<00:01:56.280> back<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:56.729> liner<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.960> not<00:01:58.020> to

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
when pulling back this liner is not to

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.920 
when pulling back this liner is not to
stop<00:01:58.710> or<00:01:59.010> you're<00:01:59.160> going<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.340> see<00:01:59.580> a<00:01:59.850> line<00:02:00.780> on

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
stop or you're going to see a line on

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.480 
stop or you're going to see a line on
the<00:02:01.020> print<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:01.530> as<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.890> goes<00:02:01.979> through<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.430> just

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
the print so as it goes through you just

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.230 
the print so as it goes through you just
want<00:02:02.760> to<00:02:02.790> pull<00:02:03.000> up<00:02:04.010> just<00:02:05.010> slowly<00:02:05.520> but<00:02:06.030> never

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
want to pull up just slowly but never

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.600 
want to pull up just slowly but never
stop<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.840> keep<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.530> keep<00:02:07.979> release<00:02:08.369> liner

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
stop and keep it keep release liner

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.130 
stop and keep it keep release liner
close<00:02:08.989> close<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.229> print<00:02:10.440> as<00:02:10.500> possible<00:02:12.140> so

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
close close to the print as possible so

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.090 
close close to the print as possible so
here<00:02:13.350> it<00:02:13.440> is<00:02:13.560> came<00:02:14.100> out<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.520> other<00:02:14.850> side<00:02:15.180> here

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
here it is came out the other side here

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.930 
here it is came out the other side here
so<00:02:17.100> now<00:02:17.280> it's<00:02:17.790> got<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.540> release<00:02:18.870> liner<00:02:19.140> on<00:02:19.530> the

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
so now it's got the release liner on the

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.880 
so now it's got the release liner on the
top<00:02:20.940> part<00:02:21.209> and<00:02:24.020> so<00:02:25.020> we<00:02:25.110> need<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.260> cut<00:02:25.530> this<00:02:25.709> off

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
top part and so we need to cut this off

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:26.590 
top part and so we need to cut this off
the<00:02:26.070> board

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
the board

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.760 
the board
we've<00:02:27.600> got<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.810> piece<00:02:28.050> of<00:02:28.170> around<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.500> edges

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
we've got a piece of around the edges

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.460 
we've got a piece of around the edges
there

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.250 

always<00:02:35.470> you<00:02:35.680> circulate<00:02:36.780> yes<00:02:37.780> that's

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
always you circulate yes that's

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.250 
always you circulate yes that's
absolutely<00:02:38.740> key<00:02:39.370> as<00:02:39.490> well<00:02:42.600> so<00:02:43.600> once<00:02:43.900> we<00:02:44.020> cut<00:02:44.170> it

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
absolutely key as well so once we cut it

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.770 
absolutely key as well so once we cut it
off<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:44.560> board<00:02:44.830> we're<00:02:45.610> on<00:02:45.760> step<00:02:46.270> 2<00:02:46.510> where

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
off the board we're on step 2 where

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.850 
off the board we're on step 2 where
we're<00:02:46.870> going<00:02:46.990> to<00:02:47.050> actually<00:02:47.260> attach<00:02:47.350> it<00:02:47.650> to<00:02:47.770> the

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
we're going to actually attach it to the

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.330 
we're going to actually attach it to the
acrylic<00:02:48.840> so<00:02:49.840> step<00:02:50.170> number<00:02:50.200> two<00:02:50.680> we're

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
acrylic so step number two we're

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.280 
acrylic so step number two we're
attaching<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.270> print<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.740> acrylic<00:02:54.240> and

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
attaching the print to the acrylic and

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.140 
attaching the print to the acrylic and
this<00:02:56.290> is<00:02:56.470> a<00:02:56.500> this<00:02:57.100> is<00:02:57.220> what<00:02:57.370> makes<00:02:57.580> it<00:02:57.730> makes<00:02:57.970> it

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
this is a this is what makes it makes it

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.210 
this is a this is what makes it makes it
or<00:02:58.240> breaks<00:02:58.270> right<00:02:58.690> here<00:02:58.960> having<00:02:59.770> that<00:02:59.980> leader

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
or breaks right here having that leader

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.400 
or breaks right here having that leader
board<00:03:00.420> essentially<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.600> same<00:03:01.780> thickness<00:03:02.050> and

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
board essentially the same thickness and

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.290 
board essentially the same thickness and
a<00:03:02.440> little<00:03:02.650> longer<00:03:02.860> than<00:03:03.130> the<00:03:03.220> acrylic<00:03:04.800> that<00:03:05.800> is

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
a little longer than the acrylic that is

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.670 
a little longer than the acrylic that is
really<00:03:07.300> the<00:03:07.660> most<00:03:07.840> essential<00:03:08.170> part<00:03:08.470> to<00:03:08.500> this

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
really the most essential part to this

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.400 
really the most essential part to this
whole<00:03:08.860> face<00:03:09.070> mounting<00:03:09.400> process<00:03:10.230> so<00:03:11.230> now<00:03:11.350> we

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
whole face mounting process so now we

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.470 
whole face mounting process so now we
have<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.709> light<00:03:11.860> table<00:03:12.100> on<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.970> print<00:03:13.360> is

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
have the light table on the print is

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.330 
have the light table on the print is
going<00:03:13.720> upside<00:03:14.080> down<00:03:14.610> onto<00:03:15.610> the<00:03:16.150> acrylic<00:03:17.340> we've

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
going upside down onto the acrylic we've

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.090 
going upside down onto the acrylic we've
got<00:03:18.550> a<00:03:18.900> quarter<00:03:19.900> inch<00:03:20.050> of<00:03:20.110> lead<00:03:20.320> gives<00:03:20.800> us<00:03:20.980> an

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
got a quarter inch of lead gives us an

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.080 
got a quarter inch of lead gives us an
eighth<00:03:21.250> inch<00:03:21.400> lead<00:03:21.700> all<00:03:21.880> the<00:03:21.970> way<00:03:22.060> around<00:03:22.650> and

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
eighth inch lead all the way around and

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.480 
eighth inch lead all the way around and
we<00:03:25.090> tape<00:03:25.330> tape<00:03:26.230> the<00:03:26.380> print<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:27.010> these<00:03:27.190> to<00:03:27.400> the

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 
we tape tape the print to these to the

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.630 
we tape tape the print to these to the
leader<00:03:27.670> board<00:03:27.760> to<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:28.570> six<00:03:28.780> mil<00:03:28.959> Sentra<00:03:29.610> okay

leader board to the six mil Sentra okay
Peters<00:03:30.970> going<00:03:31.060> to<00:03:31.150> go<00:03:31.240> run<00:03:31.420> and<00:03:31.540> turn<00:03:31.600> the

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
Peters going to go run and turn the

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.140 
Peters going to go run and turn the
lights<00:03:31.930> off<00:03:32.580> so<00:03:33.580> you<00:03:33.670> can<00:03:33.730> see<00:03:33.910> what<00:03:34.060> he's

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
lights off so you can see what he's

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.920 
lights off so you can see what he's
doing<00:03:34.450> so<00:03:34.600> now<00:03:34.720> we're<00:03:34.900> back<00:03:35.080> and<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:37.690> key<00:03:37.900> here

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
doing so now we're back and the key here

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.560 
doing so now we're back and the key here
is<00:03:38.410> is<00:03:38.640> lining<00:03:39.640> it<00:03:39.730> up<00:03:39.820> perfectly<00:03:40.180> so<00:03:40.269> you<00:03:40.420> have

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
is is lining it up perfectly so you have

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.600 
is is lining it up perfectly so you have
an<00:03:40.690> eighth<00:03:40.840> inch<00:03:41.310> extra<00:03:42.310> on<00:03:42.940> all<00:03:43.390> four<00:03:43.630> sides

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
an eighth inch extra on all four sides

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.800 
an eighth inch extra on all four sides
that<00:03:45.610> is<00:03:45.790> going<00:03:46.120> to<00:03:46.209> be<00:03:46.300> your<00:03:46.390> bleed<00:03:46.600> that's

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
that is going to be your bleed that's

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.630 
that is going to be your bleed that's
going<00:03:46.959> to<00:03:47.019> be<00:03:47.140> what's<00:03:47.350> cut<00:03:47.830> off<00:03:47.980> once<00:03:48.400> this

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
going to be what's cut off once this

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.570 
going to be what's cut off once this
piece<00:03:48.910> is<00:03:49.090> mounted<00:03:49.570> to<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:50.560> acrylic<00:03:51.810> so<00:03:53.580> yep

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
piece is mounted to the acrylic so yep

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.360 
piece is mounted to the acrylic so yep
so<00:03:54.790> we've<00:03:54.910> attached<00:03:55.209> the<00:03:55.330> adhesive<00:03:56.190> to<00:03:57.190> the

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
so we've attached the adhesive to the

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.610 
so we've attached the adhesive to the
leader<00:03:57.550> board<00:03:57.640> now<00:03:58.090> and<00:03:58.360> now<00:03:59.080> we're<00:03:59.230> double

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
leader board now and now we're double

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.140 
leader board now and now we're double
checking<00:03:59.920> to<00:04:00.250> make<00:04:01.209> sure<00:04:01.390> nothing<00:04:01.870> moved

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
checking to make sure nothing moved

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.310 
checking to make sure nothing moved
usually<00:04:04.150> it<00:04:04.239> doesn't<00:04:04.450> but<00:04:04.720> you<00:04:04.750> definitely

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
usually it doesn't but you definitely

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.690 
usually it doesn't but you definitely
want<00:04:05.440> to<00:04:05.470> double<00:04:05.709> check<00:04:05.739> otherwise<00:04:06.519> it's

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
want to double check otherwise it's

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.900 
want to double check otherwise it's
going<00:04:06.820> to<00:04:06.910> go<00:04:07.030> on<00:04:07.470> crooked<00:04:08.470> and<00:04:08.830> you<00:04:09.190> are<00:04:09.489> have

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
going to go on crooked and you are have

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.850 
going to go on crooked and you are have
a<00:04:09.940> look<00:04:10.209> at<00:04:10.360> that<00:04:10.510> point<00:04:10.780> you're<00:04:11.440> pulling<00:04:11.769> the

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
a look at that point you're pulling the

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.080 
a look at that point you're pulling the
whole<00:04:12.010> thing<00:04:12.250> back<00:04:12.430> off<00:04:12.640> the<00:04:12.790> piece<00:04:12.970> of

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
whole thing back off the piece of

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.129 
whole thing back off the piece of
acrylic

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.719 

that<00:04:16.680> glow<00:04:16.889> that<00:04:17.039> light<00:04:17.250> they<00:04:17.400> will<00:04:17.519> Peter

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
that glow that light they will Peter

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.020 
that glow that light they will Peter
gives<00:04:17.970> you<00:04:18.060> this<00:04:18.449> kind<00:04:18.870> of<00:04:18.959> a<00:04:19.079> sinister<00:04:19.349> look

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
gives you this kind of a sinister look

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.709 
gives you this kind of a sinister look
and<00:04:21.030> next<00:04:21.720> step<00:04:21.900> is<00:04:22.079> just<00:04:22.770> wipe<00:04:22.949> it<00:04:23.099> down<00:04:23.250> with

00:04:23.709 --> 00:04:23.719 
and next step is just wipe it down with

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:26.959 
and next step is just wipe it down with
their<00:04:24.719> hand<00:04:24.930> even<00:04:25.620> lint-free<00:04:26.009> cloths<00:04:26.610> leave<00:04:26.939> a

00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:26.969 
their hand even lint-free cloths leave a

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:28.429 
their hand even lint-free cloths leave a
little<00:04:27.240> bit<00:04:27.419> of<00:04:27.509> dust<00:04:27.689> the<00:04:27.990> only<00:04:28.169> thing<00:04:28.319> we

00:04:28.429 --> 00:04:28.439 
little bit of dust the only thing we

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:30.619 
little bit of dust the only thing we
found<00:04:28.620> that<00:04:28.860> really<00:04:29.520> seems<00:04:29.849> to<00:04:29.939> work<00:04:30.180> well<00:04:30.389> is

00:04:30.619 --> 00:04:30.629 
found that really seems to work well is

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:33.920 
found that really seems to work well is

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:31.480 
to press down on the lead edge words

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:36.510 
to press down on the lead edge words
appear<00:06:32.080> I<00:06:32.640> can<00:06:33.640> pull<00:06:33.880> up

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.620 

grab<00:06:37.520> that<00:06:37.730> release<00:06:38.060> liner<00:06:39.490> just<00:06:40.490> expose<00:06:41.420> your

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:41.630 
grab that release liner just expose your

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:50.460 
grab that release liner just expose your
visa

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:50.470 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.790 

so<00:06:51.040> now<00:06:51.190> the<00:06:51.270> last<00:06:52.270> step<00:06:52.360> is<00:06:53.260> to<00:06:53.470> hear<00:06:53.770> the

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.800 
so now the last step is to hear the

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.410 
so now the last step is to hear the
wooden<00:06:54.100> slats<00:06:54.370> so<00:06:55.530> we<00:06:56.530> make<00:06:56.950> marks<00:06:57.430> measure

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:58.420 
wooden slats so we make marks measure

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.780 
wooden slats so we make marks measure
out<00:06:58.690> top<00:06:59.500> and<00:06:59.680> bottom<00:06:59.980> from<00:07:00.220> the<00:07:00.310> side<00:07:00.490> so<00:07:00.760> that

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:00.790 
out top and bottom from the side so that

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.500 
out top and bottom from the side so that
are<00:07:01.030> equal<00:07:01.390> and<00:07:01.570> then<00:07:02.290> sand<00:07:03.300> basically<00:07:04.300> within

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:04.510 
are equal and then sand basically within

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:05.850 
are equal and then sand basically within
those<00:07:04.780> lines<00:07:05.050> is<00:07:05.200> where<00:07:05.350> the<00:07:05.470> wooden<00:07:05.710> slats

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:05.860 
those lines is where the wooden slats

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.980 
those lines is where the wooden slats
are<00:07:06.070> going<00:07:06.190> to<00:07:06.250> go<00:07:07.770> key<00:07:08.770> to<00:07:09.010> good<00:07:09.130> adhesion<00:07:09.990> and

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:10.990 
are going to go key to good adhesion and

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.040 
are going to go key to good adhesion and
then<00:07:11.170> we<00:07:11.350> apply<00:07:11.650> a<00:07:11.680> special<00:07:12.310> adhesive<00:07:13.020> to<00:07:14.020> the

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.050 
then we apply a special adhesive to the

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:22.230 
then we apply a special adhesive to the
sintra<00:07:14.560> and<00:07:15.090> to<00:07:16.090> the<00:07:16.210> slats<00:07:16.510> so<00:07:21.030> once<00:07:22.030> we<00:07:22.150> got

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 
sintra and to the slats so once we got

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.900 
sintra and to the slats so once we got
glue<00:07:22.510> on<00:07:22.630> both<00:07:22.780> the<00:07:22.930> sensor<00:07:23.260> in<00:07:23.350> the<00:07:23.440> wood<00:07:23.910> you

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:24.910 
glue on both the sensor in the wood you

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.580 
glue on both the sensor in the wood you
place<00:07:25.210> them<00:07:25.360> with<00:07:25.510> it<00:07:25.630> on<00:07:25.750> in<00:07:25.930> that<00:07:26.200> area<00:07:26.470> that

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:26.590 
place them with it on in that area that

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:32.340 
place them with it on in that area that
we<00:07:26.710> sanded<00:07:27.070> down<00:07:29.100> apply<00:07:30.100> enough<00:07:30.400> pressure<00:07:31.350> get

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:32.350 
we sanded down apply enough pressure get

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:36.300 
we sanded down apply enough pressure get
it<00:07:32.470> set<00:07:33.690> the<00:07:34.690> last<00:07:34.900> step<00:07:35.200> that<00:07:35.470> we'll<00:07:35.920> do<00:07:36.070> once

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:36.310 
it set the last step that we'll do once

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.600 
it set the last step that we'll do once
these<00:07:36.490> are<00:07:36.820> adhered<00:07:37.450> is<00:07:38.290> add<00:07:38.620> weight<00:07:38.920> and<00:07:39.130> let

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:39.610 
these are adhered is add weight and let

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.750 
these are adhered is add weight and let
them<00:07:39.760> sit<00:07:40.030> overnight<00:07:40.180> so<00:07:40.840> there's<00:07:41.080> the<00:07:41.320> final

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:41.760 
them sit overnight so there's the final

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.660 
them sit overnight so there's the final
finished<00:07:42.760> piece<00:07:43.000> it<00:07:43.260> basically<00:07:44.460> hangs<00:07:45.460> off

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:45.670 
finished piece it basically hangs off

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:47.450 
finished piece it basically hangs off
the<00:07:45.700> wall<00:07:45.970> about<00:07:46.240> 3/4<00:07:46.810> of<00:07:46.840> an<00:07:47.050> inch

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:47.460 
the wall about 3/4 of an inch

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.380 
the wall about 3/4 of an inch
I'll<00:07:48.460> show<00:07:48.730> you<00:07:48.820> what<00:07:48.940> it<00:07:49.000> looks<00:07:49.150> like<00:07:49.240> from

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:49.390 
I'll show you what it looks like from

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:54.390 
I'll show you what it looks like from
the<00:07:49.480> side<00:07:51.090> about<00:07:52.090> that<00:07:52.300> much<00:07:52.510> space<00:07:52.840> so<00:07:53.400> once

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:54.400 
the side about that much space so once

00:07:54.400 --> 00:08:00.210 
the side about that much space so once
again<00:07:54.520> there's<00:07:54.880> fish<00:07:55.060> print<00:07:57.030> thanks<00:07:58.030> Peter
