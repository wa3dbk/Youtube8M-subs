 of coffee remember that if you take children or 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.140

 decaffeinated 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.120
 use of a variety of strong coffee to 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.280
 that then do not know watering in a goal 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.559
 we put the sugar and a little chocolate 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.050
 that will give you more intensity of flavor and 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.970
 we remove so that each melice to 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.710
 then we add the little water to 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.550
 little and we let it dissolve 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.550

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.190
 we put our mixture in a container 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.140
 elongated that fits in the freezer 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.300
 once tempered we put it in the 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.640
 freezer for two hours then what 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.250
 we take out and with a fork we crush it 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.560
 we repeat this process every hour until 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.340
 get our mixture to stay 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.340

 accompanied with some whipped cream 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.810
 for this second hail I propose 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.970
 Hazelnut horchata 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.340
 it's very simple to do so let's go 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.860
 to need 250 grams of hazelnuts 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.049
 Toast or raw and water I have put 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.579
 half a liter and then added another medium 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.979
 liter but you can add the liter 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:07.659
 directly what is most comfortable for you 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:09.580
 to crush it then we leave it in 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.060
 soak to soften and it's time to 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.060

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.170
 hazelnut while you're taking the 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.640
 horchata you can pass it through a colander 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.640
 but I left as is 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.310

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.890
