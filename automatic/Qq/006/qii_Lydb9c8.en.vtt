two as you could see AP there Frank
Lampard<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.780> advanced<00:00:40.050> playmaker<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.920> he

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
Lampard is the advanced playmaker and he

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.549 
Lampard is the advanced playmaker and he
links<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.239> with<00:00:42.390> Torres<00:00:42.780> as<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.020> target<00:00:43.469> man

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
links in with Torres as a target man

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.299 
links in with Torres as a target man
I've<00:00:44.520> put<00:00:45.170> Torres's<00:00:46.170> instructions<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.100> pass

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
it to his feet I think that's where he's

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.540 
it to his feet I think that's where he's
most<00:00:49.410> effective<00:00:50.039> then<00:00:50.219> that's<00:00:50.370> where<00:00:50.489> he

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
most effective then that's where he

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.529 
most effective then that's where he
scored<00:00:50.760> 47<00:00:51.239> goals<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.750> me<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.649> season<00:00:53.539> on

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
left in the right you can see mater and

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.000 
left in the right you can see mater and
never<00:00:56.219> has<00:00:56.370> dead<00:00:56.610> both<00:00:56.789> winners<00:00:57.030> and

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
never has dead both winners and

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.220 
never has dead both winners and
Sturridge<00:00:59.010> as<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.250> complete<00:00:59.670> forward

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
Sturridge as a complete forward

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.990 
Sturridge as a complete forward
obviously<00:01:01.280> probably<00:01:02.280> won't<00:01:02.489> burn<00:01:02.820> a

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
obviously probably won't burn a

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.609 
obviously probably won't burn a
situation<00:01:03.600> but<00:01:03.719> he's<00:01:03.840> currently<00:01:04.260> injured<00:01:04.500> at

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
situation but he's currently injured at

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.070 
situation but he's currently injured at
the<00:01:04.680> moment<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.430> their<00:01:06.060> own<00:01:06.210> after<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.840> first

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
the moment on their own after the first

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.890 
the moment on their own after the first
season<00:01:07.610> so<00:01:08.610> Morales<00:01:09.330> box-to-box<00:01:09.810> midfielder

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
season so Morales box-to-box midfielder

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.609 
season so Morales box-to-box midfielder
and<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.680> rest<00:01:10.860> are<00:01:11.130> automatic<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:12.619> also

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
and the rest are automatic I also

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.210 
and the rest are automatic I also
occasionally<00:01:14.100> play<00:01:14.490> for<00:01:14.939> 5-1<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.409> very

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
occasionally play for 5-1 this is very

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.749 
occasionally play for 5-1 this is very
effective

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
effective

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.210 
effective
no<00:01:18.180> it's<00:01:18.330> not<00:01:18.450> very<00:01:18.509> effective<00:01:18.900> but<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.530> think

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
no it's not very effective but I think

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.090 
no it's not very effective but I think
it's<00:01:20.340> more<00:01:20.580> effective<00:01:21.290> against<00:01:22.290> team<00:01:22.830> such<00:01:23.070> as

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
it's more effective against team such as

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.469 
it's more effective against team such as
Arsenal<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.299> Barcelona<00:01:24.840> who<00:01:25.970> played<00:01:26.970> us<00:01:27.180> in

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
Arsenal and Barcelona who played us in

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.200 
Arsenal and Barcelona who played us in
style<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.080> keep<00:01:28.229> all<00:01:28.500> possession<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.210> it's

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
style and keep all possession and it's

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.690 
style and keep all possession and it's
basically<00:01:30.630> without<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.560> combi<00:01:31.890> forward<00:01:32.310> except

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
basically without a combi forward except

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.420 
basically without a combi forward except
I've<00:01:33.210> caught<00:01:33.540> anchorman<00:01:34.079> instead<00:01:34.650> behind<00:01:35.310> the

team of fielders so look where Morales
is<00:01:37.439> this<00:01:38.070> why<00:01:38.220> not<00:01:38.369> score<00:01:38.579> anchorman<00:01:39.000> here

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340

more leniency as to where the players

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.190 
more leniency as to where the players
actually<00:02:35.520> are<00:02:35.850> on<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.060> pitch<00:02:36.270> because<00:02:37.050> I<00:02:37.140> very

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
actually are on the pitch because I very

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.720 
actually are on the pitch because I very
unlikely<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.830> stick<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.160> their<00:02:38.310> position

because generally who I am and more of
expressive<00:02:41.910> person<00:02:42.150> so<00:02:42.690> I<00:02:42.930> like<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.530> players

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
expressive person so I like the players

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.970 
expressive person so I like the players
to<00:02:43.920> go<00:02:44.070> out<00:02:44.220> there<00:02:44.460> and<00:02:45.320> express<00:02:46.320> themselves<00:02:46.560> a

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
to go out there and express themselves a

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.980 
to go out there and express themselves a

going<00:03:27.480> tree<00:03:27.780> maybe<00:03:28.050> just<00:03:28.640> you<00:03:29.640> know<00:03:29.760> like<00:03:29.940> 10

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
going tree maybe just you know like 10

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.460 
going tree maybe just you know like 10
minutes<00:03:31.830> worth<00:03:32.010> of<00:03:32.190> footage<00:03:32.660> just<00:03:33.660> talking<00:03:34.290> to

minutes worth of footage just talking to

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.370 
minutes worth of footage just talking to
basically<00:03:34.920> because<00:03:35.880> I'm<00:03:36.090> I<00:03:36.420> think<00:03:37.080> that's

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
basically because I'm I think that's

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.540 
basically because I'm I think that's
probably<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.650> best<00:03:37.800> way<00:03:37.980> to<00:03:38.010> do<00:03:38.280> it

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
probably the best way to do it

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.930 
probably the best way to do it
so<00:03:39.290> Bruce<00:03:40.290> worried<00:03:40.530> for<00:03:40.680> my<00:03:40.800> absence<00:03:40.950> I<00:03:41.489> might
