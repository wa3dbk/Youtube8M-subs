00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.400
 in this video I wanted to tell you some 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.830
 more aspect about the representation of 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.860
 plans in water system as we saw 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:15.430
 they are represented by their traces that would be 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:19.180
 two independent lines means 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:21.790
 that this trace and this trace I will 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.580
 naming them quickly means how 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:27.010
 said that these traces are not the 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:31.360
 representation of the same line 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:33.460
 this is a raw line that as is the 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.040
 intersection of the plane with the plane 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.710
 vertical prediction if we wanted 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.149
 we will be interested for some reason 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.470
 horizontal projection of this trace 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.570
 I would be simply in line with 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.690
 land the same would happen with the trace 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.180
 horizontal plane is a line that 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.579
 although called premium p has 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.710
 nothing to do with the vertical projection 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.290
 of the trace are independent elements 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.420
 and if it will interest us equally, it would be 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.370
 on the land line your forecast 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.170
 vertical what is that aspect that I want 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.760
 that you take into account that the 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.760
 representation of the trace normally 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.250
 we limit it 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.650
 to the first quadrant what it would look like in 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.290
 the first quadrant the visible part of 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.550
 that line but we must understand that this 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.540
 continuous trace for example vertical 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.000
 continuous days more or less in this 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.310
 sense 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.590
 and the enjoyment would continue in this 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.060
 sense 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.800
 the trace continues but this part already 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.570
 it would continue behind the plane 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.520
 vertical forecast and this trace 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.380
 it would continue below the plane 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.970
 horizontal precision is something that 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.950
 I want you to keep in mind that the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.690
 tracing ends here but this is the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.240
 intersection point between the traces 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.830
 vertical trace and drawn and fontÃ s and that 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.870
 was then they continue what happens that 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.660
 many times we forget 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.150
 discontinuous line we forget about that 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.410
 part of the trace because it can be that 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.170
 At first we do not need and 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.030
 nor is it a plan to saturate the drawing with 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.530
 excess line but if I want that that 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.390
 keep this in mind because sometimes 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.750
 when you are going to locate an intersection 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.660
 between plane between straight it turns out that 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.000
 we have to resort to the extension 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.620
 of the traces in their non-visible parts 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.250
 so I would like us to see 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.080
 some particular case such as for example 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.390
 these two planes parallel to the planes 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.560
 of projection but that go through others 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.900
 quadrants that are not the first 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.150
 quadrant and the plane the principle does not 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.090
 it would be visible what happened for example 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.580
 with the plane p is a plane that crosses 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.180
 the horizontal plane behind the plane 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.490
 vertical with which its intersection 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.430
 would be not visible would something like that more or 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.150
 less an agreement that would be your trace 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.849
 horizontal 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.319
 retrace memories only has 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.480
 a trace since it is a plane 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.340
 parallel to a projection plane in 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.349
 this case to the vertical would have no trace 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.930
 vertical and its horizontal projection 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:59.209
 it would not be visible discontinuous and it would be 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.739
 above the earth line and that 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.780
 would happen with the plane because it would be 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.790
 basically the same is below the 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.650
 horizontal plane projection only 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.560
 has a trace with the vertical plane and its 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.090
 tracing would be visible so that camps 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.380
 a line parallel to the ground line 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:18.950
 and that would be the vertical trace 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.540
 in our plane that draws vertical by 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.990
 below the lid on land not visible 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.410
 Well, this was simply what I wanted 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:29.270
 that you would see that you know there are parts of 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.300
 the traces that are prolonged and we do not see 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.530
 which are the non-visible parts and that in 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.850
 some cases in some problems 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.660
 we have to take them into account and 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:42.040
 resort to them well this is all and 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.040
 we continue with wheat systems
