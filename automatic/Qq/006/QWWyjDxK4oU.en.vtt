heavy right it's too much most people
seem<00:01:25.160> to<00:01:25.190> think<00:01:25.399> that<00:01:25.990> but<00:01:26.990> what's<00:01:27.319> on<00:01:27.470> the<00:01:27.560> lmg

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
seem to think that but what's on the lmg

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.740 
seem to think that but what's on the lmg
should<00:01:28.160> be<00:01:28.280> on<00:01:28.369> everything<00:01:28.819> more<00:01:29.060> or<00:01:29.149> less<00:01:29.179> so

should be on everything more or less so
now<00:01:30.020> we<00:01:30.170> can<00:01:30.380> test<00:01:30.619> that<00:01:30.830> because<00:01:31.130> we<00:01:31.250> have<00:01:31.429> we

00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:31.819 
now we can test that because we have we

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:33.910 
now we can test that because we have we
have<00:01:31.970> a<00:01:32.030> testable<00:01:32.539> environment<00:01:33.200> for<00:01:33.530> console

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
this but let's see where it takes us for

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.050 
this but let's see where it takes us for
one<00:02:15.950> there<00:02:16.760> was<00:02:16.879> like<00:02:17.530> statistically

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
one there was like statistically

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.020 
one there was like statistically
medics<00:02:19.660> or<00:02:19.900> assault<00:02:20.290> class<00:02:20.920> was<00:02:21.370> like<00:02:21.790> played

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
medics or assault class was like played

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.370 
medics or assault class was like played
by<00:02:22.209> eighty<00:02:22.450> percent<00:02:22.660> or<00:02:22.989> something<00:02:23.230> like<00:02:23.319> that

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
by eighty percent or something like that

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.250 
by eighty percent or something like that
yeah<00:02:23.849> specially<00:02:24.849> if<00:02:24.880> you<00:02:24.970> wait<00:02:25.180> in<00:02:25.300> scoring<00:02:25.840> in

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
yeah specially if you wait in scoring in

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.170 
yeah specially if you wait in scoring in
that<00:02:26.440> as<00:02:26.620> well<00:02:26.770> so<00:02:27.400> this<00:02:27.550> is<00:02:27.580> a<00:02:27.700> way<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:27.910> nerve

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
that as well so this is a way to nerve

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.970 
that as well so this is a way to nerve
that<00:02:28.390> class<00:02:28.660> to<00:02:29.080> get<00:02:29.230> people<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.560> try<00:02:29.800> other

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
that class to get people to try other

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.430 
that class to get people to try other
classes<00:02:30.459> as<00:02:30.610> well<00:02:30.780> without<00:02:31.780> breaking<00:02:32.380> it

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
classes as well without breaking it

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.910 
classes as well without breaking it
hopefully<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:33.489> small<00:02:33.790> pack<00:02:34.470> did<00:02:35.470> not<00:02:35.680> have

hopefully the small pack did not have

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.400

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
in there that's random and we want to

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.720 
in there that's random and we want to
remove<00:03:07.510> random<00:03:07.900> and<00:03:08.110> so<00:03:09.099> what<00:03:09.250> we<00:03:09.370> want<00:03:09.519> to<00:03:09.610> do

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.250 
remove random and so what we want to do
is<00:03:09.910> when<00:03:10.209> that<00:03:10.420> happens<00:03:10.780> when<00:03:10.900> you<00:03:11.019> get<00:03:11.110> the

blog / currently as well kinda based on

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.880 
blog / currently as well kinda based on
the<00:04:28.120> same<00:04:28.300> mentality<00:04:28.539> but<00:04:28.960> it's<00:04:29.110> also<00:04:29.260> too

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
the same mentality but it's also too

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.890 
the same mentality but it's also too
slow<00:04:30.159> the<00:04:30.849> problem<00:04:31.210> is<00:04:31.300> we're<00:04:31.450> basing<00:04:31.720> it<00:04:31.810> on

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
slow the problem is we're basing it on

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.430 
slow the problem is we're basing it on
suppression

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
suppression

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.050 
suppression
and<00:04:32.530> what<00:04:32.950> we're<00:04:33.070> basing<00:04:33.340> it<00:04:33.460> on<00:04:33.640> when

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
and what we're basing it on when

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.580 
and what we're basing it on when
suppression<00:04:34.540> is<00:04:34.720> you're<00:04:35.320> not<00:04:35.410> depressed

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
suppression is you're not depressed

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.530 
suppression is you're not depressed
anymore<00:04:35.860> which<00:04:36.220> is<00:04:36.250> the<00:04:36.670> number<00:04:36.850> is<00:04:37.150> zero

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
anymore which is the number is zero

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.870 
anymore which is the number is zero
basically<00:04:38.110> what<00:04:38.680> we<00:04:38.770> want<00:04:38.980> it<00:04:39.160> to<00:04:39.340> be<00:04:39.490> which<00:04:39.850> is

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
basically what we want it to be which is

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.810 
basically what we want it to be which is
not<00:04:40.540> in<00:04:40.840> final<00:04:41.200> stand<00:04:41.440> release<00:04:41.680> is<00:04:42.460> when<00:04:42.700> you

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
not in final stand release is when you

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.460 
not in final stand release is when you
when<00:04:43.150> suppression<00:04:43.600> starts<00:04:43.960> going<00:04:44.230> down

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
when suppression starts going down

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.070 
when suppression starts going down
that's<00:04:44.980> that<00:04:45.490> when<00:04:46.060> it<00:04:46.240> starts<00:04:46.540> counting<00:04:46.780> a

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
that's that when it starts counting a

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.660 
that's that when it starts counting a
little<00:04:47.320> cool<00:04:47.470> down<00:04:47.650> and<00:04:47.830> then<00:04:47.890> you<00:04:48.340> can<00:04:48.550> be

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
little cool down and then you can be

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.930 
little cool down and then you can be
healed<00:04:49.390> or<00:04:49.780> spawned<00:04:50.380> on<00:04:50.530> it<00:04:50.800> okay<00:04:51.250> and<00:04:51.430> so<00:04:51.850> we

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
healed or spawned on it okay and so we

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.610 
healed or spawned on it okay and so we
will<00:04:52.030> speed<00:04:52.300> it<00:04:52.330> up<00:04:52.570> for<00:04:52.930> sure<00:04:53.080> it's<00:04:53.230> too<00:04:53.410> long

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
will speed it up for sure it's too long

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.190 
will speed it up for sure it's too long
now<00:04:53.830> but<00:04:54.070> yeah<00:04:54.580> in<00:04:55.090> general<00:04:55.330> we<00:04:55.510> kind<00:04:55.990> of<00:04:56.050> like

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
now but yeah in general we kind of like

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.110 
now but yeah in general we kind of like
it<00:04:56.380> that<00:04:56.620> way<00:04:56.890> and<00:04:57.280> also<00:04:57.670> we're<00:04:57.940> obviously

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
it that way and also we're obviously

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.360 
it that way and also we're obviously
going<00:04:58.450> to<00:04:58.510> look<00:04:58.660> at<00:04:58.840> suppression<00:04:59.380> itself<00:04:59.740> how

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
going to look at suppression itself how

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.640 
going to look at suppression itself how
easy<00:05:00.730> it<00:05:00.910> is<00:05:00.970> to<00:05:01.030> suppress<00:05:01.450> someone<00:05:01.840> how<00:05:02.080> big

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
easy it is to suppress someone how big

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.350 
easy it is to suppress someone how big
