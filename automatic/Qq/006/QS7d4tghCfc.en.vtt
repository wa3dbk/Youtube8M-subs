00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
the same room I think the best way to

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
who aren't fans of the show is that it's

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.209 
who aren't fans of the show is that it's
kind<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.600> like<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.989> combination<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.620> Pokemon

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219

to<00:01:58.710> gain<00:01:58.890> by<00:01:59.130> grinding<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.850> level<00:02:00.090> up<00:02:00.180> but<00:02:00.630> it's

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
to gain by grinding to level up but it's

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.480 
to gain by grinding to level up but it's
pretty<00:02:01.049> lame<00:02:01.259> because<00:02:01.409> this<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.860> paid<00:02:02.189> app

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
pretty lame because this is a paid app

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.490 
pretty lame because this is a paid app
this<00:02:03.030> would<00:02:03.240> be<00:02:03.329> totally<00:02:03.689> acceptable<00:02:04.079> if<00:02:04.320> this

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
this would be totally acceptable if this

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.010 
this would be totally acceptable if this
was<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.680> freemium<00:02:05.159> game<00:02:05.490> but<00:02:05.820> it's<00:02:05.969> not<00:02:06.030> mind

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
was a freemium game but it's not mind

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.690 
was a freemium game but it's not mind
you<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.320> doesn't<00:02:07.710> ruin<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.009> game<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.520> hasn't

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
you this doesn't ruin the game it hasn't

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.279 
you this doesn't ruin the game it hasn't
really<00:02:08.879> bothered<00:02:09.360> me<00:02:09.390> yet<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.869> just<00:02:09.899> think<00:02:10.200> the

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
really bothered me yet I just think the

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.410 
really bothered me yet I just think the
energy<00:02:10.470> meter<00:02:10.860> should<00:02:11.220> not<00:02:11.489> exist

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
energy meter should not exist

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.960 
energy meter should not exist
anyway<00:02:13.050> this<00:02:13.230> game<00:02:13.470> is<00:02:13.740> enjoyable<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.580> replay

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
anyway this game is enjoyable to replay

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.320 
anyway this game is enjoyable to replay

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
so even if you have to replace it's not

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.270 
so even if you have to replace it's not
