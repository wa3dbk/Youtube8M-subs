what is normally printed on these
machines<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.090> decided<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:43.010> cut<00:00:44.010> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
machines and so I decided to cut the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.380 
machines and so I decided to cut the
design<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.730> do<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.820> bunch<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.120> different

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
design and do a bunch of different

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.479 
design and do a bunch of different
pieces<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.020> actually<00:00:46.350> 29<00:00:46.829> separate

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
pieces this is actually 29 separate

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.459 
pieces this is actually 29 separate
pieces<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.210> printed<00:00:48.600> individually<00:00:49.289> and

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
pieces that I printed individually and

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.560 
pieces that I printed individually and
then<00:00:49.559> assembled<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.430> these<00:00:51.300> are<00:00:51.420> both

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
then assembled and these are both

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.680 
then assembled and these are both
life-size<00:00:52.110> one<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.860> one<00:00:52.980> with<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.219> original

life-size one to one with the original

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.150 
life-size one to one with the original
they<00:00:54.690> both<00:00:54.840> weigh<00:00:55.289> about<00:00:55.440> 8<00:00:55.770> pounds<00:00:56.100> each<00:00:56.250> and

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
they both weigh about 8 pounds each and

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.290 
they both weigh about 8 pounds each and
maybe<00:00:59.160> about<00:00:59.399> $150<00:01:00.329> worth<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.629> material<00:01:02.300> we

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
maybe about $150 worth of material we

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.509 
maybe about $150 worth of material we
asked<00:01:03.719> women<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.110> show<00:01:04.530> us<00:01:04.739> how<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.010> printer

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
asked women to show us how the printer

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.149 
asked women to show us how the printer
works<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:06.479> decided<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.020> make<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.200> small<00:01:07.470> version

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
works we decided to make a small version

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.219 
works we decided to make a small version

with<00:01:10.400> so<00:01:11.400> we're<00:01:11.549> making<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.939> miniature<00:01:12.360> test

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020
