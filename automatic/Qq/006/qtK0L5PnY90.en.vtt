00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:06.500
 Hi, I'm saying that from mom they stop 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.570
 feeley and mom speaks Spanish is almost 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.670
 lunchtime and I found myself from 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.530
 recipe in craft foods that I found 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.020
 super easy to do I have all the 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.180
 ingredients and it's called puppies 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.270
 We are going to use tortillas 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:24.250
 Of flour 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:29.050
 refried beans already heated 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:31.830
 without looking for this cheese it is low in fat 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.830
 I bought 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:37.829
 oscar mayer sausages 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.199
 and also some ketchup 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.239
 this time my son will help me 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:45.980
 prepare those tortillas with sausages 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.980
 with this favorite ingredient 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.210
 the bean here 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.579
 well let's prepare it then 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.450
 when the first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:03.090
 place the refried beans 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.090
 let's spread it on the tortillas 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.750
 then 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.400
 without other 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.400
 that's here 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:35.160
 we put a little sauce can use 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:39.110
 Mexican sauce or shake sauce but 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.110
 we are going to use ketchup 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.660
 and we put 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.660
 the sausage 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.700
 we roll it 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.380
 and we will use 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.350
 paper towel 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.009
 so it does not dry out because sometimes the 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.960
 tortilla dries and does not get on paper 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.380
 towel because we 're going to put it on 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.520
 microwave oven 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.580
 ok then this we will take the 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.690
 microwave and then I show them how 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.580
 we have left 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.430
 good as are the tortillas 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:26.150
 Wrapped in paper towels we put them on 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.150
 microwave between 1 and 1 minute and a half 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.420
 let's put 1 and 20 how 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.660

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.540

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.810
 taking advantage of what 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.300
 I'm using tomatoes from my garden 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.400
 that my husband 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.239
