problem<00:03:01.960> veto<00:03:02.290> bodies<00:03:02.680> for<00:03:02.860> example<00:03:03.250> it<00:03:03.580> show

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
problem veto bodies for example it show

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.030 
problem veto bodies for example it show
you<00:03:04.000> three<00:03:04.480> different<00:03:04.510> styles<00:03:05.290> on<00:03:05.440> one<00:03:05.800> in<00:03:05.950> the

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
you three different styles on one in the

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.340 
you three different styles on one in the
same<00:03:06.250> shape<00:03:06.610> of<00:03:06.850> body<00:03:07.120> and<00:03:07.390> show<00:03:08.170> you<00:03:08.230> how

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
same shape of body and show you how

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.530 
same shape of body and show you how
differently<00:03:09.130> that<00:03:09.430> can<00:03:09.580> turn<00:03:09.790> out<00:03:10.060> I<00:03:10.240> think

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
differently that can turn out I think

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.120 
differently that can turn out I think
that's<00:03:10.660> something<00:03:10.870> yet<00:03:11.200> it's<00:03:11.830> quite

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
that's something yet it's quite

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.620 
that's something yet it's quite
important<00:03:12.640> because<00:03:12.670> you<00:03:12.910> do<00:03:13.090> not<00:03:13.240> need<00:03:13.480> to

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
important because you do not need to

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.230 
important because you do not need to
stick<00:03:13.870> to<00:03:14.020> one<00:03:14.200> certain<00:03:14.740> shape<00:03:15.220> or<00:03:15.520> theme<00:03:15.790> or

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
stick to one certain shape or theme or

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.380 
stick to one certain shape or theme or
something<00:03:16.660> to<00:03:16.780> turn<00:03:16.930> out<00:03:17.140> cool<00:03:17.970> anyway<00:03:18.970> yeah<00:03:19.210> I

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
something to turn out cool anyway yeah I

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.910 
something to turn out cool anyway yeah I
think<00:03:19.480> that<00:03:19.750> concludes<00:03:19.900> this<00:03:20.200> update<00:03:20.590> hope
