00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
radiation exactly where it needs to go

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.450 
radiation exactly where it needs to go
delivering<00:01:51.450> exact<00:01:51.960> doses<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.829> cure<00:01:53.130> skin

delivering exact doses to cure skin

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.270 
delivering exact doses to cure skin
cancer<00:01:53.970> but<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.780> data<00:01:54.960> supports<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:56.070> this

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
cancer but the data supports that this

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.190 
cancer but the data supports that this
has<00:01:56.490> as<00:01:56.790> good<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:57.060> clearance<00:01:57.479> rate<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.840> surgery

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
has as good a clearance rate of surgery

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.620 
has as good a clearance rate of surgery
and<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:59.040> hope<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.939> painless<00:02:00.270> procedure

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
and the hope is this painless procedure

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.840 
and the hope is this painless procedure
will<00:02:01.409> keep<00:02:01.590> patients<00:02:02.100> coming<00:02:02.340> in<00:02:02.549> for

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
will keep patients coming in for
