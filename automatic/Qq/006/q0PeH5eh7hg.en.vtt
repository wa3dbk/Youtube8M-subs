approximately 12 years under the plan
that<00:01:54.340> I<00:01:54.370> proposed<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:56.320> is<00:01:56.500> solvent<00:01:59.640> so<00:02:00.640> the

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
that I proposed it is solvent so the

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.520 
that I proposed it is solvent so the
differences<00:02:01.270> in<00:02:01.390> our<00:02:01.510> Medicare<00:02:01.960> perspective

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
differences in our Medicare perspective

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.230 
differences in our Medicare perspective
could<00:02:02.710> not<00:02:02.860> be<00:02:02.980> more<00:02:03.130> stark<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:03.730> dramatic<00:02:04.120> and

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
could not be more stark and dramatic and

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.840 
could not be more stark and dramatic and
I<00:02:04.360> think<00:02:04.570> is<00:02:04.690> the<00:02:04.840> people<00:02:05.170> as<00:02:05.320> the<00:02:06.130> seniors<00:02:06.700> in

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
I think is the people as the seniors in

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.490 
I think is the people as the seniors in
America<00:02:07.240> understand<00:02:07.750> what<00:02:07.930> the<00:02:08.050> president's

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
America understand what the president's

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
to find it unacceptable and we're going

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.410 
to find it unacceptable and we're going
to<00:02:12.130> get<00:02:12.220> a<00:02:12.280> lot<00:02:12.460> of<00:02:12.490> support<00:02:12.910> from<00:02:13.030> people<00:02:13.210> who

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
to get a lot of support from people who

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.820 
to get a lot of support from people who

understand that Medicare should be

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.850 
understand that Medicare should be
