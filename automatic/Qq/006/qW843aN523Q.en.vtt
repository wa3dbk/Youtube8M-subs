00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.180
 for merchant channel netflix nice that 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.990
 you 're on again today 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.690
 our topic 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.089
 the most frequently asked questions about 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.159
 topic of medical studies and I have me 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:16.189
 considering that I ask a few the 

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:19.529
 I have been asked the most 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:22.199
 during my studies course times 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.519
 record and answer them once and 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.839
 maybe it can really be one or the other 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.970
 help others 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:28.199
 I hope you like the video and 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.960
 wifi direct one on 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.730
 yes the first question is always you need it 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.260
 a cut of 10 and I have that 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.660
 if you do not have my other videos yet 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.000
 has ever answered and 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:44.610
 No, you do not need 10 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.400
 Of course it would be fine but you can 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.220
 also in the range between 10 to 15 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.700
 lie and be taken directly yet 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.290
 in the same year were, what including 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.250
 I think that one is one 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.560
 has to wait a bit 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.560
 but you do not necessarily have to be 10 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.460
 you have to start it for years 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.440
 to study 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.910
 As I said I did not have that either 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.170
 and yes that's the first answer 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.300
 then of course the question is how 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.770
 you study for a long time you have to 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.900
 adjust to the study is like 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.350
 as long as it takes really long 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.360
 because you never really stop listening 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.070
 study so if you are already a doctor 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.650
 you have to have any training 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.990
 and do not see fit visit because 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.810
 The subject is now times as complex and 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.390
 Andermatt have new insights in the 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.520
 Medicine, so to speak, again 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.659
 learn new and new techniques new 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.370
 equipment 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.350
 Of course, that has to be done somehow 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.360
 be renewed and there you always have to 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.520
 but learn the study itself now 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.610
 A medical assistant is where you really are in 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.610
 The university itself lasts six years 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:54.479
 regular study period and of course if 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.549
 Being an assistant doctor is natural 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.369
 not yet properly doctor then you do 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.710
 again, depending on the subject five to 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.250
 then six years to be a specialist until then 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.850
 really have a medical appointment 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.409
 can 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.270
 adhered to a private practice 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.510
 can or until you ever 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.610
 Something really is that takes 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.610
 already up to twelve years so in the 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.630
 Rule yes it really takes then 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.420
 but it's worth it 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.340
 why the study itself is structured 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.590
 You can read that a lot on the internet 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.660
 in the beginning one is before the clinic until the 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.390
 First state examination that is called one makes 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.600
 just one learns the human 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.040
 Just know body in itself 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:39.750
 anatomy physiology psychology 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:43.319
 biochemistry chemistry physics biology everything 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.910
 possible dry substance in principle until 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.670
 For the first start together the risk 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.269
 then you enter the clinic and have 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.040
 so to speak, to the end 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.590
 things are already rather to the eastern 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.610
 direction is so you can also 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.739
 already in the different 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.239
 get a taste of the subject 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.700
 but you do not do that now 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:06.209
 Explicitly how to use them later 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.530
 To do the specialist training then 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.070
 enters his village 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.760
 yes, and in itself it has then the hammer 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.920
 exam 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.940
 after having the bj the bj is that 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.040
 Practical where to go again in hospital 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.560
 actually all the time is and also 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.190
 actually works as a doctor but 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.170
 Actually, he is also so practicable yes 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.459
 and to do before last year 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:35.489
 then the second state examination 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:38.160
 writes and then you are yes 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.530
 nursing practice many questions always say 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.959
 You can fool 100 play price 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.850
 that also start the study and 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.420
 do the internship afterwards or 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.250
 in the middle 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.000
 but in any case the team needs to 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.920
 to the physics finished reading three months 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.660
 and my tip to you does that 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.459
 nursing internship before studying 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.859
 I made the mistake that I did that 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.720
 or mistake but I have it on everyone 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.910
 fall my studies started and only 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.380
 then the nursing internship always, so to speak 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.290
 I pushed in the holidays 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.760
 two semester breaks sacrificed for it 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.569
 because I think that is 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.250
 chemistry internship in between and 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.540
 psychology internship i believe and the 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.220
 were already in the semester break 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.380
 Plus, I had to go back one more time 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.690
 nursing internship means that means mine 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.220
 first two semester holidays because easy 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.199
 so I did not realize that she was 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.889
 because I was there the whole time nothing 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:30.479
 Aula and all the time holding internship 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.010
 That's why it would be from 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.260
 advantage if you are really a bit 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.639
 what kind of material would you like because of the 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.949
 already in the first two semesters anyway 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.600
 then you are enough and some are ferries 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:42.630
 actually needs doing that 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.430
 Best before studying if it's too late 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.389
 all too late do you manage in any 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.910
 even while studying 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:52.639
 do not worry but it takes you hall 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:55.020
 expensive vacation away is still a question 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:57.900
 You have to know the factory skills 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.760
 Skills are so special when 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.440
 but emi people after only 17 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.930
 you do not need one 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.860
 Knowledge so you come and do it 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:10.410
 that will really go from zero to 100 2 in 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.560
 short time but it will be all over again 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.180
 durchgekaut and really makes you there 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.190
 Do not worry if you die 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.960
 Skills somehow have me because 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:23.180
 you 've been voted out for decades 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:25.500
 As I expect, I do not worry 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:28.199
 So what I give you as a tip 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.570
 it could be that you are not direct 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:33.449
 All books you need at most 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.849
 for the first semester prometheus because 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:37.860
 all three volumes and dual at and 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:40.110
 rest, i could buy everything from la so 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.020
 I'm not directly into such mountain books because 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:45.930
 so media learns or endspurt scripts 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.060
 then you in the smaller subjects 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.440
 So maybe a little help there 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.669
 to get into the matter 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.440
 you can borrow and 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.699
 Generally for the smaller fans 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.510
 you also at the library the 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:56.250
 lend things 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:00.240
 So since it does not necessarily have much 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:04.050
 buy every little book 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:06.110
 that's why what can you do something 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:10.380
 one still say 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.740
 how do you learn or are you? 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.050
 it 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.940
 hard it is much to learn there is far too 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.360
 learn yes that is really too much 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.340
 learn 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.050
 especially in the first two semesters 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.699
 everything just comes on 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:23.970
 but if you really enjoy the thing 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:25.199
 then you can do it then so I can 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:30.599
 I really have in the beginning 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:33.060
 It was also from 8 o'clock till 67 o'clock 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:34.770
 in the evenings and there you have it 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:38.130
 then or in between times in the vip 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:39.900
 Law for 45 hours and then again 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.550
 learned so in the library was 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.409
 not the easiest to learn because of it 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.520
 it's just quiet and everyone around 

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:47.130
 you learn around and you have those 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.810
 motivation to learn at home then 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.490
 Would you like the fridge or 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.259
 Otherwise , I found it there 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:55.139
 Little hard for oral exams 

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:56.729
 as well as for exams 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:58.949
 we got together in small groups 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:01.280
 set to learn it once 

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:05.159
 once read that too 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.810
 We promised to speak that way 

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:08.340
 that's hard in the integrity you read 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.630
 do you think you understood it you have it 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.650
 also understood you can just do it 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:14.099
 do not reproduce 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:15.750
 yes, and everyone has their own way 

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:17.070
 The technique of learning the visual 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.960
 they all looked at her 

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.669
 Pictures to the others need text in 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.409
 the dual row and read that 

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:24.150
 completely by some like me 

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:27.990
 just to be stupid with one 

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:31.259
 book to read books in any case 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:34.310
 Let's say it's like his somehow 

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:37.440
 own tactics and good also last 

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:38.099
 a good tactic just a song too 

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.199
 write 

00:07:38.099 --> 00:07:42.120
 if you also maybe with lyrics 

00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:43.169
 then learn a look nevertheless times a 

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.639
 other videos 

00:07:43.169 --> 00:07:46.530
 I also have a few learn 

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:48.150
 written off and otherwise up to 

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:51.169
 next video if you have questions there 

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.169
 Write it down in the comments
