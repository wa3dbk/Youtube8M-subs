00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.910
 Today we make a yogurt cake 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.660
 namely in the colorful one variant the 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.880
 for the children's birthday is 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.930
 who that for his normal birthday 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.279
 Of course he does not need any 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.770
 take food coloring and then has 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.689
 we simply need it in yellow 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:29.279
 more yogurt sugar oil lemon flavor her 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.010
 Of course you can also take orange flavor 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.070
 If he wanted baking powder vanilla sugar 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:37.760
 three eggs and as I said our bags 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.220
 with food coloring works best 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.320
 for cake powder color or pastes 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.769
 color these liquid ones are not 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.969
 made strong because it is too bright 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:59.129
 First of all we will be the sugar 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:01:01.940
 yogurt our aroma and eggs 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.940
 stir 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:28.870
 that have mixed well 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:31.260
 Vanilla sugar and seven of our flour 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.260
 about that 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:40.090
 that means that also a key 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:56.220
 We can also get and baking powder 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:56.220
 Give it back in again 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.760
 so that was already well digested 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.240
 we now and then while stirring that 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.240
 oil to it 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.770
 a bit and work in 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.940
 if you've heard well is 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.290
 the dough finished as far as said for 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.850
 Of course they are not 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.160
 just want to dye the pack in so 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:04.390
 the springform but we are sharing it now 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.920
 first in four portions on the whole 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.770
 we split first 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.410
 times our colors I have unfortunately 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.790
 only four 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.990
 I have one more but you can 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.010
 of course buy so many colors 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.990
 you who desire to quite different 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.150
 So turquoise there are also and songs 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.000
 everything was nice 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.660
 Artificially, as I said every color 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.660
 Stir well 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:41.700
 If our day was funny colorful is now 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:45.200
 ever prepared there is already 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:48.150
 a sheet of baking paper clamped down 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.799
 and then the day comes in and there 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.390
 my daughter will go through this cake 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.890
 she has been allowed to decide 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.760
 which phase comes first which color 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:02.909
 completely red ok so come down 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:05.510
 red I always give them of the 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.510
 hut in 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.660
 which color should come now 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:44.009
 He always presses the other colors 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:45.810
 you can go on, too, of course 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:49.370
 also baub wise go in then have 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.370
 her very colorful spots 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:33.820
 my son is clear as last comes now 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.850
 under cakes in the preheated oven 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:46.050
 then I preheated at 280 degrees 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:46.050
 and week about 40 minutes finished 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.180
 that does not usually look that way 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.300
 Nice office could be afterwards 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:55.120
 just cut away and the colors are 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.440
 but really nice and strong now 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.540
 Let's just put the cake in 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.580
 and then he comes right at the book 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.720
 Rust for cooling are shown 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.430
 simply with what 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.950
 icing sugar until 7 then you see the 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.670
 color on top of it not so and then 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.670
 he is finished
