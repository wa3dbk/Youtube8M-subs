the first ever African American
president<00:00:35.160> why<00:00:35.550> do<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.790> think<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.120> took<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.450> us

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
someone in office of African American

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.420 
someone in office of African American
descent<00:00:40.520> well<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:42.329> think<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:43.290> maybe<00:00:44.219> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
descent well I think that maybe the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.369 
descent well I think that maybe the
country<00:00:44.789> wasn't<00:00:45.000> ready<00:00:45.360> for<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.110> think

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
country wasn't ready for it and I think

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.010 
country wasn't ready for it and I think
this<00:00:46.559> was<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.920> right<00:00:47.100> time<00:00:47.450> you<00:00:48.450> know<00:00:48.600> he<00:00:48.870> was

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
this was the right time you know he was

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.720 
this was the right time you know he was
the<00:00:49.140> right<00:00:49.320> person<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.370> know<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.550> think

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
the right person you know I think

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.029 
the right person you know I think
because<00:00:51.120> because<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.530> know<00:00:52.680> our<00:00:52.829> past

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
because because of you know our past

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.760 
because because of you know our past
president<00:00:53.699> that's<00:00:54.149> going<00:00:54.510> out<00:00:54.690> created<00:00:55.620> some

president that's going out created some

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.760 
president that's going out created some
situations<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.730> think<00:00:57.360> they<00:00:57.480> made<00:00:57.690> it

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
the one thing where we need change in

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:53.759 
the one thing where we need change in
the<00:03:52.450> US<00:03:52.720> would<00:03:52.930> be<00:03:52.989> what<00:03:53.350> and<00:03:53.530> we're<00:03:53.620> gonna

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
regulations and all but I think we're

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.400 
regulations and all but I think we're
gonna<00:04:03.130> have<00:04:03.370> to<00:04:03.549> maybe<00:04:03.870> regulate<00:04:04.870> some<00:04:05.200> of<00:04:05.319> the
