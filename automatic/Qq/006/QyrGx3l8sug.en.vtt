00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.950
 it's no surprise to anyone that the price 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.720
 of smartphones is getting more and more 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.639
 higher in Brazil than for some 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.500
 may decrease interest in a 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.960
 little more expensive than average yet 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.690
 they offer another resource, this is 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.400
 the case for alcatel one touch 23 came to 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.230
 market as an excellent intermediary 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:25.500
 focused on audio but which costs more 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:27.630
 than I should give the cartel announced there 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.609
 three as an irreversible smartphone the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.470
 which means that basically the screen 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.020
 You can adjust the angle you want 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.760
 or you can use it upside down 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.710
 even though it is too much a statement to 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.690
 This strategy 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.640
 additional gain saved 3 is a model 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.780
 completely symmetrical in addition to bringing 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.010
 an excellent design 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.320
 even if it has a construction in 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.420
 with the exception of cameras does not 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.250
 difference what angle do you use it is well 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.960
 thin even being a good option 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.010
 for those who prefer smartphones to use 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.010
 with only one hand 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.809
 there are two versions of kindle 3 of 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.430
 different sizes a strategy 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.739
 apple style but only the version with 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.170
 4.7 inch screen arrived in Brazil 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.880
 while the 5.5-inch version still 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.369
 It was not confirmed here. 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.840
 the ideal 720p resolution for this 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.070
 size of screen with a density of 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.320
 pixels compatible 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.600
 plus one of the best lcd technologies 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.820
 ips of the moment 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.560
 technicolor fabric technology though 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.990
 seems something created by the company itself 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.939
 but with the famous name licensed the 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.380
 gorilla glass 3 freaky close with a 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.380
 extra protection against scratches and scratches 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.390
 as a good intermediary the idou 3-2 in the 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.460
 dragon 410 how to shift factory in your 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.560
 standard version without increasing clock 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.230
 as with the 2015 engine with 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.510
 differential here to bring 1.5 gb of 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.220
 ram memory and this causes the idou 3 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.530
 have the same experience of 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.960
 use of scheme 2 but with the multi task 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.370
 slightly more agile thanks to 512 mb of 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.250
 RAM memory more 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.900
 android lollipop factory 5.0 still 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.770
 without being updated by the 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.960
 cartel 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.910
 there are few interface modifications in it 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.100
 some different animations as well as 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.420
 a package of icons on a 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.220
 custom lock 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.260
 but it retains much of the experience 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.970
 of use of pure android as the drawer of 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.280
 applications and menu organization 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.500
 we received a dual chip model that comes 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.690
 with 16GB of internal memory plus 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.280
 support via micro SD card expansion 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.050
 worth remembering that there is a single version 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.550
 idt chip or three that comes with only 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.550
 8 GB of internal memory 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.280
 the pair of cameras two or three is 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.020
 excellent able to take great photos 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.000
 light conditions 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.010
 but one step is or 2 below the 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.200
 third- generation motogp cameras that 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.600
 brings the same amount of megapixels 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.850
 it supports hdr has one tone flash 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.700
 single and both cameras both the rear 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.200
 front view record videos up to 1080p 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.760
 camera software enables the 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.470
 a limited set of options 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.480
 more sufficient for most of the 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.400
 users who are looking for a smartphone to 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.800
 take high quality photos in most 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.720
 of the light conditions can take the idou 3 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.130
 in consideration but it is worth mentioning that 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.910
 it does not bring the best cost benefit 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.910
 in this matter 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.670
 let's start the idou 3 that we receive is dual 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.579
 with one of the connections enabled by 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.439
 our 4g national lt standard to access 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.930
 the chips there is a single drawer on the side 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:22.670
 which is also where micro sd card 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.069
 installed the biggest selling point 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.780
 two or three is the audio it actually comes 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.640
 with a pair of stereo speakers in the 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.319
 front with quality above the 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.180
 that we expected besides being able to 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.430
 play sound in loud volume the 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.230
 smartphone on the packaging is 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.239
 jbl headset that really 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.920
 still surprises pulling over to the 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.420
 serious than it should as it 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.340
 the headphones of the bits 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.349
 even so it is difficult to find a 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.209
 the competitor or idou 3 in this 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:49.760
 the sound driver of the device that 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.599
 also jbl has a quality well above 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.639
 average 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:55.010
 the fact that he brought a drawer to the 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:57.319
 micro sd card chips already reporting that 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.900
 the non- removable battery is small for 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.370
 the current standards with 2,000 more women 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.230
 manages to survive a day of use 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.329
 moderate without major problems 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.340
 a frustrating point here is that the chipset 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:09.709
 two or three supports the richard of 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.569
 Anything and he's enabled here more 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.579
 alcatel does not offer a charger 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.199
 on the packaging in accordance with 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:17.780
 company was a decision to reduce the 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:19.609
 expected cost of the apparatus but the system 2 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.260
 offers a quixotic charger costing 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.240
 less than half the price 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.220
 the set of connectivity is kind of 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:29.449
 intermediate without big extras of gps 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:33.680
 with the gts without cap under double 4.0 with a 2 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:36.139
 dp nfc fm radio with rds wifi band 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.699
 unique in bg and eni standards with wifi 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.699
 direct router support 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.130
 one deals with an intermediary 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.750
 excellent but the suggested price of 1909 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.520
 make it difficult 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.050
 three have already been recommended since there 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.419
 good amount of appliances on the market 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.759
 which brings much better value for money 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.620
 it comes 5 one of the best qualities of 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:59.449
 audio we saw in smartphone plus 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.130
 be an excellent device in general but 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.840
 will spend so much more for this feature 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.550
 unless you get a good 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.600
 bargain with your carrier it is not 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.280
 an option 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.900
 the intermediate segment is one of the most 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.759
 we understand that companies 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.070
 to offer unique features to 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:14.630
 out but charge much more than the 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.849
 mean here without offering the 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.110
 superior to the competitors seems to us 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:19.820
 Good strategy 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.680
 If you like it, count it down so our 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.280
 youtube channel every day has video 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.280
 new to you
