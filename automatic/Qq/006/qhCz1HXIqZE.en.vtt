00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
the toxic but it's a good thing I didn't

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.720 
the toxic but it's a good thing I didn't
because<00:02:32.350> I<00:02:32.380> was<00:02:32.680> taunted<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.250> toxic<00:02:33.580> would

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
because I was taunted the toxic would

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.180 
because I was taunted the toxic would
have<00:02:33.820> helped<00:02:34.150> but<00:02:34.470> but<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.560> nightshade

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
have helped but but the nightshade

the<00:02:36.310> nightshade<00:02:36.640> was<00:02:36.850> was<00:02:37.060> reasonable<00:02:37.540> it<00:02:37.960> was

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
the nightshade was was reasonable it was

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.200 
the nightshade was was reasonable it was
reasonable<00:02:38.530> so<00:02:38.710> he<00:02:39.250> returns<00:02:39.490> back<00:02:39.730> out<00:02:39.970> goes

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210
