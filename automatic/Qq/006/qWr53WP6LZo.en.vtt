diving plugs and they've really changed

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.240 
diving plugs and they've really changed
the<00:02:02.810> way<00:02:02.930> that<00:02:02.960> we<00:02:03.200> fish<00:02:03.410> crank<00:02:03.680> baits<00:02:03.890> and<00:02:04.100> the

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
the way that we fish crank baits and the

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.740 
the way that we fish crank baits and the
way<00:02:04.340> a<00:02:04.370> lot<00:02:04.610> of<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:04.790> other<00:02:04.910> manufacturers<00:02:05.450> are

way a lot of the other manufacturers are
building<00:02:06.080> their<00:02:06.200> rods<00:02:06.350> it's<00:02:06.619> very<00:02:06.830> light

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
building their rods it's very light

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.980 
building their rods it's very light
weight<00:02:07.100> but<00:02:07.820> with<00:02:07.910> that<00:02:08.030> composite<00:02:08.600> material

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
weight but with that composite material

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.300 
weight but with that composite material
it<00:02:09.080> gives<00:02:09.229> you<00:02:09.350> the<00:02:09.440> best<00:02:09.619> of<00:02:09.770> both<00:02:09.890> worlds<00:02:10.220> you

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
it gives you the best of both worlds you

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.210 
it gives you the best of both worlds you
get<00:02:10.459> the<00:02:10.640> slow<00:02:10.910> action<00:02:11.360> of<00:02:11.780> graphite<00:02:12.290> but<00:02:13.070> you

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
get the slow action of graphite but you

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.790 
get the slow action of graphite but you
get<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.489> sensitivity<00:02:13.790> you<00:02:14.750> know<00:02:15.140> of<00:02:15.290> the

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
get the sensitivity you know of the

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.560 
get the sensitivity you know of the
graphite<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.340> mix<00:02:16.640> of<00:02:16.760> that<00:02:16.850> e-glass<00:02:17.150> so<00:02:17.420> it's

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
graphite a mix of that e-glass so it's

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.180 
graphite a mix of that e-glass so it's
tremendous<00:02:18.050> tremendous<00:02:18.590> rod<00:02:18.770> for<00:02:18.980> crank

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
the spin and outfit I think I get a lot

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.530 
the spin and outfit I think I get a lot
better<00:03:06.739> control<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.489> you<00:03:08.209> know<00:03:08.269> where<00:03:08.420> I<00:03:08.450> grew

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
better control and you know where I grew

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.180 
better control and you know where I grew
up<00:03:08.780> in<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:08.959> Northeast<00:03:09.350> longer<00:03:09.769> rods<00:03:09.950> like

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
up in the Northeast longer rods like

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.620 
up in the Northeast longer rods like
that<00:03:10.340> really<00:03:10.519> give<00:03:10.730> you<00:03:10.820> a<00:03:10.880> lot<00:03:10.940> of<00:03:11.150> distance

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
that really give you a lot of distance

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.060 
that really give you a lot of distance
in<00:03:11.780> your<00:03:11.900> cast<00:03:12.140> and<00:03:12.380> you<00:03:12.470> move<00:03:12.620> a<00:03:12.650> lot<00:03:12.830> of<00:03:12.890> line

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
in your cast and you move a lot of line

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.860 
in your cast and you move a lot of line
on<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.340> hook<00:03:13.489> set<00:03:13.700> so<00:03:13.910> we've<00:03:14.060> got<00:03:14.239> those<00:03:14.450> all

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
on the hook set so we've got those all

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.350 
on the hook set so we've got those all
again<00:03:15.200> high<00:03:15.410> modulus<00:03:15.590> rods<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.700> one<00:03:17.150> thing

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
again high modulus rods the one thing

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.110 
again high modulus rods the one thing
that<00:03:17.510> we<00:03:17.660> did<00:03:17.870> this<00:03:18.769> year<00:03:19.100> to<00:03:19.670> really<00:03:19.850> help

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
that we did this year to really help

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.259 
that we did this year to really help
differentiate<00:03:21.100> the<00:03:22.100> the<00:03:22.580> differences<00:03:23.060> in<00:03:23.180> the

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
differentiate the the differences in the

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.300 
differentiate the the differences in the
rods<00:03:23.450> is<00:03:23.780> because<00:03:24.739> when<00:03:24.890> I've<00:03:25.010> got<00:03:25.160> them<00:03:25.250> all

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
this year though is we came out with a

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.770 
this year though is we came out with a
left-handed<00:04:19.250> version<00:04:19.310> you<00:04:20.180> know<00:04:20.270> I<00:04:20.360> have

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
left-handed version you know I have

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.180 
left-handed version you know I have
always<00:04:20.959> fished<00:04:21.290> the<00:04:21.410> right-handed<00:04:21.830> version

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
always fished the right-handed version

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.620 
always fished the right-handed version
and<00:04:22.430> a<00:04:22.490> lot<00:04:22.640> of<00:04:22.670> people<00:04:22.970> like<00:04:23.120> a<00:04:23.150> left-hand

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
and a lot of people like a left-hand

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.240 
and a lot of people like a left-hand
version<00:04:23.960> this<00:04:24.110> is<00:04:24.170> great<00:04:24.590> for<00:04:24.800> flipping<00:04:25.010> and

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
version this is great for flipping and

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.830 
version this is great for flipping and
pitching<00:04:25.280> if<00:04:25.880> you're<00:04:26.090> right-handed<00:04:26.330> and<00:04:26.690> keep

pitching if you're right-handed and keep
your<00:04:26.990> hand<00:04:27.260> on<00:04:27.410> the<00:04:27.530> rod<00:04:27.710> and<00:04:28.040> you<00:04:28.400> just<00:04:28.550> you

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
your hand on the rod and you just you

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.430 
your hand on the rod and you just you
know<00:04:28.880> can<00:04:29.210> move<00:04:29.360> that<00:04:29.510> line<00:04:29.720> especially<00:04:29.960> that

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
know can move that line especially that

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.980 
know can move that line especially that
7<00:04:30.740> 3<00:04:30.920> 2<00:04:30.950> 1<00:04:31.220> gear<00:04:31.460> ratio<00:04:31.490> man<00:04:32.390> you<00:04:32.570> can<00:04:32.720> just<00:04:32.870> move

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
7 3 2 1 gear ratio man you can just move

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.690 
7 3 2 1 gear ratio man you can just move
a<00:04:33.080> lot<00:04:33.260> of<00:04:33.380> line<00:04:33.560> so<00:04:33.890> now<00:04:34.070> we<00:04:34.130> got<00:04:34.340> it<00:04:34.460> and<00:04:34.550> both

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
a lot of line so now we got it and both

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:35.830 
a lot of line so now we got it and both
right<00:04:34.940> and<00:04:34.970> left-handed

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840
