the cheesecake is made I don't know how
it<00:01:07.680> turned<00:01:07.920> out<00:01:08.100> because<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:09.060> has<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.420> be<00:01:09.570> in

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
it turned out because it has to be in

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.899 
it turned out because it has to be in
the<00:01:09.960> fridge<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.259> a<00:01:10.860> couple<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.250> hours

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
the fridge for a couple of hours

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.539 
the fridge for a couple of hours
they<00:01:12.299> say<00:01:12.540> minimum<00:01:13.289> six<00:01:13.560> hours<00:01:13.979> but<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
they say minimum six hours but the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.330 
they say minimum six hours but the
optimum<00:01:15.289> time<00:01:16.289> would<00:01:16.590> be<00:01:16.740> twelve<00:01:17.100> to

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
optimum time would be twelve to

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.410 
optimum time would be twelve to
twenty-four<00:01:17.640> hours

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
twenty-four hours

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.230 
twenty-four hours
so<00:01:18.929> right<00:01:19.259> now<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:19.950> in<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.219> fridge<00:01:20.579> I<00:01:20.820> don't

so right now it's in the fridge I don't

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.539 
so right now it's in the fridge I don't
know<00:01:21.390> how<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.780> turned<00:01:22.079> out<00:01:22.289> I'll<00:01:23.130> only<00:01:23.399> be

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:35.599 
the inside but I'll just give you some
tips<00:01:32.789> because<00:01:33.149> after<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.770> know<00:01:34.890> making<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.429> I

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609 
tips because after you know making it I

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:37.700 
tips because after you know making it I
was<00:01:35.759> researching<00:01:36.149> so<00:01:36.960> there<00:01:37.200> are<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.439> couple

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
was researching so there are a couple

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.319 
was researching so there are a couple
things<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.280> wished<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.759> would<00:01:39.060> have<00:01:39.090> done

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
things that I wished I would have done

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:39.980 
things that I wished I would have done
differently

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
differently

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.169 
differently
so<00:01:40.950> I'll<00:01:41.039> just<00:01:41.189> share<00:01:41.520> those<00:01:41.729> with<00:01:41.789> you

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
so I'll just share those with you

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:43.879 
so I'll just share those with you
because<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:43.109> way<00:01:43.289> when<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.619> make<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:43.889 
because this way when you make the

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:45.950 
because this way when you make the
recipe<00:01:44.369> you'll<00:01:45.060> just<00:01:45.270> have<00:01:45.420> these<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.749> mind

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
recipe you'll just have these in mind

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.499 
recipe you'll just have these in mind
because<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.560> wish<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.950> had<00:01:47.159> these<00:01:47.939> thoughts<00:01:48.179> in

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
because I wish I had these thoughts in

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.889 
because I wish I had these thoughts in
mind<00:01:48.689> before<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.229> started<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.710> recipe<00:01:50.719> so<00:01:51.719> the

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
mind before I started the recipe so the

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.690 
mind before I started the recipe so the
one<00:01:52.079> thing<00:01:52.289> I<00:01:52.439> would<00:01:52.499> do<00:01:52.740> different<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.369> I

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
one thing I would do different is I

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.510 
one thing I would do different is I
think<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.479> beat<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.679> cheesecake<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.369> the

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
think I beat the cheesecake in the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.779 
think I beat the cheesecake in the
filling<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.209> on<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.409> high<00:01:58.590> speed<00:01:58.649> too<00:01:59.310> high

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
filling to on the high speed too high

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.300 
filling to on the high speed too high
and<00:02:00.179> you<00:02:00.869> really<00:02:01.259> should<00:02:01.560> just<00:02:01.829> keep<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.189> at

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
and you really should just keep it at

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.510 
and you really should just keep it at
medium<00:02:02.639> or<00:02:03.060> low<00:02:03.299> because<00:02:03.929> what<00:02:04.649> happens<00:02:05.069> is<00:02:05.249> it

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
medium or low because what happens is it

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.760 
medium or low because what happens is it
just<00:02:05.670> incorporates<00:02:05.999> too<00:02:06.509> much<00:02:06.689> air<00:02:06.959> and<00:02:07.350> then

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
just incorporates too much air and then

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.910 
just incorporates too much air and then
that<00:02:08.220> just<00:02:08.429> traps<00:02:08.789> water<00:02:09.200> so<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.380> cheesecake

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
that just traps water so the cheesecake

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.540 
that just traps water so the cheesecake
may<00:02:11.160> not<00:02:11.370> come<00:02:11.640> out<00:02:11.910> as<00:02:12.330> dense<00:02:13.340> hopefully<00:02:14.340> I

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
may not come out as dense hopefully I

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.119 
may not come out as dense hopefully I
didn't<00:02:14.940> mess<00:02:15.090> up<00:02:15.300> too<00:02:15.959> much<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:16.680> we'll<00:02:16.980> just

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
didn't mess up too much so we'll just

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.420 
didn't mess up too much so we'll just
see<00:02:17.280> how<00:02:17.489> it<00:02:17.640> comes<00:02:17.790> out<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.930> other

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
see how it comes out the other

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.610 
see how it comes out the other
I<00:02:19.489> shouldn't<00:02:20.420> have<00:02:20.510> done<00:02:20.750> but<00:02:21.170> it<00:02:21.290> wasn't

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
I shouldn't have done but it wasn't

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.520 
I shouldn't have done but it wasn't
specified<00:02:22.159> in<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.489> recipe<00:02:22.689> so<00:02:23.689> only<00:02:24.260> after

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
specified in the recipe so only after

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.349 
specified in the recipe so only after
researching<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.489> seeing<00:02:25.670> other<00:02:25.819> people<00:02:26.209> make

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:26.359 
researching and seeing other people make

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:28.630 
researching and seeing other people make
cheesecakes<00:02:26.810> I<00:02:27.049> like<00:02:27.469> realized<00:02:27.890> you<00:02:28.310> know<00:02:28.430> I

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
cheesecakes I like realized you know I

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.039 
cheesecakes I like realized you know I
should<00:02:29.060> have<00:02:29.090> done<00:02:29.329> differently

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
should have done differently

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.949 
should have done differently
but<00:02:30.739> I<00:02:30.920> pretty<00:02:31.129> much<00:02:31.329> covered<00:02:32.329> the<00:02:32.450> cheesecake

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
but I pretty much covered the cheesecake

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.929 
but I pretty much covered the cheesecake
right<00:02:33.319> after<00:02:33.739> it<00:02:33.829> came<00:02:33.859> out<00:02:34.129> of<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.340> oven<00:02:34.489> and

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:34.939 
right after it came out of the oven and

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.539 
right after it came out of the oven and
I<00:02:35.659> put<00:02:35.900> it<00:02:35.989> in<00:02:36.079> the<00:02:36.139> fridge<00:02:36.349> you<00:02:37.010> shouldn't<00:02:37.430> do

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
I put it in the fridge you shouldn't do

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.520 
I put it in the fridge you shouldn't do
that<00:02:37.790> because<00:02:38.209> it's<00:02:38.420> just<00:02:38.629> gonna<00:02:38.810> you<00:02:39.379> know

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
that because it's just gonna you know

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.500 
that because it's just gonna you know
have<00:02:39.709> all<00:02:39.920> that<00:02:40.099> condensation<00:02:40.969> from<00:02:41.150> like<00:02:41.359> the

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
have all that condensation from like the

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.199 
have all that condensation from like the
temperature<00:02:42.379> difference<00:02:42.769> so<00:02:43.370> just<00:02:43.639> remove<00:02:44.030> it

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
temperature difference so just remove it

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.940 
temperature difference so just remove it
let<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:44.599> sit<00:02:44.810> outside<00:02:44.959> until<00:02:45.500> it<00:02:45.620> cools<00:02:45.859> down

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
let it sit outside until it cools down

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.729 
let it sit outside until it cools down
and<00:02:46.430> then<00:02:46.819> only<00:02:47.120> after<00:02:47.659> that<00:02:47.810> cover<00:02:48.349> it<00:02:48.560> with

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
and then only after that cover it with

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.349 
and then only after that cover it with
aluminum<00:02:49.189> foil<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:49.670> put<00:02:49.849> it<00:02:49.969> in<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:50.150> fridge

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
aluminum foil and put it in the fridge

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.589 
aluminum foil and put it in the fridge
so<00:02:51.010> mine<00:02:52.010> kind<00:02:52.250> of<00:02:52.310> got<00:02:52.489> like<00:02:52.700> that<00:02:52.909> you<00:02:53.480> know

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
so mine kind of got like that you know

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.770 
so mine kind of got like that you know
the<00:02:53.810> condensation<00:02:54.530> even<00:02:54.980> got<00:02:55.269> sticky<00:02:56.269> on<00:02:56.599> the

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
the condensation even got sticky on the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.750 
the condensation even got sticky on the
aluminum<00:02:56.989> foil<00:02:57.439> seemed<00:02:57.739> like<00:02:57.950> it<00:02:58.099> was<00:02:58.220> so<00:02:58.400> soft

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
aluminum foil seemed like it was so soft

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.860 
aluminum foil seemed like it was so soft
and<00:02:59.000> smooth<00:02:59.299> nails

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
and smooth nails

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.379 
and smooth nails
kind<00:03:00.319> of<00:03:00.349> have<00:03:00.500> like<00:03:00.620> bumps<00:03:01.010> because<00:03:01.819> you<00:03:02.269> know

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:02.389

so let's start with the crust you're
going<00:03:27.740> to<00:03:27.830> be<00:03:27.950> grinding<00:03:28.400> up<00:03:28.550> a<00:03:28.700> half<00:03:28.910> a<00:03:28.940> pound

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
going to be grinding up a half a pound

flavor and then 3 tablespoons of melted
butter<00:03:37.150> then<00:03:38.150> you<00:03:38.300> want<00:03:38.480> to<00:03:38.540> mix<00:03:38.690> it<00:03:38.900> with<00:03:38.930> the

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
butter then you want to mix it with the

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.350 
butter then you want to mix it with the
corn<00:03:39.440> or<00:03:39.709> even<00:03:40.069> with<00:03:40.190> your<00:03:40.340> fingers<00:03:40.760> until<00:03:41.000> it

reaches a very moist until complete

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.440 
reaches a very moist until complete
