00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
on an aircraft carrier a feat that's

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.120 
on an aircraft carrier a feat that's
impossible<00:02:16.930> your<00:02:17.930> radar<00:02:18.319> monitor<00:02:18.770> gives<00:02:18.980> you

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
impossible your radar monitor gives you

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.100 
impossible your radar monitor gives you
instructions<00:02:19.490> on<00:02:19.850> how<00:02:19.910> to<00:02:20.120> land<00:02:20.480> but<00:02:20.990> no

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
instructions on how to land but no

know<00:02:25.069> it's<00:02:25.370> like<00:02:25.459> every<00:02:25.790> time<00:02:25.819> I<00:02:26.030> get<00:02:26.300> to<00:02:26.330> this

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
know it's like every time I get to this

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.900 
know it's like every time I get to this
part<00:02:26.870> I<00:02:27.080> think<00:02:27.110> I<00:02:27.620> might<00:02:27.830> have<00:02:27.980> a<00:02:28.010> chance<00:02:28.310> this

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
part I think I might have a chance this

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.390 
part I think I might have a chance this
is<00:02:29.060> going<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.240> be<00:02:29.420> it<00:02:29.950> finally<00:02:30.950> going<00:02:31.130> to<00:02:31.160> land

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
is going to be it finally going to land

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:57.189 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:02.259 

ass<00:02:58.299> fuck<00:02:59.709> it's<00:03:00.709> impossible<00:03:01.459> I<00:03:01.579> mean<00:03:01.849> why<00:03:02.239> is

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
ass fuck it's impossible I mean why is

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.720 
ass fuck it's impossible I mean why is
it<00:03:02.540> so<00:03:02.840> hard<00:03:03.200> I<00:03:03.470> mean<00:03:03.890> I<00:03:04.040> guess<00:03:04.159> because<00:03:04.610> they

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
it so hard I mean I guess because they

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.640 
it so hard I mean I guess because they
were<00:03:04.790> trying<00:03:05.090> to<00:03:05.209> make<00:03:05.360> it<00:03:05.510> realistic<00:03:05.959> like<00:03:06.439> if

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
were trying to make it realistic like if

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.470 
were trying to make it realistic like if
you<00:03:06.829> were<00:03:06.920> actually<00:03:07.519> trying<00:03:07.849> to<00:03:07.970> land<00:03:08.180> on<00:03:08.420> a

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
you were actually trying to land on a

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.380 
you were actually trying to land on a
real<00:03:08.780> aircraft<00:03:09.110> carrier<00:03:09.920> but<00:03:10.489> I<00:03:10.670> highly<00:03:11.030> doubt

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
real aircraft carrier but I highly doubt

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.330 
real aircraft carrier but I highly doubt
that<00:03:11.450> any<00:03:11.930> of<00:03:12.019> this<00:03:12.140> game<00:03:12.409> is<00:03:12.650> like<00:03:12.829> really

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
that any of this game is like really

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.240 
that any of this game is like really
flying<00:03:13.730> a<00:03:13.909> plane<00:03:14.409> so<00:03:15.409> even<00:03:15.650> though<00:03:15.680> I<00:03:15.769> crashed

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
flying a plane so even though I crashed

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.069 
flying a plane so even though I crashed
it<00:03:16.519> only<00:03:16.670> takes<00:03:16.939> a<00:03:17.060> life<00:03:17.269> away<00:03:17.599> and<00:03:17.780> it<00:03:17.840> still

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
it only takes a life away and it still

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.720 
it only takes a life away and it still
lets<00:03:18.260> me<00:03:18.439> continue<00:03:18.920> to<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.129> next<00:03:19.159> level

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
lets me continue to the next level

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.690 
lets me continue to the next level
mission<00:03:20.689> to<00:03:20.930> destroy<00:03:21.319> an<00:03:21.829> enemy<00:03:21.920> aircraft

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700

carrier<00:03:23.150> all<00:03:23.870> right<00:03:24.170> fine<00:03:24.680> as<00:03:24.980> long<00:03:25.040> as<00:03:25.549> I

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
carrier all right fine as long as I

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.569 
carrier all right fine as long as I
don't<00:03:25.700> have<00:03:25.849> to<00:03:25.970> fucking<00:03:26.450> land<00:03:26.720> on<00:03:26.959> it<00:03:27.519> now<00:03:28.519> the

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
don't have to fucking land on it now the

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.250 
don't have to fucking land on it now the
only<00:03:28.819> difference<00:03:29.239> with<00:03:29.389> the<00:03:29.480> second<00:03:29.900> level<00:03:30.049> is

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
only difference with the second level is

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.899 
only difference with the second level is
that<00:03:30.440> you're<00:03:30.560> below<00:03:30.889> the<00:03:31.069> clouds<00:03:31.400> and<00:03:31.700> you<00:03:31.760> can

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:31.909 
that you're below the clouds and you can

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:33.910 
that you're below the clouds and you can
now<00:03:32.060> see<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.450> water<00:03:32.750> basically<00:03:33.590> it's<00:03:33.709> just<00:03:33.739> a

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
now see the water basically it's just a

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.180 
now see the water basically it's just a
darker<00:03:34.370> color<00:03:34.639> blue<00:03:34.940> in<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.239> sky<00:03:35.889> stay<00:03:36.889> the

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
darker color blue in the sky stay the

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.309 
darker color blue in the sky stay the
fuck<00:03:37.549> away<00:03:37.609> there's<00:03:38.120> battleships<00:03:38.780> that<00:03:39.019> shoot

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
fuck away there's battleships that shoot

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.440 
fuck away there's battleships that shoot
the<00:03:39.500> shit<00:03:39.799> out<00:03:39.980> of<00:03:40.010> you<00:03:40.159> you're<00:03:40.730> best<00:03:40.970> off<00:03:41.150> just

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
the shit out of you you're best off just

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.830 
the shit out of you you're best off just
flying<00:03:41.750> into<00:03:42.019> the<00:03:42.139> sky<00:03:42.409> the<00:03:42.470> whole<00:03:42.799> time<00:03:43.840> now

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
flying into the sky the whole time now

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.569 
flying into the sky the whole time now
halfway<00:03:45.109> through<00:03:45.530> this<00:03:45.620> level<00:03:46.069> your<00:03:46.250> fuel

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
halfway through this level your fuel

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.030 
halfway through this level your fuel
starts<00:03:46.939> to<00:03:47.120> run<00:03:47.299> out<00:03:47.450> so<00:03:47.840> this<00:03:48.349> refueling

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
starts to run out so this refueling

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.009 
starts to run out so this refueling
plane<00:03:49.310> comes<00:03:49.670> and<00:03:50.000> you<00:03:50.120> have<00:03:50.269> to<00:03:50.420> control<00:03:50.750> its

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
plane comes and you have to control its

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.229 
plane comes and you have to control its
nozzle<00:03:51.530> so<00:03:52.189> just<00:03:52.430> like<00:03:52.579> landing<00:03:53.000> the<00:03:53.090> plane

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
nozzle so just like landing the plane

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.629 
nozzle so just like landing the plane
this<00:03:53.870> is<00:03:54.049> impossible<00:03:54.739> and<00:03:54.769> I've<00:03:55.010> never<00:03:55.280> once

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
this is impossible and I've never once

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:58.479 
this is impossible and I've never once
done<00:03:55.939> it<00:03:56.090> you<00:03:56.659> just<00:03:56.870> have<00:03:57.019> to<00:03:57.049> be<00:03:57.260> lucky<00:03:57.500> I<00:03:57.950> mean

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
done it you just have to be lucky I mean

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.280 
done it you just have to be lucky I mean
your<00:03:58.639> accuracy<00:03:59.150> has<00:03:59.510> to<00:03:59.660> be<00:03:59.810> one<00:04:00.079> hundred

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
your accuracy has to be one hundred

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.339 
your accuracy has to be one hundred
percent<00:04:00.519> perfect<00:04:01.519> and<00:04:01.699> really<00:04:02.419> I<00:04:02.599> don't<00:04:03.169> have

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
percent perfect and really I don't have

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.550 
percent perfect and really I don't have
a<00:04:03.379> fucking<00:04:03.919> clue<00:04:03.949> how<00:04:04.340> it<00:04:04.489> works<00:04:05.049> down<00:04:06.049> down

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
levels in the game so it's kind of the

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
shit now because I've never passed that

refueling<00:04:58.789> plane<00:04:59.060> I've<00:04:59.270> never<00:04:59.479> seen<00:04:59.810> the<00:04:59.960> last

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
refueling plane I've never seen the last

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.469 
refueling plane I've never seen the last
two<00:05:00.320> levels<00:05:00.830> so<00:05:01.280> what<00:05:01.610> I've<00:05:01.699> decided<00:05:02.000> to<00:05:02.240> do

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 
two levels so what I've decided to do

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.580 
two levels so what I've decided to do
here<00:05:02.810> is<00:05:02.930> to<00:05:03.590> create<00:05:03.979> my<00:05:04.190> own<00:05:04.219> version<00:05:04.639> of

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
here is to create my own version of

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.870 
here is to create my own version of
I think<00:05:06.040> the<00:05:06.490> last<00:05:06.670> two<00:05:06.970> levels<00:05:07.300> may<00:05:07.480> be<00:05:07.690> like

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
I think the last two levels may be like

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:17.380 
I think the last two levels may be like
mission<00:05:09.880> three<00:05:10.270> blow<00:05:10.840> shit<00:05:10.900> up

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
Gun the second mission which doesn't

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.570 
Gun the second mission which doesn't
really<00:05:41.420> make<00:05:41.660> much<00:05:41.720> sense<00:05:41.930> because<00:05:42.470> it<00:05:43.160> sounds

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
really make much sense because it sounds

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:44.980 
really make much sense because it sounds
like<00:05:43.670> you're<00:05:43.820> talking<00:05:44.180> about<00:05:44.360> the<00:05:44.570> second

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
like you're talking about the second

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.380 
like you're talking about the second
mission<00:05:45.170> in<00:05:45.410> the<00:05:45.500> first<00:05:45.770> Top<00:05:46.070> Gun<00:05:46.370> so<00:05:46.910> whatever

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:47.390 
mission in the first Top Gun so whatever

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
will mean windows be mission 5 and up

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.540 
will mean windows be mission 5 and up
even<00:05:50.930> the<00:05:51.170> tops<00:05:51.440> of<00:05:51.620> the<00:05:51.740> game<00:05:51.950> cartridges

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
the second top gun isn't as bad as the

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.760 
the second top gun isn't as bad as the
original<00:06:04.700> but<00:06:05.300> it<00:06:05.480> sure<00:06:05.720> is<00:06:05.960> a<00:06:05.990> hell<00:06:06.440> of<00:06:06.470> a<00:06:06.620> lot

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.320 
original but it sure is a hell of a lot
fucking<00:06:07.130> harder<00:06:07.310> if<00:06:07.790> you<00:06:07.910> could<00:06:08.090> actually

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
fucking harder if you could actually

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.900 
fucking harder if you could actually
believe<00:06:08.900> that<00:06:09.140> the<00:06:09.800> game<00:06:10.010> plays<00:06:10.280> a<00:06:10.310> lot<00:06:10.580> faster

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:10.910 
believe that the game plays a lot faster

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.570

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.380 
although I don't really know what the
point<00:06:15.200> of<00:06:15.380> that<00:06:15.440> is<00:06:15.710> and<00:06:16.520> there's<00:06:16.760> also<00:06:16.970> not<00:06:17.240> as

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
point of that is and there's also not as

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:18.730 
point of that is and there's also not as
many<00:06:17.540> dead<00:06:17.900> spots<00:06:18.110> where<00:06:18.560> you're<00:06:18.710> just

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
many dead spots where you're just

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.350 
many dead spots where you're just
waiting<00:06:19.130> for<00:06:19.400> something<00:06:19.610> to<00:06:19.790> happen<00:06:19.850> and

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
waiting for something to happen and

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.660 
waiting for something to happen and
looking<00:06:20.930> for<00:06:21.110> enemies<00:06:21.440> here<00:06:22.100> your<00:06:22.340> enemies

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:22.670 
looking for enemies here your enemies

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.580 
looking for enemies here your enemies
come<00:06:22.970> after<00:06:23.300> you<00:06:23.420> right<00:06:23.720> away<00:06:23.840> and<00:06:24.290> they<00:06:24.380> just

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
come after you right away and they just

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.260 
come after you right away and they just
blow<00:06:24.830> you<00:06:24.890> out<00:06:25.040> of<00:06:25.190> the<00:06:25.310> sky<00:06:25.610> so<00:06:25.910> you<00:06:26.000> have<00:06:26.120> to

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
blow you out of the sky so you have to

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.270 
blow you out of the sky so you have to
really<00:06:26.480> think<00:06:26.630> fast<00:06:27.170> the<00:06:27.770> missiles<00:06:28.160> are

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 
really think fast the missiles are

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.160 
really think fast the missiles are
really<00:06:28.640> hard<00:06:28.820> to<00:06:28.940> dodge<00:06:29.210> and<00:06:29.630> just<00:06:29.840> like<00:06:30.020> the

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:30.170 
really hard to dodge and just like the

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.560 
really hard to dodge and just like the
first<00:06:30.200> time<00:06:30.740> one<00:06:31.340> missile<00:06:31.760> is<00:06:31.910> enough<00:06:32.180> to<00:06:32.360> kill

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:32.570 
first time one missile is enough to kill

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.420 
first time one missile is enough to kill
you<00:06:32.750> but<00:06:33.290> this<00:06:33.470> time<00:06:33.710> they're<00:06:33.980> even<00:06:34.220> worse

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
you but this time they're even worse

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.730 
you but this time they're even worse
because<00:06:34.790> they're<00:06:35.150> faster<00:06:35.780> and<00:06:36.020> they<00:06:36.530> don't

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:36.740 
because they're faster and they don't

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.830 
because they're faster and they don't
seem<00:06:37.040> to<00:06:37.070> come<00:06:37.370> anywhere<00:06:37.880> near<00:06:37.940> as<00:06:38.240> close<00:06:38.630> as

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 
seem to come anywhere near as close as

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.560 
seem to come anywhere near as close as
they<00:06:38.990> did<00:06:39.230> before<00:06:39.410> in<00:06:39.890> the<00:06:40.670> original<00:06:40.880> Top<00:06:41.300> Gun

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:41.570 
they did before in the original Top Gun

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.150 
they did before in the original Top Gun
when<00:06:41.780> a<00:06:41.810> missile<00:06:42.200> hits<00:06:42.410> you<00:06:42.590> it<00:06:42.770> looks<00:06:42.950> like

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 
when a missile hits you it looks like

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.580 
when a missile hits you it looks like
this<00:06:43.400> and<00:06:43.730> in<00:06:44.360> the<00:06:44.450> sequel<00:06:44.900> it<00:06:45.350> looks<00:06:45.530> like

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:45.590 
this and in the sequel it looks like

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.030 
this and in the sequel it looks like
this<00:06:45.970> much<00:06:46.970> farther<00:06:47.390> away<00:06:47.630> so<00:06:48.500> if<00:06:48.710> you<00:06:48.800> played

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:49.040 
this much farther away so if you played

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.980 
this much farther away so if you played
the<00:06:49.220> original<00:06:49.310> first<00:06:49.970> you're<00:06:50.720> going<00:06:50.810> to<00:06:50.900> be

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:50.990 
the original first you're going to be

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.020 
the original first you're going to be
really<00:06:51.260> disoriented<00:06:51.860> that<00:06:52.280> you<00:06:52.400> have<00:06:52.550> so<00:06:52.880> much

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.030 
really disoriented that you have so much

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.600 
really disoriented that you have so much
less<00:06:53.390> time<00:06:53.720> to<00:06:53.900> get<00:06:54.080> out<00:06:54.170> of<00:06:54.290> the<00:06:54.350> way<00:06:54.610> besides

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:55.610 
less time to get out of the way besides

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.430 
less time to get out of the way besides
they<00:06:55.850> still<00:06:56.150> look<00:06:56.360> like<00:06:56.390> bowling<00:06:56.990> balls<00:06:57.020> on

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:57.440 
they still look like bowling balls on

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.640 
they still look like bowling balls on
fire<00:06:57.800> I<00:06:58.660> never<00:06:59.660> made<00:06:59.870> it<00:07:00.020> past<00:07:00.050> the<00:07:00.380> first

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:00.650 
fire I never made it past the first

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.530 
fire I never made it past the first
stage<00:07:01.040> but<00:07:01.370> that's<00:07:01.550> also<00:07:01.790> because<00:07:02.030> I<00:07:02.270> don't

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:02.540 
stage but that's also because I don't

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.420 
stage but that's also because I don't
have<00:07:02.690> the<00:07:02.810> patience<00:07:03.230> for<00:07:03.320> this<00:07:03.470> crap<00:07:03.890> now

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:04.430
