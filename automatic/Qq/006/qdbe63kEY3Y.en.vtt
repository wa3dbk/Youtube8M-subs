00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
it would be like a one-hit kills go okay

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.710

going to die great 12 and three awesome
I<00:01:43.020> think<00:01:43.409> we<00:01:43.500> saw<00:01:43.680> this<00:01:43.829> one<00:01:44.040> coming<00:01:44.070> actually

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
I think we saw this one coming actually

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.490 
I think we saw this one coming actually
I<00:01:44.820> didn't<00:01:45.180> because<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.600> probably<00:01:46.049> thought<00:01:46.290> I

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
I didn't because I probably thought I

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.260 
I didn't because I probably thought I
was<00:01:46.619> gonna<00:01:46.799> go<00:01:46.979> negative<00:01:47.250> probably<00:01:47.970> should<00:01:48.149> be

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
was gonna go negative probably should be

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.749 
was gonna go negative probably should be
going<00:01:48.450> negative<00:01:48.689> but<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.560> mean<00:01:49.950> there<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.520> some

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
going negative but I mean there is some

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.690 
going negative but I mean there is some
sort<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.119> bias<00:01:51.390> because<00:01:51.890> as<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:53.250> said<00:01:53.310> I've

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
sort of bias because as I said I've

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.490 
sort of bias because as I said I've
literally<00:01:54.270> played<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:54.720> game<00:01:54.960> all<00:01:55.140> my<00:01:55.290> life

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
literally played this game all my life

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.639 
literally played this game all my life
so<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.100> be<00:01:56.640> like<00:01:56.899> right<00:01:57.899> now<00:01:58.079> it's<00:01:58.290> kind<00:01:58.350> of

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
so and be like right now it's kind of

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.560 
so and be like right now it's kind of
it's<00:01:58.890> kind<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.189> easy<00:01:59.399> it's<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.030> little<00:02:00.299> bit<00:02:00.420> easy

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
it's kind of easy it's a little bit easy

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.649 
it's kind of easy it's a little bit easy
the<00:02:01.290> m16<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:01.950> an<00:02:02.040> easy<00:02:02.189> weapon<00:02:02.610> but

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
the m16 is an easy weapon but

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.440 
the m16 is an easy weapon but
I<00:02:03.749> mean<00:02:04.499> I<00:02:04.770> could<00:02:05.640> probably<00:02:05.850> do<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.210> with<00:02:06.329> the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
I mean I could probably do this with the
