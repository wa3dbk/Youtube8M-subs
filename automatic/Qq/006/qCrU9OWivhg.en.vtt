time-tested winners I have more and more
female<00:00:29.070> patients<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:29.849> my<00:00:30.029> practice<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:31.099> let's

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
female patients in my practice and let's

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.080 
female patients in my practice and let's
say<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.700> our<00:00:33.090> modern<00:00:33.810> life<00:00:34.080> places<00:00:35.010> too<00:00:35.730> many

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
say that our modern life places too many

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.170 
say that our modern life places too many
demands<00:00:36.600> on<00:00:36.809> our<00:00:37.670> women<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:39.600> know<00:00:39.780> that

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
demands on our women we know that

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.619 
demands on our women we know that
estrogen<00:00:42.180> metabolism<00:00:43.190> takes<00:00:44.190> also<00:00:44.550> place<00:00:45.180> and

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
estrogen metabolism takes also place and

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.700 
estrogen metabolism takes also place and
liver<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.170> liver<00:00:46.770> produces<00:00:47.840> healthy<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.140> if

liver is toxic unhealthy subclasses of
estrogens<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.850> goal<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.960> make<00:00:58.649> liver

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
estrogens so the goal is to make liver

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.540 
estrogens so the goal is to make liver
be<00:00:59.670> healthy<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.859> healthy<00:01:01.859> liver<00:01:02.280> produces

provide the more oxygen more blood
supply<00:01:40.380> more<00:01:41.009> nutrients<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:41.880> basically

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
supply more nutrients and basically

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.609 
supply more nutrients and basically
regulates<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.649> healthy<00:01:44.220> function<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:45.299> also

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
regulates the healthy function it also

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.600 
regulates the healthy function it also
increases<00:01:46.619> their<00:01:47.100> clearance<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.240> lymph<00:01:48.659> and

increases their clearance of lymph and

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.179 
increases their clearance of lymph and

increases their elimination of wastes of

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.569 
increases their elimination of wastes of

the cellular byproducts that may be
toxic<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.740> others<00:01:58.740> increases<00:01:59.520> the

toxic and others increases the

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.819 
toxic and others increases the

I<00:02:03.020> really<00:02:04.020> recommend<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:05.189> incorporate<00:02:05.939> as<00:02:06.149> I

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
I really recommend to incorporate as I

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.510 
I really recommend to incorporate as I
consider<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:07.049> this<00:02:07.259> is<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.500> most<00:02:07.890> important

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
consider that this is the most important

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.420 
consider that this is the most important
part<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:09.119> every<00:02:09.750> detoxification<00:02:10.440> protocol

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
part of every detoxification protocol

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.090 
part of every detoxification protocol

and for every female protocol since the

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
and for every female protocol since the
liver<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.520> so<00:02:14.730> important<00:02:15.270> for<00:02:15.330> female<00:02:15.810> health
