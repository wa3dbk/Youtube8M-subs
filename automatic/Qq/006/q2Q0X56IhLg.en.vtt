00:00:09.393 --> 00:00:10.969
The butterfly is one of the first tricks

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:12.925
we learn in contact juggling

00:00:12.925 --> 00:00:15.200
because it's the basis for many other things

00:00:19.721 --> 00:00:20.534
The first step

00:00:20.534 --> 00:00:22.718
is learning to hold the ball in the back of the hand,

00:00:23.012 --> 00:00:24.682
this position is called Cradle.

00:00:25.432 --> 00:00:26.622
To do this you can:

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:28.301
lower the middle finger,

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.845
separate the forefinger and the middle finger

00:00:33.404 --> 00:00:35.400
or the middle and the ring finger

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:37.632
I prefer the first option,

00:00:37.632 --> 00:00:38.834
lower the middle finger

00:00:39.193 --> 00:00:41.626
because it leaves you with 3 points of contact with the ball

00:00:41.626 --> 00:00:42.578
instead of two.

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:44.951
first,

00:00:44.951 --> 00:00:46.381
just try to move your hand through space

00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:47.679
with the ball on the cradle position.

00:00:48.243 --> 00:00:49.806
Practice movements on the horizontal

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:51.502
on the vertical,

00:00:52.264 --> 00:00:53.324
and mixing both

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.471
When you are comfortable with that

00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:03.017
make a short throw

00:01:04.135 --> 00:01:05.695
increase the height of this throw little by little

00:01:05.695 --> 00:01:07.569
to improve your cradle 'stall'.

00:01:10.825 --> 00:01:11.343
Now,

00:01:11.343 --> 00:01:12.681
using your elbow as an axis,

00:01:12.917 --> 00:01:15.369
throw the ball from the palm to the back of your hand.

00:01:16.355 --> 00:01:18.346
Then do the opposite movement,

00:01:18.643 --> 00:01:20.299
from the back, to the palm.

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.474
Gradually reduce the height of the throw 

00:01:28.474 --> 00:01:30.343
until the ball is not going to be thrown

00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:32.297
it will just roll over your fingers.

00:01:40.085 --> 00:01:42.056
with some practice you'll be able to do it without stopping.

00:01:42.363 --> 00:01:44.405
It is very important to learn the butterfly

00:01:44.405 --> 00:01:45.626
both sides.

00:01:45.626 --> 00:01:47.136
Remember to use your elbow as axis.

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:52.711
Also practice a little variation

00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:55.373
the cradle to palm transfer.

00:02:07.838 --> 00:02:08.979
