the<00:01:00.510> game<00:01:00.690> does<00:01:01.140> tend<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.559> go<00:01:01.680> leggy<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.219> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
the game does tend to go leggy and the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.070 
the game does tend to go leggy and the
targeting<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.850> kind<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.180> off<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.870> doesn't

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
targeting is kind of off and it doesn't

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.050 
targeting is kind of off and it doesn't
really<00:01:04.170> have<00:01:04.290> an<00:01:04.470> animation<00:01:04.830> because<00:01:05.309> out<00:01:05.909> of

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
really have an animation because out of

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.450 
really have an animation because out of
an<00:01:06.150> air<00:01:06.330> pet<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:07.170> kind<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.439> also<00:01:07.590> pops<00:01:08.010> out<00:01:08.250> so

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
an air pet it kind of also pops out so

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.679 
an air pet it kind of also pops out so
it<00:01:08.520> doesn't<00:01:08.729> really<00:01:08.820> have<00:01:09.030> an<00:01:09.119> animation<00:01:09.390> it

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
it doesn't really have an animation it

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.510 
it doesn't really have an animation it
comes<00:01:09.869> out<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.229> base<00:01:10.380> but<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.070> works<00:01:11.280> you

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
comes out of the base but it works you

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.609 
comes out of the base but it works you
can<00:01:11.640> target<00:01:11.820> units<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.229> can<00:01:13.350> actually

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
can target units and you can actually

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.859 
can target units and you can actually
mess<00:01:13.770> them<00:01:13.920> up<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.310> let's<00:01:14.670> against<00:01:15.540> that's

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869

mess them up so let's against that's
it's<00:01:16.110> got<00:01:16.290> some<00:01:16.439> more<00:01:16.530> benches<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:16.950> there<00:01:17.100> but

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
it's got some more benches in there but

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.609 
it's got some more benches in there but
the<00:01:17.460> game<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.420> game<00:01:18.570> was<00:01:18.780> really<00:01:19.080> laggy<00:01:19.290> so

I'm<00:01:20.159> gonna<00:01:20.310> have<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.549> skip<00:01:20.729> forth<00:01:21.000> sometimes

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
I'm gonna have to skip forth sometimes

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
to just you know fly around see how they

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.289 
to just you know fly around see how they
do<00:01:33.900> as<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.920> can<00:01:35.040> see<00:01:35.159> some<00:01:35.460> people<00:01:35.610> lagged<00:01:36.090> out

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
do as you can see some people lagged out

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.899 
do as you can see some people lagged out
I<00:01:36.659> think<00:01:37.170> said<00:01:37.619> stone<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.130> big<00:01:38.280> hook<00:01:38.460> monster

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
I think said stone and big hook monster

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.710 
I think said stone and big hook monster
they<00:01:39.060> were<00:01:39.180> spectating<00:01:39.840> on<00:01:40.020> my<00:01:40.259> team<00:01:41.420> but<00:01:42.420> I

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
they were spectating on my team but I

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.679 
they were spectating on my team but I
don't<00:01:43.470> know<00:01:43.670> they<00:01:44.670> liked<00:01:44.909> out<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.270> connection

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
don't know they liked out the connection

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.480 
don't know they liked out the connection
was<00:01:45.840> pretty<00:01:46.079> bad<00:01:46.380> overall<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.100> collection

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
was pretty bad overall the collection

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.510 
was pretty bad overall the collection
was<00:01:47.610> bad<00:01:47.820> through<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.240> entire<00:01:48.600> game<00:01:49.280> as<00:01:50.280> soon

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
was bad through the entire game as soon

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.219 
was bad through the entire game as soon
as<00:01:50.670> as<00:01:50.880> soon<00:01:50.909> as<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.240> got<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.540> ban<00:01:51.750> shield<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:52.200> I

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
as as soon as I got that ban shield so I

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.200 
as as soon as I got that ban shield so I
don't<00:01:52.979> know<00:01:53.070> if<00:01:53.159> there's<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.399> way<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.579> fix<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.119> I

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
don't know if there's a way to fix it I

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.639 
don't know if there's a way to fix it I
don't<00:01:54.240> know<00:01:54.479> if<00:01:54.780> it's<00:01:55.049> just<00:01:55.259> coincidence

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
don't know if it's just coincidence

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.740 
don't know if it's just coincidence
might<00:01:56.310> as<00:01:56.430> well<00:01:56.520> be<00:01:56.700> coincidence<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.420> mean<00:01:57.479> I

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
might as well be coincidence I mean I

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.859 
might as well be coincidence I mean I
haven't<00:01:58.200> really<00:01:58.320> tested<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.920> anything<00:01:59.219> but

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
haven't really tested it anything but

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.109 
haven't really tested it anything but
this<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.049> much<00:02:01.259> makeable<00:02:01.950> this<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.369> doable<00:02:02.790> in

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
this is much makeable this is doable in

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.139 
this is much makeable this is doable in
matchmaking<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:04.340> it's<00:02:05.340> it's<00:02:05.700> kind<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:05.909> weird

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
matchmaking I it's it's kind of weird

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.609 
matchmaking I it's it's kind of weird
though<00:02:06.240> because<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.869> Banshees<00:02:07.229> when<00:02:07.500> they

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
though because the Banshees when they

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.800 
though because the Banshees when they
come<00:02:07.799> out<00:02:07.829> at<00:02:08.190> first<00:02:08.459> like<00:02:09.420> if<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.720> have

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
come out at first like if you have

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.600 
come out at first like if you have
flat-out<00:02:10.110> Hornets<00:02:10.709> they<00:02:10.860> are<00:02:11.009> repeating

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
flat-out Hornets they are repeating

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.160 
flat-out Hornets they are repeating
cannon<00:02:11.910> banshees<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:12.540> then<00:02:13.020> we

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
cannon banshees and then we

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.260 
cannon banshees and then we
you<00:02:13.230> upgrade<00:02:13.530> wingman<00:02:14.220> they<00:02:14.849> are<00:02:14.910> still

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
you upgrade wingman they are still

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.449 
you upgrade wingman they are still
repeating<00:02:15.660> cannon<00:02:16.080> banshees<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.709> then<00:02:17.280> when

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
repeating cannon banshees and then when

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.110 
repeating cannon banshees and then when
you<00:02:17.550> upgrade<00:02:18.230> gaffe<00:02:19.230> pot<00:02:19.470> they<00:02:20.220> tend<00:02:20.520> to<00:02:20.640> still

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
you upgrade gaffe pot they tend to still

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.940 
you upgrade gaffe pot they tend to still
be<00:02:21.420> repeating<00:02:21.989> Kenan<00:02:22.290> Bey<00:02:22.319> she's<00:02:22.650> although

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
be repeating Kenan Bey she's although

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.150 
be repeating Kenan Bey she's although
this<00:02:23.190> time<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.580> got<00:02:23.790> sacrifice<00:02:24.420> but<00:02:25.230> most<00:02:25.890> like

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
this time I got sacrifice but most like

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.830 
this time I got sacrifice but most like
nine<00:02:26.370> out<00:02:26.550> of<00:02:26.640> ten<00:02:26.849> times<00:02:26.880> I<00:02:27.360> think<00:02:27.599> they<00:02:27.720> are

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
nine out of ten times I think they are

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.360 
nine out of ten times I think they are
like<00:02:28.080> they<00:02:28.349> they're<00:02:28.560> repeating<00:02:29.069> Kenan

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
like they they're repeating Kenan

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.160 
like they they're repeating Kenan
banshees<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:29.970> have<00:02:30.120> this<00:02:30.510> actually<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.959> first

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
banshees I have this actually the first

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.050 
banshees I have this actually the first
time<00:02:31.380> I<00:02:31.440> managed<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:31.830> get<00:02:32.010> sacrificed<00:02:32.310> somehow

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
time I managed to get sacrificed somehow

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.270 
time I managed to get sacrificed somehow
I<00:02:33.300> think<00:02:33.930> I<00:02:33.989> did<00:02:34.140> something<00:02:34.380> right<00:02:34.709> there<00:02:34.980> but

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
I think I did something right there but

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.190 
I think I did something right there but
I<00:02:35.580> can<00:02:35.790> also<00:02:35.910> do<00:02:36.090> this<00:02:36.150> with<00:02:36.239> other<00:02:36.510> units<00:02:36.959> so

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
I can also do this with other units so

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.740 
I can also do this with other units so
let's<00:02:37.590> head<00:02:37.980> over<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:39.180> most<00:02:39.390> obvious

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
let's head over to the most obvious

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.680 
let's head over to the most obvious
other<00:02:39.900> one<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.890> government<00:02:41.640> rates<00:02:42.090> the

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
other one the government rates the

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.809 
other one the government rates the
government<00:02:43.140> rate<00:02:43.349> here<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.680> is<00:02:43.800> it's<00:02:44.099> replaced

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
government rate here it is it's replaced

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.790 
government rate here it is it's replaced
for<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.120> tank<00:02:45.450> it's<00:02:45.750> pretty<00:02:46.110> pointless<00:02:46.500> in

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
for the tank it's pretty pointless in

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.830 
for the tank it's pretty pointless in
scorpion<00:02:47.340> stings<00:02:47.580> scorpion<00:02:48.239> tanks<00:02:48.750> are

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
scorpion stings scorpion tanks are

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.729 
scorpion stings scorpion tanks are
better<00:02:49.050> in<00:02:49.260> every<00:02:49.500> way

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
better in every way

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.710 
better in every way
they<00:02:49.980> are<00:02:50.100> obviously<00:02:50.640> just<00:02:50.940> just<00:02:51.360> way<00:02:51.540> better

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
they are obviously just just way better

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.030 
they are obviously just just way better
than<00:02:51.900> everything<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:52.350> can<00:02:52.500> tell<00:02:52.620> if<00:02:52.799> the<00:02:52.890> game

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
than everything you can tell if the game

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.590 
than everything you can tell if the game
is<00:02:53.160> really<00:02:53.310> key<00:02:53.489> but<00:02:53.730> let's<00:02:53.910> forget<00:02:54.209> about<00:02:54.269> the

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
is really key but let's forget about the

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.870 
is really key but let's forget about the
leg<00:02:54.780> I<00:02:55.049> didn't<00:02:55.739> want<00:02:55.890> to<00:02:55.980> cut<00:02:56.160> everything<00:02:56.580> out

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
leg I didn't want to cut everything out

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.910 
leg I didn't want to cut everything out
that<00:02:56.910> would<00:02:57.180> have<00:02:57.330> been<00:02:57.540> taking<00:02:57.870> me<00:02:57.989> so<00:02:58.350> damn

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
that would have been taking me so damn

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.220 
that would have been taking me so damn
long<00:02:59.160> and<00:02:59.940> now<00:03:00.209> we're<00:03:00.360> gonna<00:03:00.450> do<00:03:00.690> some<00:03:00.870> awesome

escapes and a mech less I'm kind of

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.729 
escapes and a mech less I'm kind of
afraid<00:03:13.709> of<00:03:13.799> my<00:03:14.040> rate<00:03:14.250> might<00:03:14.459> die<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:15.739> we'll

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
afraid of my rate might die and we'll

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.360 
head over to the next unit we have and
that<00:03:18.540> is<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.989> locus<00:03:19.530> so<00:03:19.769> I'm<00:03:19.890> killing<00:03:20.190> up<00:03:20.280> a

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
that is the locus so I'm killing up a

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.039 
that is the locus so I'm killing up a
locus<00:03:20.730> right<00:03:20.910> now<00:03:21.030> it's<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.299> Cobra<00:03:21.690> as<00:03:21.750> you<00:03:21.930> can

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
locus right now it's a Cobra as you can

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.280 
locus right now it's a Cobra as you can
see<00:03:22.609> but<00:03:23.609> it's<00:03:23.910> it's<00:03:24.299> actually<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.660> locust<00:03:25.079> and

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
see but it's it's actually a locust and

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.330 
see but it's it's actually a locust and
I<00:03:25.829> know<00:03:26.220> locust<00:03:27.209> our<00:03:27.390> tree<00:03:27.600> population<00:03:28.340> Cobras

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
I know locust our tree population Cobras

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.390 
I know locust our tree population Cobras
are<00:03:29.519> too<00:03:29.840> but<00:03:30.840> it<00:03:30.959> works<00:03:31.170> it's<00:03:31.890> a<00:03:31.980> cone<00:03:32.190> rod

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
are too but it works it's a cone rod

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.670 
are too but it works it's a cone rod
that<00:03:32.609> gives<00:03:33.329> you<00:03:33.510> three<00:03:33.780> population<00:03:34.560> that's

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
that gives you three population that's

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.880 
that gives you three population that's
the<00:03:34.829> weird<00:03:35.040> part<00:03:35.100> about<00:03:35.340> it<00:03:36.170> so<00:03:37.170> it's<00:03:37.650> not<00:03:37.829> like

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
the weird part about it so it's not like

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.039 
the weird part about it so it's not like
you<00:03:38.250> get<00:03:38.400> stuff<00:03:38.760> for<00:03:39.000> free<00:03:39.209> or<00:03:39.480> something<00:03:39.510> it's

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
you get stuff for free or something it's

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.539 
you get stuff for free or something it's
still<00:03:40.170> it's<00:03:40.769> still<00:03:40.980> weird

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
still it's still weird

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.330 
still it's still weird
and<00:03:42.030> I<00:03:42.180> think<00:03:42.239> actually<00:03:42.570> the<00:03:43.019> rate<00:03:43.350> you<00:03:44.130> paid

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
and I think actually the rate you paid

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.310 
and I think actually the rate you paid
350<00:03:44.700> for<00:03:45.120> it<00:03:45.239> anyway<00:03:45.540> and<00:03:45.690> for<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:45.930> banshee

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
350 for it anyway and for the banshee

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.430 
350 for it anyway and for the banshee
you<00:03:47.310> actually<00:03:47.640> pay<00:03:47.880> it<00:03:48.150> says<00:03:48.450> 250<00:03:48.900> but<00:03:49.350> you

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
you actually pay it says 250 but you

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.170 
you actually pay it says 250 but you
actually<00:03:49.560> pay<00:03:49.829> 200<00:03:50.370> I<00:03:50.459> think<00:03:50.670> it's<00:03:50.820> it's<00:03:51.120> just

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
actually pay 200 I think it's it's just

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.240 
actually pay 200 I think it's it's just
weird<00:03:51.630> I<00:03:51.720> think<00:03:51.780> it's<00:03:51.989> just<00:03:52.140> how<00:03:52.320> how<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:52.980> game

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
weird I think it's just how how the game

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.860 
weird I think it's just how how the game
works<00:03:53.489> and<00:03:53.670> how<00:03:53.790> everything<00:03:54.030> is<00:03:54.239> implemented

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
works and how everything is implemented

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.110 
works and how everything is implemented
I<00:03:54.959> mean<00:03:55.140> obviously<00:03:55.829> the<00:03:56.400> developers<00:03:56.850> didn't

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
I mean obviously the developers didn't

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.039 
I mean obviously the developers didn't
