00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:08.790
 hello we're all going to make a salad 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.070
 of brown rice 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.760
 brown rice here what I have already 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.380

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.380
 cook time is cooking 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.050
 and each container in this case was a rice 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.880
 integral with a portion of 20 minutes 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.610
 Once cooked, you have to go through the 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.039
 graph that strained the rice and passed through 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.039
 the two youngsters drain well and once 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:33.699
 cold we can accompany it good here is 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.559
 the fantasy but the classic recipe of 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.050
 Italian brown rice salad 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.190

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.620

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:10.940

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.580

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.680
 mushrooms, sliced â€‹â€‹mushrooms 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.680
 oil here I have 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:30.950
 and precocious sausages from 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:34.550
 pig and that that can be put to that 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:41.850
 they are fresh cheese a cheese type or 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:44.580
 I do not know about fresh corin or cow and sheep 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.479
 that they will not be cured and I have given myself a 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:52.210
 little bit cool and this is cheese 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.640
 Swiss elementary that is a pretty cheese 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.250
 sweet goes very well salads and salads 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.159
 finally comments with oil 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.720
 olive here I have put only salt to bake 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.830
 the ingredients 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:09.090
 so the first thing I'm going to put on 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:12.869
 olive oil to mix it well with 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.869
 rice 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.250
 oil 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.720
 integral is very good is ideal can 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:34.900
 have in the refrigerator for about 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.900
 days 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:47.109
 as you see put a good spoon 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.109
 let's start putting 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.260
 red 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.730
 the following 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.730
 of corn 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.850
 we start with the vegetable 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.900
 green peas 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.650
 3 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:24.810
 and also with vegetables 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.250
 then when it's ready it seems 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.700
 still a little 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.190
 still a little bit of oil 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.790
 Ideally, prepare an hour before 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.790
 consume them 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.890
 and as well as taste the richest even the 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.270
 next day richer as we know 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:50.180
 in the morning when we come back from the 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:51.859
 beach we already have a festive recipe 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.550
 here also the mushrooms had 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.560
 drained 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.730
 the oil so that they do not mix 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.159
 oil 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.580
 of the different preserves with the oil 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:02.580
 olive 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.670
 Y 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.270
 A) Yes 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:27.520
 and that's why I usually mix it where 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:39.130
 it gets 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:42.740
 sweet ham and not too much 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:45.670
 the flavors but good here in the 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.169
 fantasy that imposes 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:51.039
 born another side 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.350
 who does it only Latino vote for the 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:57.080
 action 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.080
 here also good here is the fantasy 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.170
 yes 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.680
 and here the ingredients, you can 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.680
 put at will 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:17.180
 yes 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.789
 so simple 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.620
 I for example have known the stream and 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:24.229
 I left treated a little bit because 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.960
 so I leave it personalized what to taste 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:28.340
 of each family component if 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.340
 someone does not have an ingredient because 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:34.029
 prepared a container 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:37.360
 without that environment 

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:37.360
 we face everything 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.810
 I think a bit dry with good 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.340
 do not 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.340
 it has quite loose 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.520
 all right 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.760
 good 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:14.630
 I would say that I had to put 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.630
 are 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:23.429
 I hope you liked it until soon 

00:06:20.679 --> 00:06:23.429
 bye
