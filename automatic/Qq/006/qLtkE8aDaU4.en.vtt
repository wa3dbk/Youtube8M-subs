00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
time we're already getting Hulk figure

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.759 
time we're already getting Hulk figure
primarily<00:00:29.789> from<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.150> movie<00:00:30.449> version<00:00:30.769> which

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
primarily from the movie version which

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.290 
primarily from the movie version which
is<00:00:31.920> going<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.250> be<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.489> exact<00:00:32.790> same<00:00:32.820> figure

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
is going to be the exact same figure

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.090 
is going to be the exact same figure
here<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.840> just<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.200> different<00:00:34.469> head<00:00:34.620> sculpt<00:00:34.980> and

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
here to just a different head sculpt and

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.250 
here to just a different head sculpt and
different<00:00:35.340> pants<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.690> was<00:00:36.870> pretty<00:00:37.079> much

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
different pants so I was pretty much

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.920 
different pants so I was pretty much
already<00:00:37.469> planning<00:00:37.829> on<00:00:38.010> using<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.340> aou<00:00:39.059> Hulk

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
already planning on using that aou Hulk

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.900 
already planning on using that aou Hulk
as<00:00:40.170> my<00:00:40.410> primary<00:00:40.649> hole<00:00:41.129> because<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.670> think

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
as my primary hole because I think

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.490 
as my primary hole because I think
that's<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.239> really<00:00:42.629> good-looking<00:00:42.840> Hulk<00:00:43.320> and

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
that's a really good-looking Hulk and

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.410 
that's a really good-looking Hulk and
this<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> really<00:00:44.430> good-looking<00:00:44.730> hole<00:00:45.180> to

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
this is a really good-looking hole to

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.810 
this is a really good-looking hole to
maybe<00:00:45.840> if<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.200> end<00:00:46.350> up<00:00:46.440> getting<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:46.950> which<00:00:47.670> I

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
maybe if I end up getting this which I

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.060 
maybe if I end up getting this which I
do<00:00:47.879> plan<00:00:48.360> on<00:00:48.390> probably<00:00:49.140> getting<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.590> anyways

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
do plan on probably getting this anyways

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.220 
do plan on probably getting this anyways
just<00:00:50.309> for<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.579> other<00:00:50.730> figures<00:00:51.120> but<00:00:51.899> I

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
just for the other figures but I

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.270 
just for the other figures but I
probably<00:00:52.969> would<00:00:53.969> use<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.949> maybe<00:00:55.949> swap

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
probably would use this and maybe swap

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.770 
probably would use this and maybe swap
the<00:00:56.430> head<00:00:56.579> out<00:00:56.730> although<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.390> does<00:00:57.600> look

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
the head out although this does look

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.200 
the head out although this does look
good<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.500> doc<00:00:58.949> Greene<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.910> more

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
good this is the doc Greene so the more

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.560 
good this is the doc Greene so the more
modern<00:01:00.570> version<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:01.020> Hulk<00:01:02.449> it's<00:01:03.449> a

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
modern version of Hulk it's a

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.969 
modern version of Hulk it's a
good-looking<00:01:03.780> figure<00:01:04.320> although<00:01:04.769> we're

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
good-looking figure although we're

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.710 
good-looking figure although we're
already<00:01:05.159> getting<00:01:05.400> another<00:01:05.760> Rory<00:01:06.420> getting<00:01:06.659> a

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
already getting another Rory getting a

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.289 
already getting another Rory getting a
new<00:01:06.869> Hulk<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.100> really<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.270> only

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
new Hulk so and really the only

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.000 
new Hulk so and really the only
difference<00:01:09.900> between<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.439> Hulk<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
difference between this Hulk and the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.980 
difference between this Hulk and the
Avengers<00:01:11.790> Hulk<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.479> he's<00:01:12.659> got<00:01:12.689> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
Avengers Hulk is that he's got the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.039 
Avengers Hulk is that he's got the
Avengers<00:01:13.409> pants<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.100> which<00:01:14.850> are<00:01:15.150> what<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.810> is

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
Avengers pants on which are what this is

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.990 
Avengers pants on which are what this is
here<00:01:16.470> but<00:01:16.710> these<00:01:16.890> are<00:01:17.070> painted<00:01:17.369> Brown<00:01:17.640> and

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
here but these are painted Brown and

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.090 
here but these are painted Brown and
then<00:01:18.540> he's<00:01:18.659> got<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.869> new<00:01:19.439> head<00:01:19.650> skull<00:01:19.920> so

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
then he's got the new head skull so

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.320 
then he's got the new head skull so
there's<00:01:20.250> really<00:01:20.340> no<00:01:20.549> difference<00:01:20.580> this<00:01:21.030> is

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
there's really no difference this is

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.420 
there's really no difference this is
kind<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.630> unfortunate<00:01:21.810> but<00:01:22.409> maybe<00:01:22.680> i'll<00:01:23.280> end

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
kind of unfortunate but maybe i'll end

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.219 
kind of unfortunate but maybe i'll end
up<00:01:23.580> selling<00:01:24.000> off<00:01:24.150> one<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.509> them<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.930> don't<00:01:25.170> know

be that hard to get you can get this one

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
which i think this exclusive is going to

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.520 
which i think this exclusive is going to
be<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.960> little<00:01:37.350> bit<00:01:37.500> harder<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.509> I'm<00:01:39.509> kind<00:01:40.470> of

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
be a little bit harder and I'm kind of

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.590 
be a little bit harder and I'm kind of
sad<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.890> it's<00:01:41.040> an<00:01:41.130> exclusive<00:01:41.460> because<00:01:42.060> I

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
sad that it's an exclusive because I

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.469 
sad that it's an exclusive because I
really<00:01:42.960> want<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.259> Ultron<00:01:43.680> here<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.479> new

figured<00:01:54.600> at<00:01:55.110> some<00:01:55.140> point<00:01:55.560> they<00:01:55.680> would<00:01:55.860> use<00:01:56.100> for

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
figured at some point they would use for

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.219 
figured at some point they would use for
Ultron<00:01:56.700> which<00:01:57.329> I'm<00:01:57.509> completely<00:01:57.930> fine<00:01:58.200> with

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
Ultron which I'm completely fine with

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.230 
Ultron which I'm completely fine with
because<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.649> think<00:01:58.710> it's<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> good<00:01:59.130> mold<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.700> think

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
because I think it's a good mold I think

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.050 
because I think it's a good mold I think
it<00:02:00.390> looks<00:02:00.420> good<00:02:00.990> here<00:02:01.409> too<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:02.000> don't<00:02:03.000> know

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
it looks good here too I don't know

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.359 
it looks good here too I don't know
about<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.390> antennas<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:04.290> mean<00:02:04.890> I'm<00:02:05.159> sure

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
about the antennas I I mean I'm sure

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.449 
about the antennas I I mean I'm sure
it's<00:02:05.610> just<00:02:05.729> depending<00:02:06.390> on<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.630> artwork<00:02:07.170> but<00:02:07.890> I

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
it's just depending on the artwork but I

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.090 
it's just depending on the artwork but I
kind<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.090> wish<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.390> was<00:02:09.479> more

white vision figure which I don't know

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.270 
white vision figure which I don't know
if<00:03:15.519> this<00:03:15.670> is<00:03:15.700> translucent<00:03:16.330> plastic<00:03:17.140> or<00:03:17.680> if

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
if this is translucent plastic or if

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.090 
if this is translucent plastic or if
it's<00:03:18.489> if<00:03:19.030> he's<00:03:19.450> just<00:03:19.660> painted<00:03:20.080> with<00:03:20.260> like

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
it's if he's just painted with like

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.970 
it's if he's just painted with like
white<00:03:21.430> we<00:03:22.090> won't<00:03:22.300> really<00:03:22.450> know<00:03:22.570> yet<00:03:22.980> hopefully

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
white we won't really know yet hopefully

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.770 
white we won't really know yet hopefully
it's<00:03:24.340> not<00:03:24.430> translucent<00:03:25.180> plastic<00:03:25.239> because

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
it's not translucent plastic because

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.090 
it's not translucent plastic because
otherwise<00:03:26.080> this<00:03:26.410> figure<00:03:26.709> is<00:03:26.769> going<00:03:26.920> to<00:03:26.980> be

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
otherwise this figure is going to be

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.280 
otherwise this figure is going to be
kind<00:03:27.340> of<00:03:27.430> crappy<00:03:27.820> because<00:03:28.390> if<00:03:28.900> you<00:03:29.170> know

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
kind of crappy because if you know

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.170 
kind of crappy because if you know
anything<00:03:29.500> about<00:03:29.680> translucent<00:03:30.580> figures<00:03:30.880> that

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
anything about translucent figures that

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.140 
anything about translucent figures that
they're<00:03:31.360> really<00:03:31.780> easy<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:32.230> break<00:03:32.760> it<00:03:33.760> while

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
they're really easy to break it while

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.360 
they're really easy to break it while
this<00:03:34.420> doesn't<00:03:34.810> look<00:03:34.989> like<00:03:35.200> he's<00:03:35.440> translucent

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
this doesn't look like he's translucent

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.460 
this doesn't look like he's translucent
I<00:03:36.519> kind<00:03:36.730> of<00:03:36.850> see<00:03:37.000> some<00:03:37.180> translucent<00:03:37.630> pneus<00:03:38.230> in

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.580 
his his shoulder there so and it kind of
looks<00:03:43.510> like<00:03:43.570> in<00:03:43.780> his<00:03:43.870> arm<00:03:44.080> but<00:03:44.230> it's<00:03:44.350> hard<00:03:44.530> to

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
looks like in his arm but it's hard to

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.380 
looks like in his arm but it's hard to
tell<00:03:44.890> because<00:03:45.100> the<00:03:45.310> background<00:03:45.970> is<00:03:46.150> white<00:03:46.330> so

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
tell because the background is white so

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.310 
tell because the background is white so
it<00:03:46.690> doesn't<00:03:47.280> it<00:03:48.280> doesn't<00:03:48.340> help<00:03:48.820> anything<00:03:49.320> I'm

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
it doesn't it doesn't help anything I'm

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.870 
it doesn't it doesn't help anything I'm
really<00:03:50.680> hoping<00:03:51.040> that<00:03:51.190> he's<00:03:51.340> just<00:03:51.550> going<00:03:51.640> to<00:03:51.730> be

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
really hoping that he's just going to be

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.670 
really hoping that he's just going to be
painted<00:03:52.720> over<00:03:52.870> white<00:03:53.260> and<00:03:55.380> that's<00:03:56.380> all

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
painted over white and that's all

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.380 
painted over white and that's all
because<00:03:56.709> if<00:03:57.310> he's<00:03:57.760> trained<00:03:58.030> if<00:03:58.180> he's

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
because if he's trained if he's

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.300 
because if he's trained if he's
translucent<00:03:59.170> plastic<00:03:59.260> he's<00:03:59.769> probably<00:04:00.070> going

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
translucent plastic he's probably going

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.220 
translucent plastic he's probably going
to<00:04:00.400> break<00:04:00.610> pretty<00:04:00.880> easy<00:04:01.150> and<00:04:01.540> that's<00:04:01.989> not

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
to break pretty easy and that's not

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.300 
to break pretty easy and that's not
going<00:04:02.350> to<00:04:02.440> be<00:04:02.470> good<00:04:02.769> so<00:04:03.840> yeah<00:04:04.840> so<00:04:05.769> that'd<00:04:06.190> be

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
going to be good so yeah so that'd be

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.410 
going to be good so yeah so that'd be
cool<00:04:06.489> we're<00:04:06.730> going<00:04:06.850> to<00:04:06.910> get<00:04:07.060> the<00:04:07.209> regular

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
cool we're going to get the regular

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.350 
cool we're going to get the regular
Ultron<00:04:08.200> or<00:04:08.430> Ultron<00:04:09.430> we're<00:04:10.000> gonna<00:04:10.090> get<00:04:10.239> the

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
Ultron or Ultron we're gonna get the

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.449 
Ultron or Ultron we're gonna get the
regular<00:04:10.540> vision<00:04:11.110> in<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:11.350> Hulkbuster<00:04:12.280> wave

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
regular vision in the Hulkbuster wave

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.180 
regular vision in the Hulkbuster wave
which<00:04:12.790> I<00:04:12.940> will<00:04:13.150> be<00:04:13.180> covering<00:04:13.500> soon<00:04:14.500> so<00:04:15.130> stay

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
which I will be covering soon so stay

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.699 
which I will be covering soon so stay
tuned<00:04:15.580> for<00:04:15.790> that<00:04:15.820> but<00:04:16.600> you<00:04:17.140> know<00:04:17.260> really<00:04:17.410> cool

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
tuned for that but you know really cool

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.500 
tuned for that but you know really cool
i<00:04:17.859> don't<00:04:18.040> know<00:04:18.160> i'm<00:04:18.789> not<00:04:18.970> sure<00:04:19.150> what<00:04:19.270> the<00:04:19.390> deal

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
i don't know i'm not sure what the deal

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:20.880 
i don't know i'm not sure what the deal
is<00:04:19.570> with<00:04:19.690> the<00:04:19.900> white<00:04:20.049> version<00:04:20.260> i<00:04:20.650> don't<00:04:20.799> know

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
is with the white version i don't know

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.409 
is with the white version i don't know
if<00:04:20.979> the<00:04:21.070> white<00:04:21.250> version<00:04:21.459> actually<00:04:22.300> I<00:04:22.330> think

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
if the white version actually I think

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:23.800 
if the white version actually I think
the<00:04:22.690> white<00:04:22.840> version<00:04:23.080> is

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
the white version is

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.129 
the white version is
when<00:04:24.130> he<00:04:25.130> kind<00:04:25.400> of<00:04:25.490> loses<00:04:25.910> all<00:04:26.300> his<00:04:26.750> like

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
when he kind of loses all his like

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.230 
when he kind of loses all his like
emotions<00:04:27.830> and<00:04:28.190> stuff<00:04:28.340> if<00:04:28.639> I<00:04:28.790> remember

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
emotions and stuff if I remember

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.590 
emotions and stuff if I remember
correctly<00:04:29.680> I<00:04:30.730> think<00:04:31.730> it's<00:04:32.060> when<00:04:32.210> his<00:04:32.389> like

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
correctly I think it's when his like

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.450 
correctly I think it's when his like
memories<00:04:33.050> and<00:04:33.230> all<00:04:33.320> that<00:04:33.500> get<00:04:33.680> erase<00:04:34.010> so<00:04:34.250> he's

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
memories and all that get erase so he's

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.580 
memories and all that get erase so he's
just<00:04:34.490> back<00:04:35.000> to<00:04:35.210> his<00:04:35.450> primitive<00:04:35.840> primitive

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
just back to his primitive primitive

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.190 
just back to his primitive primitive
robot<00:04:37.100> state<00:04:37.580> so<00:04:38.330> I<00:04:38.360> think<00:04:38.690> that's<00:04:38.990> what

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
robot state so I think that's what

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.110 
robot state so I think that's what
that's<00:04:39.380> supposed<00:04:39.740> to<00:04:39.860> be<00:04:39.889> but<00:04:40.700> you<00:04:40.760> could<00:04:41.000> also

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
that's supposed to be but you could also

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.390 
that's supposed to be but you could also
use<00:04:41.240> as<00:04:41.570> like<00:04:41.750> a<00:04:41.780> phasing<00:04:42.350> version<00:04:42.950> although

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
use as like a phasing version although

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.760 
use as like a phasing version although
when<00:04:43.850> he<00:04:43.970> faces<00:04:44.330> he's<00:04:44.780> more<00:04:45.080> just<00:04:45.110> kind<00:04:45.740> of

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
when he faces he's more just kind of

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.909 
when he faces he's more just kind of
like<00:04:45.980> see-through<00:04:46.730> of<00:04:46.970> how<00:04:47.840> like<00:04:48.410> see-through

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
like see-through of how like see-through

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.940 
like see-through of how like see-through
and<00:04:49.130> not<00:04:49.730> like<00:04:50.090> just<00:04:50.510> white<00:04:50.720> so<00:04:51.110> either<00:04:51.650> way

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
and not like just white so either way

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.320 
and not like just white so either way
it's<00:04:52.160> still<00:04:52.250> pretty<00:04:52.520> cool<00:04:52.960> so<00:04:54.910> I'm<00:04:55.910> really

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
it's still pretty cool so I'm really

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.350 
it's still pretty cool so I'm really
excited<00:04:56.479> I'm<00:04:57.370> kind<00:04:58.370> of<00:04:58.430> sad<00:04:58.610> though<00:04:58.669> because<00:04:59.090> i

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
excited I'm kind of sad though because i

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.020 
excited I'm kind of sad though because i
don't<00:04:59.690> like<00:05:00.010> exclusives<00:05:02.110> although<00:05:03.110> if<00:05:04.030> target

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
don't like exclusives although if target

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.650 
don't like exclusives although if target
can<00:05:05.210> do<00:05:05.360> a<00:05:05.389> good<00:05:05.660> job<00:05:05.720> like<00:05:06.200> they<00:05:06.380> did<00:05:06.620> with<00:05:06.860> the

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
can do a good job like they did with the

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.900 
can do a good job like they did with the
miss<00:05:08.660> marvel<00:05:09.200> 3-pack<00:05:09.710> with<00:05:10.010> radioactive<00:05:10.639> man

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
miss marvel 3-pack with radioactive man

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.370 
miss marvel 3-pack with radioactive man
then<00:05:11.300> there<00:05:11.540> shouldn't<00:05:11.750> be<00:05:11.840> any<00:05:12.020> problem

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
then there shouldn't be any problem

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.860 
then there shouldn't be any problem
because<00:05:12.680> I<00:05:12.710> was<00:05:12.979> really<00:05:13.280> concerned<00:05:14.150> when<00:05:14.720> that

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
because I was really concerned when that

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.450 
because I was really concerned when that
was<00:05:15.080> coming<00:05:15.139> out<00:05:15.500> that<00:05:15.770> I<00:05:15.800> wouldn't<00:05:16.190> be<00:05:16.280> able

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
was coming out that I wouldn't be able

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.690 
was coming out that I wouldn't be able
to<00:05:16.580> find<00:05:16.850> it<00:05:17.030> but<00:05:17.840> as<00:05:18.080> you<00:05:18.260> can<00:05:18.410> tell<00:05:18.470> the<00:05:19.070> they

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
to find it but as you can tell the they

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.650 
to find it but as you can tell the they
have<00:05:20.060> a<00:05:20.389> lot<00:05:21.160> left<00:05:22.160> over<00:05:22.430> and<00:05:22.880> they're<00:05:23.030> on<00:05:23.270> sale

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
have a lot left over and they're on sale

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.940 
have a lot left over and they're on sale
right<00:05:23.720> now<00:05:24.050> for<00:05:24.080> like<00:05:24.380> 24<00:05:24.860> 99<00:05:25.220> so<00:05:26.530> while<00:05:27.530> I<00:05:27.560> will

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
right now for like 24 99 so while I will

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.270 
right now for like 24 99 so while I will
probably<00:05:28.190> buy<00:05:28.490> this<00:05:28.550> at<00:05:28.910> full<00:05:29.090> price<00:05:29.300> I<00:05:30.280> would

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
probably buy this at full price I would

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.029 
probably buy this at full price I would
hope<00:05:31.460> that<00:05:31.490> it<00:05:31.880> that<00:05:32.539> that<00:05:33.169> this<00:05:33.410> 3-pack<00:05:33.830> will

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 
hope that it that that this 3-pack will

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:36.190 
hope that it that that this 3-pack will
probably<00:05:34.520> go<00:05:34.700> about<00:05:35.300> being<00:05:35.630> the<00:05:35.780> same<00:05:35.990> way

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
probably go about being the same way

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.870 
probably go about being the same way
because<00:05:36.680> I<00:05:37.210> I<00:05:38.210> just<00:05:39.020> as<00:05:39.260> much<00:05:39.650> as<00:05:39.890> I<00:05:40.039> don't

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
because I I just as much as I don't

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.500
