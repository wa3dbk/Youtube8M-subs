00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.330
 hello love making friends back today 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:28.189
 we have a flower nail 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:30.619
 what are flower nails he looks like this 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.390
 you need them for the production of 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:37.460
 various sugar flowers 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:40.210
 you can get them so on the internet you can 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.210
 They are made of metal 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:47.239
 or plastic 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.940
 plastic who does not have such a thing but 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.540
 still imitate the flower here now 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.180
 I want to follow what I then in mine 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.640
 following videos you want to show you 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.540
 I can make it myself 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.479
 we need a cardboard box 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.869
 the should not be relatively firm either 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.640
 too fat but not so and and 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.070
 a tenth nail 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.979
 that's the reason and in sillian 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.030
 what you need for that and the size 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.350
 the size would be 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.460
 we have a lock of 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:31.280
 a bottle 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:34.909
 which is about the same size or 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.299
 if you have a shot glass then too 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:42.130
 can you use that as well? 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:47.020
 but that would be the size as I said 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:53.920
 so you know it should not be bigger 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.920
 we just need it here 

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:57.639
 all around 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:11.810
 well and fast now if I am 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.930
 Now put the nail on it then 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:19.220
 we really have the right size 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:26.150
 and then cut out a pair of scissors again 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:27.140
 and that we film then yes 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.250
 to give up 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:35.570
 This is really true for every flower 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:39.640
 no matter if that is out of cardboard now because 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:43.060
 We do not work directly on the box 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:50.410
 so that would be the first step 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:50.410
 we must potter still here always 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:03:02.110
 take care so that you do not hurt yourself 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:07.959
 and our flower nail who already 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:11.120
 ready to use 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:20.950
 it is then always the film 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:24.340
 it and here are then the various 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:28.959
 flowers sprayed 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:31.569
 and turned so easily is it one 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.970
 flowers brand self-manufacture 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.269
 I wish you much fun in the market 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.269
