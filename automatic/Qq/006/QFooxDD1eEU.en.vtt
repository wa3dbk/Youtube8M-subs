00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.110
 the beta is over and the finished one 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.940
 play is about the end of the month out 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.370
 to come naturally better than 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.470
 the beta is because that was just real 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.300
 a few problems which annoying 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.939
 has been there is of course already 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.170
 worked on some fixes again and 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.740
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.539
 wish yours said so it will 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.060
 already in several points 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.239
 worked and one hopes of course that 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.550
 These are fixed to the launch by 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.559
 Of course, the beds have some bugs 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.050
 and glitches anyway balancing 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.260
 addressed problems and thanks for that 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.510
 in their really long blogpost many 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.850
 Problems are platform specific though 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.210
 two or three of the largest 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.120
 There were problems on the pc with low 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.399
 fps values respectively 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.190
 extreme fps has to break for 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.199
 many players just belong to it 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.420
 It was just not a thing either 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.989
 fixed by any three updates 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.909
 has been 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.010
 By the way, many players are not 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.570
 only got into the game because you are in the 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.760
 loading screen is stuck 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.930
 pretty annoying if you have one 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.700
 beta wants to test 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.860
 I never had one of the problems 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.689
 So the first two or not 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.360
 the next one but it really has 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.400
 lots of games like for example 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.259
 kaboom which just hold the beds 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.090
 could not play anymore because of it 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.729
 just did not run optimally 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.860
 the high cpu use which at times in 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.560
 the height shoots or that really one 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.110
 reason somehow turned up 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.479
 was in the three patches or with the 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.880
 Three patches in the beta gefixed says so 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.920
 You can say the patch to the patch 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.869
 that they really did a lot 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.759
 I do not know if that too on the 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.560
 console over but happened here 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.509
 The pc has that game a lot 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.820
 better done if not perfect 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.350
 of course for all console players 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.719
 as it is connected to the controller layout 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.729
 worked and also added new ones like that 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.009
 For example, you can now bf 3 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.290
 Select controller layout and me 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.450
 I think some like that because some like it 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.740
 things were not perfect 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.360
 I have that myself briefly 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.660
 looked at and somehow I found that by 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.120
 bf3 too 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.340
 better one of the funniest bucks 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.460
 was the invisible lift of the one 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.650
 including vehicles or just 20 people 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.420
 so thrown about in the air 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.100
 This was pretty cool though 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.950
 Meanwhile also fixed again 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.900
 score the list at gameplay balancing 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.510
 is really quite long and the same 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.910
 the first point is great 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.950
 I have to say honestly in the beta 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.560
 It often happens that you just go with it 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.540
 a hit sound was killed 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.190
 So you just got something 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.830
 once got that hit sound and that 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.150
 get visual indication for it and is 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.160
 then directly overturned 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.380
 So you really did not have much 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.000
 time to react at all and that 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.820
 was changed now so that the 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.910
 perception of sound and thus harm 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.260
 in general wants to be better 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.120
 I'll see how it works 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.460
 they explained that because of that 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.260
 the cooldown of this hit sound or 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.710
 the visual display just too long 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.330
 was 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:11.170
 Accordingly, that comes quickly now 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.870
 one after another our oh so awesome ak 12 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.550
 especially in the burst mode it has a nerve 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.950
 why do you ask? 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.110
 she just had a whole 1000 shot a week 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.690
 minute in advance mode available 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.610
 what that weapon with that anyway 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.040
 very low recoil just too strong 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.560
 you can still do it 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.170
 Remember as I often do in my videos 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.570
 who used the muscle braker was 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.760
 ice still too good and now has 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.640
 you even have more disadvantages to this 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.110
 if we use a weapon now 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.290
 vollautomatisch shoots then the will 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.360
 spread again larger to all providers 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.220
 out there what it at least already 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.900
 times as many as in battlefield 3 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.340
 At least that's what it can do to me 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.030
 maybe even a few more are available 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.650
 no matter 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.600
 the poverty bags are now two 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.030
 magazine immediately after loading and 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.190
 plus four more over the rest 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.500
 So these are really real 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.209
 usable crazy for all storm 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.890
 soldiers resuscitate homes 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.050
 were now from seven to ten 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.450
 Seconds high that concerns halt 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.130
 conquest and I like that super well 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.780
 suppose that the nomination timer too 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.880
 a little bit were raised that way 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.400
 not two seconds or a percentage 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.489
 it has happened to me so often 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.830
 that I just brought from the sky where 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.229
 so when i was pilot, of course, after 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.690
 a constant beep signal was heard 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:29.220
 but no rocket warning this is 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.270
 always happens when someone with the 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.370
 apg which laser was marked on you 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.319
 shot and yes there is now 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.690
 no longer that means laser joint 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:41.580
 The Martian and apps are history 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.180
 By the way, that's one of the topics 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.039
 Which is probably the biggest back or that 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.380
 biggest balancing problems 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:52.590
 According to the forums it was amazing 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.880
 how much time has been posted about it and 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.800
 I'm still a bit honest 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.000
 glad that this is not in there because 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.550
 that was just too easy 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.860
 Two people were already pretty good 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.250
 really helios or even in the 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.509
 future jets with a hit down 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.780
 instead, this makes things better, too 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:12.539
 of course the igla city the old 25% 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.400
 35 percent start hurting me now 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:16.680
 really good for you otherwise have to 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.389
 you really have four hits and quite 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.400
 honestly I do not have a single kill 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:22.319
 with this weapon get as the 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.650
 It's clear to pilots now 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.360
 better 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.940
 even other laser steered 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.430
 missile hits would be only 90 percent 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.139
 instead of doing 100 percent harm so that 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.169
 one still has the chance this one 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.550
 fire extinguisher so use the unlock 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:37.320
 He does a little bit with that as well 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.039
 More than in battlefield 3 I think 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.810
 good again 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:41.639
 I find many of these changes 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.380
 personally really good performance 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:44.880
 problems and we did not have a question 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.740
 that had to be 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.169
 These had to be fixed so the 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.430
 problems and other balancing 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:52.020
 things I want to first see how 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.580
 which then really plays in the game and 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.469
 I am sure that there is still a lot 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.150
 we do not come after that 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:59.130
 finished with balancing problems 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.800
 Let me know in the comments 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.330
 what you think of because eat really 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.039
 some points in the process 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.960
 probably exactly the opposite 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:08.969
 can make my statement so 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.500
 what I think of the complex 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:12.690
 we have to see 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.280
 but anyway let me know what you are 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.870
 think about it and that's it 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.889
 again for this video then you will 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.949
 see you and hopefully until the 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:19.949
 May
