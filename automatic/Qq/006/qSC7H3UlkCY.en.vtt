00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
still could not get full housing benefit

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.799

to<00:01:00.809> cover<00:01:01.020> our<00:01:01.230> rent<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:02.660> because<00:01:03.660> they

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
to cover our rent and because they

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.679 
to cover our rent and because they
couldn't<00:01:03.989> help<00:01:04.290> us<00:01:04.530> we<00:01:05.430> rang<00:01:05.670> every<00:01:06.000> hostile

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
couldn't help us we rang every hostile

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.330 
couldn't help us we rang every hostile
on<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.869> list<00:01:07.080> they<00:01:07.500> couldn't<00:01:07.799> help<00:01:07.979> as<00:01:08.130> either

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
on the list they couldn't help as either

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.190 
on the list they couldn't help as either
so<00:01:09.240> we<00:01:09.420> were<00:01:09.570> faced<00:01:09.780> with<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.080> possibility

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
so we were faced with the possibility

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.289 
so we were faced with the possibility
that<00:01:10.740> we<00:01:11.130> would<00:01:11.310> have<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.610> sleep<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.119> car

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
that we would have to sleep in the car

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.690 
that we would have to sleep in the car
and<00:01:13.049> that's<00:01:13.380> exactly<00:01:13.530> what<00:01:14.040> we<00:01:14.159> did<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.580> it

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
and that's exactly what we did and it

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.020 
and that's exactly what we did and it
was<00:01:14.820> terrifying<00:01:15.509> as<00:01:16.280> a<00:01:17.280> result<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.850> what

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
was terrifying as a result of what

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.590 
was terrifying as a result of what
happened<00:01:18.320> the<00:01:19.320> family<00:01:19.680> have<00:01:19.799> split<00:01:20.130> up<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.600> I

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
happened the family have split up and I

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.190 
happened the family have split up and I
ended<00:01:22.080> up<00:01:22.320> here<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.280> hostel<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.780> was
