00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.390
 Hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:09.050
 new video from the spiral plays point 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.130
 we have the next one today 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.590
 christmas party christmas tournament fight 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.690
 And this is about the fight 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:21.270
 Number 11 overall we already had 20 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.920
 Beyblade had it in the fight it is new to it 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.019
 also come from us and it will be 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.340
 follow more I look supple times 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.619
 get away with it and how fast again 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.370
 we have to turn in the final rounds 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.239
 will just see that 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:44.840
 we definitely have a few more 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:44.840
 do well 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.740
 first round and take a few out 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.860
 look at something 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:11.180
 In any case, here we have the 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:13.160
 medico very interesting hallelujah that 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.820
 is here on the spot since cross even 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.070
 been 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.860
 that means we have two clowns against 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.950
 the metal carrier that is definitely a 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.070
 very interesting fight on the weight 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.140
 I would both assess almost the same 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.250
 a left one right clarifies times 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:34.100
 see again stable guy against himself 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.770
 like to soak with absorption forces 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.770
 Michael Weber clearly we are coming 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.280
 Of course we will see that again 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.770
 2 the thing easy to watch 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.090
 for as fast as possible one after the other 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.890
 can deduct 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.899
 All right, then specify round 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.410
 single best of five fight a lot 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.410
 while watching 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.810
 You lose medio properly 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.820
 land or lose my power but my 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.550
 it's not so wild legs with 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.320
 little power is good at absorbing question 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.360
 only here could come forward 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.340
 the material that is accepted is clear 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.980
 belonged to the team had made here too 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:24.530
 city ​​actually hot even 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.870
 interesting the clinging by the 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.150
 come get tips that is quite 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.830
 normal 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.780
 Let's see what happens now people 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.350
 had to wait so long 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.459
 on a video but they were the 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.860
 various things are now 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.570
 but have tried diligently somewhere 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.510
 Also the information over comes to you 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.030
 let it be clever , look at the 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.340
 arena turns out to be very difficult 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.489
 in the medio which means that this stamina 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.000
 type is despite the first point here 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:58.130
 has always brought in place 15 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.640
 the dreamer bring course now 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:07.480
 get started here first 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.480
 jasmine dropped 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:22.430
 or I have to demolition only again 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.650
 I would say come in the race 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.690
 Is it just going on or if the 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.310
 media battles through and now maybe 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.310
 even can absorb power because 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.970
 that is certainly not a bad thing 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.940
 been 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.940
 let's see if medium creates straight in 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.959
 empty under lions of course so 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.100
 that in the middle more one 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.269
 larger shallow enriches it 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.010
 instructed that a little bit ago 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.200
 Swings or nets are both 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.760
 parallel in your training 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.579
 the air is not exactly here 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.570
 right tip for this arena but 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:58.239
 medio is always fighting back 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:05.140
 and the power can still be great 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:08.140
 Of course it is the question like spinning 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:12.209
 what happens it looks like this after that 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:15.930
 medium video has gotten to every point 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:18.190
 so we have a 1 equalization of 11 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.970
 and yes that promises in any case 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:27.610
 say good luck for the further fight 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:31.650
 go like this and then we start here 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.650
 meteo in the third round 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.870
 yes that would of course be in the third 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.120
 pass video again 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.970
 hardly catapults out of power 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.110
 or at least very far down 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.570
 is now completely clean 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.510
 neatly charged and has become here 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:59.500
 Definitely neat akin here 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:02.290
 the energy of chronos is brought now 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.700
 I wonder how it goes on here 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:10.630
 Of course, it will take a little longer to fight 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:15.729
 well, anyway that would have been exciting 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:18.070
 principle of meteo a bit asynchronous 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:20.770
 Teacher that's right the 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.410
 coloring media promote power but 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:27.280
 since chronos definitely synonymous yes there 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:30.220
 neat to metro off and years of girls 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.080
 he does not get more often but he loses 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.450
 always makes it easy 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.210
 contact 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:40.150
 until this time the power to 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:43.150
 steal so here we have a 2 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:45.729
 1-guidance for anger and then go 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.960
 we of course in the fourth round 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:51.039
 which can also be decisive 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:55.050
 Vollmann says she picks up another point 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:57.250
 then he is definitely on 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.750
 but they are not all time 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:09.570
 raus or completely free hessen 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:12.150
 so video but that is without contact 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.610
 went out and accordingly the same 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.070
 the repeat here again what I 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.050
 has just seen that is krones 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.910
 Down here in the corner stinks as with 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:24.360
 although his tuning fork is very 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:37.680
 interesting little behavior times 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:40.800
 look video has attacked and zack 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:44.419
 this is definitely the clear victory for the 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:49.530
 most mine types thrones new in assortment 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:53.940
 new with me in my box and thus 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:57.419
 we have definitely a winner is 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.560
 Krones is continuing to bat medio el greco's 

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:00.180
 also not out and will be 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.460
 certainly then fight again purely 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.290
 can if he is good enough to 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.340
 do not thank for watching and looking forward 

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:07.440
 me then be the next time there 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.600
 if it is, the mirror makes a place 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.169
 at video and like to look something 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.360
 is over too 

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:13.650
 they are all sharpener and glass too 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.460
 I 'm looking forward to it 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.460
 the playground
