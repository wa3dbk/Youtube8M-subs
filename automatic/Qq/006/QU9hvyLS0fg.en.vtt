 will allow to establish the causes that 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.970
 produced in order to apply

 following steps recognition of 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.750
 place of occurrence 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.840
 interview to witnesses repetition or 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.049
 simulation of the scene analysis of 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.649
 parts and pieces written report of
