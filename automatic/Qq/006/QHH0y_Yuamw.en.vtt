00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.860
 and 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.140
 on youtube once again the friends and 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.630
 good people, how can they be given? 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.790
 account today I bring you this texture to see 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.529
 we're going to get on the map and well this 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.750
 texture is ice and it is very cool 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.990
 for those 15 I bring them and good 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:38.560
 let's go here and start here 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:41.170
 we have oak wood on this side 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.770
 with their respective sheets here we have 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.470
 the cactus the brown ones here 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.809
 we have here we have obsidian the 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.489
 ice and snow and good on this side 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.900
 up we had the villagers that 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.370
 It's a part that I love that 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.960
 As you can see, they have very 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.150
 Humorous like this that makes me see 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.710
 with an angry face and on the other hand 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.720
 we have others that have characteristics 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.080
 like this one that left me dry and 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.910
 they throw very strange and good they do not have face 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.240
 of angry other twitters there are poses 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.430
 and not so is life so good here 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.860
 we have the chicken and we have a grenade 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.110
 next to her which is on the run 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.369
 it's an egg, but it looks like that 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.920
 here we have the brand that is 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.750
 completely the same here we have the pig 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.750
 that simply because it seems like a 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.479
 agent we already have the sheep the wolf and 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.039
 the mushroom cow that are equal and good for 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.690
 this side we already have the monsters that 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.640
 This is the clipper as you can see you 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.920
 a very strange tara 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.380
 here we have the silver bis we have the 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.700
 zombie here we have the skeleton that I eat 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.860
 you can see this face looks like it was 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.570
 eat and notice that he is telling you 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.119
 what on all sides you have the same 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.490
 face to see I hope it turns good 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.590
 we are weird and here we have salt 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.560
 because the zombies so good we're going to 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.330
 come down here and here we have the sick 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.950
 which, as you can see, are the same here 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.500
 We have the line if they are very 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.420
 very rare children that we have at 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.640
 spiders that simply do not change 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.950
 they are the same and on this side we have the 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.520
 trees as you can see if we are 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.370
 great and good here we have the 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.190
 rails for the main cards we have the 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.780
 water the lava because we have the crosses 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.910
 the little things that is a part that to me 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.950
 I like it a lot because it's like 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.350
 antiquity and then those of which it is still seen 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.150
 a little more final because we have the 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.880
 slabs and the stairs that come with your 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.710
 respective block 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.200
 now that we have the flowers that 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.260
 they are also of antiquity they are 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.570
 great although we have the main card of 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.500
 oldies because after before here 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.770
 we have the sign 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.900
 of the pumpkin and you can here many 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.680
 things well and obviously with what 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.020
 we have the chests and all this we have 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.400
 the bed and well here I'm just going to 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.310
 happen like this so you can see 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.480
 the blocks as you can see we have here 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:05.870
 the sands the sandstone and all that 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.330
 we are great here we have the 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.360
 colored wool blocks with their 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.330
 carpet is here in front and here 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.769
 we have the minerals with the block that 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.380
 it belongs to you that for example here 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:21.410
 we have the emerald diamond 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.360
 I pray iron and coal and good if we 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.130
 here we go for treatment because 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.709
 we would have what is missing from the wool of 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.050
 colors which makes it super 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.090
 end not because they can see that they have 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.030
 some little things that look so very very well 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.500
 the truth because I did not notice very well 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.510
 who was the creator but the truth is 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.670
 what was left of this original and here 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.580
 we have the land that gives us in front 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.010
 good views a view to see the 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.599
 photos that is the coolest thing about this 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.670
 texture and also what we have been 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:52.599
 led to forget what I forgot 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.129
 to mention is that 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.780
 rather add this skin as you can 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.760
 see that I'm imperative and still I 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.069
 puts which is super general because 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.900
 if it looks like the skin and the whole thing and 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.819
 besides that the images are in hd 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.800
 so then the people in the description 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.690
 find what without downloading also the 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.379
 forum of the creator if there is any error 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.879
 you can report it and then I do not 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.890
 you have seen none but if you see it 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:17.479
 Similarly it managed to clear so as 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.040
 there are no people until today's video 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.630

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.190
