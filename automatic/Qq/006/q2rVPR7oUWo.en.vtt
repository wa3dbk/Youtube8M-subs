00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:08.450 

here's<00:00:02.879> another<00:00:03.000> stone<00:00:04.879> slab<00:00:05.879> that<00:00:07.460> I'm

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
here's another stone slab that I'm

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.730 
here's another stone slab that I'm
anxious<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.030> plant<00:00:09.420> another<00:00:09.809> granite<00:00:10.410> slab

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
anxious to plant another granite slab

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.629 
anxious to plant another granite slab
another<00:00:11.929> slab<00:00:12.929> that<00:00:13.320> is<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.009> results<00:00:14.490> of

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
another slab that is the results of

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.630 
another slab that is the results of
freezing<00:00:15.240> overtime<00:00:16.010> layers<00:00:17.010> peeling<00:00:17.490> off

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
freezing overtime layers peeling off

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.859 
freezing overtime layers peeling off
bigger<00:00:17.940> stones<00:00:19.820> this<00:00:20.820> stone<00:00:21.090> sits<00:00:21.510> very

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
bigger stones this stone sits very

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.109 
bigger stones this stone sits very
naturally<00:00:22.619> this<00:00:22.800> way<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.070> like<00:00:23.430> how<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.699> slopes

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
naturally this way I like how it slopes

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.740 
naturally this way I like how it slopes
down<00:00:24.240> towards<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.990> viewer<00:00:25.340> I<00:00:26.340> like<00:00:27.300> the

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
down towards the viewer I like the

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.630 
down towards the viewer I like the
direction<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.830> seems<00:00:29.039> like<00:00:29.189> most<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.550> my

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
direction it seems like most of my

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.970 
direction it seems like most of my
stones<00:00:29.939> go<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.330> opposite<00:00:30.720> way<00:00:30.779> but<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.500> like

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
stones go the opposite way but I like

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.540 
stones go the opposite way but I like
this<00:00:32.700> one<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.149> has<00:00:33.500> a<00:00:34.500> leftward<00:00:34.860> blow<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.399> the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
this one that has a leftward blow to the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.750 
this one that has a leftward blow to the
left<00:00:37.040> a<00:00:38.040> pretty<00:00:38.820> good<00:00:39.059> edge<00:00:40.280> not<00:00:41.280> terribly

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
left a pretty good edge not terribly

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.400 
left a pretty good edge not terribly
thick<00:00:42.059> or<00:00:42.300> bad<00:00:42.450> breaks<00:00:42.780> anywhere<00:00:44.960> by<00:00:45.960> spinning

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
thick or bad breaks anywhere by spinning

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.470 
thick or bad breaks anywhere by spinning
around

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
around

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.240 
around
you<00:00:49.480> could<00:00:49.660> probably<00:00:49.930> also<00:00:50.500> do<00:00:50.980> something

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
you could probably also do something

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
you could probably also do something
from<00:00:51.640> this<00:00:51.820> side<00:00:52.090> as<00:00:52.390> well<00:00:53.730> especially<00:00:54.730> if<00:00:55.120> it

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
from this side as well especially if it

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.950 
from this side as well especially if it
were<00:00:55.390> propped<00:00:55.750> up<00:00:55.989> a<00:00:56.110> little<00:00:56.350> bit<00:00:56.500> in<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:56.890> back

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
were propped up a little bit in the back

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.080 
were propped up a little bit in the back
it's<00:00:58.960> a<00:00:59.080> little<00:00:59.110> thicker<00:00:59.920> on<00:01:00.340> the<00:01:00.610> on<00:01:00.910> the

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
it's a little thicker on the on the

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.630 
it's a little thicker on the on the
front<00:01:01.300> here<00:01:01.720> so<00:01:02.040> that's<00:01:03.040> a<00:01:03.190> little<00:01:03.430> less

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
front here so that's a little less

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.370 
front here so that's a little less
appealing<00:01:04.089> to<00:01:04.420> me<00:01:05.640> but<00:01:06.990> here's<00:01:07.990> something

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
appealing to me but here's something

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.469 
appealing to me but here's something
else<00:01:09.030> let's<00:01:10.030> turn<00:01:10.270> this<00:01:10.450> one<00:01:10.660> over

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.600 

all<00:01:14.930> right<00:01:15.140> and<00:01:15.380> take<00:01:15.920> a<00:01:15.950> look<00:01:16.159> at<00:01:16.340> it<00:01:16.460> like

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
all right and take a look at it like

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.590 
all right and take a look at it like
this

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.030 

again<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.869> thickness<00:01:22.200> same<00:01:23.040> spot<00:01:23.490> here<00:01:25.040> is

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
again that thickness same spot here is

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.249 
again that thickness same spot here is
not<00:01:26.490> as<00:01:26.640> attractive<00:01:26.909> as<00:01:27.299> I'd<00:01:27.450> like<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.840> be

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
not as attractive as I'd like it to be

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.249 
not as attractive as I'd like it to be
I<00:01:28.290> could<00:01:29.009> probably<00:01:29.509> chip<00:01:30.509> some<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.049> away

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
I could probably chip some of this away

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.420 
I could probably chip some of this away
and<00:01:31.740> round<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.369> little<00:01:32.759> bit<00:01:32.939> but<00:01:34.039> I'd<00:01:35.039> risk

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
and round this a little bit but I'd risk

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.279 
and round this a little bit but I'd risk
break-in<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.909> stunts<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.509> doubt<00:01:36.750> I'll<00:01:36.899> ever<00:01:36.930> do

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
break-in the stunts I doubt I'll ever do

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.270 
break-in the stunts I doubt I'll ever do
that

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.390 

he's<00:01:42.820> actually<00:01:43.030> sad<00:01:43.510> I<00:01:43.540> was<00:01:43.810> thinking<00:01:44.170> about

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
he's actually sad I was thinking about

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.300 
he's actually sad I was thinking about
nice<00:01:45.700> curve<00:01:46.060> coming<00:01:46.540> down<00:01:46.840> to<00:01:47.140> you<00:01:47.380> I<00:01:47.620> can<00:01:48.100> see

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
nice curve coming down to you I can see

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.020 
nice curve coming down to you I can see
a<00:01:48.340> nice<00:01:48.520> clump<00:01:48.910> of<00:01:49.240> deciduous<00:01:50.230> trees<00:01:50.860> in<00:01:51.400> this

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
a nice clump of deciduous trees in this

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.500 
a nice clump of deciduous trees in this
area<00:01:52.470> with<00:01:53.470> an<00:01:53.590> exposed<00:01:54.190> rock<00:01:54.820> face<00:01:55.180> going

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.910 
guys tonight
I<00:02:22.480> think<00:02:22.900> I<00:02:23.050> probably<00:02:23.440> made<00:02:23.770> up<00:02:23.920> my<00:02:24.070> mind<00:02:24.100> but

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
I think I probably made up my mind but

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.130 
I think I probably made up my mind but
who<00:02:26.100> knows<00:02:26.310> maybe<00:02:26.520> somebody'll<00:02:27.060> bring<00:02:27.240> up

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
who knows maybe somebody'll bring up

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.530 
who knows maybe somebody'll bring up
remember
