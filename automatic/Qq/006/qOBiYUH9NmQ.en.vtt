00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello welcome again from confusing him superior consulting 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.430
 to bring a tutorial 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.009
 of how to submerge a person in water 

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.069
 madrid not whole but a part of it 

00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:13.440
 to do this, we will be two photos 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.729
 one of the person itself 

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:20.089
 and another one from the sea where we want to submerge side of the pool wherever 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:23.060
 megayacht +2 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.210
 we must first do the time 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.929
 to the person 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:29.759
 what object to 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:30.820
 Alvaro are worth 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.160
 and put the opposition more or less 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.270
 where we know that it has been submerged 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.270
 As you can see in that site, it will not be too real because the sea 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.830
 Well, it's a little bit more 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.110
 more too big let's say for a girl but good 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.030
 I'm going to put it here pretty much 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.270
 i the next we want murder of a mask and cape on the girl 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.380
 and with a brush 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.380
 black as you see big enough 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.030
 little bit blurred 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.520
 60 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.220
 we would go 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.250
 well 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.720
 putting into the water the part that we know the delayed 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.310
 the part that we know will be submerged more 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.000
 your profile will be clear 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 and put up here for example 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.480
 invent then 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.480
 will look for a wave or 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.440
 but hey around here I'll be 8- 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.010
 now we will welcome a white brush 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.010
 and we will lower 11 the size of being unfaithful 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 and we will approach this part 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.490
 I can challenge to give a little more 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.789
 yay put the parts that they know coming out a little bit 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.670
 we go down a little and capacity for this 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.590
 and around here these whole company parts 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.880
 so we could 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.619
 once we have it is ready 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.739
 we want that as the water is translucent 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.929
 Well, if someone sees us a little 

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:15.419
 this part 

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:18.849
 below the water that what we will do we will find our own the 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.629
 Brush 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.939
 at 20 percent worth 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.939
 and with a white brush a little more 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.139
 bigger 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:30.589
 we wanted little by little 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:32.659
 so much 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:35.659
 Well, taking out this part 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.319
 so we will go little by little 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.799
 Something like that was going to be left little by little 

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:55.029
 and as you see from a distance more or less we would have that look 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:59.169
 desired effect 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.969
 what do we want to do now 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:05.209
 now what we are going to do 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.009
 give it an effect 

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:08.979
 demos to filters 

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:11.979
 we can not the novel woman's coat 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.879
 of the cape mask we fought caricuao 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.879
 then we will have to go little by little 

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:22.549
 on the hips 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.060
 you can we are creating when you have 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:29.759
 for it has a more water effect 

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:31.679
 deflate 

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:34.519
 because it's more than anything 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:35.900
 will serve me said 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.900
 of sinfra tablado we can present ourselves for her 

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:40.609
 barack 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:43.909
 except that gives us the tools 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:46.909
 and giving a little 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:51.939
 also watching a little 

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:56.299
 more or less 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.089
 as you see 

00:03:58.089 --> 00:04:01.249
 that there is this effect 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:04.249
 we could give the final touches 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.809
 around here we will change 15 the white egypt 

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:11.799
 it will be a little bit more 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:13.839
 it costs a little less 

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:16.489
 even 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.749
 and already had a flaw 

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:21.609
 project to give you the last 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.609
 passed by 24 

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:31.999
 for example French both art and trial goalie 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.270
 but that looks more or less 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.349
 that effect 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:40.289
 d 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:41.809
 and finally 

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:44.909
 we could add firewood 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:48.340
 to this mask and layer 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.430
 center 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.669
 we would go to nobody filters 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:54.639
 and we would make him ap 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.610
 like that we have enough both marinas 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.009
 Size of the band puts a little less 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.009
 and size of the band - environment 20s 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.759
 as you see, a little bit has changed 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:10.759
 and we would have the effects of the submerged 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.870
 and even here they want to forget their young in our channel to 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.319
 more tutorials and if they have any request I'm loyal about something is 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:20.610
 last week 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.860
 of photoshop or some other program should not tell us what 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.270
 and see you soon
