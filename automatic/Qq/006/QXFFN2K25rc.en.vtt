below<00:01:38.799> the<00:01:39.100> custom<00:01:39.549> and<00:01:40.920> we<00:01:41.920> did<00:01:42.130> started

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
making the metro network from there

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.690 
making the metro network from there
because<00:01:47.830> we<00:01:47.950> wanted<00:01:48.220> something<00:01:48.990> fast<00:01:49.990> for<00:01:50.350> our

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
because we wanted something fast for our

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.280 
because we wanted something fast for our
transportations<00:01:51.700> and<00:01:54.180> if<00:01:55.180> you<00:01:55.450> just<00:01:55.780> arrived

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
transportations and if you just arrived

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.950 
transportations and if you just arrived
there<00:01:56.590> it<00:01:56.890> takes<00:01:57.130> like<00:01:57.430> one<00:01:57.970> minute<00:01:58.240> to<00:01:58.810> get

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
there it takes like one minute to get

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.330 
there it takes like one minute to get
there<00:01:59.670> but<00:02:00.670> it's<00:02:00.880> pretty<00:02:01.479> far<00:02:02.009> also<00:02:03.009> have<00:02:03.190> to

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
there but it's pretty far also have to

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.419 
there but it's pretty far also have to
mention<00:02:03.630> yeah<00:02:04.630> but<00:02:04.899> we<00:02:05.080> need<00:02:05.740> all<00:02:06.039> this<00:02:06.190> with

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
mention yeah but we need all this with

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:11.850 
mention yeah but we need all this with
DNT<00:02:07.410> because<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:10.119> would<00:02:10.470> have<00:02:11.470> been<00:02:11.650> pretty

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
DNT because it would have been pretty

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.070 
DNT because it would have been pretty
hard<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:12.519> do<00:02:12.700> it<00:02:13.769> normal<00:02:14.769> normal<00:02:15.130> mining

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
hard to do it normal normal mining

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.130 
hard to do it normal normal mining
that's<00:02:17.080> true<00:02:17.430> so<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:19.209> market<00:02:19.540> will<00:02:19.720> continue

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
that's true so the market will continue

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.290 
that's true so the market will continue
doing<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:20.500> circle<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.459> will<00:02:21.760> say<00:02:21.970> go<00:02:22.030> through

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
doing a circle it will say go through

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.080 
doing a circle it will say go through
the<00:02:22.420> last<00:02:22.690> station<00:02:23.019> and<00:02:23.610> after<00:02:24.610> sometime<00:02:24.880> it

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
the last station and after sometime it

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.280 
the last station and after sometime it
will<00:02:25.330> come<00:02:25.600> over<00:02:25.840> here

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.270
