00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.520
 There is a new rubric in the neo magazine 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:06.560
 By the way, Mr staeck of the week is that 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.330
 Now I shit like to start today 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.519
 at irregular intervals people 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.370
 honor the things you just pull through 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.650
 although everybody let him say that 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.660
 people with tunnel vision stay better 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.790
 simply committed contestants for the good 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:24.070
 these brave ones have these silent heroes 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.070
 a big heart and above all they have 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.770
 and today campino singer sang the 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.080
 legendary düsseldorfer punkband die 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.150
 dead pants like real punker 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.150
 you are only interested in being one 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.890
 to help people in africa and who 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.830
 knows better how to help africa 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.410
 as you and a white 32 million pounds 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:54.020
 serious one hit wonder popstar named 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.090
 Bob Geldof Of course there are always a few 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.150
 crazy cold-hearted know-it-alls 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.949
 they say that's it already 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.330
 not quite clear who is here for a long time 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.729
 actually, to whom more attention 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.460
 helps bob geldof africa or africa 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.500
 bob geldorf but campino that's you 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.690
 Shit if you say his opinion 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.210
 the British do not shut up you have 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.229
 do not be afraid even before bola and first 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.520
 not really from bob geldof 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.600
 publicly attached to the pranger 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.260
 be because you have no bock 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.080
 join 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.240
 Africa is in the midst of a short-term need 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.280
 christmas our help and at the time 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.950
 especially money for the fight against ebola 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.770
 maybe as much as 215 million 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.990
 but still prefer 834 million euros 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.240
 but how should a simple düsseldorfer 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.880
 punker as you campino come to money 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.860
 you would just have to be okay then older ones 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.480
 brother michael can call because of 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.680
 insolvency administrator of the lehman brothers 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.210
 and has committed his firm 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.600
 get a fee that somewhere between 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.150
 215 million and 834 million euros 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.500
 But why is the family pumping 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.570
 just before christmas if you 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.950
 campino can do something for yourself 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.000
 Humanity is much more valuable than 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.530
 money artistic commitment and therefore 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.700
 Do you have a few friendly musicians? 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.580

 [Music] 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.640

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.010
 can use 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.000
 These are not all the stars only 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.040
 join in because the record company 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.940
 universal music end reaction stands and 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.069
 Make a flat contract with universal 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.140
 Music is what these stars are all about 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.209
 really just about africa for example jan 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.200
 Joseph is always there 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.700
 if he can help 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.680
 this is not about his ego that is 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.690
 disinterested has civil courage and 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:51.180
 he has courageous before he is 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:56.450
 got up and said where always 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:59.069
 back ferrero I always think about that 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.230
 fair production conditions if cacau 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.519
 comes from west africa and he will have him 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.650

 aerotec found out how many products 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.459
 by ferrero are really fair or crew 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:15.410
 Great finally one of the band aid 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.410
 30 projects face also gives 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.960
 also the camp for a long time 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.800
 together with the world's most important 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.780
 animal and environmental protection organizations 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.430
 against the hunger in the world I had 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.380
 my question in one plus one same 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.780
 So two is a coke light and one 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:33.040
 snack rap more deserved for two Euro 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.330
 there actually more gained 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.950
 I still have something to it and since last 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.880
 friday offer campino is the song 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.160
 then outside and that's natural 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.410
 shit no matter how the people find the 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.660
 because it is about africa and against ebola 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.010
 and, of course, people should listen to the song 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.160
 buy then it is actually okay 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.710
 not to load the song on the plate 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.050
 you go down if you are the song acts 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.760
 or not is secondarily clear 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.560
 of course they are asking themselves again 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.260
 cynical hater if it is not for the 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.610
 song goes why do you do it then why 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.440
 don't donate money for africa 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.670
 just so with it an ebola patient what 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.360
 Delicious food is enough yes 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.030
 already two euros 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.540

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.090

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.550
 would the people of west africa 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:22.870
 even to the price of the would 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:24.190
 people in west africa on facebook 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.540

 People in West Africa are so shocked 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.670
 They were only 20 hours behind 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.770
 Publishing the song no different 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.750

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.240
 plane to rise just because 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.210
 It must be four days short break in new 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.210
 to make york 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.770

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.910
 climate damage senseless air travel 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.080
 German comedy actor actor 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.840
 to draw attention also ultimately 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.639
 of course, your deserving campino you have 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.729

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:58.560
 good thing and for transparency 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.000
 donate to the band project so land

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.870
 Syrian refugee choir 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.880
 average zdf cabaret audience 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.250
 to tears can stir but what in the end 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.139
 really important is what people are into 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.570
 Keep West Africa from your project 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.009
 because they have to be lucky 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.060
 the people of west africa are talking about it 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:31.620
 Do not worry if 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.050
 people from Ivory Coast or from 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.490

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.500
 tried it because we did not do it ourselves 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.770
 then they could only believe that 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.380
 here is the video from the user 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.270
