00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
split open sometimes as well I'm a

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.479 
split open sometimes as well I'm a
strike<00:01:02.140> this<00:01:03.140> whole<00:01:03.440> door<00:01:03.800> will<00:01:04.040> be<00:01:04.070> kicked

strike this whole door will be kicked

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.180 
strike this whole door will be kicked
open<00:01:04.699> so<00:01:05.449> this<00:01:05.869> one's<00:01:06.079> at<00:01:06.229> least<00:01:06.409> okay<00:01:06.860> it<00:01:07.010> has

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
open so this one's at least okay it has

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.010 
open so this one's at least okay it has
the<00:01:07.460> three<00:01:08.000> inch<00:01:08.210> screws<00:01:08.479> in<00:01:08.630> there<00:01:08.750> so<00:01:08.870> that's

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
the three inch screws in there so that's

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.020 
the three inch screws in there so that's
good<00:01:09.170> but<00:01:09.380> if<00:01:09.830> you<00:01:09.920> look<00:01:10.070> at<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:10.280> hole<00:01:10.490> they

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
good but if you look at the hole they

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.460 
good but if you look at the hole they
haven't<00:01:11.270> even<00:01:11.420> drilled<00:01:11.690> it<00:01:11.840> in<00:01:11.960> one<00:01:12.110> inch<00:01:12.320> so

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
haven't even drilled it in one inch so

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.719 
haven't even drilled it in one inch so
this<00:01:12.590> door<00:01:12.890> has<00:01:13.040> never<00:01:13.280> locked<00:01:13.550> properly

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
this door has never locked properly

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.420 
this door has never locked properly
anyways<00:01:14.330> it's<00:01:14.900> a<00:01:15.110> poor<00:01:15.500> install<00:01:15.890> from<00:01:16.100> before

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
anyways it's a poor install from before

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.190 
anyways it's a poor install from before
so<00:01:16.820> we'll<00:01:16.909> put<00:01:17.090> on<00:01:17.180> a<00:01:17.210> strike<00:01:17.540> plate<00:01:17.780> on<00:01:17.930> here

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
so we'll put on a strike plate on here

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.460 
so we'll put on a strike plate on here
this<00:01:19.070> is<00:01:19.190> the<00:01:19.310> door<00:01:19.520> reinforcer<00:01:20.240> or<00:01:20.540> magnet

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
this is the door reinforcer or magnet

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.219 
this is the door reinforcer or magnet
late<00:01:21.680> it<00:01:22.549> makes<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:23.000> guard<00:01:23.270> harder<00:01:23.930> to<00:01:24.049> kick

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
late it makes the guard harder to kick

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.140 
late it makes the guard harder to kick
in<00:01:24.440> so<00:01:24.920> when<00:01:25.070> you<00:01:25.130> saw<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.400> metal<00:01:25.670> edges<00:01:26.030> of

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
in so when you saw the metal edges of

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.260 
in so when you saw the metal edges of
the<00:01:26.240> wood<00:01:26.450> this<00:01:26.960> will<00:01:27.170> fit<00:01:27.470> on<00:01:27.680> the<00:01:28.310> door<00:01:28.549> and

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
the wood this will fit on the door and

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.510 
the wood this will fit on the door and
he'll<00:01:29.900> make<00:01:30.080> it<00:01:30.229> harder<00:01:30.590> to<00:01:30.620> for<00:01:31.159> the<00:01:31.250> door<00:01:31.490> to

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
he'll make it harder to for the door to

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.000 
he'll make it harder to for the door to
split<00:01:32.030> when<00:01:32.900> somebody<00:01:33.229> tries<00:01:33.409> to<00:01:33.440> kick<00:01:33.740> it<00:01:33.860> in

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
split when somebody tries to kick it in

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.100 
split when somebody tries to kick it in
it<00:01:34.159> also<00:01:34.700> offers<00:01:35.150> some<00:01:35.180> protection<00:01:35.810> against

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
it also offers some protection against

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.160 
it also offers some protection against
icepick<00:01:36.500> attack<00:01:36.860> so<00:01:37.460> again<00:01:37.820> this<00:01:38.150> this<00:01:38.930> lock

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
icepick attack so again this this lock

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.280 
icepick attack so again this this lock
this<00:01:39.500> will

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
this will

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.110 
this will
they<00:01:40.800> say<00:01:41.010> it<00:01:41.100> doubles<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.520> strength<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:42.030> the

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
they say it doubles the strength of the

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.750 
they say it doubles the strength of the
door<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.990> just<00:01:43.590> makes<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.860> harder<00:01:44.190> to<00:01:44.220> kick<00:01:44.580> in

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
door so just makes it harder to kick in

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.430 
door so just makes it harder to kick in
and<00:01:44.970> for<00:01:45.090> these<00:01:45.180> doors<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.540> spread<00:01:45.960> okay<00:01:46.290> we're

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
and for these doors to spread okay we're

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.900 
and for these doors to spread okay we're
going<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.590> install<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.010> door<00:01:47.220> reinforcer

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
going to install the door reinforcer

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.950 
going to install the door reinforcer
