00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
you can wash it very easily

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.690 
you can wash it very easily
the<00:00:35.730> way<00:00:36.090> we're<00:00:36.329> going<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.540> do<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.870> today<00:00:37.050> is

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
the way we're going to do it today is

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.490 
the way we're going to do it today is
using<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.940> measuring<00:00:39.480> cup<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:39.989> comes<00:00:40.230> with

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
using the measuring cup that comes with

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.819 
using the measuring cup that comes with
your<00:00:40.969> rice<00:00:41.969> cooker<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.750> want<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.710> make

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
your rice cooker and you want to make

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.910 
your rice cooker and you want to make
sure<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.219> use<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.910> because<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.899> cups<00:00:46.410> what

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
sure you use this because the cups what

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.700 
sure you use this because the cups what
they<00:00:47.129> refer<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.239> directions<00:00:48.570> it's<00:00:49.379> not

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
they refer to in the directions it's not

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.729 
they refer to in the directions it's not
the<00:00:50.039> same<00:00:50.309> size<00:00:50.640> as<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.199> traditional<00:00:52.199> cup

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
the same size as a traditional cup

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.819 
the same size as a traditional cup
measurement<00:00:53.340> like<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.489> dry<00:00:53.820> measuring

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
measurement like a dry measuring

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:56.479 
measurement like a dry measuring
measurement<00:00:55.829> it's<00:00:55.920> actually<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.250> little<00:00:56.399> bit

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
measurement it's actually a little bit

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.340 
measurement it's actually a little bit
smaller<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.420> want<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.629> make<00:00:57.719> sure<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:58.079> use

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
smaller so you want to make sure you use

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.130 
smaller so you want to make sure you use
this<00:00:58.680> particular<00:00:59.539> measuring<00:01:00.539> tool<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.930> came

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
this particular measuring tool that came

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.260 
this particular measuring tool that came
with<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.789> get<00:01:02.940> accurate

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
with it so that you get accurate

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.260 
with it so that you get accurate
measurements<00:01:04.460> and<00:01:05.460> then<00:01:05.580> everything<00:01:06.030> comes

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
measurements and then everything comes

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.399 
measurements and then everything comes
out<00:01:06.479> right<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:07.619> I'm<00:01:07.890> going<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.400> do<00:01:09.020> three<00:01:10.020> cups

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
out right so I'm going to do three cups

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.310 
out right so I'm going to do three cups
of<00:01:10.560> rice<00:01:10.770> today<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.939> basically<00:01:12.810> I'm<00:01:13.110> just

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
of rice today so basically I'm just

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.060 
of rice today so basically I'm just
going<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.680> scoop<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:15.409> you<00:01:16.409> want<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.950> make<00:01:17.040> sure

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
going to scoop and you want to make sure

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.340 
going to scoop and you want to make sure
you<00:01:17.369> get<00:01:17.520> just<00:01:18.210> even<00:01:18.540> scoops<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:19.020> don't<00:01:19.200> want

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
you get just even scoops you don't want

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.280 
you get just even scoops you don't want
to<00:01:19.439> overfill<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.729> there's<00:01:21.090> my<00:01:21.330> one<00:01:21.570> cup<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.080> put

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
to overfill so there's my one cup I put

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.910 
to overfill so there's my one cup I put
it<00:01:22.409> into<00:01:22.890> my<00:01:23.250> rice<00:01:23.909> cooker<00:01:24.409> going<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.500> take<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
it into my rice cooker going to take the

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:35.120 
it into my rice cooker going to take the
second<00:01:26.549> cup<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:29.850> then<00:01:30.920> my<00:01:31.920> third<00:01:31.950> cup<00:01:34.130> now

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
second cup and then my third cup now

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.749 
second cup and then my third cup now
there's<00:01:35.490> two<00:01:35.820> ways<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:36.420> adding<00:01:36.840> water<00:01:37.439> if<00:01:37.979> you

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
there's two ways of adding water if you

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.800 
there's two ways of adding water if you
take<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.210> look<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.920> rice<00:01:41.490> cooker<00:01:41.939> itself<00:01:42.450> it

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
take a look in the rice cooker itself it

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.280 
take a look in the rice cooker itself it
actually<00:01:42.920> has<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.340> water<00:01:44.820> line<00:01:45.210> marks<00:01:45.810> on<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
actually has a water line marks on the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.350 
actually has a water line marks on the
side<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.430> can<00:01:47.640> fill<00:01:47.909> up<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.149> water

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
side that you can fill up the water

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.330 
side that you can fill up the water
until<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.960> gets<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.290> part<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.829> need<00:01:50.070> I

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
until it gets to the part you need I

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.999 
until it gets to the part you need I
find<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.479> little<00:01:51.600> bit<00:01:51.810> difficult<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.590> do<00:01:52.860> it

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
find it a little bit difficult to do it

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.460 
find it a little bit difficult to do it
that<00:01:53.189> way<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.729> prefer<00:01:54.299> just<00:01:54.479> using<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.229> cup

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
that way I prefer just using the cup

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.889 
that way I prefer just using the cup
again<00:01:55.880> so<00:01:56.930> basically<00:01:57.930> for<00:01:58.229> every<00:01:58.350> one<00:01:58.890> cup<00:01:59.310> of

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
again so basically for every one cup of

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.639 
again so basically for every one cup of
rice<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.350> put<00:02:01.590> in<00:02:01.710> there<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.549> need<00:02:03.649> the

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
rice that you put in there you need the

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.240 
rice that you put in there you need the
same<00:02:04.950> amount<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.880> water<00:02:06.570> plus<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.590> half<00:02:07.890> cup

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
same amount of water plus a half cup

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.760 
same amount of water plus a half cup

50<00:03:24.720> minutes<00:03:25.050> so<00:03:25.290> we'll<00:03:26.010> check<00:03:26.190> back<00:03:26.250> on<00:03:26.670> it

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
50 minutes so we'll check back on it

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.460
