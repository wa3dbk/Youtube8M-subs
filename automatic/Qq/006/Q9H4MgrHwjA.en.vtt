 feels doing anerra wants to end 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:36.180
 life is suicidal and because you are for 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:42.780

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.739
 climb up 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.580
 I want to find things, but I don't know how to 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.360
 them to get 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.850
 fan training or that it doesn't even 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:16.739
 I know that but still I often jump 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:19.850
 even the pokemon itself no I don't 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:26.340

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:34.320
 krutyak some we leave we leave it strongly 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:39.120
 big me so so do nothing 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.730
 we will explore the area here 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:46.070
 located 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:51.260
 trash floor this building we have nothing I 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:55.760
 so what is it like usually everyones 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.760
 cilia here is such a fox. 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:09.019
 so the bike is fun here these things 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:14.389
 Only how to climb, I finally can not understand 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:14.389
 maybe somehow you need to fill up 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:32.470
 mana and caution 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:40.110
 so how can you climb so need so 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:43.620
 so incomprehensible how to climb here but 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:51.530
 headquarters so no we probably won't come here 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:51.530
 We climb and what is there, too, nothing is interesting 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:05.940
 what is this which which is how is it 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:13.710
 vestry where this staircase saw your 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:18.500
 man are n't you a strange man stuck like 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.500

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:27.450
 marked climbed and what is there with mash here 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.050
 some 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:35.700
 oh this cement is a bullshit that works 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:37.970
 and if we do not fall there is nothing 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.970
 will be 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:48.410
 failed and that is understandable so incomprehensible 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.900
 Now I will explore all the same 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:53.490

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:10.650
 collect then they die that such 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:15.780
