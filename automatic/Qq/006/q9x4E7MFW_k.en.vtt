00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.459
 Mr. Jesus, do not take our 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.340
 sins but the faith of your people and 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:18.650
 according to your word grants peace and 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.900
 the unit 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:26.650
 to you who live queens and love us for 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.650
 the centuries of the centuries 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.489
 how many people live in life then 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.500
 there is not a census yet 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.770
 appear on the nicolÃ¡s map to exit 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.140
 from the council of foundations the people who 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.430
 live now here are the ones who first go to 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.890
 occupy departments when you 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.140
 they build neither of the construction company 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.180
 in the municipality is a social worker 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.180
 how old is the house here 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.910
 among them they can not count more than 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.010
 10 years 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.110
 and illegally occupying a work that 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.640
 no government ended if we do not want 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:14.810
 we go through what we have to do 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:16.880
 something since frustration what he wants 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.820
 is that we support a violent take 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.640
 and with that I can not get you out with tam is 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.470
 crazy to think and what is 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.760
 it's our priest's job what 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.900
 enter more accomplices do not do the 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.020
 You know very well what I'm doing 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.020
 talking 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.350
 and are able to be transparent of 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.350
 this parish 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.540
 We never went there, not somewhere else 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.369
 a priest does not negotiate with 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.570
 narcotics traffickers one has been 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.400
 deflected 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.380
 but we take prejudice in the task 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.950
 It is much more important than all 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.950
 other points 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.460
 we can not be just priests 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.390
 you do not think that it 's easy for me to come 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.660
 here every day you have ideas 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.620
 if not there is the house 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.620
 but but only 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.760
 the violence of yesterday is not the same as 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:27.099
 Today's 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.099
 but our love is the same
