00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
three breaks so you know we bar and it's

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.000 
three breaks so you know we bar and it's

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
else to do it you know it's kind of how

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.300 
else to do it you know it's kind of how
we<00:04:35.550> figured<00:04:36.110> we<00:04:37.110> also<00:04:37.260> made<00:04:37.800> the<00:04:37.919> cake<00:04:38.100> you

next<00:04:48.630> is<00:04:48.840> just<00:04:49.680> finishing<00:04:50.010> the<00:04:50.070> fabrication

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
next is just finishing the fabrication

we<00:04:51.630> we<00:04:52.110> ran<00:04:52.289> the<00:04:52.410> car<00:04:52.590> really<00:04:52.919> low<00:04:53.070> this<00:04:53.250> year

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
we we ran the car really low this year

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.370 
we we ran the car really low this year
but<00:04:53.669> not<00:04:53.880> what<00:04:54.780> why<00:04:54.960> should<00:04:55.139> I<00:04:55.199> actually

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
but not what why should I actually

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.219 
but not what why should I actually
recommend<00:04:55.860> you<00:04:55.979> run<00:04:56.099> it<00:04:56.660> which<00:04:57.660> means<00:04:57.990> that<00:04:58.139> we

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
recommend you run it which means that we

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:00.260 
recommend you run it which means that we
didn't<00:04:58.410> get<00:04:58.500> into<00:04:58.680> backs<00:04:58.889> of<00:04:59.039> mangle<00:04:59.340> we<00:05:00.150> have

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
didn't get into backs of mangle we have

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.360 
didn't get into backs of mangle we have
to<00:05:00.360> quantify<00:05:00.570> our<00:05:00.840> intrusion<00:05:01.139> bars<00:05:01.470> actually

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
to quantify our intrusion bars actually

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.820 
to quantify our intrusion bars actually
change<00:05:02.849> them<00:05:03.000> completely<00:05:03.330> and<00:05:04.139> bash<00:05:04.380> out<00:05:04.650> the

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
change them completely and bash out the

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.770 
change them completely and bash out the
wheel<00:05:05.010> well<00:05:05.220> more<00:05:05.490> so<00:05:05.970> we<00:05:06.060> can<00:05:06.180> get<00:05:06.240> more<00:05:06.449> angle

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
wheel well more so we can get more angle

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.600 
wheel well more so we can get more angle
we're<00:05:07.470> also<00:05:07.590> gonna<00:05:07.770> change<00:05:08.010> the<00:05:08.130> rear<00:05:08.340> end<00:05:08.490> of

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
we're also gonna change the rear end of

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.969 
we're also gonna change the rear end of
the<00:05:08.699> car<00:05:08.880> moving<00:05:09.810> the<00:05:09.900> radiator<00:05:10.530> for<00:05:10.740> about

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
the car moving the radiator for about

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.540 
the car moving the radiator for about
five<00:05:11.250> inches<00:05:11.720> and<00:05:12.720> just<00:05:13.620> finish<00:05:14.340> up<00:05:14.430> the

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
five inches and just finish up the

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.310 
five inches and just finish up the
fabrication<00:05:15.090> then<00:05:15.330> fit<00:05:15.510> the<00:05:15.599> body<00:05:15.780> panels<00:05:16.139> and

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
fabrication then fit the body panels and

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.200 
fabrication then fit the body panels and
get<00:05:17.099> it<00:05:17.220> ready<00:05:17.370> to<00:05:17.430> put<00:05:17.610> everything<00:05:18.030> back

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
get it ready to put everything back

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.029 
get it ready to put everything back
together<00:05:18.419> so<00:05:19.020> all<00:05:19.199> the<00:05:19.289> fat<00:05:19.470> work<00:05:19.710> is<00:05:19.860> going<00:05:19.979> to

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 
together so all the fat work is going to

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:21.710 
together so all the fat work is going to
be<00:05:20.099> done<00:05:20.310> in<00:05:20.400> the<00:05:20.460> next<00:05:20.550> couple<00:05:20.760> weeks<00:05:20.880> then

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
be done in the next couple weeks then

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.839 
be done in the next couple weeks then
we'll<00:05:21.840> put<00:05:21.960> the<00:05:22.050> engine<00:05:22.340> the<00:05:23.340> suspension<00:05:23.400> back

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:23.849 
we'll put the engine the suspension back

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:25.460 
we'll put the engine the suspension back
on<00:05:24.060> it<00:05:24.210> and<00:05:24.419> just<00:05:24.479> fit<00:05:24.900> everything<00:05:25.020> make<00:05:25.440> sure

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
on it and just fit everything make sure

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.179 
on it and just fit everything make sure
that<00:05:25.770> the<00:05:25.889> clearances<00:05:26.310> are<00:05:26.430> good<00:05:26.610> and<00:05:27.000> go

00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:28.189 
that the clearances are good and go

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:31.119 
that the clearances are good and go
and<00:05:28.580> then<00:05:28.969> once<00:05:29.150> that's<00:05:29.300> finishes<00:05:30.439> we'll<00:05:30.949> go

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:31.129 
and then once that's finishes we'll go

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:35.379 
and then once that's finishes we'll go
dude<00:05:31.490> I<00:05:31.639> know<00:05:32.499> engine<00:05:33.499> all<00:05:33.619> working<00:05:34.550> well<00:05:34.729> then
