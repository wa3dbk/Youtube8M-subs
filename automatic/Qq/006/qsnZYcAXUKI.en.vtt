it<00:00:28.830> will<00:00:29.039> not<00:00:29.310> be<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.580> straight<00:00:29.970> line<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.539> the

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
it will not be a straight line to the

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.680 
it will not be a straight line to the
leak<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:31.590> will<00:00:31.769> be<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.920> circuitous<00:00:32.460> route<00:00:32.880> it'll

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
leak it will be a circuitous route it'll

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.090 
leak it will be a circuitous route it'll
be<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.840> route<00:00:34.110> where<00:00:34.320> there'll<00:00:34.500> be<00:00:34.530> bumps<00:00:34.950> and

bruises<00:00:35.219> along<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.820> way<00:00:36.120> but<00:00:36.899> if<00:00:37.050> they're

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
bruises along the way but if they're

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.560 
bruises along the way but if they're
willing<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.920> make<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.309> effort<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.820> think

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570

hard every single time he follows every

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.710 
hard every single time he follows every
time<00:01:16.770> he<00:01:17.549> commits<00:01:17.880> he'd<00:01:18.150> probably<00:01:18.390> be<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.630> a

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
time he commits he'd probably be in a

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.910 
time he commits he'd probably be in a
game<00:01:18.900> for<00:01:19.049> three<00:01:19.259> minutes<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.560> have<00:01:19.740> eight

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
and that kind of a guy as an energy guy

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.630 
and that kind of a guy as an energy guy
might<00:01:28.409> have<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.619> chance<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.189> leak<00:01:29.430> down
