care intel inside go figure oh it looks
to<00:05:04.449> be<00:05:04.479> a<00:05:05.849> little<00:05:07.650> thing<00:05:08.650> here<00:05:08.949> that<00:05:09.009> push<00:05:09.460> down

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
to be a little thing here that push down

to be a little thing here that push down
on<00:05:11.970> you<00:05:12.970> want<00:05:13.240> to<00:05:13.330> get<00:05:13.479> this<00:05:13.660> to<00:05:13.870> snap<00:05:14.110> on<00:05:17.070> mmm

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
on you want to get this to snap on mmm

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.760 
on you want to get this to snap on mmm
this<00:05:18.520> is<00:05:18.789> to<00:05:18.970> be<00:05:19.060> too<00:05:19.690> complicated<00:05:20.139> for<00:05:20.500> me

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
this is to be too complicated for me

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.629 
this is to be too complicated for me
have<00:05:21.639> to<00:05:21.820> figure<00:05:22.030> out<00:05:22.120> later<00:05:23.639> probably

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 
have to figure out later probably

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:25.740 
have to figure out later probably
something<00:05:24.789> simple<00:05:25.060> that<00:05:25.240> I'm<00:05:25.389> overlooking

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
something simple that I'm overlooking

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.990 
something simple that I'm overlooking
because<00:05:26.259> it's<00:05:26.590> upside<00:05:26.949> down<00:05:26.979> in<00:05:27.460> its

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
because it's upside down in its

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.480 
because it's upside down in its
orientation<00:05:28.539> from<00:05:28.840> me<00:05:29.190> I'm<00:05:30.190> going<00:05:30.280> to<00:05:30.340> go

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
orientation from me I'm going to go

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.550 
orientation from me I'm going to go
ahead<00:05:30.520> and<00:05:30.699> close<00:05:30.970> this<00:05:31.000> back<00:05:31.330> up<00:05:31.360> and<00:05:32.169> i'll

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
ahead and close this back up and i'll

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:46.290 
ahead and close this back up and i'll
install<00:05:32.949> it<00:05:33.099> battering<00:05:44.789> that<00:05:45.789> part<00:05:46.030> is<00:05:46.150> pretty

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
install it battering that part is pretty

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.510 
install it battering that part is pretty
simple<00:05:46.659> this<00:05:47.020> locking<00:05:47.470> mechanism<00:05:50.190> is<00:05:51.190> quick

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
simple this locking mechanism is quick

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:59.010 
simple this locking mechanism is quick
to<00:05:51.550> use<00:05:53.370> and<00:05:54.750> i'll<00:05:55.750> pass<00:05:56.020> up<00:05:57.690> looks<00:05:58.690> like<00:05:58.840> it's

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
to use and i'll pass up looks like it's

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.570 
to use and i'll pass up looks like it's
already<00:05:59.289> been<00:05:59.530> powered<00:05:59.860> up<00:06:00.659> within<00:06:01.659> seconds

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
already been powered up within seconds

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:17.240 
already been powered up within seconds
it<00:06:03.580> has<00:06:03.759> come<00:06:04.120> to<00:06:04.300> life<00:06:15.000> it<00:06:16.000> was<00:06:16.150> pretty<00:06:16.330> nice

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
it has come to life it was pretty nice

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.420 
it has come to life it was pretty nice
i'll<00:06:18.250> go<00:06:18.430> ahead<00:06:18.460> and<00:06:18.669> log<00:06:19.630> into<00:06:19.870> it<00:06:20.050> oh<00:06:20.430> and

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430 
i'll go ahead and log into it oh and

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.909 
i'll go ahead and log into it oh and
regarding<00:06:22.180> this<00:06:22.270> X<00:06:22.539> need<00:06:22.750> to<00:06:22.990> need<00:06:23.259> to<00:06:23.289> push<00:06:23.680> in

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 
regarding this X need to need to push in

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:29.399 
regarding this X need to need to push in
a<00:06:23.949> little<00:06:24.070> bit<00:06:24.430> and<00:06:24.639> turn<00:06:27.000> so<00:06:28.000> that<00:06:28.240> was<00:06:28.449> fairly

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:29.409 
a little bit and turn so that was fairly

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:32.110 
a little bit and turn so that was fairly
painless

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.550 

and<00:06:33.120> I<00:06:33.810> log<00:06:34.020> into<00:06:34.230> it<00:06:34.500> momentarily<00:06:36.350> it<00:06:37.350> looks

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
and I log into it momentarily it looks

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.970 
and I log into it momentarily it looks
like<00:06:37.760> all<00:06:38.760> we<00:06:38.940> needed<00:06:39.120> to<00:06:39.240> do<00:06:39.450> was<00:06:39.720> it<00:06:40.440> detected

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:40.980 
like all we needed to do was it detected

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.950 
like all we needed to do was it detected
my<00:06:41.130> wireless<00:06:41.400> network<00:06:41.880> so<00:06:42.120> I<00:06:42.150> connected<00:06:42.660> to<00:06:42.810> it

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
my wireless network so I connected to it

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.400 
my wireless network so I connected to it
and<00:06:43.350> then<00:06:43.890> the<00:06:44.310> next<00:06:44.460> prompt<00:06:44.970> was<00:06:45.180> a<00:06:45.480> request

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:46.410 
and then the next prompt was a request

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:49.490 
and then the next prompt was a request
for<00:06:46.980> me<00:06:47.130> to<00:06:47.160> agree<00:06:47.550> to<00:06:47.670> terms<00:06:48.170> of<00:06:49.170> our

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500 
for me to agree to terms of our

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.000 
for me to agree to terms of our
agreement<00:06:50.120> which<00:06:51.120> I<00:06:51.270> did<00:06:51.480> and<00:06:51.660> then<00:06:51.980> the<00:06:52.980> next

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.010 
agreement which I did and then the next

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.440 
agreement which I did and then the next
step<00:06:54.350> it<00:06:55.350> automatically<00:06:56.040> took<00:06:56.310> was<00:06:56.700> to<00:06:57.030> start

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:57.450 
step it automatically took was to start

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.020 
step it automatically took was to start
updating<00:06:57.720> so<00:06:58.590> what<00:06:59.010> is<00:06:59.370> going<00:06:59.670> on<00:06:59.760> right<00:06:59.820> now

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.030 
updating so what is going on right now

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.590 
updating so what is going on right now
which<00:07:00.480> you<00:07:00.720> may<00:07:00.930> not<00:07:00.990> be<00:07:01.230> able<00:07:01.260> to<00:07:01.500> I<00:07:02.600> can't

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:03.600 
which you may not be able to I can't

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.890 
which you may not be able to I can't
really<00:07:03.690> see<00:07:04.110> is<00:07:05.270> it's<00:07:06.270> going<00:07:06.600> through<00:07:06.780> the

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:06.900 
really see is it's going through the

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.840 
really see is it's going through the
update<00:07:07.200> process<00:07:07.380> right<00:07:07.950> now<00:07:07.980> let<00:07:08.400> me<00:07:08.430> see<00:07:08.670> if<00:07:08.760> I

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:08.850 
update process right now let me see if I

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:21.230 
update process right now let me see if I
can<00:07:09.030> zoom<00:07:09.300> in

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.240 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.210 

so<00:07:22.240> chrome<00:07:22.600> is<00:07:22.630> updating<00:07:23.230> automatically<00:07:23.830> this

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:24.220 
so chrome is updating automatically this

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.340 
so chrome is updating automatically this
is<00:07:24.400> not<00:07:24.580> a<00:07:24.610> terribly<00:07:25.060> exciting<00:07:25.690> portion<00:07:26.200> of

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:26.350 
is not a terribly exciting portion of

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.730 
is not a terribly exciting portion of
this<00:07:26.470> video<00:07:27.810> but<00:07:28.810> nonetheless<00:07:29.230> it's

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:29.740 
this video but nonetheless it's

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.920 
this video but nonetheless it's
something<00:07:30.100> needs<00:07:30.340> to<00:07:30.460> be<00:07:30.490> done<00:07:30.610> and<00:07:31.090> at<00:07:31.690> some

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:31.930 
something needs to be done and at some

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.850 
something needs to be done and at some
point<00:07:32.200> shortly<00:07:32.500> I<00:07:32.890> will<00:07:32.920> actually<00:07:33.220> insert<00:07:33.760> my

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:34.860 
point shortly I will actually insert my

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.990 
point shortly I will actually insert my
google<00:07:35.860> based<00:07:36.280> login<00:07:36.910> credentials<00:07:37.390> and

google based login credentials and

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.060 
google based login credentials and
continue<00:07:40.000> to<00:07:40.030> login<00:07:40.270> so<00:07:41.020> this<00:07:41.860> is<00:07:41.890> a
