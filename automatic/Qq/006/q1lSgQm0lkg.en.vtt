pretty high damage pretty high range and
a<00:00:41.309> medium<00:00:42.270> fire<00:00:42.510> rate<00:00:43.070> now<00:00:44.070> let's<00:00:44.610> take<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.820> look

at<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.960> actual<00:00:46.379> stats<00:00:46.800> for<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.070> ak-47

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
at the actual stats for the ak-47

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.200 
at the actual stats for the ak-47
alright<00:00:50.010> here's<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.430> actual<00:00:50.550> sets<00:00:51.000> for<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
alright here's the actual sets for the

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.160 
alright here's the actual sets for the
ak-47<00:00:52.170> alright<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.460> my<00:00:54.360> thoughts<00:00:54.870> are<00:00:55.140> that

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
ak-47 alright so my thoughts are that

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.470 
ak-47 alright so my thoughts are that
with<00:00:55.710> stopping<00:00:56.129> power<00:00:56.430> or<00:00:56.699> without<00:00:56.969> stopping

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
with stopping power or without stopping

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.180 
with stopping power or without stopping
power<00:00:57.660> it's<00:00:58.350> more<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.859> choice<00:00:59.039> of

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
power it's more of a choice of

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.349 
power it's more of a choice of
preference<00:00:59.750> it<00:01:00.750> does<00:01:01.609> like<00:01:02.609> speed<00:01:02.940> up<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
preference it does like speed up the

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.850 
preference it does like speed up the
time<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.690> takes<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.989> kill<00:01:04.170> someone<00:01:04.530> but<00:01:04.799> not

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
time it takes to kill someone but not

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.630 
time it takes to kill someone but not
very<00:01:05.489> remarkably<00:01:06.799> with<00:01:07.799> stopping<00:01:08.100> power<00:01:08.369> this

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
very remarkably with stopping power this

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.320 
very remarkably with stopping power this
gun<00:01:08.880> does<00:01:09.150> about<00:01:09.510> 56<00:01:10.229> damage<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.740> bullet<00:01:11.330> for

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
gun does about 56 damage a bullet for

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.210 
gun does about 56 damage a bullet for
short<00:01:12.570> medium<00:01:12.840> range<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.770> equals<00:01:13.890> out<00:01:14.189> to

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
short medium range so that equals out to

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.859 
short medium range so that equals out to
about<00:01:14.430> two<00:01:14.729> shots<00:01:14.970> are<00:01:15.150> kill<00:01:15.330> because<00:01:15.659> it

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
about two shots are kill because it

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.830 
about two shots are kill because it
person<00:01:16.110> has<00:01:16.259> 100<00:01:16.710> hip<00:01:16.860> points<00:01:17.479> in<00:01:18.479> long-range

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
person has 100 hip points in long-range

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.289 
person has 100 hip points in long-range
it<00:01:19.320> does<00:01:19.470> about<00:01:19.590> 42<00:01:20.250> damage<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:21.000> that's<00:01:21.180> about

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
it does about 42 damage so that's about

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.080 
it does about 42 damage so that's about
three<00:01:21.750> shots<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.200> kill<00:01:22.439> somebody<00:01:22.820> now<00:01:23.820> without

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
three shots to kill somebody now without

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.749 
three shots to kill somebody now without
stopping<00:01:24.570> power<00:01:24.720> it's<00:01:25.140> about<00:01:25.500> 40<00:01:26.310> damage<00:01:26.520> a

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
stopping power it's about 40 damage a

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.940 
stopping power it's about 40 damage a
bullet<00:01:27.060> for<00:01:27.600> short<00:01:27.869> medium<00:01:28.080> range<00:01:28.470> which

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
bullet for short medium range which

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.620 
bullet for short medium range which
equals<00:01:29.250> out<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.430> about<00:01:29.640> three<00:01:30.000> shots<00:01:30.240> kill

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
equals out to about three shots kill

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.010 
equals out to about three shots kill
somebody<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.520> long<00:01:32.520> range<00:01:32.729> it's<00:01:33.000> 30<00:01:33.450> damage<00:01:33.720> a

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
somebody and long range it's 30 damage a

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.840 
somebody and long range it's 30 damage a
bullet<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.650> that's<00:01:34.890> about<00:01:35.009> four<00:01:35.310> shots<00:01:35.579> kill

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
bullet so that's about four shots kill

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.670 
bullet so that's about four shots kill
somebody<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.900> really<00:01:37.140> it's<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.409> matter<00:01:37.560> of

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
somebody so really it's a matter of

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.440 
somebody so really it's a matter of
preference<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.490> doesn't<00:01:38.850> make<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.970> world<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.329> a

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
preference it doesn't make a world of a

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.620 
preference it doesn't make a world of a
difference<00:01:39.479> pretty<00:01:40.140> much<00:01:40.320> just<00:01:40.530> one<00:01:40.799> bullet

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
difference pretty much just one bullet

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.200 
difference pretty much just one bullet
but<00:01:42.630> for<00:01:42.869> both<00:01:43.049> guns<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:44.280> takes<00:01:44.520> two<00:01:44.759> shots<00:01:45.030> in

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
but for both guns it takes two shots in

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.240 
but for both guns it takes two shots in
the<00:01:45.299> head<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.630> kill<00:01:45.659> somebody<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.950> just<00:01:47.130> keep

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
the head to kill somebody so just keep

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.950 
the head to kill somebody so just keep
that<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.549> mind<00:01:47.729> when<00:01:47.880> choosing<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.420> gun<00:01:48.659> over

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
that in mind when choosing this gun over

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.590 
that in mind when choosing this gun over
the<00:01:49.049> other<00:01:49.170> guns<00:01:49.820> okay<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.880> use<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.299> iron

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
the other guns okay to use the iron

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.740 
the other guns okay to use the iron
sight<00:01:51.960> there's<00:01:52.619> like<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> little<00:01:54.000> line<00:01:54.420> at<00:01:54.630> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
sight there's like a little line at the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.010 
sight there's like a little line at the
bottom<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.829> iron<00:01:56.250> sights<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.719> bullet

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
bottom of the iron sights and the bullet

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.920 
bottom of the iron sights and the bullet
ends<00:01:58.469> up<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.950> hundred<00:01:59.310> percent<00:01:59.430> always<00:02:00.090> on<00:02:00.750> the

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
ends up a hundred percent always on the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:29.050 
ends up a hundred percent always on the
first<00:02:01.140> shot<00:02:01.320> at<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.710> top<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.310> low<00:02:02.490> line

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
of the accuracy for all ranges for this

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.980 
of the accuracy for all ranges for this
gun<00:03:12.470> I<00:03:12.740> just<00:03:13.250> wanted<00:03:13.520> to<00:03:13.640> give<00:03:14.030> you<00:03:14.060> my<00:03:14.510> opinion

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
gun I just wanted to give you my opinion

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.570 
gun I just wanted to give you my opinion
on<00:03:15.470> how<00:03:15.980> it<00:03:16.160> is<00:03:17.770> close<00:03:18.770> quarters<00:03:19.160> i<00:03:19.280> think<00:03:19.460> it's

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
on how it is close quarters i think it's

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.600 
on how it is close quarters i think it's
a<00:03:19.640> pretty<00:03:19.760> good<00:03:19.970> gun<00:03:20.650> it's<00:03:21.650> pretty<00:03:21.950> like<00:03:22.430> the

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
a pretty good gun it's pretty like the

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.640 
a pretty good gun it's pretty like the
bullets<00:03:23.210> are<00:03:23.300> pretty<00:03:23.510> much<00:03:23.660> in<00:03:23.810> a<00:03:23.870> small

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
bullets are pretty much in a small

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.600 
bullets are pretty much in a small
vicinity<00:03:25.420> and<00:03:26.420> for<00:03:27.170> medium<00:03:27.980> range<00:03:28.220> I<00:03:28.430> think

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
vicinity and for medium range I think

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.150 
vicinity and for medium range I think
it's<00:03:28.730> pretty<00:03:28.850> reliable<00:03:29.540> but<00:03:29.870> then<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:30.710> recoil

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
it's pretty reliable but then the recoil

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.720 
it's pretty reliable but then the recoil
kicks<00:03:31.460> in<00:03:31.670> so<00:03:32.540> and<00:03:33.350> that's<00:03:34.160> the<00:03:34.310> same<00:03:34.490> for<00:03:34.610> the

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
kicks in so and that's the same for the

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.100 
kicks in so and that's the same for the
long<00:03:34.910> range<00:03:35.150> so<00:03:35.450> my<00:03:36.110> my<00:03:37.070> opinion<00:03:37.460> I<00:03:37.580> guess<00:03:37.760> is<00:03:37.970> a

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
long range so my my opinion I guess is a

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.390 
long range so my my opinion I guess is a
stick<00:03:39.110> to<00:03:39.230> bursting<00:03:39.680> for<00:03:39.890> long<00:03:40.070> and<00:03:40.250> medium

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
stick to bursting for long and medium

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.150 
stick to bursting for long and medium
ranges<00:03:40.940> and<00:03:41.150> for<00:03:41.510> short<00:03:42.140> ranges<00:03:42.440> go<00:03:42.620> ahead<00:03:42.890> and

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
ranges and for short ranges go ahead and

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.910 
ranges and for short ranges go ahead and
you<00:03:44.030> can<00:03:44.180> be<00:03:44.300> like<00:03:44.480> Rambo<00:03:44.930> and<00:03:44.959> just<00:03:45.470> spray<00:03:45.740> and

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
you can be like Rambo and just spray and

00:03:45.920 --> 00:04:04.090 
you can be like Rambo and just spray and
pray

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:57.439 

you

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.730 

alright<00:04:58.449> so<00:04:58.719> my<00:04:58.870> final<00:04:59.020> thoughts<00:04:59.379> for<00:04:59.500> this

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
alright so my final thoughts for this

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.100 
alright so my final thoughts for this
gun<00:05:00.000> this<00:05:01.000> is<00:05:01.150> definitely<00:05:01.360> one<00:05:01.719> of<00:05:01.780> the<00:05:01.930> best
