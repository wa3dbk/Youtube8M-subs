00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.749

wrong<00:01:37.140> because<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.619> characters<00:01:37.860> we've<00:01:38.520> got

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
wrong because the characters we've got

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.819 
wrong because the characters we've got
three<00:01:39.420> character<00:01:39.780> deaths<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.229> two<00:01:40.350> chapters

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
three character deaths and two chapters

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.300 
three character deaths and two chapters
and<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.369> was<00:01:41.549> still<00:01:41.759> pretty<00:01:42.240> effective<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.140> was

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
and it was still pretty effective it was

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.740 
and it was still pretty effective it was
it<00:01:44.310> still<00:01:44.490> has<00:01:44.640> some<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:45.000> good<00:01:45.479> amount<00:01:45.720> of

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
it still has some is good amount of

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.210 
it still has some is good amount of
impact<00:01:45.990> on<00:01:46.229> me<00:01:46.350> like<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.560> was<00:01:46.680> like<00:01:46.799> holy<00:01:46.890> fuck

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
impact on me like I was like holy fuck

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.770 
impact on me like I was like holy fuck
and<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.700> think<00:01:47.759> that's<00:01:47.970> that's<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.570> thing

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
and I think that's that's the thing

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.139 
and I think that's that's the thing
because<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.140> didn't<00:01:49.439> think<00:01:49.680> more<00:01:50.670> characters

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
because I didn't think more characters

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.899 
because I didn't think more characters
would<00:01:51.299> die<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.540> 11<00:01:52.259> died<00:01:52.470> right<00:01:53.040> then<00:01:53.670> like

know<00:04:00.380> if<00:04:00.500> it<00:04:00.680> it<00:04:01.519> will<00:04:01.760> get<00:04:01.970> old<00:04:02.180> because<00:04:03.139> if<00:04:03.560> a

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:03.889 
know if it it will get old because if a

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:06.629 
know if it it will get old because if a
huge<00:04:04.340> amount<00:04:04.579> of<00:04:04.670> characters<00:04:04.880> die<00:04:05.239> that'll<00:04:05.720> be

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:06.639 
huge amount of characters die that'll be

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:09.129 
huge amount of characters die that'll be
like<00:04:07.639> that'll<00:04:07.940> be<00:04:08.030> a<00:04:08.060> huge<00:04:08.239> impact<00:04:08.660> on<00:04:08.780> its<00:04:08.959> own

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
like that'll be a huge impact on its own

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.110 
like that'll be a huge impact on its own
you<00:04:09.530> don't<00:04:10.010> really<00:04:10.190> you<00:04:10.670> know<00:04:10.730> I'm<00:04:10.880> saying

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
you don't really you know I'm saying

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.059 
you don't really you know I'm saying
this<00:04:11.239> like<00:04:11.389> it<00:04:11.510> won't<00:04:11.810> even<00:04:11.959> get<00:04:12.079> old<00:04:12.319> if

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
this like it won't even get old if

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.080 
this like it won't even get old if
they're<00:04:13.489> like<00:04:13.750> if<00:04:14.750> it<00:04:15.229> keeps<00:04:15.410> doing<00:04:15.590> them<00:04:15.799> I

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
they're like if it keeps doing them I

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.890 
they're like if it keeps doing them I
think<00:04:17.090> you<00:04:17.150> should<00:04:17.299> spread<00:04:17.510> them<00:04:17.690> out<00:04:17.750> a<00:04:17.810> bit

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
think you should spread them out a bit

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.220 
think you should spread them out a bit
more

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
more

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.260 
more

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
but if he keeps some deaths as long as

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.460
