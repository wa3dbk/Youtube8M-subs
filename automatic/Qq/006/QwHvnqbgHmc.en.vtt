00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.530
 survive among many others and you have to do it based on effort from 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.759
 the organizers of the parents of the relatives 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:25.289

 in the superior police headquarters of pavilion that has chances that it has 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.990
 inside 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.670
 so with that I already tell you all about the hardships of quotes that pass for 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.400
 who knows how to develop their sport and good in the photo they drink superhuman coffee 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.410
 for the goal to all that's why a goalkeeper more than support these 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.160
 girls and already generate aliens to rené campero let's see if we are going to see the 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.170
 plans 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.150
 proud 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.940
 timid and expectant like any other club the or of lot is formed by 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.790
 very different characters 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.830
 but between so much difference in the personality bill 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.690
 there is a common bond that defines these girls 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.200
 his passion for rhythmic gymnastics 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.730
 they train three times per week and in two of the occasions they do it in a room 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.730
 improvised and not very good for women's sport 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.210
 the facilities that can see the pavilion of the superior leadership of 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.300
 police 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.860
 also these girls have to leave to train on Fridays until 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.310
 the town of Toledo from Povisa showing that their love for 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.150
 sport goes far beyond the miles to be done we bring you a 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.159
 bit bad apart 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.689
 the rhythm is done with a tapestry as you have seen from 14 by 14 meters and 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:00.149
 we can not be moving from one pavilion to another then we have had 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.859
 to buy another to climb the police station and put an expense on his post 

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:04.980
 very important 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.190
 at the beginning they are explained that we do not have another gang member to link 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.369
 them and they understand it perfectly better than being 

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:15.809
 without being able to train anywhere else we also have the pavilion for 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:18.829
 we just percent and the aforementioned hours 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:19.969
 so very good 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:23.989
 despite the necessary expenses and efforts, it has been possible to consolidate 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.609
 that was built as a club 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:29.899
 a July 28, 2004 in Castilla-La Mancha there are very few level of 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:30.980
 rhythmic gymnastics 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.970
 We based ourselves on the smallest of all, what then 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.270
 enjoy sports, we prefer that you are here, it's a sport before 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.359
 being on the street 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:45.369
 to get good results from the gymnasts and what is more 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:49.039
 vital to foster a spirit of camaraderie among all its members 

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:54.339
 and this despite the fact that only two female coaches have to compose 

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:59.169
 to cover a group of 32 million I was thinking next year in 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:01.559
 train the five days and separate girls 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:02.880
 three days that train 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.600
 those that are in level 1 that are the ones that compete in federated championships and 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.270
 the days that compete the rest are included in the rest of the negotiations 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.430
 that of all the ways they are not going to alter the march of these princesses 

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:18.099
 for the moment what crazy among his triumphs have classified boys of 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.099
 its components in the championship of Spain in its category 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.899
 her name alba and sara good as a child 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:29.029
 my mother would wear it when the employees and I like the idea of ​​what 

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:30.679
 what I wanted to do 

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:33.119
 and nothing gets ready to 

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:34.159
 and the pp 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:36.799
 monterde the proximity because in the first place 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.999
 ayala that tuning liked Martians after 

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:41.559
 in general you have to do them 

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:44.559
 but to do gymnastics certain attitudes are also required 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:49.009
 and a little more patience and it's that during workouts you have to work 

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:51.929
 always the same work work 

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:55.019
 legs and backs handling apparatus and so on 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:00.349
 a routine of repeating and repeating that however for excellent rewards 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.739
 all you have to do is ask the little ones and check their illusion 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:08.689
 however, some even the farm is not a little 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:11.689
 many people 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:13.330
 you are not happy 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.279
 It is a fort 

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:17.809
 let's go to the cinema 

00:04:17.809 --> 00:04:19.699
 seven different parents 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:22.189
 when you get home or when they see you here 

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:23.449
 toulouse 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:26.459
 toulon a bus in an unusual gesture 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.789
 he has to be careful 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:32.729
 because according to consider a chemical percent 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.900
 one by one your institutions 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.900
 a month ago global warming 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:44.389
 we do a bit annoying nothing more to the rhythmic set after the 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.620
 coach day by day and get an exercise to progress little by little according to 

00:04:47.619 --> 00:04:48.990
 the daily training 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.460
 so then for now we have not had any girl that has not 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.310
 left but that you do have to like you have to have the conditions that you 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.139
 give between civility that skill will be seen to 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:01.360
 the handling of the devices that we sow 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.909
 You are taking it 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:06.229
 in little by little as you progress through basic training in 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:06.909
 an assault 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:08.439
 This is not everything 

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:11.439
 I will practice that precise activity of great musical talent 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:15.909
 and is that what would be an exercise without its corresponding musical thread 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.249
 in him or at night deepens and much in this relationship 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:24.059
 In fact, according to Miguel, he likes music that he has heard he can take 

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:27.179
 and analyze with your coaches if you can use it 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.159
 every exercise has to carry the music 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:35.400
 then we look for the music adapted to the conditions that it has 

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:37.370
 each gymnast each set 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.620
 each arch next to him carries a different music from each individual area of 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.360
 a different music then 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.589
 we make lakes the montages that depending on that music 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:49.999
 They hope to continue growing and learning at the same time 

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:54.579
 despite the difficulties, the one or the other wants to continue sowing ground and 

00:05:54.579 --> 00:05:57.990
 who knows if someday these girls could be 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.039
 one of our mothers
