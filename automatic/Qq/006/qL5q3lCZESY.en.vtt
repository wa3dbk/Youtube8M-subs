creature with red spots since his whole
typing<00:06:29.409> was<00:06:29.530> shown<00:06:29.740> as<00:06:29.889> fire<00:06:30.129> and<00:06:30.159> water<00:06:30.580> both

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090 
typing was shown as fire and water both

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.300 
typing was shown as fire and water both
forms<00:06:31.479> must<00:06:31.690> contain<00:06:32.080> both<00:06:32.289> attributes<00:06:32.949> which

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
forms must contain both attributes which

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.800 
forms must contain both attributes which
means<00:06:33.610> his<00:06:33.729> ability<00:06:34.240> may<00:06:34.419> be<00:06:34.479> the<00:06:34.659> one

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:34.810 
means his ability may be the one

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.510 
means his ability may be the one
determining<00:06:35.139> destructive<00:06:35.860> estab<00:06:36.159> attacks

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 
determining destructive estab attacks

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.149 
determining destructive estab attacks
maybe<00:06:37.120> in<00:06:37.539> this<00:06:37.690> fire<00:06:37.930> form<00:06:38.319> his<00:06:38.500> fire<00:06:38.770> attacks

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:39.159 
maybe in this fire form his fire attacks

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:41.399 
maybe in this fire form his fire attacks
do<00:06:39.370> more<00:06:39.610> but<00:06:40.030> as<00:06:40.120> water<00:06:40.360> attacks<00:06:40.690> do<00:06:40.900> less<00:06:41.199> and

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:41.409 
do more but as water attacks do less and

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:43.920 
do more but as water attacks do less and
vice-versa<00:06:42.280> firs<00:06:42.490> water<00:06:42.759> form<00:06:43.120> may<00:06:43.690> be<00:06:43.750> the

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:43.930 
vice-versa firs water form may be the

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.719 
vice-versa firs water form may be the
item<00:06:44.259> he<00:06:44.379> holds<00:06:44.680> will<00:06:44.830> affect<00:06:45.159> what<00:06:45.310> form<00:06:45.580> ease

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:45.729 
item he holds will affect what form ease

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:47.670 
item he holds will affect what form ease
in<00:06:45.909> but<00:06:46.300> this<00:06:46.539> is<00:06:46.690> all<00:06:46.810> just<00:06:46.990> a<00:06:47.110> simple<00:06:47.440> theory

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 
in but this is all just a simple theory

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.890 
in but this is all just a simple theory
which<00:06:47.979> is<00:06:48.129> yet<00:06:48.400> to<00:06:48.550> be<00:06:48.669> proven<00:06:49.060> but<00:06:49.419> I<00:06:49.479> think<00:06:49.810> it

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:49.900 
which is yet to be proven but I think it

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.269 
which is yet to be proven but I think it
really<00:06:49.930> does<00:06:50.289> make<00:06:50.500> a<00:06:50.529> lot<00:06:50.740> of<00:06:50.770> sense<00:06:51.009> and

00:06:51.269 --> 00:06:51.279 
really does make a lot of sense and

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:52.740 
really does make a lot of sense and
explains<00:06:51.759> the<00:06:51.849> lacking<00:06:52.300> of<00:06:52.389> a<00:06:52.479> water

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:52.750 
explains the lacking of a water

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.490 
explains the lacking of a water
attribute<00:06:52.990> in<00:06:53.409> his<00:06:53.500> appearance

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:55.500 
attribute in his appearance
