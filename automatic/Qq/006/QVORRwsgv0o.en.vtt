tape<00:00:50.960> and<00:00:51.960> we're<00:00:52.079> going<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.289> use<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.739> to

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
tape and we're going to use that to

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.590 
tape and we're going to use that to
figure<00:00:53.250> out<00:00:53.399> exactly<00:00:53.879> where<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.210> decal

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
this about in the middle of the scoop so

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.149 
this about in the middle of the scoop so
that's<00:01:13.080> fine<00:01:13.670> we'll<00:01:14.670> mark<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:14.970> other<00:01:15.240> end

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
that's fine we'll mark the other end

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.990 
that's fine we'll mark the other end
where<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.189> decal<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.759> going<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:17.970> go<00:01:19.850> so<00:01:20.850> we've

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
peel it off the plastic backing making

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:08.469 
peel it off the plastic backing making

sure everything came apart okay take
this<00:02:09.100> we<00:02:10.100> have<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.340> wet<00:02:10.520> it<00:02:10.550> down<00:02:10.700> with<00:02:11.240> our

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
this we have to wet it down with our

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:19.059 
this we have to wet it down with our
wedding<00:02:11.660> solution

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.259 

the<00:02:19.609> reason<00:02:19.999> we're<00:02:20.150> using<00:02:20.180> this<00:02:21.909> is<00:02:22.909> so<00:02:23.150> that

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
the reason we're using this is so that

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.149 
the reason we're using this is so that
we<00:02:23.329> can<00:02:23.569> position<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:24.109> decal<00:02:24.530> without<00:02:25.010> it

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.159 
we can position the decal without it

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.729 
we can position the decal without it
gripping<00:02:25.840> immediately<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:27.079> we<00:02:27.439> can<00:02:27.560> position

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
gripping immediately and we can position

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:36.339 
gripping immediately and we can position
exactly<00:02:28.159> where<00:02:28.790> we<00:02:28.909> want<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.239> before<00:02:29.629> scoop<00:02:35.349> we

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
exactly where we want it before scoop we

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:46.240 
exactly where we want it before scoop we
take<00:02:36.560> our<00:02:36.680> sweetie<00:02:37.189> again<00:02:43.810> go<00:02:44.810> over<00:02:45.250> square

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
take our sweetie again go over square

00:02:46.250 --> 00:03:00.110

installation that it's finished it's the

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.880 
installation that it's finished it's the
only<00:03:52.480> thing<00:03:52.660> left<00:03:52.900> to<00:03:53.050> do<00:03:53.230> is<00:03:53.260> to<00:03:53.349> take<00:03:53.560> up<00:03:53.739> the
