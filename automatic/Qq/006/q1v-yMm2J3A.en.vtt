project once you'll see inside if you

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.080 
project once you'll see inside if you
look<00:00:49.739> from<00:00:49.860> side<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.129> side<00:00:50.280> you'll<00:00:50.640> see<00:00:50.700> little

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
clips and you'll just find something to

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.569 
clips and you'll just find something to
move<00:00:54.899> those<00:00:55.140> aside<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.070> whole<00:00:56.309> motor

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
move those aside so that the whole motor

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.270 
move those aside so that the whole motor
mount<00:00:56.820> will<00:00:57.000> come<00:00:57.180> out<00:00:57.329> as<00:00:57.510> one<00:00:57.660> unit<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.440> I've

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
over on one side to release that clamp

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.260 
over on one side to release that clamp
and<00:01:10.740> just<00:01:10.890> kind<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.159> leave<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:11.490> there<00:01:11.700> and

and just kind of leave it in there and

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.789 
and just kind of leave it in there and
I'll<00:01:12.479> take<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> screwdriver<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.290> on<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.680> other

I'll take a screwdriver and on the other
side<00:01:13.890> from<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.490> other<00:01:14.610> direction<00:01:16.549> put<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.610> in

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
side from the other direction put it in

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.380 
side from the other direction put it in
there<00:01:18.710> and<00:01:19.710> if<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.340> do<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.610> just<00:01:20.640> right<00:01:20.970> that

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
there and if you do it just right that

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.920 
there and if you do it just right that
whole<00:01:21.600> motor<00:01:21.869> casing<00:01:22.170> will<00:01:22.530> come<00:01:22.710> out

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.620 

they're<00:01:29.930> not<00:01:30.760> entirely<00:01:31.760> I'm<00:01:32.060> saying<00:01:32.330> easy<00:01:33.340> but

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
they're not entirely I'm saying easy but

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.960 
they're not entirely I'm saying easy but
so<00:01:35.630> you<00:01:35.840> get<00:01:36.020> that<00:01:36.140> motor<00:01:36.410> mount<00:01:36.700> motor<00:01:37.700> casing

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
so you get that motor mount motor casing

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.590 
so you get that motor mount motor casing
includes<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.850> actual<00:01:40.850> motor<00:01:41.090> and<00:01:41.390> the

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
includes the actual motor and the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.490 
includes the actual motor and the
battery<00:01:41.630> contacts<00:01:42.590> and<00:01:43.870> then<00:01:44.870> you<00:01:45.170> have<00:01:45.350> the

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
battery contacts and then you have the

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.350 
battery contacts and then you have the
switch<00:01:45.730> on<00:01:46.730> top<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:47.540> all<00:01:48.230> this<00:01:48.530> you<00:01:49.040> leave

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
switch on top and all this you leave

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.190 
switch on top and all this you leave
unmodified<00:01:50.770> and<00:01:51.910> put<00:01:52.910> it<00:01:53.000> aside<00:01:53.090> and<00:01:53.570> then<00:01:54.110> you

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
unmodified and put it aside and then you

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.740 
unmodified and put it aside and then you
take<00:01:54.380> this<00:01:54.560> casing<00:01:55.040> here<00:01:55.600> and<00:01:56.600> just<00:01:57.590> take<00:01:57.830> a

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
take this casing here and just take a

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.690 
take this casing here and just take a
pair<00:01:59.750> of<00:01:59.780> needle<00:02:00.020> nose<00:02:00.380> or<00:02:01.220> something<00:02:01.340> and

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
pair of needle nose or something and

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.990 
pair of needle nose or something and
grab<00:02:01.940> that<00:02:02.270> upper<00:02:03.200> piece<00:02:03.410> and<00:02:04.160> just

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
grab that upper piece and just

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.210 
grab that upper piece and just
essentially<00:02:05.479> break<00:02:05.720> that<00:02:05.930> right<00:02:06.110> off<00:02:06.290> I'm

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
essentially break that right off I'm

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.060 
essentially break that right off I'm
going<00:02:07.400> to<00:02:07.520> come<00:02:07.670> out<00:02:07.700> and<00:02:08.060> going<00:02:08.240> up<00:02:08.890> with<00:02:09.890> one

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
going to come out and going up with one

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:16.210 
going to come out and going up with one
like<00:02:10.220> this<00:02:10.429> so<00:02:12.220> this<00:02:13.220> flush<00:02:13.990> okay<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:16.040> once

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
like this so this flush okay and once

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.140 
like this so this flush okay and once
you've<00:02:16.340> broken<00:02:16.460> it<00:02:16.820> off<00:02:16.970> then<00:02:17.810> you<00:02:18.110> will<00:02:18.260> take

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
you've broken it off then you will take

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.250 
you've broken it off then you will take
your<00:02:20.150> cell<00:02:20.870> phone<00:02:21.080> charger<00:02:22.810> an<00:02:23.810> old<00:02:23.990> cell

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
your cell phone charger an old cell

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.140 
your cell phone charger an old cell
phone<00:02:24.440> charger

this<00:02:26.150> one<00:02:26.390> is<00:02:26.540> a<00:02:27.370> output<00:02:28.370> of<00:02:29.060> 5<00:02:29.990> volts<00:02:31.690> so<00:02:32.690> it

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
this one is a output of 5 volts so it

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.400 
this one is a output of 5 volts so it
puts<00:02:33.140> this<00:02:33.640> well<00:02:34.640> above<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.120> two<00:02:36.080> double-a

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
puts this well above the two double-a

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.510 
puts this well above the two double-a
battery<00:02:36.739> power<00:02:36.950> level<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:39.070> seems<00:02:40.070> to<00:02:40.250> be<00:02:40.340> not

battery power level and seems to be not
far<00:02:40.760> enough<00:02:40.880> to<00:02:41.030> burn<00:02:41.270> out<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.540> motor<00:02:41.570> so

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
far enough to burn out the motor so

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.009 
far enough to burn out the motor so
shave<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.340> ends<00:02:43.459> of<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.790> wire<00:02:44.000> off<00:02:44.300> the

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
shave the ends of the wire off the

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.650 
shave the ends of the wire off the
casing<00:02:45.489> so<00:02:46.489> you<00:02:46.550> have<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.760> bare<00:02:47.060> wire<00:02:47.239> exposed

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
casing so you have the bare wire exposed

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.160 
casing so you have the bare wire exposed
and<00:02:47.989> then<00:02:49.390> didn't<00:02:50.390> seem<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:50.600> matter<00:02:50.750> which<00:02:50.959> end

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
and then didn't seem to matter which end

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.140 
and then didn't seem to matter which end
I<00:02:51.230> put<00:02:51.380> this<00:02:51.530> on<00:02:51.709> it<00:02:52.459> will<00:02:52.519> watch<00:02:52.760> what<00:02:52.910> motors

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
I put this on it will watch what motors

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.500 
I put this on it will watch what motors
are<00:02:53.269> pretty<00:02:53.480> sturdy<00:02:53.660> that<00:02:53.870> way<00:02:54.019> apparently

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
are pretty sturdy that way apparently

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.740 
are pretty sturdy that way apparently
just<00:02:56.510> type<00:02:56.690> up<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.930> wire<00:02:58.180> wrap<00:02:59.180> around<00:02:59.540> and

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
just type up the wire wrap around and

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.509 
just type up the wire wrap around and
you<00:02:59.840> can<00:02:59.989> solder<00:03:00.200> it<00:03:00.470> on<00:03:00.560> I'll<00:03:00.980> just<00:03:01.010> leave<00:03:01.370> in

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
you can solder it on I'll just leave in

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.550 
you can solder it on I'll just leave in
place<00:03:01.640> if<00:03:01.910> you<00:03:02.000> do<00:03:02.120> it<00:03:02.239> just<00:03:02.330> quite<00:03:02.660> right<00:03:02.900> in

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
place if you do it just quite right in

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.560 
place if you do it just quite right in
case<00:03:03.709> you<00:03:03.860> want<00:03:04.010> to<00:03:04.070> get<00:03:04.190> off<00:03:04.280> later<00:03:04.550> flip<00:03:05.450> it

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
case you want to get off later flip it

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.470 
case you want to get off later flip it
around<00:03:06.610> but<00:03:07.610> generally<00:03:08.000> it's<00:03:08.120> just<00:03:08.300> sits

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
around but generally it's just sits

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.070 
around but generally it's just sits
looks<00:03:08.720> like<00:03:08.900> that<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:10.700> one<00:03:10.940> wire<00:03:11.420> on<00:03:11.630> each<00:03:11.810> end

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
looks like that the one wire on each end

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.400 
looks like that the one wire on each end
of<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.260> battery<00:03:12.470> post<00:03:13.660> so<00:03:14.660> it<00:03:14.810> makes<00:03:14.989> contact

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
of the battery post so it makes contact

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.520 
of the battery post so it makes contact
with<00:03:15.530> e2n<00:03:16.040> and<00:03:16.940> it's<00:03:17.510> look<00:03:17.720> if<00:03:17.810> I<00:03:17.930> can<00:03:18.200> pay

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
with e2n and it's look if I can pay

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.949 
with e2n and it's look if I can pay
attention<00:03:18.560> to<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.130> switch<00:03:19.489> side<00:03:19.940> versus<00:03:20.930> the

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
attention to the switch side versus the

attention to the switch side versus the
motor<00:03:21.200> side<00:03:21.440> for<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.680> switch<00:03:21.860> side<00:03:22.100> up<00:03:22.280> on<00:03:23.120> the

motor side for the switch side up on the

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.410 
motor side for the switch side up on the
casing<00:03:23.660> again<00:03:23.930> put<00:03:24.380> it<00:03:24.470> right<00:03:24.620> back<00:03:24.800> and<00:03:25.420> when

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
casing again put it right back and when

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.870 
casing again put it right back and when
you<00:03:26.480> pull<00:03:26.660> these<00:03:26.810> out<00:03:26.989> be<00:03:27.230> really<00:03:27.500> careful<00:03:27.920> of

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
you pull these out be really careful of

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.270 
you pull these out be really careful of
these<00:03:29.090> clips<00:03:30.640> this<00:03:31.640> one<00:03:32.590> broke<00:03:33.590> off<00:03:33.830> pretty

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
these clips this one broke off pretty

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.490 
these clips this one broke off pretty
easily

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
easily

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.420 
easily
unless<00:03:36.500> you<00:03:36.590> want<00:03:36.739> to<00:03:36.769> pull<00:03:36.920> this<00:03:37.040> in<00:03:37.220> and<00:03:37.250> out

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
unless you want to pull this in and out

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.520 
unless you want to pull this in and out
all<00:03:37.639> the<00:03:37.670> time<00:03:37.760> make<00:03:38.150> modifications<00:03:38.410> and<00:03:39.410> then

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
all the time make modifications and then

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.290 
all the time make modifications and then
you'll<00:03:39.680> just<00:03:39.799> break<00:03:40.010> them<00:03:40.160> off<00:03:40.250> anyway

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
you'll just break them off anyway

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.350 
you'll just break them off anyway
but<00:03:41.810> then<00:03:41.990> slide<00:03:42.290> it<00:03:42.380> right<00:03:42.410> back<00:03:42.530> in<00:03:43.360> locks

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
but then slide it right back in locks

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.040 
but then slide it right back in locks
back<00:03:44.570> in<00:03:44.780> place<00:03:45.050> and<00:03:45.790> then<00:03:46.790> you<00:03:47.540> can<00:03:47.750> cut<00:03:47.930> all

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
back in place and then you can cut all

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.890 
back in place and then you can cut all
the<00:03:48.140> hole<00:03:48.380> in<00:03:48.560> the<00:03:48.620> bottom<00:03:48.920> casing<00:03:49.450> or<00:03:50.450> just

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
the hole in the bottom casing or just

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.300 
the hole in the bottom casing or just
jam<00:03:51.200> it<00:03:51.230> in<00:03:51.440> there<00:03:51.620> really<00:03:51.770> tight<00:03:54.190> kind<00:03:55.190> of

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
jam it in there really tight kind of

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.820 
jam it in there really tight kind of
loose<00:03:55.870> pull<00:03:56.870> in<00:03:57.080> and<00:03:57.200> out<00:03:57.260> as<00:03:57.410> options<00:03:57.740> you

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
loose pull in and out as options you

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.270 
loose pull in and out as options you
want<00:03:57.950> essentially<00:03:58.880> once<00:03:59.060> you're<00:03:59.210> done<00:03:59.330> with

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
want essentially once you're done with

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.700 
want essentially once you're done with
without<00:04:01.280> any<00:04:01.460> major<00:04:01.640> modifications<00:04:02.530> you<00:04:03.530> can

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:03.710 
without any major modifications you can

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.480 
without any major modifications you can
plug<00:04:04.280> this<00:04:04.310> in<00:04:04.640> and<00:04:05.600> it<00:04:06.200> already<00:04:06.800> has<00:04:07.100> a<00:04:07.130> switch

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
plug this in and it already has a switch

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:13.630 
plug this in and it already has a switch
on<00:04:07.700> it<00:04:08.140> so<00:04:09.140> once<00:04:09.590> you've<00:04:09.710> got<00:04:09.920> that<00:04:12.640> cell

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
on it so once you've got that cell

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.690 
on it so once you've got that cell
tribes<00:04:13.940> are<00:04:14.030> hooked<00:04:14.210> into<00:04:14.330> it<00:04:15.340> you<00:04:16.340> don't<00:04:16.400> even

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
tribes are hooked into it you don't even

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.890 
tribes are hooked into it you don't even
have<00:04:16.820> to<00:04:16.910> unplug<00:04:17.120> the<00:04:17.270> cell<00:04:17.450> charger<00:04:17.690> if<00:04:17.810> you

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
have to unplug the cell charger if you

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.180 
have to unplug the cell charger if you
don't<00:04:18.049> want<00:04:18.170> to<00:04:18.320> this<00:04:18.680> is<00:04:18.770> sort<00:04:18.920> of<00:04:18.950> got<00:04:19.100> its

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
don't want to this is sort of got its

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.620 
don't want to this is sort of got its
own<00:04:19.250> switch<00:04:20.320> and<00:04:21.700> what<00:04:22.700> this<00:04:22.850> does<00:04:23.030> is<00:04:23.330> instead

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
own switch and what this does is instead

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.790 
own switch and what this does is instead
of<00:04:23.690> going<00:04:23.810> in<00:04:23.990> circles<00:04:24.290> like<00:04:24.380> people<00:04:24.680> might

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
of going in circles like people might

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.340 
of going in circles like people might
think<00:04:25.040> it<00:04:25.190> goes<00:04:25.310> in<00:04:25.580> and<00:04:25.730> out<00:04:25.880> and<00:04:26.180> so<00:04:26.270> you<00:04:27.140> can

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
think it goes in and out and so you can

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.830 
think it goes in and out and so you can
use<00:04:27.500> it<00:04:27.620> like<00:04:27.800> a<00:04:27.830> little<00:04:27.980> engraver<00:04:28.660> looks<00:04:29.660> like

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
use it like a little engraver looks like

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.430 
use it like a little engraver looks like
so<00:04:31.150> you<00:04:32.150> kind<00:04:32.360> of<00:04:32.420> learn<00:04:32.600> balance<00:04:33.080> it's<00:04:33.260> not

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
so you kind of learn balance it's not

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.530 
so you kind of learn balance it's not
perfect<00:04:33.950> but<00:04:34.040> it<00:04:34.160> works

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.130 

if<00:04:40.540> you<00:04:40.720> had<00:04:40.840> made<00:04:41.170> that<00:04:41.320> little<00:04:41.440> line<00:04:41.710> right

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
if you had made that little line right

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.950 
if you had made that little line right
there<00:04:44.140> and<00:04:44.940> I've<00:04:45.940> done<00:04:46.180> that<00:04:46.360> on<00:04:46.510> rubber

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
there and I've done that on rubber

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.010 
there and I've done that on rubber
components<00:04:47.320> and<00:04:47.800> metal<00:04:48.070> components<00:04:48.870> it's<00:04:49.870> not

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
components and metal components it's not

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.860 
components and metal components it's not
perfect<00:04:50.470> it's<00:04:50.710> cheap<00:04:51.120> and<00:04:52.120> if<00:04:52.510> you<00:04:52.660> really

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
perfect it's cheap and if you really

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.140 
perfect it's cheap and if you really
want<00:04:53.050> to<00:04:53.110> engrave<00:04:53.320> something<00:04:53.850> you<00:04:54.850> can<00:04:55.030> do

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
want to engrave something you can do

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.840 
want to engrave something you can do
that<00:04:55.330> trick<00:04:55.660> and<00:04:56.080> now<00:04:56.350> I<00:04:56.740> haven't<00:04:57.460> done<00:04:57.550> it<00:04:57.700> yet

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
that trick and now I haven't done it yet

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.320 
that trick and now I haven't done it yet
but<00:04:58.030> I<00:04:58.090> thought<00:04:58.360> about<00:04:59.460> maybe<00:05:00.460> filing<00:05:01.030> the<00:05:01.150> tip

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
but I thought about maybe filing the tip

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.360 
but I thought about maybe filing the tip
of<00:05:01.510> this<00:05:01.690> so<00:05:02.200> that<00:05:02.380> you<00:05:02.500> can<00:05:02.680> add<00:05:02.890> something<00:05:03.160> on

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
of this so that you can add something on

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.700 
of this so that you can add something on
there<00:05:03.610> and<00:05:04.240> maybe<00:05:04.450> some<00:05:04.780> of<00:05:04.900> you<00:05:05.080> people<00:05:05.500> out

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
there and maybe some of you people out

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.210 
there and maybe some of you people out
there<00:05:05.950> that<00:05:06.070> are<00:05:06.220> a<00:05:06.780> little<00:05:07.780> more<00:05:08.220> creative

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
there that are a little more creative

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.680 
there that are a little more creative
can<00:05:10.030> take<00:05:10.240> that<00:05:10.510> rubber<00:05:11.320> seal<00:05:11.680> off<00:05:11.920> that<00:05:12.690> goes

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
can take that rubber seal off that goes

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.190 
can take that rubber seal off that goes
underneath<00:05:14.020> the<00:05:14.320> casing<00:05:14.800> and<00:05:15.270> then<00:05:16.270> find<00:05:17.110> a

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
underneath the casing and then find a

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.520 
underneath the casing and then find a
way<00:05:17.230> to<00:05:17.380> replace<00:05:17.680> this<00:05:18.040> little<00:05:18.400> head<00:05:18.610> here<00:05:18.970> and

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
way to replace this little head here and

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.140 
way to replace this little head here and
maybe<00:05:20.530> put<00:05:20.830> in<00:05:21.040> some<00:05:21.250> kind<00:05:21.460> of<00:05:21.550> diamond<00:05:21.910> point

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
maybe put in some kind of diamond point

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.270 
maybe put in some kind of diamond point
or<00:05:22.420> something<00:05:22.840> like<00:05:22.960> that<00:05:23.760> off<00:05:24.760> of<00:05:26.010> some<00:05:27.010> drill

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
or something like that off of some drill

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.500 
or something like that off of some drill
bit<00:05:27.460> supplier<00:05:27.790> like<00:05:28.000> Home<00:05:28.150> Depot<00:05:28.180> or

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
bit supplier like Home Depot or

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.970 
bit supplier like Home Depot or
something<00:05:28.870> like<00:05:28.960> that<00:05:29.020> as<00:05:29.380> a<00:05:29.410> diamond<00:05:29.740> point

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
something like that as a diamond point

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.150 
something like that as a diamond point
that<00:05:30.850> will<00:05:31.350> let<00:05:32.350> you<00:05:32.500> engrave<00:05:32.800> harder

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
that will let you engrave harder

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.470 
that will let you engrave harder
surfaces<00:05:33.810> but<00:05:34.810> that's<00:05:35.020> it<00:05:35.290> in<00:05:35.440> general<00:05:36.480> not

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
surfaces but that's it in general not

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.900 
surfaces but that's it in general not
that<00:05:37.720> complicated<00:05:38.050> and<00:05:38.520> it<00:05:39.520> seems<00:05:39.730> to<00:05:39.820> work

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
that complicated and it seems to work

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.890 
that complicated and it seems to work
pretty<00:05:40.060> well<00:05:41.640> thanks<00:05:42.640> and<00:05:42.850> look<00:05:43.510> for<00:05:43.720> my<00:05:43.840> other

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
pretty well thanks and look for my other

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.200 
pretty well thanks and look for my other
videos
