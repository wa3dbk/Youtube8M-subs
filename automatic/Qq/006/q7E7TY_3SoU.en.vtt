new<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.270> me<00:00:18.420> it's<00:00:18.660> funny<00:00:18.840> for<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.109> couple<00:00:19.410> of

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
new to me it's funny for a couple of

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.349 
new to me it's funny for a couple of
reasons<00:00:19.650> one<00:00:20.220> you<00:00:20.460> can<00:00:20.609> pretty<00:00:20.730> much<00:00:20.820> insert

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
reasons one you can pretty much insert

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.810 
reasons one you can pretty much insert
any<00:00:21.660> generic<00:00:22.140> joke<00:00:22.560> here<00:00:22.830> like<00:00:23.130> these<00:00:23.400> girls

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
any generic joke here like these girls

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.630 
any generic joke here like these girls
sure<00:00:24.090> are<00:00:24.119> bad<00:00:24.600> at<00:00:24.840> handling<00:00:25.230> bubbles<00:00:26.070> -<00:00:26.369> this

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
sure are bad at handling bubbles - this

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.550 
sure are bad at handling bubbles - this
was<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.820> pretty<00:00:27.119> clever<00:00:27.420> way<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.840> getting<00:00:28.380> these

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
was a pretty clever way of getting these

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.950 
was a pretty clever way of getting these
girls<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.130> make<00:00:29.279> out<00:00:29.550> no<00:00:30.240> I'm<00:00:30.390> guessing<00:00:30.810> that

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
girls to make out no I'm guessing that

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.389 
girls to make out no I'm guessing that
they<00:00:31.109> thought<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.380> these<00:00:31.650> balls<00:00:31.920> would<00:00:32.189> hit

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
they thought that these balls would hit

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.040 
they thought that these balls would hit
each<00:00:32.520> other<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.090> if<00:00:33.180> they<00:00:33.300> would<00:00:33.450> bounce<00:00:33.630> back

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
each other and if they would bounce back

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.870 
each other and if they would bounce back
and<00:00:34.290> we<00:00:34.410> would<00:00:34.530> all<00:00:34.680> roll<00:00:35.160> let<00:00:35.640> their

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
and we would all roll let their

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.030 
and we would all roll let their
shenanigans<00:00:36.750> but<00:00:36.989> that's<00:00:37.200> not<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.710> way<00:00:37.860> it

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
shenanigans but that's not the way it

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.040 
shenanigans but that's not the way it
turned<00:00:38.280> out<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:39.239> I'm<00:00:39.360> guessing<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.930> was

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
turned out so I'm guessing that it was

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.080 
turned out so I'm guessing that it was
an<00:00:40.140> intentional<00:00:40.469> fail<00:00:41.040> which<00:00:41.370> turned<00:00:41.700> into<00:00:41.790> an

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
an intentional fail which turned into an

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.990 
an intentional fail which turned into an
actual<00:00:42.600> fail<00:00:43.020> which<00:00:43.410> using<00:00:44.100> internet<00:00:44.730> math

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
actual fail which using internet math

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.869 
actual fail which using internet math
makes<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.690> win<00:00:46.260> now<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.340> next<00:00:47.579> video<00:00:47.789> is

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
makes it a win now this next video is

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.549 
makes it a win now this next video is
fairly<00:00:48.480> new<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:48.989> just<00:00:49.200> appeared<00:00:49.500> on

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
would it I guess it would make sense

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.949 
would it I guess it would make sense
that<00:03:04.640> he<00:03:04.820> would<00:03:04.910> whistle<00:03:05.120> a<00:03:05.360> song<00:03:05.630> I<00:03:05.810> mean

I don't whistle a song I sing opera and

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
by the way and I'm just curious who in

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.310 
by the way and I'm just curious who in
the<00:03:16.790> hell<00:03:16.970> pulls<00:03:17.300> out<00:03:17.510> their<00:03:17.660> camera<00:03:18.140> and

films<00:03:18.709> birds<00:03:19.010> humping<00:03:19.550> I<00:03:23.620> mean<00:03:24.620> I'm<00:03:24.739> glad<00:03:24.860> they

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
films birds humping I mean I'm glad they

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.830 
films birds humping I mean I'm glad they
did<00:03:25.370> it<00:03:25.519> cuz<00:03:25.670> you<00:03:25.700> know<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:26.150> video<00:03:26.390> is<00:03:26.450> funny

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840

did it cuz you know the video is funny
I'm<00:03:27.410> just<00:03:27.500> asking<00:03:28.100> anyway<00:03:28.340> now<00:03:28.519> that<00:03:28.670> I<00:03:28.730> think

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
I'm just asking anyway now that I think

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.640 
I'm just asking anyway now that I think
about<00:03:29.030> it<00:03:29.300> it<00:03:29.480> would<00:03:29.720> make<00:03:29.989> sense<00:03:30.260> that<00:03:30.410> the

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
about it it would make sense that the

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.440 
about it it would make sense that the
bird<00:03:30.830> was<00:03:30.860> whistling<00:03:31.489> of<00:03:31.670> course<00:03:32.030> he<00:03:32.330> was
