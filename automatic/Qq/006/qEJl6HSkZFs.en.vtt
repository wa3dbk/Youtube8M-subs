00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.819 
let it cook for about 10 to 15 minutes
and<00:02:30.860> check<00:02:31.160> out<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:31.489> stir<00:02:31.730> it<00:02:31.880> occasionally

when<00:02:33.829> it<00:02:33.950> gets<00:02:34.160> to<00:02:34.400> about<00:02:34.489> this<00:02:34.910> level<00:02:35.510> of

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
when it gets to about this level of

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.360 
when it gets to about this level of
cooking<00:02:36.019> where<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.440> moong<00:02:36.769> dhal<00:02:36.950> is<00:02:37.160> just

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
cooking where the moong dhal is just

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.550 
cooking where the moong dhal is just
starting<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:37.790> break<00:02:38.060> up<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:40.220> lose<00:02:40.459> its<00:02:40.700> form

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
starting to break up and lose its form

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.720 
starting to break up and lose its form
then<00:02:42.560> we<00:02:42.650> want<00:02:42.829> to<00:02:42.890> start<00:02:43.100> adding<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.430> veggies

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
then we want to start adding the veggies

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.460 
then we want to start adding the veggies
so<00:02:44.000> start<00:02:44.299> by<00:02:44.420> adding<00:02:44.570> the<00:02:44.630> zucchinis<00:02:45.200> cuz

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
so start by adding the zucchinis cuz

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.630 
so start by adding the zucchinis cuz
they're<00:02:45.620> gonna<00:02:45.709> take<00:02:45.980> a<00:02:46.010> little<00:02:46.190> longer<00:02:46.489> to

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
they're gonna take a little longer to

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.509 
they're gonna take a little longer to
cook<00:02:46.880> than<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.209> spinach<00:02:48.280> so<00:02:49.280> add<00:02:49.370> the

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
zucchini to the pot then pop the lid

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.970 
zucchini to the pot then pop the lid
back<00:02:52.250> on<00:02:52.989> can<00:02:53.989> leave<00:02:54.170> a<00:02:54.200> little<00:02:54.410> gap<00:02:54.680> with<00:02:54.950> the

and<00:02:55.519> at<00:02:56.390> each<00:02:56.420> stage<00:02:56.959> again<00:02:57.560> just<00:02:57.769> checking<00:02:58.130> it

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
and at each stage again just checking it

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.850 
and at each stage again just checking it
for<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:59.690> amount<00:02:59.930> of<00:03:00.049> water<00:03:00.260> you<00:03:00.530> might<00:03:00.680> want

little while and the doll starting to

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.789 
little while and the doll starting to
break<00:03:06.640> down<00:03:06.849> further<00:03:07.200> then<00:03:08.200> we<00:03:08.379> can<00:03:08.560> add<00:03:08.709> the

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
break down further then we can add the

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
in the Moondogs nicely broken down we

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.259 
in the Moondogs nicely broken down we
can<00:03:35.950> make<00:03:36.099> the<00:03:36.280> little<00:03:36.400> the<00:03:36.849> soup<00:03:37.060> a<00:03:37.150> little

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
can make the little the soup a little

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.149 
can make the little the soup a little
bit<00:03:37.450> thinner<00:03:37.720> by<00:03:37.959> adding<00:03:38.290> some<00:03:38.500> water<00:03:38.530> again

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:39.159 
bit thinner by adding some water again

adding some salt to taste and the final
touch<00:03:43.359> is<00:03:43.750> adding<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.680> coriander<00:03:45.099> leaves<00:03:45.519> now

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:45.909 
touch is adding the coriander leaves now

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:47.640 
touch is adding the coriander leaves now
we<00:03:46.269> don't<00:03:46.420> really<00:03:46.810> want<00:03:46.959> to<00:03:47.049> cook<00:03:47.170> these<00:03:47.409> we

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
we don't really want to cook these we

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.610 
we don't really want to cook these we
just<00:03:47.799> want<00:03:47.950> to<00:03:48.040> stir<00:03:48.280> them<00:03:48.459> in<00:03:49.319> turn<00:03:50.319> off<00:03:50.470> the

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620

just want to stir them in turn off the
heat<00:03:50.829> and<00:03:51.069> then<00:03:51.159> I<00:03:51.909> like<00:03:52.209> to<00:03:52.359> let<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.629> soup

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
heat and then I like to let the soup

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.809 
heat and then I like to let the soup
rest<00:03:53.230> for<00:03:54.190> a<00:03:54.220> few<00:03:54.489> minutes<00:03:55.019> before<00:03:56.019> serving<00:03:56.470> up

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
the soup which will help with the

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.729 
the soup which will help with the
digestion<00:04:06.669> of<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:07.000> spinach<00:04:07.480> and<00:04:08.109> also<00:04:08.560> make

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
digestion of the spinach and also make

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.280
