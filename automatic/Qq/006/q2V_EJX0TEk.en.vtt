00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
he got knocked out very very early so I

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.700 
he got knocked out very very early so I
mean<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.880> guess<00:01:54.479> when<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.049> can't<00:01:55.290> relate<00:01:55.560> when

mean I guess when you can't relate when

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.170 
mean I guess when you can't relate when
you<00:01:55.770> can't<00:01:55.950> really<00:01:56.070> beat<00:01:56.280> Bray<00:01:56.549> Wyatt<00:01:56.880> it's

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
you can't really beat Bray Wyatt it's

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.340 
you can't really beat Bray Wyatt it's
kind<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.420> hard<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.630> think<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.899> can<00:01:58.049> take<00:01:58.229> on

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350
