00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.859
 hello everyone today we're going 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.870
 begin our third recipe 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.849
 dessert actually so as we touch to 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.549
 the end of our recipe marathon 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.200
 Christmas I took out the beautiful hat so 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.020
 so we're really in the holidays 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:24.570
 and so today we will make a 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.369
 Mango ice cream recipe a little 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.529
 special make it a mango ice cream 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.260
 vanilla with lime 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.059
 so all there the list of ingredients and 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.830
 the quantities you will find on the 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.510
 blog as usual the link in the 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.299
 info bar and we'll start everything from 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.210
 next we will first peel the mango 

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:44.430
 a beautiful mende it must be a 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.510
 slightly soft to the touch and normally the 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.670
 flesh must be orange 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.769
 so here I will discover at the same time 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.269
 that you if I have some good ones 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.000
 shots 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.739
 apparently yes that's fine she's 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.049
 mature she is at points so we 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.049
 stuffed animals and it's gone 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.390
 So now we have finished 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.850
 peel 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.050
 to be able to cut it into pieces I leave 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.050
 at my post 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.650
 the stern is first a cheek the ideal 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.300
 it is to have a knife that is a little 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:39.300
 bigger mine mine a little psy I 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:48.759
 am not very good fofana 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:52.320
 the other day you see a little damaged 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:55.479
 game in front of the saints have done the sides 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.160
 It's super stringy so it's very 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:07.390
 although at this moment it is 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:10.479
 also in ice so that's the moment 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.550
 very glamorous - do not care 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.780
 fingers 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.970
 So here we are trying to recover a little 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.150
 what we can there is very stringy 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:23.280
 so we will eat it I think the fauna 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:26.560
 will suck kernel as they say in Creole 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:33.810
 so here is my live the little woods that 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:36.579
 are damaged have the cut into pieces 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.860
 that's not too small but not too big 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:41.130
 because after we'll have to pass them 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.130
 blender 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.240
 hop 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.340
 and we will put them in a bag 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:10.410
 freezing during the fact for the 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:12.950
 banana ice well your bag r 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.640
 you will put me in the freezer 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:27.630
 put in the freezer 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:28.890
 apparently I need to move on and 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.840
 so now let 's leave 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.280
 for a few hours and then I'll you 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.470
 find again just now 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.730
 defrosting and migration 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.730
 and ice 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.490
 So here after two hours of passage 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.580
 in the freezer in the bag of 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.530
 freezing the bananas are frozen 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:54.000
 so there I took them out there pretty much 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:56.490
 see in these hard then imany the 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.260
 mangos and by henri the wolf world are 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.930
 hard there and I took them out of 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.910
 freezer and there are about 5 10 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.190
 minutes so like that it has time to 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.620
 to soften a little so there we can have 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.150
 a little consistency so what are we going 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.240
 do now is we go I have 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.220
 pressed to half a lime so that 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.650
 I have that I have here that I love you excuse in 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.410
 is we going to put a little bit of vanilla 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.180
 lh2 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.320
 that's what we actually do 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.940
 it's vanilla that comes from 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.660
 souama the purse of the meeting I 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:28.590
 know more so we did it in two 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.590
 believe I already showed you 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.850
 it's a little cataclysmic 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.190
 because my vanilla is completely 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:46.730
 dried up it is old and there in 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:55.220
 do we will scratch to recover the 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:57.890
 seeds inside you take a 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.240
 half vanilla pod about to 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.590
 take a little less if you want if 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.840
 you do not have vanilla you can 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.410
 you can simply take some 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.910
 the aroma of vanilla so there some 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.380
 sufficient drops it is not worth it no 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.010
 Latin good there I'll stop the cement 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.010
 I mean not hurt myself 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.960
 I never throw the vanilla bean 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:21.740
 I get it back and put it in 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.870
 the coffee that I do not drink from elsewhere 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.320
 it's for the guests or in my 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.180
 bed 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.010
 it's very good gray we can put it 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.400
 in quinoa it gives a very good taste 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:33.860
 then the dish that's 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:43.040
 put the vanilla lemon juice back 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:46.850
 lime and we'll be able to smooth if 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:48.280
 you want if you want this 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.410
 be so 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.389
 more liquid it is the find that it is 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:55.330
 too hard I will add a little bit 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:56.980
 of water is still a little juice of 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.630
 lemon for example a little bit of 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.280
 vegetable milk if you want me 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:04.710
 I will try to do it like that 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.710
 without adding as you go 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:13.990
 I go and I find you after that 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.300
 I finished mixing so as you 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:19.660
 can see I have gasse there it's 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:23.080
 So the really good gasse is soft 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.970
 still, then, look carefully 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.600
 appearance it must have some 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.220
 consistency 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.050
 you see it really looks like the 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.610
 ice cream except that there is no 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.900
 there is no cream 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:35.590
 it's just vanilla mango 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.720
 and lime 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.980
 so what I'm going to do is that 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.010
 I will make a nice presentation 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:43.690
 quickly done in a in a pretty edge a 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.610
 nice plate and then I take in 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.680
 pictures before it then melts us 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.150
 we're going to eat that we're going to revel in 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.580
 that even if we refuse a snack where we 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:53.500
 would reach 9 months well it's okay 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.690
 and then I would put you a picture of his 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.940
 on the blog so the link will be in the 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.440
 info bar i hope that his 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.990
 recipes you liked 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.450
 and then I tell you right away 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.460
 for the last teil the last 

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:09.280
 dessert recipe that will be a cake 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:11.550
 which is very likely to please you 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.550
 chip
