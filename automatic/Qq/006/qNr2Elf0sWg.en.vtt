00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
there there are a few people out there

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.150 
there there are a few people out there
who<00:02:04.300> do<00:02:05.300> it<00:02:05.420> full-time<00:02:05.660> be<00:02:06.319> carving<00:02:06.709> full-time

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
who do it full-time be carving full-time

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.350 
who do it full-time be carving full-time
but<00:02:07.369> very<00:02:07.640> few<00:02:08.170> am<00:02:09.170> probably<00:02:09.890> know<00:02:10.310> I<00:02:10.640> can<00:02:11.180> can

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
but very few am probably know I can can

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.270 
but very few am probably know I can can
count<00:02:11.599> on<00:02:11.810> one<00:02:12.290> hand<00:02:12.319> how<00:02:12.739> many<00:02:12.860> people

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
count on one hand how many people

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.070 
count on one hand how many people
actually<00:02:13.370> carve<00:02:13.819> full-time<00:02:14.360> in<00:02:14.599> the<00:02:14.690> country

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
actually carve full-time in the country

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.250 
actually carve full-time in the country
and<00:02:15.560> so<00:02:16.280> you<00:02:16.340> have<00:02:17.239> to<00:02:17.420> go<00:02:19.239> overseas<00:02:20.239> really<00:02:21.110> to

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
and so you have to go overseas really to

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.430 
and so you have to go overseas really to
find<00:02:21.500> some<00:02:22.190> of<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.900> European<00:02:23.900> Carver's<00:02:24.410> and

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
even that is hard to find now that's

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.790 
even that is hard to find now that's
sort<00:02:31.940> of<00:02:32.000> disappearing<00:02:32.660> but<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.260> ones<00:02:33.620> who

carving<00:02:56.810> phases<00:02:57.290> so<00:02:57.620> difficult<00:02:58.070> is<00:02:58.340> when

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
carving phases so difficult is when

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.340 
carving phases so difficult is when
there's<00:02:58.940> a<00:02:59.000> particular<00:02:59.540> mood<00:02:59.810> that<00:03:00.020> you<00:03:00.140> try

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
particular person so the mood that they

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.690 
particular person so the mood that they
want<00:03:09.740> is<00:03:09.980> very<00:03:10.060> kind<00:03:11.060> of<00:03:11.200> regal<00:03:12.200> and<00:03:12.770> classic
