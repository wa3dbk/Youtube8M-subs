already made the lifestyle shift but
it's<00:00:30.269> helping<00:00:30.539> them<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.869> identify<00:00:31.040> any<00:00:32.040> weak

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
it's helping them to identify any weak

points in their in their body system so
for<00:00:35.550> instance<00:00:35.820> your<00:00:35.940> adrenal<00:00:36.420> system<00:00:36.600> your

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
for instance your adrenal system your

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.530 
for instance your adrenal system your
thyroid<00:00:37.559> system<00:00:37.950> you'll<00:00:38.520> liver<00:00:38.879> your

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
thyroid system you'll liver your

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.520 
thyroid system you'll liver your
digestion<00:00:40.460> and<00:00:41.480> various<00:00:42.480> other<00:00:42.690> organs<00:00:43.170> if

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.090 
one of those systems is not working well
you<00:00:46.050> can<00:00:46.800> be<00:00:46.920> taking<00:00:47.309> in<00:00:47.430> all<00:00:47.809> the<00:00:48.809> high

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
you can be taking in all the high

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.250 
you can be taking in all the high
nutrient<00:00:50.100> foods<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.850> can<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.449> you

nutrient foods that you can and you

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.110 
nutrient foods that you can and you
still<00:00:52.620> may<00:00:52.770> not<00:00:52.949> achieve<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.640> results<00:00:54.090> that

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
still may not achieve the results that

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.299 
still may not achieve the results that
you're<00:00:54.360> looking<00:00:54.660> for<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.079> what<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.860> may<00:00:56.129> need

is a specific strategy to improve your
digestion<00:00:59.010> for<00:00:59.340> instance<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.359> some<00:01:00.570> cases

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
digestion for instance so in some cases

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.650 
digestion for instance so in some cases
this<00:01:01.140> could<00:01:01.379> mean<00:01:02.090> supplementing<00:01:03.090> digestive

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
this could mean supplementing digestive

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.230 
this could mean supplementing digestive
enzymes<00:01:04.080> or<00:01:04.379> using<00:01:04.920> various<00:01:05.339> herbs<00:01:05.670> to

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240

for is any type of special toxicity in

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.359 
for is any type of special toxicity in
the<00:01:30.390> system<00:01:30.720> whether<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.140> be<00:01:31.380> heavy<00:01:31.979> metal

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
the system whether that be heavy metal

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.130 
the system whether that be heavy metal
toxicity<00:01:32.939> whether<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.360> be<00:01:33.479> pesticide

digestive toxins and helping you to

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.330 
digestive toxins and helping you to
formulate<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.540> strategy<00:01:39.950> to<00:01:40.950> actually

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
formulate a strategy to actually

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.039 
formulate a strategy to actually
eliminate<00:01:41.790> those<00:01:41.970> things<00:01:42.299> from<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.570> body<00:01:42.780> so

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
eliminate those things from the body so

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.530 
eliminate those things from the body so
in<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.259> cases<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.950> heavy<00:01:44.520> metal<00:01:44.880> toxicity

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
in the cases of of heavy metal toxicity

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.649 
in the cases of of heavy metal toxicity
we<00:01:45.960> may<00:01:46.140> need<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.439> use<00:01:47.280> certain<00:01:48.060> substances

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
we may need to use certain substances

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.990 
we may need to use certain substances
which<00:01:48.869> actually<00:01:49.350> chelate<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:49.979> take<00:01:50.820> these

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
which actually chelate and take these

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.819 
which actually chelate and take these
things<00:01:51.210> out<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.630> body<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.320> if<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.530> find

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
things out of the body so if you find

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.560 
things out of the body so if you find
that<00:01:52.890> you've<00:01:53.100> got<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.280> parasite<00:01:53.970> infection<00:01:54.479> in

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
the system we've got to get a strategy

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.069 
the system we've got to get a strategy
together<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:57.240> actually<00:01:57.659> deal<00:01:57.869> with<00:01:57.899> that

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
together to actually deal with that
