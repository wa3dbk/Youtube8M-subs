00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.880
 hydrotherapy jo rehabilitation aquatic is a comprehensive method 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.029
 where by the way he showed exercises in the water 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:15.619
 in Udinese know how to swim 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.619
 it is not necessary to put your head in the water 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.990
 7 these exercises that we do even some people who have 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:27.689
 much fear of water can do it I have taken that the order 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.099
 The plantation 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.589
 one of the properties of water that helps us 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:33.430
 to work on it 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.850
 what do we worry about when we accomplish much less working with 10% 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.660
 from our apartment 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.160
 with which we feel much lighter in the water 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.780
 myspace too 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.300
 what the vertebrae that decompress 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.900
 meanwhile the vertebrae of the spine as the joints 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.390
 this is abysmal to get into the water 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.550
 e makes our elders 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.200
 ghiggia libya 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.850
 another one of the properties that the pressure the pressure is the pressure that there is 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.230
 of the uege on our body 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.520
 massage that is given 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.760
 from the ankles in ascending form with which 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.050
 So we give the venous return 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.010
 this benefit is ideal for dilma reduction 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.040
 the heat is another of the benefits we mark in summer of heat yes 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.120
 because in this life is heated up to 30 degrees with which the afe 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.170
 nerve endings of our body 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.580
 initiator month dn 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.310
 therefore there was no lorenzo of bread disappearing very much of the 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.170
 jobs 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.170
 although older adults there is a structural change 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.209
 this structural change cedar eloquence or they become more fragile 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.060
 the joints that become sharper 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.060
 the muscles that there are more in four cinemas yelmo 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.490
 and with force 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.490
 all this makes the older adult 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.400
 surplus 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.960
 ee advanced 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.110
 Even still the pain 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.039
 how to reverse all this 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.369
 being the exercise if the water is the 

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:13.979
 the activity method 

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:17.189
 revert and you are not doing exercises in the water 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.789
 2 making him 

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:25.159
 and is that the person tina maze autonomy another of the most common things are the 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:26.629
 three problems the uma 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.319
 beak is arthritis or arthritis 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.209
 where mobility is restricted 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.469
 water makes mobility 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:37.980
 that this one recovers with which we have much more force 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.749
 much more percent and much less much less pain when acquiring the 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:47.939
 strength another basis other pathologies that are treated in the water are those 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:49.289
 postoperative 

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:54.009
 operative lopez replacement quality knee replacement or 

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:55.289
 said lugo 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:59.559
 One hundred what is what is done is to make a treatment for eastern league 

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:01.439
 kinesiology in you 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:02.439
 and in water 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:03.780
 what we achieved 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.510
 it's all a housing reduction because of this we talk about people and leave 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.510
 that act in the region that acted in the water on our body 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:15.989
 the meticulous by here regiments of the 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.119
 they will astiazarán and nations nervous of the pain 

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:23.049
 is with which the recovery in these postoperative 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.699
 much faster 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:29.839
 yesterday cervera and urológicas that we can do is ask that they have an evolution 

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:32.189
 better in the water 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:35.450
 the water which makes our body support with which 

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:38.899
 neurological problems like 

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:41.099
 parkinson like 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:42.529
 aceves oil 

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:45.529
 a vascular brain accident 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.260
 george improves a lot especially the march because the water just 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:51.789
 hold
