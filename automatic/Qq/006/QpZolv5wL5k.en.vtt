00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.639
 hello everyone and welcome to wildlife 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.560
 apps it's gone for a selection of 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.240
 five new apps for your mobile 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.500
 for starters I propose to do 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.449
 the circuit tour 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.830
 a very nice application for iphone 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.510
 and android which is defined as a 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.670
 local social network 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.960
 in other words, sticking to it allows you to 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.310
 follow the activity of the author networks 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.650
 that they are physically located at 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.360
 a few meters where kilometers from you there 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.440
 may be other users of 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.649
 the app but also your contacts 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.700
 facebook google + or twitter from 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.750
 when you have saved your 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.820
 accounts in the app 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.469
 then the circle principle remains 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.120
 pretty classic once registered you 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.010
 can follow where is followed by others 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.809
 users post messages 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.840
 visible by everyone in the 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.129
 also sharing on facebook or twitter 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.329
 do you like to react to the publications of 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.949
 others and finally engage 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.289
 private conversations using the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.539
 in-app messaging 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.520
 brief circle is not only a 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.019
 exciting new way to follow his 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.220
 contacts but also to worry 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.750
 new not far from home 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.040
 we just regretted that 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.260
 the application does not integrate an engine of 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.640
 search to find contacts and 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.560
 they are for the moment while 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.360
 English but since it's free 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.320
 does not cost anything to try and adopt it 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.470
 Up to you 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.090
 on iphone and on android so and for 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.140
 the download the qr code is displayed in 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.140
 this moment on the screen 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.630
 if you follow von ah ben it's without 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.520
 doubt that you also like to watch 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.960
 other videos on the web probably 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.220
 on your smartphone and for that there is 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.079
 much more than one application 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.520
 except that not all are equally 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.590
 successful that your diot that I propose to you 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.909
 to discover now your dios is a 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.710
 aggregator of videos from 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.509
 youtube classified by thematic tech 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.640
 viral music sport comedy movies news 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.140
 session and some of the best you 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.460
 you'll notice it's all in English 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.439
 but it's not really a problem 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.299
 the videos they can of course be 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.700
 in French and you can synchronize 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.020
 your youtube account to add the 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.460
 channels to which you subscribe 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.990
 as well as your facebook accounts and 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.399
 twitter to group all the videos 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.049
 posted by your contacts 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.490
 among the other functions of vaudieu 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.380
 we also enjoyed the research 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.549
 of videos by keyword the possibility of 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.590
 set aside the ones you want 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.869
 watch later video sharing 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.910
 by email sms facebook or twitter and 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.510
 activation or deactivation at the 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.459
 stolen 2 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.930
 hd during the reading finally and especially 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.159
 we liked the new suggestion 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.530
 video according to that which was 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:21.590
 already looked at and facebook profile 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.030
 finally your duos has an interface 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.290
 particularly neat and just for 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.060
 it's really worth the detour 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.310
 so if you have an iphone a 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.690
 ipad or an android smartphone this is the 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.260
 moment to download it because it is 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.260

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.409
 seventy thousand stations 2 million 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.060

 offers you tunein radio a 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.750
 application that was suggested to us by 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.250
 remy willebroeck and who like his name 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.200
 the indicated allows to listen to the radio with 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.849

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.519
 issues and debates but also by type 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.780
 of music and by language but you 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.730
 can also search for a station 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.900
 specific using the engine of 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.299
 search for the application 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.040
 knowing that tunein radio index also 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.139
 many audio podcasts for a 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.609
 offline listening of the broadcasts and

 the favorite section to find them 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.709
 then more easily compared to 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.629
 other applications in the same field 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.670
 tunein radio stands out not only 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:16.200
 with its very successful interface but 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.760
 also with its auto mode that allows you to 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.220
 no longer show on the sound screen 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.019

 his favorites at the last station listened to 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.449
 to that suggested by the application is 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.519
 to start a radio search 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:31.470
 practice driving a good app 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.239
 does so that is available no 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.760

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.139
 windows phone and blackberry is a 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.480
 free application of which there is a 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:40.470
 pro version at 6 euros which allows more 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.239

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.040

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.190
 reaper is a fighting game for iphone 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.959
 android and windows phone where you 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.940
 play as a little character with a 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.050
 big sword and who must fight all 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.480
 the monsters that is on his

 we fight in rather dark scenery 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.359
 but with very successful graphics and for 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.889
 it still needs to be presented in 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.030
 start of the game the few gestures that 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.919
 allow the enemy to be transported 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.720
 most devastating blows only remains 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.070
 more then to make a clean place on 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.350
 every battlefield to be able to 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.820

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.970
 but it's not too embarrassing and 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.470
 the first ten levels are free 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.380
 additional level packs 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.540
 costs between 4 and 5 euros that against 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.100

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.570
