what type of regular motion you've got
and<00:00:38.800> to<00:00:38.890> see<00:00:39.070> if<00:00:39.250> your<00:00:39.400> stretches<00:00:39.880> and

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
and to see if your stretches and

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.450 
and to see if your stretches and
training<00:00:40.750> is<00:00:40.840> improving<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:42.160> range<00:00:42.340> of

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
training is improving the range of

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.270 
training is improving the range of
motion<00:00:42.760> you<00:00:42.970> got<00:00:43.480> to<00:00:43.540> stand<00:00:43.860> back<00:00:44.860> up<00:00:44.920> and<00:00:45.130> get

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
motion you got to stand back up and get

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.220 
motion you got to stand back up and get
to<00:00:45.370> the<00:00:45.430> wall<00:00:45.640> and<00:00:45.910> you<00:00:46.360> want<00:00:46.570> to<00:00:46.630> flatten<00:00:47.140> out

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
to the wall and you want to flatten out

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.689 
to the wall and you want to flatten out
that<00:00:48.190> lower<00:00:48.370> back<00:00:48.640> position<00:00:49.239> and<00:00:50.010> keep<00:00:51.010> that

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
that lower back position and keep that

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.119 
that lower back position and keep that
low<00:00:51.940> back<00:00:52.149> flattened<00:00:52.780> and<00:00:53.019> see<00:00:53.739> if<00:00:53.829> you<00:00:53.980> can

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
low back flattened and see if you can

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:55.979 
low back flattened and see if you can
get<00:00:54.370> into<00:00:54.820> an<00:00:54.910> overhead<00:00:55.269> position<00:00:55.510> with<00:00:55.899> your

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
get into an overhead position with your

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.099 
get into an overhead position with your
arms<00:00:56.140> without<00:00:56.910> changing<00:00:57.910> the<00:00:58.510> position<00:00:58.960> of

00:00:59.099 --> 00:00:59.109 
arms without changing the position of

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:01.919 
arms without changing the position of
the<00:00:59.170> ribs<00:00:59.379> position<00:01:00.010> the<00:01:00.129> spine<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:01.420> can<00:01:01.449> see

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:01.929 
the ribs position the spine you can see

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:03.540 
the ribs position the spine you can see
you<00:01:02.379> might<00:01:02.559> be<00:01:02.739> able<00:01:02.859> to<00:01:02.949> see<00:01:03.100> that<00:01:03.280> this

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
you might be able to see that this

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.730 
you might be able to see that this
shoulder<00:01:03.910> is<00:01:04.269> in<00:01:04.510> a<00:01:04.570> bit<00:01:04.900> different<00:01:05.350> position

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
shoulder is in a bit different position

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.100 
shoulder is in a bit different position
than<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:05.980> left<00:01:06.190> one<00:01:06.280> so<00:01:07.000> I'm<00:01:07.060> a<00:01:07.150> bit<00:01:07.360> limited

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
than the left one so I'm a bit limited

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.400 
than the left one so I'm a bit limited
in<00:01:08.380> some<00:01:08.710> flexion<00:01:10.020> mobility<00:01:11.020> through<00:01:11.320> this

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
in some flexion mobility through this

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.850 
in some flexion mobility through this
shoulder<00:01:11.680> and<00:01:12.010> so<00:01:12.659> what<00:01:13.659> you'll<00:01:13.780> see<00:01:13.810> often<00:01:14.140> is

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
shoulder and so what you'll see often is

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.090 
shoulder and so what you'll see often is
that<00:01:14.920> guys<00:01:15.310> they're<00:01:15.640> stuck<00:01:15.970> in<00:01:16.120> this<00:01:16.270> posture

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
that guys they're stuck in this posture

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.920 
that guys they're stuck in this posture
they<00:01:18.100> can't<00:01:18.340> get<00:01:18.520> overhead<00:01:19.000> so<00:01:19.660> what<00:01:19.750> they<00:01:19.870> do

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
they can't get overhead so what they do

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.560 
they can't get overhead so what they do
is<00:01:20.470> start<00:01:20.860> arching<00:01:21.160> through<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:21.820> low<00:01:21.970> back<00:01:22.240> to

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
is start arching through the low back to

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.720 
is start arching through the low back to
get<00:01:22.720> overhead<00:01:23.170> so<00:01:23.770> think<00:01:24.040> about<00:01:24.160> your<00:01:24.430> spine

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:24.730 
get overhead so think about your spine

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.400 
get overhead so think about your spine
being<00:01:25.030> in<00:01:25.210> that<00:01:25.330> position<00:01:25.510> and<00:01:26.050> trying<00:01:26.260> to

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
being in that position and trying to

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.520 
being in that position and trying to
paddle<00:01:26.770> you're<00:01:27.700> just<00:01:27.910> constantly<00:01:28.530> grinding

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
paddle you're just constantly grinding

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.260 
paddle you're just constantly grinding
through<00:01:29.830> that<00:01:30.040> shoulder<00:01:30.430> girdle<00:01:30.820> bursitis

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
through that shoulder girdle bursitis

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.620 
through that shoulder girdle bursitis
tendinitis<00:01:32.190> upset<00:01:33.190> to<00:01:33.430> stop<00:01:33.670> shoulders<00:01:34.150> so

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
tendinitis upset to stop shoulders so

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.240 
tendinitis upset to stop shoulders so
you<00:01:34.720> need<00:01:34.930> to<00:01:35.170> be<00:01:35.260> able<00:01:35.320> to<00:01:35.440> regain<00:01:36.010> mobility

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
you need to be able to regain mobility

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.070 
you need to be able to regain mobility
through<00:01:36.790> the<00:01:36.850> spine<00:01:37.150> flexibility<00:01:37.930> through

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
through the spine flexibility through

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.480 
through the spine flexibility through
the<00:01:38.170> tissue<00:01:38.350> so<00:01:38.950> you<00:01:39.040> can<00:01:39.160> get<00:01:39.280> into<00:01:39.400> that

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
the tissue so you can get into that

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.610 
the tissue so you can get into that
vertical<00:01:40.030> position<00:01:40.510> and<00:01:40.720> start<00:01:41.320> getting

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
vertical position and start getting

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.899 
vertical position and start getting
range<00:01:42.220> of<00:01:42.430> motion

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
range of motion

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.060 
range of motion
so<00:01:43.090> you<00:01:43.149> can<00:01:43.450> start<00:01:43.810> paddling<00:01:44.469> rather<00:01:44.890> than

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
so you can start paddling rather than

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.350 
so you can start paddling rather than
being<00:01:45.250> one<00:01:45.399> of<00:01:45.460> those<00:01:45.610> old<00:01:45.850> dudes<00:01:46.090> out<00:01:46.299> there

vertical shoulder position you can feel

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.750 
vertical shoulder position you can feel
this<00:02:25.720> might<00:02:26.260> be<00:02:26.410> it's<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:26.739> lot<00:02:27.040> of<00:02:27.099> laughs<00:02:27.459> you

and breathing and so you might feel that

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.280 
and breathing and so you might feel that
low<00:02:37.000> back<00:02:37.299> you<00:02:37.540> might<00:02:37.750> feel<00:02:37.959> that<00:02:37.989> in<00:02:38.230> the
