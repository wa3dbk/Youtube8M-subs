could do it was that have our focus to
you<00:02:18.670> you<00:02:19.120> got<00:02:19.270> in<00:02:19.480> folks<00:02:19.810> i<00:02:20.050> got<00:02:20.230> it<00:02:20.319> right<00:02:20.470> up

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
you you got in folks i got it right up

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.180 
you you got in folks i got it right up
by<00:02:21.220> got<00:02:21.400> close<00:02:21.700> but<00:02:21.730> as<00:02:22.420> far<00:02:22.720> as<00:02:22.780> as<00:02:23.680> far<00:02:23.800> as<00:02:24.069> it

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
by got close but as far as as far as it

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:31.530 
by got close but as far as as far as it
you'd<00:02:24.310> go<00:02:25.020> was<00:02:26.020> a<00:02:26.050> chimney<00:02:26.440> to<00:02:26.590> our<00:02:26.739> host<00:02:27.280> me

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.030 

so<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:32.660> one<00:02:32.840> I<00:02:33.020> think<00:02:33.170> that<00:02:33.590> hasn't<00:02:33.890> really

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
so that one I think that hasn't really

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.130 
so that one I think that hasn't really
changed<00:02:34.190> is<00:02:34.640> that<00:02:34.670> one<00:02:35.000> yeah<00:02:35.440> Stanley<00:02:36.440> system
