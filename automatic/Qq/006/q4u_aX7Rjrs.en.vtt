 on the horizon the Japanese ball 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.980
 decided to go beyond the homeland and 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.890
 introduced one of the first phone from 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.960
 palych displays and lost on their background 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.970
 very distinctive and inclined american

 mobile phone concepts but today we 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.570
 let's talk about her and her latest 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.620
 okay, meet motorola droid razr 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.600
 maxx hd 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.210
 with all its appearance this smartphone shows 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.610
 I'm cool because I'm a man 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.770
 there is no place for hipster lotions 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.750
 or zadornova gloss glossy Chinese 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.030

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.770
 by weight 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.329
 slightly burdening the arm is 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.960
 clear evidence of this 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.120
 statements 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.550
 build quality is great if at all 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.220
 not the best on the market nothing creaks no 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.740
 dangling does not depart and does not stagger on 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.049
 the front panel is located capacitive 4 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.670
 and a 7 inch super amoled display with 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.860
 already become standard and miracle 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.780

 covering the whole apparatus 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.470
 the quality of the display despite its controversial 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.020
 technology does not cause any 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.920
 complaints besides the visibility of information on 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.890
 bright sun 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.350
 however this is the weak point of all amulets in 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.600
 the rest is not inherent 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.780
 such a display cold blue-green

 they settled down as usual to everyone

 the latter is very convenient as possible

 hot swap flash drive and if 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.650
 you do not have enough built-in 32 gigabytes

 225 distinctive feature of which 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.130
 is not so much a record 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.320
 performance as careful 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.510
 battery charge is low 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.400
 heat dissipation and support of the whole galaxy 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.200
 network frequency works it all under

 motoblur shell 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.859
 which is a great help 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.870
 among similar sentences of others 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.700
 manufacturers thanks to logical 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.130
 convenient and useful expansion and 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.780
 supplement commonly found in

 custom firmware from third-party 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.500
 programs the only drawback 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.569
 from time to time the device decides it's time 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.280
 would slow down what is happening 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.389
 not often until decides with installation 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.760
 third-party launcher 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:06.440
 However, all these are just words because 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.060
 the main thing is that there is a battery 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.340
 volume in three thousand three hundred 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.470
 milliamp clock allowing apparatus 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.480
 work is not something that day use 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.820
 average person and almost 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.010
 full two days with mixed 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.870
 high load while you 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.880
 will be putting competing solution on 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.810
 charging at the end of their working day as 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.300
 i.e. light 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.220
 with motorola rizr mix hd you will 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.470
 sure that whatever you are 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.110
 the tasks you performed did not play 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.300
 filmed photographed or listened 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.970
 music you don't have to worry about 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.710
 availability of a number of sockets can be summarized 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.500
 say that the motorola came out great 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.510
 phone beautiful okay tailored long 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.730
 working not much crouching in terms of 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.680
 performance alas get it in 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.330
 there is no official opportunity in our area 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.110
 no and in the foreseeable future 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.190
 foreseen 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.680
 so have to take advantage 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.570
 gray market offers tangible 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.460
 overpaying or ordering machines 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.210
 abroad directly but with 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.550
 intermediaries 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:05.140
 that puts some risk with our
