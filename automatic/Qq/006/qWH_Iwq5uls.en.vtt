00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:09.290
 the c贸rdoba did not know how to keep the c贸rdoba 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:11.530
 that advantage on the scoreboard has not been 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.690
 been impossible the team has made a 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.980
 superhuman effort 90 minutes with a 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.999
 player less 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.970
 we have come to anticipate but 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:25.640
 Well, I'm about to do a little bit of 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.159
 change to keep a little more the 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:32.040
 result because we got the tie and 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:34.110
 since then it has been I think a little 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.330
 the referee also who has helped us 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.330
 nothing I think has been overpriced 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:42.360
 we have fought us everything 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:45.690
 everything we have been able to do today we have 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.320
 to return to C贸rdoba with the empty bag 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.910
 but we have to think that we have 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.850
 fought we have put everything that 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.590
 we had and at the end everything can not be 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.470
 you can not ask for more it is a pity 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.360
 because I think that after 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.220
 overtake with 10 was much 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.550
 match ahead but but we had 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.550
 hopes you saw that the team even 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.870
 I was trying to find the second good 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.730
 key has been the move of 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.320
 that we were able to score the goal with 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.440
 baby already against 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.230
 we have marked the second them and already 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.940
 it was too hard to talk about the referee 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.070
 you say that they have somehow been primed 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.660
 today with the cordoba three reds you have 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.070
 seen and on your team as 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.170
 poses the next game against 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.870
 athletic of madrid our three red 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.990
 yes, it speaks that it will be necessary to recompose 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:38.200
 as we can, we are a template 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.360
 wide and those that are will have to 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.060
 give the most because because it is a 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.840
 final I think we go with three 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.690
 players less virtually without 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.790
 fouls and rough play if you make it 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.920
 well says a lot about this 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.270
 referee that good I see many matches 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.180
 on TV and the truth is that it's not the 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.240
 first time I see that I see that he has the 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.759
 pretty loose hand 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.119
 we have been punished very badly 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.130
 hard I have already very easy we have seen 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.780
 go through here at the end of the match 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.239
 your colleagues quite touched how 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.459
 you are in the mood if we are not 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.890
 very hurt because we had seen that 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.319
 the days had given results 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.269
 favorable to us in case of 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.880
 win today we put ourselves at a distance 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:27.720
 than with the points that were left 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.180
 ahead then we could take a step 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.310
 very important forward and well then not 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.310
 it has not been like that because of a circumstance 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.720
 another we have to raise our heads 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.200
 there are still many matches left for 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.810
 throw in the towel and let them know that not the 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.959
 c贸rdoba is not going to be dropped thanks 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.959
 and encourage
