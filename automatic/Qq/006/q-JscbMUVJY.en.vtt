and you can feel the buttons going in
you<00:02:34.880> got<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.030> lot<00:02:35.210> of<00:02:35.270> space<00:02:35.540> it's<00:02:36.260> very<00:02:36.350> easy<00:02:36.500> to

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
you got a lot of space it's very easy to

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.890 
you got a lot of space it's very easy to
navigate<00:02:37.300> you<00:02:38.300> haven't<00:02:38.540> gained<00:02:38.690> too<00:02:38.870> much

size<00:02:40.630> on<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.840> handset<00:02:42.170> when<00:02:42.830> compared<00:02:43.190> with

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
size on the handset when compared with

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.780 
size on the handset when compared with
the<00:02:43.910> standard<00:02:44.270> with<00:02:44.390> us<00:02:45.190> as<00:02:46.190> you<00:02:46.310> can<00:02:46.430> see<00:02:46.580> here

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
the standard with us as you can see here

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.610 
the standard with us as you can see here
what<00:02:47.600> they<00:02:47.690> have<00:02:47.840> done<00:02:47.870> is<00:02:48.200> reduce<00:02:48.500> the

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
what they have done is reduce the

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.640 
what they have done is reduce the
megapixel<00:02:49.160> from<00:02:49.700> eight<00:02:50.110> on<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.260> standard<00:02:51.590> of

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
megapixel from eight on the standard of

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.360 
megapixel from eight on the standard of
has<00:02:52.180> 25<00:02:53.180> on<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.480> vivaz<00:02:53.780> pro<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.950> reason<00:02:55.220> being

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
has 25 on the vivaz pro the reason being

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.150 
has 25 on the vivaz pro the reason being
is<00:02:55.910> to<00:02:56.090> keep<00:02:56.270> this<00:02:56.690> very<00:02:56.930> small<00:02:57.560> size

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
is to keep this very small size

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.700 
is to keep this very small size
difference<00:02:58.840> again<00:02:59.840> you<00:03:00.020> have<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.290> hard<00:03:00.470> keys

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
difference again you have the hard keys

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.650 
difference again you have the hard keys
so<00:03:01.610> it's<00:03:01.730> pretty<00:03:01.820> much<00:03:02.000> exactly<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.480> same

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
so it's pretty much exactly the same

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.540 
so it's pretty much exactly the same
handset<00:03:03.020> you've<00:03:03.620> got<00:03:03.770> the<00:03:03.860> same<00:03:04.040> benefits

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
handset you've got the same benefits

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.010 
handset you've got the same benefits
from<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:06.070> customizability<00:03:07.070> on<00:03:07.490> the<00:03:08.020> shortcut

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020

the<00:03:11.210> pretty<00:03:11.390> much<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.600> same<00:03:11.720> answer<00:03:11.930> we're

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
the pretty much the same answer we're
