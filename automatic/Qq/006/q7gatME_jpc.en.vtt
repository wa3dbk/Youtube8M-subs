anyone could pick up and enjoy and read

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.660 
anyone could pick up and enjoy and read
then<00:03:12.050> there's<00:03:12.290> no<00:03:12.350> reason<00:03:12.710> that<00:03:13.250> they

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
then there's no reason that they

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.860 
then there's no reason that they
shouldn't<00:03:14.000> be<00:03:14.030> where<00:03:14.209> people<00:03:14.420> can<00:03:14.540> see<00:03:14.720> them

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
shouldn't be where people can see them

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.230 
shouldn't be where people can see them
the<00:03:15.140> comics<00:03:15.560> are<00:03:15.800> just<00:03:16.550> starting<00:03:16.880> to<00:03:17.000> find

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.240 
the comics are just starting to find

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.090 
the comics are just starting to find
their<00:03:17.360> place<00:03:17.570> in<00:03:17.660> library<00:03:18.230> so<00:03:18.590> I<00:03:18.620> think<00:03:18.980> it's

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
their place in library so I think it's
