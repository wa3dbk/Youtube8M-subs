00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.030
 Mr. steffel 3321 the most exciting 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.889
 role-playing games that currently make countries 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.780
 are also technical that is now in 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.849
 the apg . has a world scenario freight 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.070
 very interesting we have with it 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.050
 theoretically I hope halfway right 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.240
 pronounced the song engine developer 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.589
 entertained by cd project and some 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.900
 in-depth questions about the engine 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.580
 We know that the wiper 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.529
 three part of the way it's meant to be 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.329
 nvidia is and 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.820
 own techniques such as tessellation 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:36.000
 soft particle filtering reflection to 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.100
 but also use nvidias hd + and 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.660
 accelerated physics uses gpu 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.280
 a particularly impressive player 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.110
 To guarantee the life of the gpu 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.520
 accelerated physics through 46 has us 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.260
 especially interested in it eventually 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.570
 cd's project actually known 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.250
 that they are drm proprietary solutions 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.420
 and other customer ganged distance 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.490
 At least here we can take 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.980
 give partial warning at the moment 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.420
 all the effects on the cpu run 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.740
 However, high rock ammunition will be 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.390
 completely taken over by the gpu 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.190
 We will learn about it 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.780
 but fortunately that's it 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.640
 not limited to nvidia graphics cards 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.860
 is also on sd, for example 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.630
 cards will work unless either 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.950
 decides still a blocking of 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.390
 technology 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.920
 All 46 effects are possible 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.570
 enjoy the same from which manufacturer 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.490
 euro graphics card is required 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.810
 Of course she is coming too fast 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.130
 nvidia technology at the beautiful 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.200
 Water presentation for use 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.360
 in the development of the witcher 3 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.950
 experimented city project with the 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.810
 its own water then presentation 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.220
 sit down with nvidia and 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.110
 got from the graphics card manufacturer 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.729
 some insights into theirs 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.860
 technology from the collected 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.900
 cd project then tinkered 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.400
 your own water simulation itself 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.750
 different from nvidia fluid 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.470
 Tessellation is the water 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.000
 used electricity 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.950
 as will the landscape with the 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.960
 directx 11 technology embellished at 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.729
 models we character monsters and 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.140
 other objects but no 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.570
 Tessellation uses the technology 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.130
 set problematic to them on objects to 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.640
 to defend and cause in principle only 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.780
 problems with additional overhead 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.610
 it would be more reasonable only the techniques 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.229
 then use it more clearly 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.659
 optical gain would be expected 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.310
 on our question whether over sampling his 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.200
 would find back back in German 3 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.780
 said back that she was not sure yet 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.280
 are 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.080
 many players complained because 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.580
 their computers were not fast enough 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.110
 the economy two with maximum 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.959
 to play details and about sampling 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.160
 but cd project was the picture quality 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.730
 Do not forget enthusiasts and think 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.830
 about it 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.260
 maybe it might come in shape 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.080
 a later patch that would be from 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.290
 everything here is in the interview until 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.290
 denne
