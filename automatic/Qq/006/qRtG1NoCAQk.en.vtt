00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.880 
place bring around like this you can go
ahead<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.990> think<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.320> helps<00:01:58.560> if<00:01:58.680> these

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
ahead and I think it helps if these

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.590 
ahead and I think it helps if these
little<00:01:58.979> spines<00:01:59.399> here<00:01:59.909> those<00:02:00.180> there's<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.450> goal

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
little spines here those there's a goal

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.440 
little spines here those there's a goal
hook<00:02:01.200> if<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.770> put<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.100> on<00:02:02.280> top<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.880> then

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
hook if you put that on top and then

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.940 
hook if you put that on top and then
flip<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.899> legs<00:02:04.110> down<00:02:04.320> these<00:02:04.560> will<00:02:04.680> come<00:02:04.829> out

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
flip the legs down these will come out

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.370 
flip the legs down these will come out
just<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.250> little<00:02:05.280> bit<00:02:05.700> more<00:02:06.079> than<00:02:07.079> they<00:02:07.200> would

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
constitute Co the litter line which I

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.190 
constitute Co the litter line which I
don't<00:03:56.790> really<00:03:56.910> get<00:03:57.060> because<00:03:57.360> technically<00:03:57.720> in

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
don't really get because technically in

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.320 
don't really get because technically in
that<00:03:58.380> scene<00:03:58.650> he<00:03:58.950> was<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.310> little<00:03:59.520> one<00:03:59.550> so

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
that scene he was the little one so

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.300 
that scene he was the little one so
maybe<00:04:00.510> they<00:04:00.630> should<00:04:00.780> have<00:04:00.870> killed<00:04:01.050> him<00:04:01.320> but

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
maybe they should have killed him but

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
little bit of a fit in the form since I

had a similar microscope when I was a
kid<00:04:16.640> probably<00:04:17.640> not<00:04:17.820> nearly<00:04:18.030> as<00:04:18.150> high<00:04:18.270> quality

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
kid probably not nearly as high quality

kid probably not nearly as high quality
is<00:04:18.720> this<00:04:18.840> one<00:04:18.959> would<00:04:19.140> have<00:04:19.170> been<00:04:19.350> but<00:04:19.500> I

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
is this one would have been but I

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.010 
is this one would have been but I
remember<00:04:19.799> my<00:04:19.860> parents<00:04:20.010> got<00:04:20.280> me<00:04:20.370> a<00:04:20.400> microscope

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.020 
remember my parents got me a microscope

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.630 
remember my parents got me a microscope
for<00:04:22.020> Christmas<00:04:22.350> one<00:04:22.530> year<00:04:22.560> it<00:04:23.070> was<00:04:23.130> very<00:04:23.250> cool

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
for Christmas one year it was very cool

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.750 
for Christmas one year it was very cool
I<00:04:23.850> might<00:04:24.420> did<00:04:24.540> a<00:04:24.570> lot<00:04:24.750> of<00:04:24.840> things<00:04:25.020> with<00:04:25.200> it<00:04:25.760> so

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
I might did a lot of things with it so

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.580 
I might did a lot of things with it so
the<00:04:26.910> microscope<00:04:27.390> ball<00:04:27.570> mode<00:04:27.810> definitely<00:04:28.500> has

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
the microscope ball mode definitely has

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.070 
the microscope ball mode definitely has
some<00:04:28.740> nostalgia<00:04:29.220> for<00:04:29.400> me<00:04:29.660> and<00:04:30.660> he<00:04:30.750> was<00:04:30.840> kind<00:04:31.050> of

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
some nostalgia for me and he was kind of

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.440 
some nostalgia for me and he was kind of
a<00:04:31.170> cool<00:04:31.380> little<00:04:31.440> character<00:04:31.860> in<00:04:31.980> the<00:04:32.070> movie<00:04:32.450> so

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
a cool little character in the movie so

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.560 
a cool little character in the movie so
they<00:04:33.570> have<00:04:33.840> scalpel
