00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
now I have a lot of money like I start

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.630

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
doing boss seeing glaziers etc Slayer

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.270 
doing boss seeing glaziers etc Slayer
should<00:01:41.909> i<00:01:41.939> say<00:01:42.150> arm<00:01:42.530> and<00:01:43.530> i<00:01:43.710> made<00:01:43.860> my<00:01:43.979> money's

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
should i say arm and i made my money's

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.010 
should i say arm and i made my money's
then<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.670> start<00:01:44.909> cutting<00:01:45.060> ivy<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:45.810> think

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
then I start cutting ivy and I think

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.780 
then I start cutting ivy and I think
that's<00:01:46.170> like<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.409> lazy<00:01:46.619> way<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:46.950> go<00:01:47.220> but<00:01:47.759> I

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
that's like the lazy way to go but I

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.859 
that's like the lazy way to go but I
think<00:01:47.820> that's<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.210> right<00:01:48.390> way<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.600> go<00:01:48.689> because

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869
