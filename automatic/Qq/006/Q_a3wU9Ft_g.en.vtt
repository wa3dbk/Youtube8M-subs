00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.720 

the<00:00:10.170> watercraft<00:00:10.530> of<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.830> 90s<00:00:11.190> was<00:00:11.370> so<00:00:11.550> much

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.390 
the watercraft of the 90s was so much
fun<00:00:12.000> they<00:00:12.540> were<00:00:12.599> easy<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.380> toss<00:00:13.530> around<00:00:13.590> they

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
fun they were easy to toss around they

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.120 
fun they were easy to toss around they
had<00:00:14.549> good<00:00:15.269> zip<00:00:15.629> good<00:00:15.959> acceleration<00:00:16.289> and

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
had good zip good acceleration and

wasn't going fast it was going below for

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.339 
wasn't going fast it was going below for
around<00:00:20.250> 40<00:00:20.730> miles<00:00:20.939> per<00:00:21.090> hour<00:00:21.360> but<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.110> was

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:22.349 
around 40 miles per hour but this was

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:24.950 
around 40 miles per hour but this was
plenty<00:00:22.860> of<00:00:23.220> speed<00:00:23.640> given<00:00:24.270> the<00:00:24.419> feeling<00:00:24.840> of

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
plenty of speed given the feeling of
