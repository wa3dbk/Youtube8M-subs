00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.910
 And then the beauty people who will make someone 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.840
 not all welcome to another episode 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.010
 from minecraft adventure in the sky guys 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.070
 You must have seen this episode 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.050
 It is very short but it was the following is 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.240
 a very important thing that I have 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.030
 What to say to you who like this 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.590
 Our series here in the wild skies galera 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.150
 Bonfim are connected that I really like 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.920
 This series is one of my series 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.510
 here on the channel so much that the 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.730
 people passed 40 and floors 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.949
 something that is a little strange because 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.690
 usually I do not usually finish 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:47.410
 series c so they do not last long in the 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.170
 my channel 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.270
 But anyway, what do I have to do? 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.879
 tell you about this series 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.469
 which you like a lot I think and that 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.030
 I like it a lot too 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.670
 I could not post videos of this 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.129
 for the following reason I 'm not 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.610
 Can you play in my world? 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.960
 when I try to play gives a range 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.479
 monstrous mainly because our 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.360
 The map is full of machines and is very 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.070
 heavy and your attempt to record usually 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.369
 I can record more than five minutes 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.090
 before you badge it all and give a bug 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.770
 frantic and crazy then it was as follows 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.530
 Why will this bug happen to me? 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.810
 I know but I told you that I was going to 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.759
 I'm going to try to fix this from here. 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.220
 try to fix this here and if everything 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.710
 certain in a few days he will come back with 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.470
 force it if you want to give 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.840
 right and the reason for the series 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.000
 is mainly stopped is my pc 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.290
 guys my pc too bad 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.180
 Maybe I do not know if I said I did not 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.400
 it was a while ago but I had burned 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.829
 a part of it and a few days ago he 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.509
 problem is that one or other part then 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.030
 It's very complicated. 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.250
 Only if all goes well and some days 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.020
 arrives my new pc and arriving in a pc 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.610
 So much so, I'll try to bet more. 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.460
 channel videos when I'm going to try 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.420
 back with this and other series that are 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.640
 pretty cool 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.500
 so folks were met by understanding the 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.959
 fact that the note bringing video comes out of the 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.760
 our adventure in heaven and if you 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.690
 want me to continue with this 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.019
 series 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.910
 leave a comment telling guys there 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.190
 if all goes well then the next 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.000
 week at the most I'll be back here with 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.730
 this series 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.780
 I'll try during this time. 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.520
 improve some things on our map 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.890
 a few things to try 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.080
 in this series there as soon as possible 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.960
 but I did not want to leave you there is 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.030
 let's say without an explanation why 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.650
 a lot of people were asking why 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.750
 that she was not bringing any more videos from her 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.300
 because there is always a stop in the channel and 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.490
 No, I did not finish the series or think about 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.860
 finish without completing all the 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.330
 our missions guys who know I 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.090
 I have something to do. 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.070
 and we are in the vision of 40 and little I 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.810
 I think I can finish this series 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:00.910
 there by episode 60 or 70 then so 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.760
 that I can stabilize here in my 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.860
 map and get a new pc and probably 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.030
 put this map to be announced in 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.400
 a server 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.200
 there if he comes back with videos almost 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.360
 diaries for us to finish this series 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.490
 because I want to finish it and start 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.710
 a new series that I'm already there 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.990
 mind then this video here because 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.850
 it's a bonus video, but I think 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.160
 was a necessary and important video 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.960
 so that all those who like and 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.850
 channel and mainly like our 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.280
 adventure sky series here 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.020
 know that she is not finished and she goes 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.090
