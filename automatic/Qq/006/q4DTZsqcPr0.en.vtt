exactly<00:02:10.899> I<00:02:10.929> know<00:02:11.110> about<00:02:11.620> Arco<00:02:14.280> only<00:02:15.280> had<00:02:15.580> four

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000

shots<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:16.569> as<00:02:16.660> you<00:02:16.810> see<00:02:17.020> I<00:02:17.230> think<00:02:17.470> that<00:02:17.800> we

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
shots and as you see I think that we

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.309

this<00:03:10.860> one<00:03:10.940> what<00:03:11.940> happened<00:03:12.240> to<00:03:12.330> you<00:03:13.970> yeah<00:03:15.050> I

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
this one what happened to you yeah I

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.970 
this one what happened to you yeah I
didn't<00:03:16.620> really<00:03:16.830> get<00:03:16.980> my<00:03:17.160> point<00:03:17.490> across<00:03:18.980> from

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
didn't really get my point across from

the

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.930 

I<00:03:27.050> think<00:03:27.800> that<00:03:27.950> Paul<00:03:28.160> probably<00:03:28.670> didn't

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
I think that Paul probably didn't

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.180 
I think that Paul probably didn't
deserve<00:03:29.030> it<00:03:29.240> as<00:03:29.450> much<00:03:29.660> as<00:03:29.810> I<00:03:29.990> did<00:03:30.230> but<00:03:30.500> you<00:03:31.070> know

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
deserve it as much as I did but you know

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.190 
deserve it as much as I did but you know
I<00:03:31.220> got<00:03:31.580> my<00:03:31.730> walking<00:03:32.120> papers<00:03:32.150> right<00:03:32.690> there<00:03:32.960> and
