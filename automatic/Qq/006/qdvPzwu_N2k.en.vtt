00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.530 

was<00:00:04.920> the<00:00:05.069> wedding<00:00:05.250> things<00:00:05.430> but<00:00:05.609> actually<00:00:06.270> use

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
was the wedding things but actually use

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.870 
was the wedding things but actually use
up<00:00:06.720> is<00:00:07.200> that<00:00:07.529> it<00:00:07.649> they<00:00:08.040> get<00:00:08.189> faster<00:00:08.639> every<00:00:08.849> year

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
up is that it they get faster every year

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.780 
up is that it they get faster every year
so<00:00:09.710> pretty<00:00:10.710> soon<00:00:10.920> you<00:00:11.250> know<00:00:11.340> we'll<00:00:11.490> be<00:00:11.610> able<00:00:11.670> to

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
so pretty soon you know we'll be able to

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.620 
so pretty soon you know we'll be able to
stage<00:00:11.940> where<00:00:12.179> you<00:00:12.210> use<00:00:12.570> this<00:00:12.809> engage<00:00:14.630> the

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
stage where you use this engage the

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.570 
stage where you use this engage the
other<00:00:15.750> things<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.080> see<00:00:16.230> here<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.710> there's<00:00:17.520> a

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
other things to see here is there's a

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.550 
other things to see here is there's a
couple<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.940> columns<00:00:18.300> here<00:00:18.539> which<00:00:19.170> we<00:00:19.289> put<00:00:19.470> it

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
couple of columns here which we put it

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.470 
couple of columns here which we put it
in<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.740> show<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.070> fact<00:00:20.310> that<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.730> fire<00:00:21.210> is

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
in to show the fact that the fire is

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.230 
in to show the fact that the fire is
interacting<00:00:22.199> with<00:00:22.470> these<00:00:22.970> objects<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.180> can

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
interacting with these objects you can

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.400 
interacting with these objects you can
see<00:00:24.420> it<00:00:24.480> kind<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.689> flow<00:00:24.990> around<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.439> columns

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
see it kind of flow around the columns

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.870 
see it kind of flow around the columns
if<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.529> pause<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.920> here<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.250> can<00:00:29.400> see<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
if I pause it here you can see the

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.170 
if I pause it here you can see the
volume<00:00:30.630> rendering<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:31.080> little<00:00:31.289> bit<00:00:32.180> more

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
volume rendering a little bit more

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.400 
volume rendering a little bit more
closely<00:00:35.600> we<00:00:36.600> have<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.750> kind<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:36.989> heat<00:00:37.200> haze

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
closely we have a kind of heat haze

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.819 
closely we have a kind of heat haze
effect<00:00:37.890> which<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.219> might<00:00:38.370> be<00:00:38.520> able<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.670> see<00:00:39.829> in

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
effect which you might be able to see in

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.920 
effect which you might be able to see in
some<00:00:41.070> areas<00:00:41.430> but<00:00:41.610> yeah<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.360> setup<00:00:42.629> here<00:00:42.809> is

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
some areas but yeah the setup here is

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.630 
some areas but yeah the setup here is
actually<00:00:43.079> very<00:00:43.260> simple<00:00:43.890> was<00:00:44.160> just<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.430> single

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
actually very simple was just a single

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.360 
actually very simple was just a single
cone<00:00:45.600> emitter<00:00:45.989> attached<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.160> dragon's

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
cone emitter attached to the dragon's

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.630 
cone emitter attached to the dragon's
mouth<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.360> that's<00:00:48.510> injecting<00:00:49.190> fuel<00:00:50.190> and

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
mouth and that's injecting fuel and

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.600 
mouth and that's injecting fuel and
temperature<00:00:51.239> into<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.539> simulation<00:00:52.430> and<00:00:53.430> you

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
temperature into the simulation and you

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.240 
temperature into the simulation and you
can<00:00:53.760> see<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.270> kind<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.050> expansion<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:56.010> last

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
can see the kind of expansion that last

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.650 
can see the kind of expansion that last
one<00:00:56.460> was<00:00:56.640> talking<00:00:56.910> about<00:00:57.090> in<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> combustion

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
one was talking about in the combustion

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.470 
one was talking about in the combustion
model<00:00:58.079> lost<00:00:58.710> producing<00:00:59.699> these<00:00:59.879> cool<00:01:01.460> final

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
model lost producing these cool final

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.010 
model lost producing these cool final
phase

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.200 

oh<00:01:07.189> yeah<00:01:08.189> means<00:01:08.460> there's<00:01:08.790> one<00:01:08.939> kind<00:01:09.090> of

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
oh yeah means there's one kind of

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.960 
oh yeah means there's one kind of
emitter<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.320> nostrils<00:01:10.799> as<00:01:10.979> well<00:01:11.159> just<00:01:13.850> so

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.270 

in<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.060> way<00:01:18.180> that's<00:01:18.420> good<00:01:18.600> cool<00:01:18.960> if<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.039> want<00:01:20.220> a

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
in a way that's good cool if you want a

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.270 
in a way that's good cool if you want a
quad<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:21.180> can<00:01:21.360> add<00:01:21.539> it<00:01:21.750> but<00:01:22.049> it's<00:01:22.590> not<00:01:22.680> because

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
quad you can add it but it's not because

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.749 
quad you can add it but it's not because
the<00:01:23.700> advances<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:25.189> then<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.280> other<00:01:26.310> thing<00:01:26.490> is

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
the advances and then the other thing is

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.370 
the advances and then the other thing is
what<00:01:27.000> kind<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.240> interpolation<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:28.110> actually

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
what kind of interpolation you actually

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.710 
what kind of interpolation you actually
doing<00:01:28.890> over<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.310> simulation<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:30.030> doing<00:01:30.689> just

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
doing over the simulation is doing just

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.690 
doing over the simulation is doing just
a<00:01:31.170> linear<00:01:31.380> interpolation<00:01:32.039> on<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.399> Apple

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
a linear interpolation on the Apple

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.179 
a linear interpolation on the Apple
sells<00:01:32.909> definitely<00:01:33.810> we<00:01:34.170> do<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> trial<00:01:34.799> in<00:01:34.950> here

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
sells definitely we do a trial in here

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.980 
sells definitely we do a trial in here
just<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:35.850> intimately<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.330> but<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.810> can

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
just so intimately I but that you can

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.139 
just so intimately I but that you can
repair<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.560> with<00:01:37.740> like<00:01:38.159> your<00:01:38.369> bacon<00:01:38.759> waffle

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
repair it with like your bacon waffle

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.580 
repair it with like your bacon waffle
but<00:01:39.299> it's<00:01:39.899> not<00:01:40.049> very<00:01:40.280> event<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.780> think<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:43.380> can

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
but it's not very event I think you can

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.699 
but it's not very event I think you can
you<00:01:44.310> can<00:01:44.490> add<00:01:45.240> what<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.899> even<00:01:46.170> five<00:01:46.380> minute

00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:46.709 
you can add what is it even five minute

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:49.279 
you can add what is it even five minute
that<00:01:46.890> Kyle<00:01:47.159> give<00:01:47.940> you<00:01:48.119> simulated<00:01:48.899> that's

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
that Kyle give you simulated that's

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:50.700 
that Kyle give you simulated that's
cheaper

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
cheaper

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.539 
cheaper
yes<00:01:51.710> it's<00:01:51.950> actually<00:01:52.220> an<00:01:52.310> interesting

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
yes it's actually an interesting

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.430 
yes it's actually an interesting
question<00:01:53.180> with<00:01:53.330> the<00:01:53.360> stability<00:01:53.930> is<00:01:54.140> that<00:01:54.320> we

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
question with the stability is that we

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.530 
question with the stability is that we
actually<00:01:54.619> we<00:01:54.920> haven't<00:01:55.100> really<00:01:55.540> integrated

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
actually we haven't really integrated

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.380 
actually we haven't really integrated
this<00:01:56.600> into<00:01:56.750> many<00:01:57.020> games<00:01:57.320> yet<00:01:57.710> so<00:01:58.070> again<00:01:58.460> you

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
this into many games yet so again you

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.359 
this into many games yet so again you
know<00:01:59.540> you<00:01:59.930> don't<00:02:00.110> know<00:02:00.260> how<00:02:00.470> big<00:02:00.770> things<00:02:01.159> that

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
know you don't know how big things that

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:02.440 
know you don't know how big things that
will<00:02:01.460> be<00:02:01.520> moving<00:02:01.670> you<00:02:02.030> know<00:02:02.060> collision

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
will be moving you know collision

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.690 
will be moving you know collision
objects<00:02:02.750> and<00:02:02.930> stuff<00:02:03.140> so<00:02:03.350> we<00:02:03.440> may<00:02:03.830> have<00:02:04.040> issues

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
objects and stuff so we may have issues

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.550 
objects and stuff so we may have issues
once<00:02:05.210> we<00:02:05.360> start<00:02:05.600> doing<00:02:05.720> that<00:02:05.960> but<00:02:06.110> I<00:02:06.229> imagine

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
once we start doing that but I imagine

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.160 
once we start doing that but I imagine
we<00:02:06.650> could<00:02:06.710> put<00:02:06.950> in<00:02:07.070> you<00:02:07.430> know<00:02:07.460> claps<00:02:07.880> for<00:02:08.270> to

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
we could put in you know claps for to

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.100 
we could put in you know claps for to
control<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.709> maximum<00:02:10.100> velocity<00:02:10.720> for<00:02:11.720> example

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
control the maximum velocity for example

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.800 
control the maximum velocity for example
so<00:02:13.010> what<00:02:13.280> parts<00:02:13.670> of<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.850> simulation<00:02:14.030> pipeline

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
so what parts of the simulation pipeline

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.510 
so what parts of the simulation pipeline
are<00:02:15.020> physically<00:02:15.470> motivated<00:02:15.620> what<00:02:16.220> parts<00:02:16.459> are

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
are physically motivated what parts are

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.780 
are physically motivated what parts are
artistically<00:02:17.090> it<00:02:17.450> seems<00:02:17.600> like<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.870> vorticity

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
artistically it seems like the vorticity

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.420 
artistically it seems like the vorticity
application<00:02:19.790> is<00:02:19.910> firm<00:02:20.540> from<00:02:20.930> people<00:02:21.430> taking

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
application is firm from people taking

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.380 
application is firm from people taking
an<00:02:22.519> interesting<00:02:22.970> situation

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
an interesting situation

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.699 
an interesting situation
well<00:02:25.350> actually<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:26.130> is<00:02:26.690> fun<00:02:27.690> physics<00:02:28.140> computer

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
well actually it is fun physics computer

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.890 
well actually it is fun physics computer
in<00:02:29.010> our<00:02:29.160> physics<00:02:29.610> as<00:02:29.790> well<00:02:29.970> like<00:02:30.240> what<00:02:30.750> the

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
in our physics as well like what the

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.350 
in our physics as well like what the
city<00:02:31.170> refinement<00:02:31.740> is<00:02:32.010> physical<00:02:32.610> like<00:02:33.090> maybe

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
city refinement is physical like maybe

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.220 
city refinement is physical like maybe
you<00:02:33.569> can<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:34.530> can<00:02:34.709> make<00:02:34.920> it<00:02:35.069> so<00:02:35.280> that<00:02:35.430> in

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
you can you can make it so that in

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.900 
you can you can make it so that in
conversation<00:02:37.230> but<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.250> mean<00:02:38.550> you<00:02:38.730> can

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
conversation but I mean you can

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.750 
conversation but I mean you can
optionally<00:02:39.180> do<00:02:39.959> it<00:02:40.140> in<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:41.070> way<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.250> they're

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
optionally do it in a way that they're

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.060 
optionally do it in a way that they're
not<00:02:42.000> physical<00:02:42.570> by<00:02:42.810> adding<00:02:43.260> too<00:02:43.410> much<00:02:43.620> what

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
not physical by adding too much what

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.449 
not physical by adding too much what
icity<00:02:44.490> of<00:02:45.000> hair<00:02:45.330> to<00:02:45.360> physical<00:02:46.080> solution<00:02:46.459> but

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
icity of hair to physical solution but

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.580 
icity of hair to physical solution but
it<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:47.970> our<00:02:48.209> physical<00:02:48.990> which<00:02:49.170> motivated<00:02:51.590> go

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
it is our physical which motivated go

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.320 
it is our physical which motivated go
through<00:02:52.860> those<00:02:53.040> but<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.819> is<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.000> good<00:02:54.090> question

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
through those but it is a good question

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
through those but it is a good question
if<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:54.840> have<00:02:55.080> a<00:02:55.110> you<00:02:55.830> know<00:02:55.920> more<00:02:56.130> competitive

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
if you have a you know more competitive

it's<00:03:02.370> it's<00:03:02.700> quite<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.060> difficult<00:03:03.269> problem<00:03:03.630> to

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
it's it's quite a difficult problem to

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
we like to like to fight it but in

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.310 
we like to like to fight it but in
practice<00:03:11.760> you<00:03:11.940> get<00:03:12.120> away<00:03:12.360> with<00:03:12.600> with<00:03:13.019> family

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320
