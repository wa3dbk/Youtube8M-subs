00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
i think i was on the clean channels and

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.950 
i think i was on the clean channels and
last<00:00:19.260> one<00:00:19.529> was<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.369> red<00:00:23.390> is<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.720> gets

last one was the the red is that it gets
a<00:00:25.230> pretty<00:00:25.560> crunchy<00:00:26.400> but<00:00:27.050> the<00:00:28.050> cleans<00:00:28.349> very

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
a pretty crunchy but the cleans very

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.400 
a pretty crunchy but the cleans very
clean

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.620 

that<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.890> two<00:00:35.130> which<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.820> crunch<00:00:36.090> channel

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
that the two which is the crunch channel

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.819 
that the two which is the crunch channel
i'll<00:00:36.960> start<00:00:37.260> with<00:00:37.470> the<00:00:37.620> green

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.600 

and

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.079 

you

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:57.520 

orange

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.470 

you

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.250 

mhm

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:17.310 

and<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.980> red<00:01:08.190> on<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.640> crunch

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.900 

that<00:01:18.320> was<00:01:18.440> always<00:01:18.620> the<00:01:18.770> neck<00:01:19.130> then<00:01:19.610> with<00:01:19.790> the

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
that was always the neck then with the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.670 
that was always the neck then with the
bridge<00:01:20.180> of<00:01:20.210> course<00:01:20.810> it<00:01:20.960> will<00:01:21.050> get<00:01:21.200> done<00:01:21.470> a

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
bridge of course it will get done a

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:28.090 
bridge of course it will get done a
little<00:01:21.770> bit<00:01:22.010> more

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:46.530 

Oh

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.140 

Oh

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:59.070 

I<00:01:52.740> remember<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:53.770> green<00:01:56.910> so<00:01:57.910> the<00:01:58.180> green

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
I remember the green so the green

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:15.420 
I remember the green so the green
overdrive<00:01:59.830> 11<00:02:00.730> which<00:02:01.090> I<00:02:01.270> never<00:02:01.330> used

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.010 

but<00:02:16.430> you<00:02:16.880> would<00:02:17.180> think<00:02:17.390> that<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.750> green

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
but you would think that the green

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.400 
but you would think that the green
overdrive<00:02:18.680> one<00:02:19.069> would<00:02:19.880> be<00:02:20.090> like<00:02:20.390> maybe<00:02:21.050> the

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
overdrive one would be like maybe the

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.580 
overdrive one would be like maybe the
orange<00:02:21.980> or<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.490> red<00:02:23.000> on<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.810> crunch<00:02:24.080> but<00:02:24.410> it's

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
orange or the red on the crunch but it's

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.610 
orange or the red on the crunch but it's
not<00:02:24.800> it<00:02:25.130> definitely<00:02:25.790> does<00:02:26.120> sound<00:02:26.620> differently

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
not it definitely does sound differently

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.610 
not it definitely does sound differently
but<00:02:27.800> once<00:02:28.370> again<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:29.239> Warren<00:02:29.959> jover<00:02:30.380> drive

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
but once again the Warren jover drive

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:42.760 
but once again the Warren jover drive
one<00:02:30.920> which<00:02:31.220> is<00:02:31.370> my<00:02:31.550> fav

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:03:06.420 

Oh

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.760 

then<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.610> red<00:03:07.790> ever<00:03:08.120> drive<00:03:08.450> one<00:03:08.780> there's<00:03:09.710> a

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
then the red ever drive one there's a

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:36.370 
then the red ever drive one there's a
difference<00:03:10.010> but<00:03:10.580> it<00:03:11.090> is<00:03:11.390> kind<00:03:12.140> of<00:03:12.290> son

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:46.320 

drive<00:03:37.130> one<00:03:37.670> roo<00:03:38.060> dream<00:03:44.680> all<00:03:45.680> right<00:03:45.800> now<00:03:46.100> I

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
drive one roo dream all right now I

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:59.240 
drive one roo dream all right now I
river<00:03:47.330> drive<00:03:47.630> to<00:03:48.190> green<00:03:51.250> open<00:03:52.250> court

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.890 

so<00:04:00.920> I'm<00:04:01.920> neck<00:04:02.220> pickup<00:04:02.670> you<00:04:02.850> could<00:04:03.000> even<00:04:03.450> strum

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
so I'm neck pickup you could even strum

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:24.690 
so I'm neck pickup you could even strum
chords

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:05:15.030 

the<00:04:25.700> orange<00:04:26.300> overdrive<00:04:26.960> to<00:04:27.230> pretty<00:04:27.950> heavy

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:28.210 

overdrive<00:05:16.040> red<00:05:16.400> which<00:05:16.730> is<00:05:16.910> the<00:05:17.120> last<00:05:17.360> one

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:52.339 

you

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:52.349 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:56.519 

so<00:05:53.349> that's<00:05:53.709> pretty<00:05:53.889> much<00:05:54.069> it<00:05:55.049> with<00:05:56.049> a<00:05:56.079> built-in

00:05:56.519 --> 00:05:56.529 
so that's pretty much it with a built-in

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:59.609 
so that's pretty much it with a built-in
reverb<00:05:57.329> in<00:05:58.329> all<00:05:58.569> those<00:05:58.749> channels<00:05:59.139> you<00:05:59.589> can

00:05:59.609 --> 00:05:59.619 
reverb in all those channels you can

00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:01.649 
reverb in all those channels you can
pretty<00:05:59.919> much<00:06:00.069> get<00:06:00.579> whatever<00:06:00.729> sound<00:06:01.179> you<00:06:01.419> want

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:01.659 
pretty much get whatever sound you want

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:04.409 
pretty much get whatever sound you want
plus<00:06:02.079> the<00:06:02.409> I<00:06:02.949> don't<00:06:03.609> even<00:06:03.729> mess<00:06:04.029> with<00:06:04.059> the

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 
plus the I don't even mess with the

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.979 
plus the I don't even mess with the
resonance<00:06:05.079> or<00:06:05.319> the<00:06:05.589> presence<00:06:06.099> because<00:06:06.789> I<00:06:06.999> have

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:07.989 
resonance or the presence because I have

00:06:07.989 --> 00:06:10.649 
resonance or the presence because I have
the<00:06:08.859> resonance<00:06:09.369> at<00:06:09.549> twelve<00:06:09.789> o'clock<00:06:10.179> in<00:06:10.419> the

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:10.659 
the resonance at twelve o'clock in the

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:13.319 
the resonance at twelve o'clock in the
presence<00:06:11.109> usually<00:06:11.859> between<00:06:12.039> one<00:06:12.699> and<00:06:12.969> two

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:13.329 
presence usually between one and two

00:06:13.329 --> 00:06:16.289 
presence usually between one and two
o'clock<00:06:13.529> which<00:06:14.529> works<00:06:14.829> for<00:06:15.129> me<00:06:15.309> but<00:06:15.789> there<00:06:16.269> is

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:16.299 
o'clock which works for me but there is

00:06:16.299 --> 00:06:18.839 
o'clock which works for me but there is
a<00:06:16.479> lot<00:06:17.169> of<00:06:17.199> a<00:06:17.529> difference<00:06:18.219> but<00:06:18.399> if<00:06:18.549> I<00:06:18.669> went

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:18.849 
a lot of a difference but if I went

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:20.939 
a lot of a difference but if I went
through<00:06:19.059> all<00:06:19.209> that<00:06:19.239> the<00:06:20.229> video<00:06:20.499> would<00:06:20.739> never

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:20.949 
through all that the video would never

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:24.779 
through all that the video would never
end<00:06:21.219> but<00:06:21.459> so<00:06:22.389> that's<00:06:22.719> the<00:06:22.809> basics<00:06:23.349> for<00:06:24.009> the<00:06:24.639> way

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:24.789 
end but so that's the basics for the way

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:26.939 
end but so that's the basics for the way
that<00:06:24.999> sounds<00:06:25.509> with<00:06:25.689> a<00:06:25.719> humbucker<00:06:26.409> style

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:26.949 
that sounds with a humbucker style

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:30.779 
that sounds with a humbucker style
guitar<00:06:27.419> so<00:06:28.419> I<00:06:28.869> guess<00:06:29.349> I'll<00:06:29.559> make<00:06:29.769> part<00:06:30.039> 3<00:06:30.399> with

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:30.789 
guitar so I guess I'll make part 3 with

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:33.989 
guitar so I guess I'll make part 3 with
the<00:06:30.909> fender<00:06:31.299> and<00:06:31.859> my<00:06:32.859> only<00:06:33.069> complaints<00:06:33.819> about

00:06:33.989 --> 00:06:33.999 
the fender and my only complaints about

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:39.089 
the fender and my only complaints about
this<00:06:34.359> amp<00:06:34.629> that<00:06:34.809> I<00:06:34.929> do<00:06:34.989> not<00:06:35.289> like<00:06:35.589> or<00:06:38.099> whatever

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:39.099 
this amp that I do not like or whatever

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:41.189 
this amp that I do not like or whatever
you<00:06:39.309> use<00:06:39.339> affects<00:06:40.179> the<00:06:40.479> only<00:06:40.719> external

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 
you use affects the only external

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:44.209
