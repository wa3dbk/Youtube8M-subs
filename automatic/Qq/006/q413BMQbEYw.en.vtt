00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
come through the children is that my

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.549 
come through the children is that my
children<00:01:00.000> are<00:01:00.300> just<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.629> robust<00:01:01.140> they're

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
children are just so robust they're

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.189

super strong they're very independent

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.400 
super strong they're very independent
they<00:01:04.920> have<00:01:05.160> the<00:01:05.339> sense<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.790> groundedness<00:01:06.540> that

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.910 
they have the sense of groundedness that
I<00:01:07.650> feel<00:01:08.010> comes<00:01:08.310> from<00:01:08.700> their<00:01:09.920> responsibilities

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920
