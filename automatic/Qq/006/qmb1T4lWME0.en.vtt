00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
a rough outline of the head shape and

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.470 
a rough outline of the head shape and
I'm<00:00:07.680> now<00:00:07.830> moving<00:00:08.010> on<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.429> hair<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:09.240> key

thing to remember with hair is that each

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.220 
thing to remember with hair is that each
line<00:00:11.550> this<00:00:11.700> is<00:00:11.820> up<00:00:12.059> from<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.360> head<00:00:12.570> like<00:00:13.049> your

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
line this is up from the head like your

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.930 
line this is up from the head like your
own<00:00:13.349> hair<00:00:13.590> each<00:00:13.830> strand<00:00:14.250> doesn't<00:00:14.549> start<00:00:14.759> in<00:00:14.880> a

find the hardest again I would look them

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.130 
find the hardest again I would look them
up<00:00:59.100> on<00:00:59.219> google<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.640> practice<00:01:00.090> practice<00:01:00.960> and

they're<00:01:17.740> doing<00:01:18.010> I<00:01:18.280> know<00:01:18.850> might<00:01:19.120> just<00:01:19.270> add<00:01:19.420> that

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
they're doing I know might just add that

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.130 
they're doing I know might just add that
with<00:01:21.640> the<00:01:21.790> nose<00:01:21.970> and<00:01:22.300> always<00:01:22.420> keep<00:01:22.810> it<00:01:22.960> pretty

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
with the nose and always keep it pretty

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.020 
with the nose and always keep it pretty
simple<00:01:23.260> and<00:01:23.740> just<00:01:23.830> do<00:01:24.010> a<00:01:24.040> rough<00:01:24.340> outline<00:01:24.490> of

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
simple and just do a rough outline of

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.610 
simple and just do a rough outline of
what<00:01:25.750> the<00:01:25.900> shape<00:01:26.110> is<00:01:26.260> down<00:01:26.440> the<00:01:26.560> bottom<00:01:28.620> so

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
what the shape is down the bottom so

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.960 
what the shape is down the bottom so
when<00:01:29.770> you<00:01:29.860> finish<00:01:30.100> your<00:01:30.280> sketch<00:01:30.490> just<00:01:30.760> clean

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
when you finish your sketch just clean

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.940 
when you finish your sketch just clean
it<00:01:31.000> up<00:01:31.210> a<00:01:31.330> little<00:01:31.360> bit<00:01:31.720> you<00:01:31.900> don't<00:01:32.080> want<00:01:32.320> the

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
it up a little bit you don't want the

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.830 
it up a little bit you don't want the
grayling<00:01:33.580> to<00:01:33.730> get<00:01:33.880> mixed<00:01:34.060> with<00:01:34.330> the<00:01:34.420> texture

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
grayling to get mixed with the texture

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.010 
grayling to get mixed with the texture
it<00:01:35.020> becomes<00:01:35.440> really<00:01:35.740> messy<00:01:36.250> so<00:01:37.030> just<00:01:37.360> make<00:01:37.990> it

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
it becomes really messy so just make it

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.290 
it becomes really messy so just make it
sort<00:01:38.350> of<00:01:38.380> clean<00:01:38.740> so<00:01:39.460> you<00:01:39.520> sort<00:01:39.850> of<00:01:39.910> know<00:01:40.090> where

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
sort of clean so you sort of know where

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.330 
sort of clean so you sort of know where
the<00:01:40.420> outline<00:01:40.780> is

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
the outline is

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.620 
the outline is
you're<00:01:43.340> starting<00:01:43.460> to<00:01:43.640> add<00:01:43.850> color<00:01:44.120> start<00:01:44.510> with

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
you're starting to add color start with

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.350 
you're starting to add color start with
the<00:01:44.750> skin<00:01:45.050> this<00:01:45.260> is<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.500> lightest<00:01:45.860> color<00:01:46.360> it

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
the skin this is the lightest color it

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.240 
the skin this is the lightest color it
prevents<00:01:47.780> any<00:01:47.990> smudging<00:01:48.680> you<00:01:48.920> don't<00:01:49.070> want<00:01:49.190> to

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
prevents any smudging you don't want to

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.410 
prevents any smudging you don't want to
start<00:01:49.400> with<00:01:49.430> a<00:01:49.550> dark<00:01:49.790> color<00:01:50.030> and<00:01:50.210> have<00:01:50.300> it

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
start with a dark color and have it

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.450 
start with a dark color and have it
smudged<00:01:50.750> into<00:01:51.140> your<00:01:51.290> light<00:01:51.440> skin<00:01:54.220> then<00:01:55.220> move

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
smudged into your light skin then move

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.219 
smudged into your light skin then move
on<00:01:55.610> to<00:01:55.760> adapt<00:01:56.270> a<00:01:56.300> color<00:01:56.630> around<00:01:56.869> the<00:01:57.050> edges

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
on to adapt a color around the edges

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.130 
on to adapt a color around the edges
this<00:01:57.680> will<00:01:57.830> give<00:01:57.860> it<00:01:58.100> a<00:01:58.159> more<00:01:58.310> a<00:01:58.369> 3d<00:01:58.880> look<00:01:59.140> also

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
this will give it a more a 3d look also

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.780 
this will give it a more a 3d look also
