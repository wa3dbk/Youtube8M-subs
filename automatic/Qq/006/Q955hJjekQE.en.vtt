now is a new thing of God it's called

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.870 
now is a new thing of God it's called
apex<00:00:18.270> fusion<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:19.439> what<00:00:19.560> apex<00:00:19.890> fusion<00:00:20.160> does<00:00:20.490> is

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
apex fusion and what apex fusion does is

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.730 
apex fusion and what apex fusion does is
it<00:00:21.000> brings<00:00:21.180> your<00:00:21.420> apex<00:00:21.779> now<00:00:22.109> into<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.529> cloud

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
it brings your apex now into the cloud

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.400 
it brings your apex now into the cloud
for<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.119> number<00:00:24.119> one<00:00:24.390> problem<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.050> we<00:00:25.199> have

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
for you number one problem that we have

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.990 
for you number one problem that we have
with<00:00:25.769> people<00:00:25.800> with<00:00:26.160> connecting<00:00:26.519> their<00:00:26.640> apex

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
with people with connecting their apex

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.390 
with people with connecting their apex
is<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.869> they<00:00:28.109> can't<00:00:28.890> connect<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.310> through

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
is that they can't connect it through

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.890 
is that they can't connect it through
their<00:00:29.550> network<00:00:29.820> they<00:00:30.000> can't<00:00:30.240> get<00:00:30.449> access<00:00:30.660> to

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
their network they can't get access to

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.630 
their network they can't get access to
it<00:00:31.140> from<00:00:31.289> outside<00:00:31.650> they<00:00:31.890> can't<00:00:32.099> set<00:00:32.340> up<00:00:32.460> their

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
it from outside they can't set up their

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.340 
it from outside they can't set up their
email<00:00:33.030> all<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.570> these<00:00:33.870> things<00:00:34.140> have<00:00:34.320> been

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
email all of these things have been

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.799 
email all of these things have been
super<00:00:34.950> super<00:00:35.130> difficult<00:00:35.430> for<00:00:35.880> us<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.660> help

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
super super difficult for us to to help

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:37.549 
super super difficult for us to to help
them<00:00:36.989> get<00:00:37.140> set<00:00:37.350> up

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
them get set up

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.650 
them get set up
now<00:00:38.190> with<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.430> apex<00:00:38.610> fusion<00:00:38.910> they<00:00:39.180> can<00:00:39.329> do<00:00:39.480> it

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
now with the apex fusion they can do it

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.780 
now with the apex fusion they can do it
by<00:00:40.320> just<00:00:40.350> connecting<00:00:40.950> their<00:00:41.070> apex<00:00:41.340> into<00:00:41.640> their

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
by just connecting their apex into their

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.430 
by just connecting their apex into their
network<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.329> goes<00:00:42.540> out<00:00:42.690> communicates<00:00:43.290> with

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
network it goes out communicates with

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.010 
network it goes out communicates with
the<00:00:43.559> apex<00:00:43.860> fusion<00:00:44.100> server<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.300> they<00:00:45.780> can<00:00:45.930> have

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
the apex fusion server and they can have

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.389 
the apex fusion server and they can have
complete<00:00:46.320> access<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.860> control<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.250> their

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
complete access and control of their

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.389 
complete access and control of their
aquarium<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:47.910> way<00:00:48.059> it's<00:00:48.719> pretty<00:00:48.809> cool<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.399> see

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
aquarium that way it's pretty cool I see

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.330 
aquarium that way it's pretty cool I see
you<00:00:50.460> even<00:00:50.610> have<00:00:50.879> video<00:00:51.210> up<00:00:51.480> yeah<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.829> we

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
you even have video up yeah so we

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.340 
you even have video up yeah so we
started<00:00:53.670> last<00:00:53.820> year<00:00:54.059> by<00:00:54.390> by<00:00:54.840> integrating

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
started last year by by integrating

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.680 
started last year by by integrating
webcams<00:00:55.770> into<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.489> know<00:00:56.579> into<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.090> interface

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
webcams into you know into the interface

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.450 
webcams into you know into the interface
into<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.989> dashboard<00:00:58.199> with<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.710> apex<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.340> to

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
into the dashboard with the apex it to

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.569 
into the dashboard with the apex it to
be<00:00:59.550> able<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.730> widely<00:01:00.570> use<00:01:01.230> its<00:01:01.949> use<00:01:02.160> more<00:01:02.460> than

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
be able to widely use its use more than

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.500 
be able to widely use its use more than
we<00:01:02.670> thought<00:01:02.850> we<00:01:02.969> had<00:01:03.059> multiple<00:01:03.300> dashboards

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
we thought we had multiple dashboards

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.149 
we thought we had multiple dashboards
and<00:01:03.899> everything<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.320> year<00:01:04.559> we've<00:01:04.710> added<00:01:04.920> it

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
and everything this year we've added it

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.070 
and everything this year we've added it
in<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.460> it's<00:01:05.610> easier<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.510> can<00:01:06.630> actually<00:01:06.780> go

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
in so it's easier you can actually go

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.859 
in so it's easier you can actually go
between<00:01:07.909> multiple<00:01:08.909> webcams<00:01:09.360> right<00:01:09.659> from<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
between multiple webcams right from the

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.420 
between multiple webcams right from the
dashboard<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.590> can<00:01:10.710> have<00:01:10.860> one<00:01:11.070> maybe<00:01:11.250> on

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
dashboard so you can have one maybe on

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.580 
dashboard so you can have one maybe on
your<00:01:11.520> skimmer<00:01:11.850> or<00:01:12.240> in<00:01:12.689> your<00:01:12.840> fish<00:01:13.020> room<00:01:13.260> as

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
your skimmer or in your fish room as

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.770 
your skimmer or in your fish room as
well<00:01:13.770> as<00:01:13.920> on<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.280> fish<00:01:14.460> themselves<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:15.240> have<00:01:15.720> a

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780

and you mentioned on call one of the
cool<00:01:29.280> things<00:01:29.490> about<00:01:29.610> apex<00:01:30.060> fusion<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.570> we're

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
cool things about apex fusion is we're

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.109 
cool things about apex fusion is we're
going<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.380> have<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.740> ability<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.220> have

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
going to have the ability to have

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.210 
going to have the ability to have
multiple<00:01:33.390> people's<00:01:34.110> look<00:01:34.439> looking<00:01:35.009> on<00:01:35.100> your

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
multiple people's look looking on your

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.100 
multiple people's look looking on your
tank<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.150> have<00:01:36.450> people<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.780> are<00:01:36.900> set<00:01:37.079> up

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
tank so you have people that are set up

direction that we're taking with the
apex<00:03:17.819> with<00:03:17.970> apex<00:03:18.480> fusion<00:03:18.750> because<00:03:19.500> we<00:03:19.799> have

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
apex with apex fusion because we have

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.220 
apex with apex fusion because we have
more<00:03:20.069> horsepower<00:03:20.370> now<00:03:20.780> having<00:03:21.780> it<00:03:21.870> beating<00:03:22.109> up

on<00:03:22.380> our<00:03:22.470> servers<00:03:22.889> we<00:03:23.160> can<00:03:23.280> do<00:03:23.459> Wizards<00:03:24.359> that<00:03:24.540> we

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630

we<00:03:28.889> have<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:29.040> really<00:03:29.340> cool<00:03:29.579> demo<00:03:29.639> of<00:03:29.970> is<00:03:30.209> the

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
we have a really cool demo of is the

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.870 
we have a really cool demo of is the
lighting<00:03:30.690> wizard<00:03:31.310> and<00:03:32.310> one<00:03:32.459> of<00:03:32.549> the<00:03:32.609> biggest

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
lighting wizard and one of the biggest

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.210 
lighting wizard and one of the biggest
dilemmas<00:03:33.000> out<00:03:33.450> there<00:03:33.660> in<00:03:33.750> the

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
dilemmas out there in the

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.130 
dilemmas out there in the
is<00:03:34.760> that<00:03:34.970> every<00:03:35.210> lighting<00:03:35.510> manufacturer<00:03:36.050> has

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
is that every lighting manufacturer has

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.660 
is that every lighting manufacturer has
a<00:03:36.170> different<00:03:36.650> way<00:03:36.800> to<00:03:36.860> control<00:03:37.310> their<00:03:37.460> lights

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
a different way to control their lights

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.630 
a different way to control their lights
okay<00:03:38.300> and<00:03:38.900> it's<00:03:39.050> confusing<00:03:39.460> whether<00:03:40.460> your

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
okay and it's confusing whether your

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.610 
okay and it's confusing whether your
service<00:03:41.030> guy<00:03:41.180> or<00:03:41.660> your<00:03:41.930> a<00:03:41.960> guy<00:03:42.140> just<00:03:42.350> happen<00:03:42.560> to

have two tanks or you decide to upgrade
from<00:03:44.720> one<00:03:44.840> light<00:03:45.020> to<00:03:45.170> the<00:03:45.260> other<00:03:45.410> you<00:03:45.590> got<00:03:45.710> to

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
from one light to the other you got to

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.710 
from one light to the other you got to
learn<00:03:45.830> a<00:03:45.890> whole<00:03:45.980> new<00:03:46.310> way<00:03:46.490> to<00:03:46.550> do<00:03:46.760> it<00:03:46.880> we've

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
learn a whole new way to do it we've

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.650 
learn a whole new way to do it we've
create<00:03:48.020> a<00:03:48.080> unified<00:03:48.650> LED<00:03:49.190> interface<00:03:49.640> in<00:03:50.180> apex

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
create a unified LED interface in apex

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.540 
create a unified LED interface in apex
fusion<00:03:50.900> so<00:03:51.320> all<00:03:51.530> the<00:03:51.710> lights<00:03:51.920> work<00:03:52.160> the<00:03:52.280> same

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
fusion so all the lights work the same

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.730 
fusion so all the lights work the same
way<00:03:52.820> you<00:03:52.880> set<00:03:53.240> it<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:53.600> same<00:03:53.810> way<00:03:54.020> but<00:03:54.650> you

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
way you set it the same way but you

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.200 
way you set it the same way but you
might<00:03:54.890> have<00:03:55.070> different<00:03:55.280> colors<00:03:55.730> right<00:03:56.000> for

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.210 
might have different colors right for

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.050 
might have different colors right for
your<00:03:56.360> for<00:03:56.930> your<00:03:57.130> LEDs<00:03:58.130> and<00:03:58.430> you'll<00:03:58.670> see<00:03:58.850> those

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
your for your LEDs and you'll see those

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.420 
your for your LEDs and you'll see those
down<00:03:59.300> here<00:03:59.480> depending<00:03:59.870> so<00:04:00.740> for<00:04:00.950> instance<00:04:01.250> if<00:04:01.340> I

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
down here depending so for instance if I

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.580 
down here depending so for instance if I
wanted<00:04:01.670> to<00:04:01.760> go<00:04:01.880> in<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:02.180> change<00:04:02.360> my<00:04:03.050> lighting<00:04:03.440> I

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
wanted to go in and change my lighting I

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.950 
wanted to go in and change my lighting I
can<00:04:03.740> just<00:04:03.890> move<00:04:04.010> around<00:04:04.220> these<00:04:04.400> docks<00:04:04.960> you'll

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960 
can just move around these docks you'll

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.720 
can just move around these docks you'll

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
each one of those rows has a different

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.590 
each one of those rows has a different
preset<00:04:10.550> that<00:04:10.700> you<00:04:10.760> can<00:04:10.910> set<00:04:11.120> it<00:04:11.240> for<00:04:11.270> that

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600

skittish to say oh you need to have a
native<00:04:38.870> app<00:04:39.140> right<00:04:39.560> because<00:04:39.800> it's<00:04:40.040> not<00:04:40.190> gonna

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
native app right because it's not gonna

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.370 
native app right because it's not gonna
work<00:04:40.490> it's<00:04:40.700> a<00:04:40.790> web<00:04:40.970> app<00:04:41.000> we've<00:04:41.810> designed<00:04:42.110> this

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
work it's a web app we've designed this

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.990 
work it's a web app we've designed this
mobile<00:04:42.770> first<00:04:43.040> which<00:04:43.610> was<00:04:43.730> a<00:04:43.760> bold

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
tablet you can you can do it just the

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.790 
tablet you can you can do it just the
same<00:04:49.970> way<00:04:50.180> there's<00:04:50.630> no<00:04:50.780> delays<00:04:51.230> no<00:04:51.560> lags

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800

nothing well you know all these were

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.830 
nothing well you know all these were
originally<00:04:54.590> written<00:04:55.520> for<00:04:55.760> laptops<00:04:56.630> and

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
laptop to the computer everything we

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.270 
laptop to the computer everything we
designed<00:05:05.300> now<00:05:05.510> is<00:05:05.780> mobile<00:05:06.140> first<00:05:06.350> we<00:05:06.980> design

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
designed now is mobile first we design

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.159 
designed now is mobile first we design
it<00:05:07.430> for<00:05:07.550> mobile<00:05:07.880> and<00:05:08.180> we<00:05:08.480> make<00:05:08.630> it<00:05:08.720> work<00:05:08.870> on<00:05:09.140> the

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
it for mobile and we make it work on the

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.140 
it for mobile and we make it work on the
on<00:05:09.500> the<00:05:09.650> computer<00:05:10.040> that's<00:05:10.220> great<00:05:10.460> but<00:05:10.970> it

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
on the computer that's great but it

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.730 
on the computer that's great but it
works<00:05:11.390> and<00:05:11.630> it<00:05:11.750> takes<00:05:11.900> advantage<00:05:12.380> if<00:05:12.530> it's<00:05:12.680> a

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
works and it takes advantage if it's a

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.770 
works and it takes advantage if it's a
computer<00:05:13.130> as<00:05:13.250> big<00:05:13.460> as<00:05:13.580> you<00:05:13.669> can<00:05:13.700> go<00:05:13.940> if<00:05:14.510> it's<00:05:14.660> on

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
computer as big as you can go if it's on

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.210 
computer as big as you can go if it's on
the<00:05:14.960> little<00:05:15.169> tiny<00:05:15.350> phone<00:05:15.650> it's<00:05:15.860> gonna<00:05:15.980> be<00:05:16.130> as

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
the little tiny phone it's gonna be as

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.420 
the little tiny phone it's gonna be as
small<00:05:16.430> as<00:05:16.580> you<00:05:16.870> perfect<00:05:17.870> is<00:05:18.290> this<00:05:18.440> a<00:05:18.470> setup<00:05:19.190> for

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
small as you perfect is this a setup for

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.040 
small as you perfect is this a setup for
the<00:05:19.520> radion<00:05:19.940> right<00:05:20.240> now<00:05:20.390> or<00:05:20.630> what<00:05:20.840> lighter

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
the radion right now or what lighter

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.930 
the radion right now or what lighter
your<00:05:21.230> control<00:05:21.530> this<00:05:21.919> one's<00:05:22.100> a<00:05:22.190> Radeon<00:05:22.610> it's

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
your control this one's a Radeon it's

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.640 
your control this one's a Radeon it's
actually<00:05:23.210> the<00:05:23.300> Radeon<00:05:23.660> we<00:05:23.900> also<00:05:24.050> have<00:05:24.350> over

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
actually the Radeon we also have over

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:25.460 
actually the Radeon we also have over
here<00:05:24.770> the<00:05:24.919> Aeon

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
here the Aeon

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.230 
here the Aeon
this<00:05:25.800> one<00:05:26.010> right<00:05:26.190> here<00:05:26.250> yeah<00:05:26.730> the<00:05:26.880> middle<00:05:27.000> ones

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.590 
this one right here yeah the middle ones
the<00:05:27.330> radion<00:05:27.690> and<00:05:28.110> then<00:05:28.500> we<00:05:28.590> have<00:05:28.710> the<00:05:28.800> AI<00:05:29.600> Hydra

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
the radion and then we have the AI Hydra

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.240 
the radion and then we have the AI Hydra
up<00:05:30.780> here<00:05:31.020> which<00:05:31.440> is<00:05:31.470> brand<00:05:31.830> new<00:05:31.890> it<00:05:32.040> we've<00:05:32.160> got

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
up here which is brand new it we've got

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.380 
up here which is brand new it we've got
a<00:05:32.280> new<00:05:32.430> module<00:05:32.820> that<00:05:32.850> will<00:05:32.970> be<00:05:33.090> coming<00:05:33.240> out

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
a new module that will be coming out

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.010 
a new module that will be coming out
this<00:05:33.450> fall

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
this fall

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.290 
this fall
no<00:05:34.230> Berbick<00:05:34.620> now<00:05:34.770> control<00:05:35.250> the<00:05:35.490> the<00:05:35.730> Vega<00:05:35.940> and

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
no Berbick now control the the Vega and

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.270 
no Berbick now control the the Vega and
the<00:05:36.390> hydrent<00:05:36.870> even<00:05:37.050> the<00:05:37.230> new<00:05:37.380> Hydra<00:05:37.710> 52<00:05:38.130> that

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
the hydrent even the new Hydra 52 that

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.700 
the hydrent even the new Hydra 52 that
happens<00:05:38.720> and<00:05:39.720> then<00:05:39.810> the<00:05:39.930> third<00:05:40.140> light<00:05:40.380> we<00:05:40.530> have

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
happens and then the third light we have

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.830 
happens and then the third light we have
is<00:05:40.920> the<00:05:41.130> is<00:05:41.550> a<00:05:41.610> Kessel<00:05:42.120> and<00:05:42.270> that<00:05:42.480> uses<00:05:42.720> the

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
is the is a Kessel and that uses the

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.080 
is the is a Kessel and that uses the
standard<00:05:43.050> zero<00:05:43.410> to<00:05:43.560> ten<00:05:43.740> lighting<00:05:44.100> so<00:05:44.820> I<00:05:44.850> think

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
standard zero to ten lighting so I think

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.460 
standard zero to ten lighting so I think
it's<00:05:45.180> pretty<00:05:45.510> innovative<00:05:45.810> that<00:05:46.200> we've<00:05:46.320> got

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
it's pretty innovative that we've got

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.100 
it's pretty innovative that we've got
one<00:05:46.740> unified<00:05:47.490> control<00:05:47.760> system<00:05:48.390> that<00:05:48.840> controls

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
one unified control system that controls

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.560 
one unified control system that controls
all<00:05:49.500> of<00:05:49.530> these<00:05:49.800> lights<00:05:50.070> really<00:05:50.970> it<00:05:51.240> makes<00:05:51.420> it

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
all of these lights really it makes it

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.840 
all of these lights really it makes it
easy<00:05:51.720> it<00:05:52.110> says<00:05:52.440> the<00:05:53.070> whole<00:05:53.190> purpose<00:05:53.430> of<00:05:53.700> this

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
easy it says the whole purpose of this

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.840 
easy it says the whole purpose of this
right<00:05:55.670> excellent

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850
