00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.010
 how is money created then 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.650
 we say that there is money creation 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.969
 when new money circulates 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.330
 in the economy ie to make the 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.300
 change 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.080
 news and in the hands of agents 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.000
 while non-financial economic 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.529
 create money in the system 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.360
 economic there are 3 3 3 rungs in fact 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.920
 creating a situation of the 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.579
 currency there is first at the top the 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.100
 central banks 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.660
 then second tier banks and 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.949
 then economic agents 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.899
 financial and it's only at the moment 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:41.760
 where they are non-economic agents 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.519
 who use this currency 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.929
 that there is money creation then we 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.489
 often when we talk about creation 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:50.699
 monetary one imagine the board to 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.310
 tickets that turns or tickets or 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:56.200
 or coins actually the currency 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.060
 metal money or money 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.250
 fiduciary coins and notes 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.110
 it's only 10% of the currency that 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.310
 in circulation most of the money 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.600
 in circulation it is the currency 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.580
 scriptural, ie simply 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.840
 postings on our bank accounts 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.250
 the bulk of the payments confers 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.570
 effect for example with a blue card 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.740
 or a check and there is no change 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.420
 who is really exchanging it's just 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.400
 writing games between accounts 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.260
 which changes the question so it's 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.870
 actually know how the currency 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.100
 scriptural and create and the currency 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.330
 scriptural in fact to decree 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.680
 mainly by the banks 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.030
 commercials so it's not at the 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.130
 central bank a thousand treasuries 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.600
 who create the scriptural money this 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.220
 are the commercial banks it's up to 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.040
 tell the banks in which we have 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.990
 all an account with a checkbook of a 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.270
 blue card and his dishes so how 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.710
 it's happening and ben makes it a bank 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.030
 it creates money simply 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.640
 by granting credit 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.590
 it is often said that banks it 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.690
 lends deposits to others 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.369
 economic agents in reality these are 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.229
 not the deposits that will make 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.479
 credits but these are the credits 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.710
 granted to economic agents who will 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.540
 make deposits and so that's why 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.929
 say credits make deposits 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.869
 so when the bank lends money to 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:03.429
 one of her clients she creates money 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.350
 in fact in general she does not have this 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:06.310
 money before she creates money 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.100
 ex nihilo 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.500
 and when seven camps there when the sound 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.880
 customer will spend this money with 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.800
 other economic agents this is what 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.100
 moment there is monetary creation 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.870
 this is not the simple act of doing 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.090
 the loan is the fact that the agent 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.650
 spends this money is so do it 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.110
 enter into circulation in the economy 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.950
 so that's the main way of 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.930
 create money 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.630
 it is therefore the loans granted to 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.790
 individuals who will come to swell the 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.340
 currency stock then there is another 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.110
 way to create money that them 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.580
 which is more anecdotal it's all 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.170
 simply exchanging 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.030
 currencies against other currencies by 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.489
 example if the bank of France exchange 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.170
 dollars against euros she goes 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.629
 to bring in euros into circulation and 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.269
 she will destroy dollars so she 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:53.890
 will create from the hand then the currency 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.540
 can it be destroyed I like to give a 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.819
 answer element yes already she can 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.660
 to be destroyed if we exchange 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.239
 they were betting against one another have 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.590
 destroys part of this currency has 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.959
 especially in fact it is destroyed when 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.549
 individuals repay their loans 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.549
 if I have so when the bank has me 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.810
 granted credit 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.660
 gl to create money but when I 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.579
 refunds this credit I withdraw this 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.489
 money from circulation and so I 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:21.099
 destroy the currency actually I 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.079
 represented that with the schema of a 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.579
 bath then there there is the 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.410
 money creation so especially by 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.269
 the credit that is influential that comes 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.879
 to swell the money supply which is a 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.709
 stock and the destruction of currency gets 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:34.810
 made by repayment mainly 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.000
 by the repayment of the credits and so 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.769
 it's actually the money supply going 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.420
 depend on the speed with which the 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.560
 currency will be created with which the 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.819
 currency will be destroyed ie from 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.700
 their habits the amount of 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:48.269
 credits granted is reimbursed to a 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.269
 given moment
