00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
you and I was fast forward this and when

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.550 
you and I was fast forward this and when
I<00:03:15.250> get<00:03:15.730> a<00:03:15.760> drop<00:03:16.090> I'll<00:03:16.330> just<00:03:16.480> like<00:03:16.690> slow<00:03:17.140> motion

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
I get a drop I'll just like slow motion

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.600 
I get a drop I'll just like slow motion
so<00:03:18.370> I<00:03:20.160> get<00:03:21.160> about<00:03:22.230> maybe<00:03:23.230> a<00:03:23.620> couple<00:03:23.890> room<00:03:24.160> skins

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
so I get about maybe a couple room skins

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.080 
so I get about maybe a couple room skins
every<00:03:24.970> 20<00:03:25.540> minutes<00:03:25.810> so<00:03:26.700> probably<00:03:27.700> an<00:03:27.760> hour

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
every 20 minutes so probably an hour

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.740 
every 20 minutes so probably an hour
I'll<00:03:28.510> get<00:03:28.780> like<00:03:29.310> maybe<00:03:30.310> a<00:03:30.730> trim<00:03:31.090> skims<00:03:31.420> and

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
I'll get like maybe a trim skims and

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.839 
I'll get like maybe a trim skims and
maybe<00:03:32.380> ten<00:03:32.769> ring<00:03:32.980> daggers<00:03:33.430> or<00:03:33.459> something<00:03:33.760> like

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:33.849 
maybe ten ring daggers or something like

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.100 
maybe ten ring daggers or something like
that<00:03:34.060> so<00:03:34.599> that's<00:03:34.690> a<00:03:34.840> good<00:03:34.870> 300<00:03:35.620> K<00:03:35.739> plus<00:03:36.040> and<00:03:36.190> on

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
that so that's a good 300 K plus and on

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.940 
that so that's a good 300 K plus and on
sometimes<00:03:38.110> more<00:03:38.440> it<00:03:38.590> really<00:03:38.769> depends<00:03:39.370> also<00:03:40.180> I

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
sometimes more it really depends also I

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.940 
sometimes more it really depends also I
suggest<00:03:41.950> you<00:03:42.129> wear<00:03:42.540> ring<00:03:43.540> go<00:03:43.690> wealth<00:03:43.950> because

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
suggest you wear ring go wealth because

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.559 
suggest you wear ring go wealth because
that<00:03:45.099> increases<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.610> chances<00:03:45.970> of<00:03:46.030> them

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
that increases the chances of them

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.970 
that increases the chances of them
dropping<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:48.370> if<00:03:49.209> you<00:03:49.390> don't<00:03:49.569> get<00:03:49.660> anything

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
dropping and if you don't get anything

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.289 
dropping and if you don't get anything
like<00:03:50.980> any<00:03:51.190> drops<00:03:51.579> and<00:03:51.879> your<00:03:51.970> first<00:03:52.120> five

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
like any drops and your first five

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:53.850 
like any drops and your first five
minutes<00:03:52.420> don't<00:03:52.750> give<00:03:52.989> up<00:03:53.140> just<00:03:53.319> keep<00:03:53.530> going

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
minutes don't give up just keep going

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.640 
minutes don't give up just keep going
this<00:03:54.819> is<00:03:54.970> also<00:03:55.120> really<00:03:55.420> good<00:03:55.630> strength<00:03:55.959> XP<00:03:56.410> or

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
this is also really good strength XP or

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.910 
this is also really good strength XP or
any<00:03:57.310> combat<00:03:57.850> skill<00:03:58.470> because<00:03:59.470> they<00:03:59.620> don't<00:03:59.799> hit

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
any combat skill because they don't hit

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.470 
any combat skill because they don't hit
that<00:03:59.980> high<00:04:00.250> and<00:04:00.549> they're<00:04:01.000> really<00:04:01.120> easy<00:04:01.299> to

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
that high and they're really easy to

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:14.610 
that high and they're really easy to
kill

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:27.540 

off-key<00:04:15.489> fight<00:04:15.700> until<00:04:16.090> I<00:04:16.949> get<00:04:17.949> some

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.640 

and<00:04:28.060> always<00:04:28.360> a<00:04:28.509> right-click<00:04:29.050> on<00:04:29.199> everything

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
and always a right-click on everything

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.400 
and always a right-click on everything
because<00:04:29.800> sometimes<00:04:30.280> the<00:04:30.460> rune<00:04:30.639> daggers<00:04:31.410> hide

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
because sometimes the rune daggers hide

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.469 
because sometimes the rune daggers hide
you<00:04:33.160> can't<00:04:33.370> really<00:04:33.490> see<00:04:33.669> them<00:04:33.759> that<00:04:33.849> good<00:04:34.090> so

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
you can't really see them that good so

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:39.689 
you can't really see them that good so
just<00:04:34.780> make<00:04:34.900> sure<00:04:34.930> you<00:04:35.110> right-click<00:04:35.289> oh<00:04:38.699> there

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
just make sure you right-click oh there

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:40.170 
just make sure you right-click oh there
we<00:04:39.789> go

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
we go

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:47.330 
we go
rune<00:04:41.080> skim<00:04:42.599> and<00:04:43.889> about<00:04:44.889> a<00:04:45.310> minute<00:04:45.759> there<00:04:46.210> we<00:04:46.330> go

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
rune skim and about a minute there we go

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.990 
rune skim and about a minute there we go
so<00:04:49.289> it's<00:04:50.289> really<00:04:50.560> common<00:04:50.949> I<00:04:51.310> highly<00:04:51.789> suggest

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
so it's really common I highly suggest

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.640 
so it's really common I highly suggest
this<00:04:52.710> you<00:04:53.710> can<00:04:53.949> earn<00:04:54.400> money<00:04:54.580> really<00:04:54.909> fast<00:04:55.650> get

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
this you can earn money really fast get

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.029 
this you can earn money really fast get

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
of food because you don't have that high
