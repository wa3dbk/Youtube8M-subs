00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:08.429
 Hello dear viewers at least 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.929
 to bring to your attention workmanship 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.460
 and minor repairs 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:20.150
 babina holders home conditions on 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:22.920
 most likely that there will be a repair for sale 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:29.390
 enough reel holders 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:33.149
 but me for example with such an insert 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:36.410
 There seems to be ceramic but not good 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:41.390
 I will soon redo it 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.390
 Barina holders I make myself 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:54.210
 then hereâ€™s how you see it is nothing 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:57.030
 different from my reel holder that 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.129
 same fastening principle is the only thing 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.830
 that only I machined cone 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:07.920
 a little under my reel and wall, wreck 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:10.439
 but such a mount at home 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.450
 it will be a little difficult for you 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.950
 so I switched to manufacturing here 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.670
 such 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:23.070
 reel holders very comfortable 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:27.170
 make the tube pulled on 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:30.170
 lathe machined under the holder and 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.170
 connected 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:36.479
 I connect to disentangle prutochek and soot 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.670
 on glue 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.780
 so he doesnâ€™t turn around 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.479
 therefore pressed 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.680
 big problems in work not like 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.649
 small loads 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:54.000
 but the highlight of what is here is 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:57.630
 these my reel holders when we are with 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 you start working on any other 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.000
 let's say even such 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.310
 Indian I have a reel holder 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.830
 as you see it only flare 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.910
 he has no inserts here 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:15.060
 nothing this is such a cheap option but 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.250
 how to get out of this situation, thread all 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:22.190
 equal starts very thin hard 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:27.930
 work I looked thought and decided 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:33.020
 use the services of your box 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:35.280
 with beads like i do i initially 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.300
 made so those that I have 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.750
 there were 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:43.709
 but were without i raspaltsevat with one with 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.430
 the other side 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:52.200
 ream simply and pick up here such 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:56.520
 here I insert glasses beads and paste 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:03.450
 as you can see here on the brilliance marked 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:07.019
 here and in front and here and here that I 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:10.110
 I can calmly use this 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:13.290
 On this I already told the first film 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:16.950
 this is the thickness of the string 0 0 15 she 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.019
 quietly running does not break well 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.820
 slips 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.400
 so I initially produce such 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:27.950
 here are the blanks but this one is a little bit 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:33.450
 did under another option 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:35.940
 myself work and then I pick myself 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.250
 here are the beads but initially I already 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.750
 Made picked up for themselves beads under 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:45.660
 my diameter of the drill so take a needle 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:50.280
 beads which i need to be lubricating 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:54.120
 here I coat it with glue 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:59.750
 gel which moment quickly dries but 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.750
 not the moment as the moment here is such a glue 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.810
 why did you eat we have the opportunity 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:09.569
 so we slowly inserted 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.989
 and centered if you will 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:15.330
 use the way here like me 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.709
 first used set stuck 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.620
 then centered 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.470
 he will not fit here the most ideal have taken 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.930
 On a needle they put on the one we need 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:29.240
 bead points here 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:32.520
 need beads. and after that we take 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:36.000
 missed th tube Elim here so take 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:42.330
 insert pasted she missed us 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:44.520
 glue he holds us apparently yes then 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:49.280
 we have already and centered 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:52.190
 and here is our bead 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:57.540
 do the same on the other side 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:05:00.990
 the whole point is what beads 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.800
 I am all but certain here 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.830
 here is red 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:08.300
 I have a high quality 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:12.600
 This is not an advertisement of the Japanese manufacturer. 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:16.500
 or German which here is little black 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:19.740
 they are polished enough 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:23.490
 not polished has an inner 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:26.310
 good processing and outdoor good 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:33.330
 glued thread slips just 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:37.080
 amazing to say just one minus when 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:39.060
 you will not be quite neat like this 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:44.370
 throw reel holders 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:48.720
 then 1 2 3 5 and 10 times our bead 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:51.710
 break away and have to glue the same 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.570
 back but it's all fixable too 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:58.940
 believe with a converted reel 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.940
 holder work much better 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:05.300
 than with a cheap budget option I wish 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.650
 good luck to you soon on my 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.650
 channel bye
