phones but not with the stereo I mean

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.309 
phones but not with the stereo I mean
each<00:02:56.660> phone<00:02:56.900> one's<00:02:57.049> a<00:02:57.109> little<00:02:57.200> different

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
each phone one's a little different

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.410 
each phone one's a little different
obviously<00:02:57.769> everybody<00:02:58.250> knows<00:02:58.459> that<00:02:58.670> there's

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
obviously everybody knows that there's

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.849 
obviously everybody knows that there's
so<00:02:59.600> many<00:02:59.720> different<00:03:00.170> type<00:03:00.290> phones<00:03:00.560> and

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
different things that each phone has on

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.039 
different things that each phone has on
but<00:03:04.519> otherwise<00:03:05.150> that's<00:03:05.510> pretty<00:03:05.750> simple

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
but otherwise that's pretty simple

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.319
