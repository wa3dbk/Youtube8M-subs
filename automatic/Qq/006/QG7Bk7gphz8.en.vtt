00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
you know the area that we will be on the

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.660 
you know the area that we will be on the
slippery<00:00:34.960> path<00:00:35.350> where<00:00:36.010> we<00:00:36.160> can<00:00:36.340> do<00:00:36.489> a<00:00:36.520> little

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
slippery path where we can do a little

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.209 
slippery path where we can do a little
bit<00:00:36.969> of<00:00:37.030> drifting<00:00:37.809> as<00:00:37.960> well<00:00:38.140> but<00:00:38.620> our<00:00:38.770> first

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:39.219 
bit of drifting as well but our first

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:41.470 
bit of drifting as well but our first
driving<00:00:39.879> back<00:00:40.090> we<00:00:40.540> will<00:00:40.660> have

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
driving back we will have

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:53.960 
driving back we will have
a<00:00:41.510> 45<00:00:42.320> degree<00:00:42.590> f

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.460 

we<00:00:54.970> have<00:00:55.120> two<00:00:55.390> main<00:00:55.690> purposes<00:00:56.320> humane

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
we have two main purposes humane

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.230 
we have two main purposes humane
important<00:00:59.470> things<00:00:59.800> we<00:00:59.980> wish<00:01:00.130> to<00:01:00.160> let<00:01:01.060> the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:01.240 
important things we wish to let the

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.390 
important things we wish to let the
drive<00:01:01.720> their<00:01:01.930> customers<00:01:02.410> experience<00:01:03.100> at

drive their customers experience at

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.000 
drive their customers experience at
first<00:01:03.640> their<00:01:04.239> own<00:01:04.390> driving<00:01:04.720> skills<00:01:05.350> so<00:01:05.830> at

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
first their own driving skills so at

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.270 
first their own driving skills so at
first<00:01:06.480> how<00:01:07.480> they<00:01:07.660> drive<00:01:07.870> at<00:01:08.650> the<00:01:08.710> moment<00:01:08.830> and

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
first how they drive at the moment and

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.300 
first how they drive at the moment and
what<00:01:10.030> they<00:01:10.210> can<00:01:10.270> improve<00:01:10.630> perhaps<00:01:11.260> and<00:01:11.530> in

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
what they can improve perhaps and in

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.700 
what they can improve perhaps and in
specific<00:01:12.880> situation<00:01:13.480> so<00:01:13.720> improving<00:01:14.230> driving

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
specific situation so improving driving

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.100 
specific situation so improving driving
skills<00:01:15.010> is<00:01:15.280> one<00:01:15.880> main<00:01:16.240> pillar<00:01:16.630> of<00:01:16.870> this

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
skills is one main pillar of this

here and to know how to work with it in
specific<00:01:34.030> situation<00:01:34.630> so<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:34.990> driver<00:01:35.229> should

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
specific situation so the driver should

specific situation so the driver should
improve<00:01:35.920> driving<00:01:36.369> skills<00:01:36.610> and<00:01:37.030> should<00:01:37.270> be

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
improve driving skills and should be

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.020 
improve driving skills and should be
informed<00:01:38.229> about<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.740> technology<00:01:39.430> which<00:01:39.880> we

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
and don't forget that with the 4matic

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.479 
and don't forget that with the 4matic
system<00:02:28.659> also<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.319> front<00:02:29.590> wheels<00:02:29.920> are<00:02:30.099> pulling

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
system also the front wheels are pulling

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.430 
system also the front wheels are pulling
you<00:02:30.610> out<00:02:30.670> at<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.060> same<00:02:31.360> time<00:02:31.599> front<00:02:32.260> wheel

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
you out at the same time front wheel

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:42.300 
you out at the same time front wheel
both<00:02:32.680> laugh<00:02:32.920> traction

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.680 

knuckles<00:02:42.640> are

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.720 

music<00:02:47.690> returned<00:02:48.080> even<00:02:48.830> if<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.190> speed<00:02:49.460> of<00:02:49.700> the

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
music returned even if the speed of the

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.940 
music returned even if the speed of the
car<00:02:50.030> is<00:02:50.240> quite<00:02:50.510> slow<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:51.230> front<00:02:51.530> wheels<00:02:51.620> have

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
car is quite slow the front wheels have

00:02:51.950 --> 00:03:05.580 
car is quite slow the front wheels have
to<00:02:52.100> turn<00:02:52.280> fast

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.250 

50<00:03:06.430> driving<00:03:06.760> skills<00:03:07.120> it's<00:03:07.450> very<00:03:07.690> important

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
50 driving skills it's very important

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.320 
50 driving skills it's very important
that<00:03:08.290> everybody<00:03:08.800> is<00:03:09.280> able<00:03:09.610> to<00:03:09.940> perform

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
that everybody is able to perform

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.259 
that everybody is able to perform
emergency<00:03:10.750> brake<00:03:11.260> that<00:03:11.980> sounds<00:03:12.310> a<00:03:12.370> bit<00:03:12.519> basic

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
emergency brake that sounds a bit basic

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.150 
emergency brake that sounds a bit basic
right<00:03:13.959> but<00:03:14.200> there<00:03:14.410> is<00:03:14.560> a<00:03:14.590> huge<00:03:14.920> gap<00:03:15.129> between

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
right but there is a huge gap between

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.509 
right but there is a huge gap between
theory<00:03:15.940> and<00:03:15.970> practice<00:03:16.120> so<00:03:16.870> not<00:03:17.050> everybody<00:03:17.519> can

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
theory and practice so not everybody can

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.030 
theory and practice so not everybody can
perform<00:03:19.030> one<00:03:19.269> so<00:03:19.780> emergency<00:03:20.290> braking<00:03:20.560> is<00:03:20.800> most

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
perform one so emergency braking is most

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.850 
perform one so emergency braking is most
important<00:03:21.580> even<00:03:22.330> if<00:03:22.450> we<00:03:22.569> have<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.959> BAS<00:03:23.590> and

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
important even if we have the BAS and

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.009 
important even if we have the BAS and
abs<00:03:24.340> oh<00:03:24.610> there<00:03:24.819> are<00:03:24.940> lots<00:03:24.970> of<00:03:25.269> supporters<00:03:25.810> but

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
abs oh there are lots of supporters but

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.410 
abs oh there are lots of supporters but
you<00:03:26.170> have<00:03:26.349> to<00:03:26.560> do<00:03:26.739> the<00:03:27.010> breaking<00:03:27.400> right<00:03:27.670> go<00:03:28.239> and

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
you have to do the breaking right go and

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.390 
you have to do the breaking right go and
this<00:03:28.569> is<00:03:28.720> this<00:03:29.260> is<00:03:29.440> one<00:03:29.650> main<00:03:29.830> target<00:03:30.280> that

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
this is this is one main target that

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.820 
this is this is one main target that
everybody<00:03:30.940> is<00:03:31.180> able<00:03:31.390> to<00:03:31.629> break<00:03:31.870> and<00:03:32.410> everybody

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
everybody is able to break and everybody

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.190 
everybody is able to break and everybody
is<00:03:33.010> able<00:03:33.220> to<00:03:33.549> break<00:03:33.819> and<00:03:34.060> swerve<00:03:34.629> at<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:34.989> same

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
is able to break and swerve at the same

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.460 
is able to break and swerve at the same
time<00:03:35.440> so<00:03:35.769> this<00:03:35.920> is<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.160> main<00:03:36.370> advantage

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
time so this is the main advantage

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.589 
time so this is the main advantage
