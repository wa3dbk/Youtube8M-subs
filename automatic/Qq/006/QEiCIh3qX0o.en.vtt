00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.890
 hello I am alexander pau do 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.420
 professional photographer also everything 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.040
 like a tomato and today I'm going 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.700
 explain how to make a portrait 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.440
 without flash 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.330
 it's not always easy to do a 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.769
 portrait when you do not have the flash 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.029
 when for example you are in a 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:18.410
 room inside and you do it I 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.610
 had to portray someone 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.440
 with ambient light 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.029
 we will try to see some 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.949
 little tips to overcome this problem 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.150
 using the different sources of 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.279
 light we can have our 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.859
 provision for example windows of 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.329
 screens or artificial lighting by 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.530
 example a bay window can you 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.750
 bring a soft enough light 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.280
 preferred a light not too strong 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.410
 with a very sunny weather but 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.790
 rather a time with clouds that goes 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.110
 allow to diffuse the light and 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.579
 to have something much more 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.500
 homogeneous on light sources 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.390
 like a bedside lamp or a halogen 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.129
 you can for example place in front of a 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.480
 paper 4 that allows you to broadcast 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.129
 light and have something of 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.629
 much softer it is important to 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.059
 pay attention to the position of your 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.920
 subject in relation to light so if 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.140
 you place your model in front of the 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.610
 source the light may explode 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.500
 completely face and flatten 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.990
 all the shadows it can be important 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.119
 to place the source rather on the side 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.219
 and play with tomorrow's one 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.020
 to change the attention shadows 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:13.909
 however do not position the light 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.009
 too much on the side which will cause a 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.539
 shadow too much marked on the side 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.529
 opposite 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:20.659
 if you only have one light source 

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:22.609
 you can think the source 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.109
 main with different elements to the 

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:26.810
 provision for example you can 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:28.279
 use a player like these as well 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.099
 than a mirror if you want a 

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:32.749
 stronger light and more direct or 

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:35.329
 still a white surface like those 

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:36.889
 polystyrene these reflectors exists in 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.840
 several formats and especially in 

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:40.819
 several materials that allow you 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.310
 to give a dominant to your image 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:45.259
 for example a blue surface gave me 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.209
 a much colder color or a 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.709
 surface to gather a warmer one 

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:49.969
 white surface like those polystyrene 

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:50.270
 brings us a lot more light 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:51.919
 fresh 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.929
 it will certainly be necessary to approach the 

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:55.489
 plate of your subject now you 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.439
 did you realize a portrait without flash 

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:59.090
 do not hesitate to test different 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.169
 solutions with everything you have to 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.169
 provision at home
