00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
all right today I'm going to do a quick

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.019 
all right today I'm going to do a quick
demo<00:00:13.519> of<00:00:13.849> the<00:00:14.389> Strymon<00:00:14.809> timeline<00:00:15.530> delay

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:16.029 
demo of the Strymon timeline delay

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.390 
demo of the Strymon timeline delay
latest<00:00:17.029> addition<00:00:17.450> to<00:00:17.630> my<00:00:17.950> new<00:00:18.950> paddle<00:00:19.189> board<00:00:19.369> I

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
latest addition to my new paddle board I

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.070 
latest addition to my new paddle board I
got<00:00:19.550> a<00:00:19.580> lot<00:00:19.759> of<00:00:19.790> new<00:00:20.180> stuff<00:00:20.419> going<00:00:20.450> on<00:00:20.750> here<00:00:20.930> but

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
got a lot of new stuff going on here but

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.990 
got a lot of new stuff going on here but
we're<00:00:21.200> going<00:00:21.290> to<00:00:21.380> focus<00:00:21.529> on<00:00:22.040> the<00:00:22.610> timeline

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
we're going to focus on the timeline

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.440 
we're going to focus on the timeline
mainly<00:00:23.360> today<00:00:24.279> I've<00:00:25.279> just<00:00:25.550> updated<00:00:26.119> it<00:00:26.210> with

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.450 
mainly today I've just updated it with

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:32.109 
mainly today I've just updated it with
the<00:00:27.849> latest<00:00:28.849> firmware<00:00:29.239> which<00:00:29.960> adds<00:00:30.290> the<00:00:31.119> patch

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
the latest firmware which adds the patch

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.760 
the latest firmware which adds the patch
name<00:00:32.419> and<00:00:32.860> preset<00:00:33.860> spillover<00:00:35.410> I've<00:00:36.410> got<00:00:36.590> two

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
name and preset spillover I've got two

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.400 
name and preset spillover I've got two
basic<00:00:37.239> setups<00:00:38.239> right<00:00:38.480> now<00:00:38.630> I<00:00:38.660> got<00:00:38.870> two<00:00:38.989> presets

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
basic setups right now I got two presets

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.670 
basic setups right now I got two presets
that<00:00:39.590> I<00:00:39.620> want<00:00:39.920> is<00:00:40.040> a<00:00:40.250> dual<00:00:41.149> delay<00:00:41.590> it's<00:00:42.590> a

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
that I want is a dual delay it's a

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.370 
that I want is a dual delay it's a
digital<00:00:42.890> so<00:00:43.760> I<00:00:43.790> have<00:00:44.060> two<00:00:44.480> delays<00:00:44.780> in<00:00:44.990> series

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:45.380 
digital so I have two delays in series

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.920 
digital so I have two delays in series
one<00:00:45.710> is<00:00:45.860> it<00:00:46.090> the<00:00:47.090> main<00:00:47.300> ones<00:00:47.510> that<00:00:47.570> dotted

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
one is it the main ones that dotted

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.640 
one is it the main ones that dotted
eighth<00:00:48.610> the<00:00:50.079> secondary<00:00:51.079> delay<00:00:51.410> which

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
eighth the secondary delay which

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.830 
eighth the secondary delay which
actually<00:00:52.040> is<00:00:52.160> first<00:00:52.490> in<00:00:52.730> the<00:00:52.760> series<00:00:53.090> is<00:00:53.540> set

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
actually is first in the series is set

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.440 
actually is first in the series is set
to<00:00:54.470> it<00:00:54.620> just<00:00:54.829> an<00:00:55.010> eighth<00:00:55.250> so<00:00:56.120> you<00:00:56.180> get<00:00:56.300> a<00:00:56.329> nice

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
to it just an eighth so you get a nice

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.270 
to it just an eighth so you get a nice
bounce<00:00:56.780> to<00:00:56.960> it<00:00:57.110> when<00:00:57.410> you're<00:00:57.860> doing<00:00:57.980> the<00:00:58.160> you

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
bounce to it when you're doing the you

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.150 
bounce to it when you're doing the you
to<00:00:58.430> be<00:00:58.460> kind<00:00:58.730> of<00:00:58.850> stuff<00:00:59.090> I<00:00:59.470> have<00:01:00.470> a<00:01:00.620> little<00:01:00.980> bit

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
to be kind of stuff I have a little bit

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.550 
to be kind of stuff I have a little bit
of<00:01:01.190> modulation<00:01:01.670> on<00:01:01.970> it<00:01:02.180> set<00:01:02.480> pretty<00:01:02.870> fast<00:01:03.110> but

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:03.560 
of modulation on it set pretty fast but

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.399 
of modulation on it set pretty fast but
at<00:01:04.159> a<00:01:04.220> shallow<00:01:04.519> rate<00:01:04.869> fast<00:01:05.869> rate<00:01:06.140> but<00:01:06.380> a

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
at a shallow rate fast rate but a

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.240 
at a shallow rate fast rate but a
shadowed<00:01:06.860> shallow<00:01:07.340> depth<00:01:08.740> mixed<00:01:09.740> in<00:01:09.860> fifty

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
shadowed shallow depth mixed in fifty

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.039 
shadowed shallow depth mixed in fifty
percent<00:01:10.520> three<00:01:10.880> o'clock<00:01:11.119> on<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:11.450> mix<00:01:11.659> knob<00:01:11.840> is

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
percent three o'clock on the mix knob is

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:13.539 
percent three o'clock on the mix knob is
actually<00:01:12.380> fifty<00:01:12.680> percent<00:01:12.950> according<00:01:13.250> to<00:01:13.460> the

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
actually fifty percent according to the

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:15.039 
actually fifty percent according to the
manual<00:01:13.939> and<00:01:13.999> that<00:01:14.149> sounds<00:01:14.509> about<00:01:14.689> right<00:01:14.719> to<00:01:14.960> my

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
manual and that sounds about right to my

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.039 
manual and that sounds about right to my
ears<00:01:15.259> too<00:01:16.149> and<00:01:17.149> then<00:01:17.299> on<00:01:17.509> this<00:01:17.689> other<00:01:17.869> one<00:01:18.020> I

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
ears too and then on this other one I

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.149 
ears too and then on this other one I
have<00:01:18.520> my<00:01:19.520> shimmer<00:01:19.850> patch<00:01:20.119> which<00:01:20.479> is<00:01:20.659> the<00:01:20.810> ice

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
have my shimmer patch which is the ice

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.330 
have my shimmer patch which is the ice
delay<00:01:22.159> machine<00:01:22.840> setup<00:01:23.840> very<00:01:24.049> similar<00:01:24.590> except

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
delay machine setup very similar except

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.359 
delay machine setup very similar except
it's<00:01:25.520> just<00:01:25.670> a<00:01:25.759> single<00:01:26.090> delay<00:01:26.389> not<00:01:26.689> a<00:01:26.719> dual<00:01:27.369> also

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
it's just a single delay not a dual also

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.770 
it's just a single delay not a dual also
50%<00:01:29.060> mix<00:01:29.600> I<00:01:29.959> have<00:01:30.259> the<00:01:30.740> ice<00:01:31.340> blended<00:01:31.939> in<00:01:32.270> just

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
50% mix I have the ice blended in just

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:42.660 
50% mix I have the ice blended in just
below<00:01:33.499> 50%<00:01:36.459> going<00:01:37.459> here<00:01:37.729> into<00:01:38.149> the<00:01:39.939> parameters

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
below 50% going here into the parameters

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.359 
below 50% going here into the parameters
blend<00:01:43.670> I<00:01:43.909> have<00:01:44.060> it<00:01:44.179> set<00:01:44.420> just<00:01:44.689> under<00:01:45.020> 50%<00:01:45.369> okay

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
blend I have it set just under 50% okay

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.389 
blend I have it set just under 50% okay
so<00:01:46.429> for<00:01:46.670> this<00:01:46.759> clip<00:01:47.029> I'm<00:01:47.779> doing<00:01:48.109> is<00:01:48.399> I'm

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
so for this clip I'm doing is I'm

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:50.739 
so for this clip I'm doing is I'm
running<00:01:49.670> through<00:01:49.880> all<00:01:49.939> of<00:01:50.029> this<00:01:50.240> stuff<00:01:50.479> but

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:50.749 
running through all of this stuff but

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:52.690 
running through all of this stuff but
it's<00:01:51.020> all<00:01:51.170> being<00:01:51.350> most<00:01:51.920> of<00:01:52.069> the<00:01:52.159> fuzz<00:01:52.340> pedals

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
it's all being most of the fuzz pedals

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.190 
it's all being most of the fuzz pedals
