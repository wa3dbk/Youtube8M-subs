00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.509
 and there folks of the month well received linux 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.870
 here with samsung galaxy s 4 keep 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.690
 another video of this same basic we 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.049
 there I am making here the basic video 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.000
 here I am trying here to make of 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.650
 all options and cell phone 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.470
 There are things that I do not know, there are things that 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.960
 I know what I know I speak the basics 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.390
 so today I 'm going to face this way 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.330
 the power save mode after the 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.920
 to samsung for playing 4.3 for 4 4 2 he 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.130
 disappeared there with a little joke that 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.440
 it was up and now it has only this mode 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.739
 energy efficiency and energy savings because 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.300
 if you die when you do energy and 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.879
 basically take for example let's go 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.840
 here power cpu power save 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.090
 and limited cpu commitment 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.170
 Here I am, here she goes. 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.020
 teaching of 300 thousand garis to 1.9 of 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.000
 arrive a point 9 arriving at the message 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:07.470
 Some place for me is to see, for example. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:10.799
 has 300 600 8 300 and 800 1.2 1.9 it up 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.979
 1.9 when you enable this option here 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.820
 it will reach a point 21.5 seila 1 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.310
 and this ceiling is less a step away from 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.340
 processor touch to save 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.890
 energy is the energy saving of the 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.080
 screen to use low power level for 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.520
 screen or have to come here it goes 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.360
 simply pick up will adjust to 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.890
 down this luminosity of the screen to 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.159
 save because the same big villain 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.829
 in the battery consumption is the screen 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.500
 and also occurs if you leave the 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.439
 background programs such as 3g or 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.829
 wifi and youtube gps 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.899
 he will also start to eat his 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:54.780
 battery is then what you are not 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.030
 using power off response to 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.710
 touch it is possible to extend the life of the 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.229
 battery turning off the response to the top 10 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.540
 and you will type on the keyboard he always 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.200
 will it respond to the touch then you? 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.550
 see 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.470
 I put it here he leaves it 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.200
 it will not answer everything has changed and 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.780
 only he does not change if he wants Mario too 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.630
 have you when you touch the keyboard it does 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.640
 a noise and it vibrates then you finish 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.230
 therefore both vibration and 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.580
 The noise is obviously there to stay. 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.800
 dumb're 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.260
 learn about energy savings and you 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.850
 come here he will teach you and how 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.300
 save energy 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:34.830
 the basics are what you're not using 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.150
 off for example you are not using 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.390
 off bluetooth I 'm not using 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.590
 off the furniture are not using 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.060
 off wifi also am not using 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.270
 They hung it all off staff 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.030
 if he understood the stadium there is but has 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.960
 need is no need to stay 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.700
 switched on 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.050
 I think I did not know if I was clear on the 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.620
 Portuguese 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.740
 Let's go here and see. I'm rolling. 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.940
 today's hard total here in the video 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.330
 accessory we thought the option of 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:11.530
 accessory that only we have to anchor 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.959
 doc wilson sound when inserting or removing 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.180
 the anchoring device that you 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.100
 connects in a gift a base and goes 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.510
 emitting a sound will also emit sound 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.190
 same way dies george audio and use 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.810
 external speakers when the 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:31.930
 device that is attached or high 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.330
 external speaker would be to use the doc 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.810
 obviously you are using to use 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:40.630
 of the doc 's phone is what I imagine 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:44.170
 I have not tested it yet is display screen 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:48.640
 of the message in a specific 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:50.709
 right this guy here to activate table 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.860
 table top screen is not possible 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.570
 activate because the professional still screen 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:01.090
 Attendance is in São José Domingos is 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:03.310

 Give a gift here on doc here 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.750
 underneath for this is working 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:13.030
 shows the initial screen of the desk when the 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:16.620
 device is locked're Cover 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.829
 automatic locking 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.169
 reverse the cover opening to 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.389
 aa screen when the security lock 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.970
 It's deactivated 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:31.319
 I did not understand this, you have to reverse the 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:33.750
 cover if it was understood that the 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:35.729
 So either I know your head for 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.360
 down and upside down is not 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:40.979
 also the staff do not know personal interest 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.810
 I do not know who to know please leave 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:47.310
 video description displays screen on call 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.530
 activate the screen automatically when the 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.650
 your device has been moved away from the 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:57.180
 your ear during a call display 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:59.639
 call screen is interesting in never 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.419
 I also used stereo audio output has 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:07.860
 here the sound lounge that is those 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:09.919
 7.1 5.1 boxes should be for this 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.710
 then the personnel this accessory that 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:16.169
 I would hardly know why I never 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.479
 I used this here, I already saw that it has to 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:21.930
 sell but I find it so unnecessary and 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:23.340
 if this touch is more serious then 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.379
 even charge, right? 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.629
 but for promos, things are going to be me. 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:29.400
 I prefer to put my headset and okay 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:31.650
 listening to my music myself because 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.599
 I know people do not always have the 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.669
 same musical taste of what I play 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:37.529
 People, I hope you have 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:40.139
 like these other options besides the 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:40.770
 basic and samsung will cs4 touch 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.139
 folks 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.060
 the next ones you can see that you have 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.639
 a lot of video still to do 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.500
