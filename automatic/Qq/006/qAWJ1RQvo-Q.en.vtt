volume<00:02:40.380> so<00:02:40.650> it's<00:02:40.770> not<00:02:40.950> just<00:02:41.010> all<00:02:41.430> highlighting

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
volume so it's not just all highlighting

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.200 
volume so it's not just all highlighting
pure<00:02:42.840> highlight<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.530> also<00:02:43.980> some<00:02:44.220> volume<00:02:44.700> by

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
pure highlight and also some volume by

00:02:45.210 --> 00:03:00.240 
pure highlight and also some volume by
applying<00:02:45.600> some<00:02:46.020> lighter<00:02:46.350> white<00:02:47.040> lighter<00:02:47.790> pink

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
highlight it and we are done next step

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.350 
highlight it and we are done next step
is<00:03:17.410> gonna<00:03:17.530> be<00:03:17.680> started<00:03:18.190> creating<00:03:18.520> the<00:03:19.030> chick

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
is gonna be started creating the chick

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.810 
is gonna be started creating the chick
design<00:03:19.990> it's<00:03:20.230> gonna<00:03:20.380> be<00:03:20.560> quite<00:03:20.890> simple<00:03:21.430> by

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
design it's gonna be quite simple by

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.000 
design it's gonna be quite simple by
elegant<00:03:22.270> again<00:03:23.080> you<00:03:23.350> can<00:03:23.500> do<00:03:23.710> it<00:03:23.860> your

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
elegant again you can do it your

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:34.809 
elegant again you can do it your
freehand<00:03:24.550> or<00:03:24.670> you<00:03:24.910> can<00:03:25.060> copy<00:03:25.330> my<00:03:25.690> own

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.839 

again<00:03:35.819> I<00:03:36.030> was<00:03:36.360> using<00:03:36.599> a<00:03:37.080> very<00:03:37.379> fine<00:03:37.590> brush<00:03:38.250> I

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
again I was using a very fine brush I

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.850 
again I was using a very fine brush I
have<00:03:39.090> a<00:03:39.120> little<00:03:39.420> more<00:03:39.569> control<00:03:40.110> of<00:03:40.319> the<00:03:40.620> lines

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
have a little more control of the lines

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.860 
have a little more control of the lines
and<00:03:41.190> once<00:03:41.610> we<00:03:41.849> are<00:03:41.879> happy<00:03:42.120> with<00:03:42.299> this<00:03:42.540> we<00:03:42.750> can

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
and once we are happy with this we can

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.830 
and once we are happy with this we can
start<00:03:43.260> creating<00:03:43.670> the<00:03:44.670> lips<00:03:44.970> designed<00:03:45.480> for

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
start creating the lips designed for

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.050 
start creating the lips designed for
that<00:03:45.989> first<00:03:46.379> thing<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:46.739> I<00:03:46.799> add<00:03:46.980> some<00:03:47.340> pink<00:03:47.819> of

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
that first thing and I add some pink of

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.330 
that first thing and I add some pink of
my<00:03:48.180> lips<00:03:48.450> and<00:03:48.720> then<00:03:48.900> created<00:03:49.349> a<00:03:49.470> line<00:03:49.769> straight

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
my lips and then created a line straight

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.059 
my lips and then created a line straight
from<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.790> corners<00:03:51.180> of<00:03:51.330> my<00:03:51.390> lips<00:03:51.480> almost<00:03:52.470> until

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
from the corners of my lips almost until

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.920 
from the corners of my lips almost until
the<00:03:53.250> start<00:03:53.610> of<00:03:53.819> this<00:03:54.030> line<00:03:54.269> of<00:03:54.390> the<00:03:54.480> cheekbones

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
the start of this line of the cheekbones

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.440 
the start of this line of the cheekbones
and<00:03:55.260> then<00:03:55.950> create<00:03:56.459> line<00:03:56.700> on<00:03:56.879> the<00:03:57.000> center<00:03:57.330> of

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
and then create line on the center of

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.960 
and then create line on the center of
the<00:03:57.599> lips<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:57.989> start<00:03:58.470> creating<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:59.370> stitches

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
the lips and start creating the stitches

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.880 
the lips and start creating the stitches
effect<00:04:00.360> it<00:04:00.540> has<00:04:00.720> to<00:04:00.900> have<00:04:01.049> a<00:04:01.260> little<00:04:01.500> curve

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
effect it has to have a little curve

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:12.080 
effect it has to have a little curve
from<00:04:02.160> them

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.850 

the<00:04:13.090> last<00:04:13.360> step<00:04:13.540> is<00:04:13.690> gonna<00:04:13.810> be<00:04:14.020> the<00:04:14.170> eyes<00:04:14.290> just

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
the last step is gonna be the eyes just

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.430 
the last step is gonna be the eyes just
start<00:04:15.250> creating<00:04:15.460> an<00:04:15.850> oval<00:04:16.420> shape<00:04:16.780> in<00:04:17.019> black

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
start creating an oval shape in black

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.920 
start creating an oval shape in black
smaller<00:04:18.400> on<00:04:18.700> the<00:04:18.730> treated<00:04:19.060> area<00:04:19.390> and<00:04:19.600> I<00:04:19.720> need<00:04:19.900> a

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
smaller on the treated area and I need a

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.840 
smaller on the treated area and I need a
thicker<00:04:20.380> and<00:04:20.560> outer<00:04:20.739> part<00:04:21.100> of<00:04:21.220> the<00:04:21.310> eye<00:04:21.519> and

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
thicker and outer part of the eye and

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.230 
thicker and outer part of the eye and
created<00:04:22.420> equal<00:04:22.870> in<00:04:23.050> both<00:04:23.200> sides<00:04:23.590> then<00:04:24.490> once<00:04:24.730> we

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
created equal in both sides then once we

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.910 
created equal in both sides then once we
have<00:04:25.420> this<00:04:25.600> design<00:04:26.050> we<00:04:26.320> can<00:04:26.440> start<00:04:26.800> creating

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
have this design we can start creating

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.020 
have this design we can start creating
halfway<00:04:27.960> ovals<00:04:28.960> or<00:04:29.290> petals<00:04:29.920> effect<00:04:30.430> around

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
halfway ovals or petals effect around

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.440 
halfway ovals or petals effect around
the<00:04:31.510> sides<00:04:32.080> of<00:04:32.320> these<00:04:32.730> design<00:04:33.730> we<00:04:33.880> just<00:04:34.090> create

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
the sides of these design we just create

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.540 
the sides of these design we just create
and<00:04:34.720> then<00:04:35.020> we're<00:04:35.200> gonna<00:04:35.290> fill<00:04:35.620> them<00:04:35.830> with<00:04:36.010> red

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
and then we're gonna fill them with red

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.820 
and then we're gonna fill them with red
once<00:04:37.210> we<00:04:37.360> have<00:04:37.540> that<00:04:37.570> done<00:04:37.990> we<00:04:38.260> can<00:04:38.290> and<00:04:38.620> come

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
once we have that done we can and come

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.860 
once we have that done we can and come
back<00:04:39.100> again<00:04:39.370> with<00:04:39.730> a<00:04:39.760> black<00:04:40.090> and<00:04:40.390> create<00:04:40.840> a

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
back again with a black and create a

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.850 
back again with a black and create a
little<00:04:41.260> more<00:04:41.380> steady<00:04:42.280> and<00:04:42.610> firm<00:04:43.620> design<00:04:44.620> on

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
little more steady and firm design on

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.010 
little more steady and firm design on
the<00:04:44.980> other<00:04:45.100> part<00:04:45.400> of<00:04:45.430> the<00:04:45.580> petals<00:04:45.970> a<00:04:46.300> little

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
the other part of the petals a little

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.780 
the other part of the petals a little
bit<00:04:47.110> of<00:04:47.230> black<00:04:47.470> hole<00:04:47.740> on<00:04:47.950> the<00:04:48.130> waterline<00:04:48.400> and

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
bit of black hole on the waterline and

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:56.920 
bit of black hole on the waterline and
we've<00:04:48.910> done
