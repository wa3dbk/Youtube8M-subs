00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:34.710 

don't<00:01:21.400> think<00:01:24.360> too<00:01:25.360> much<00:01:25.510> longer<00:01:33.479> some<00:01:34.479> real

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
don't think too much longer some real

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:50.390 
don't think too much longer some real
big<00:01:34.960> rollers<00:01:35.290> coming<00:01:35.470> in<00:01:35.650> there<00:01:35.800> now<00:01:35.979> yeah

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.410 

it's<00:01:52.140> getting<00:01:53.140> a<00:01:53.200> little<00:01:53.500> bit<00:01:53.619> dodgy<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:55.240> guy

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
it's getting a little bit dodgy this guy

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.820 
it's getting a little bit dodgy this guy
he's<00:01:55.630> trying<00:01:55.900> to<00:01:55.990> see<00:01:56.140> if<00:01:56.229> they're<00:01:56.350> boots<00:01:56.560> and

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
he's trying to see if they're boots and

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.630 
he's trying to see if they're boots and
stuff<00:01:57.009> here<00:01:58.800> some<00:01:59.800> of<00:01:59.890> these<00:01:59.950> sports<00:02:00.430> will

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
stuff here some of these sports will

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.360 
stuff here some of these sports will
probably<00:02:01.320> hit<00:02:02.320> right<00:02:02.590> on<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:02.860> top<00:02:03.010> end<00:02:03.160> of<00:02:03.310> the

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
probably hit right on the top end of the

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.090 
probably hit right on the top end of the
harbor<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:05.530> it's<00:02:05.620> quite<00:02:05.770> nasty

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
harbor so it's quite nasty

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.920 
harbor so it's quite nasty
the<00:02:07.520> ones<00:02:07.700> not<00:02:07.910> too<00:02:08.090> strong<00:02:08.390> but<00:02:08.420> it's<00:02:08.750> just

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
the ones not too strong but it's just

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:27.190 
the ones not too strong but it's just
that<00:02:09.229> big<00:02:09.860> swell<00:02:24.550> I<00:02:25.870> think<00:02:26.870> it's<00:02:26.990> time<00:02:27.140> to

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
that big swell I think it's time to

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.970 
that big swell I think it's time to
shoot<00:02:27.500> I'm<00:02:28.400> heading<00:02:28.670> for<00:02:28.700> beat<00:02:28.910> six<00:02:29.830> it's<00:02:30.830> a

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
shoot I'm heading for beat six it's a

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.030 
shoot I'm heading for beat six it's a
little<00:02:31.190> bit<00:02:31.280> sicker<00:02:31.580> than<00:02:31.700> this<00:02:31.850> so<00:02:32.510> we'll<00:02:33.040> do

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
little bit sicker than this so we'll do

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.150 
little bit sicker than this so we'll do
a<00:02:34.070> lot<00:02:34.190> of<00:02:34.250> report<00:02:34.610> on<00:02:34.700> that<00:02:34.850> later<00:02:35.060> on
