00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.299 

okay<00:00:07.210> what<00:00:07.509> we're<00:00:07.660> gonna<00:00:07.840> imitate<00:00:08.680> here<00:00:09.130> is

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:09.309 
okay what we're gonna imitate here is

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:14.020 
okay what we're gonna imitate here is
event<00:00:09.760> blocky

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.030 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.330 

now<00:00:14.450> normally<00:00:15.050> you<00:00:15.410> can<00:00:15.620> see<00:00:15.770> you<00:00:15.890> can<00:00:16.010> see<00:00:16.219> the

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
now normally you can see you can see the

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.519 
now normally you can see you can see the
fires<00:00:16.580> burning<00:00:17.000> in<00:00:17.270> there<00:00:17.480> but<00:00:18.050> our<00:00:18.140> vent<00:00:18.380> is

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
fires burning in there but our vent is

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.620 
fires burning in there but our vent is
blocked<00:00:18.860> and<00:00:19.190> I've<00:00:19.310> also<00:00:19.640> bypassed<00:00:20.450> the

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
blocked and I've also bypassed the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.929 
blocked and I've also bypassed the
pressure<00:00:20.930> switch<00:00:21.380> which<00:00:22.189> should<00:00:22.490> protect

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
pressure switch which should protect

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.170 
pressure switch which should protect
from<00:00:23.180> this<00:00:23.740> however<00:00:24.740> if<00:00:25.279> the<00:00:25.430> pressure<00:00:25.700> switch

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
from this however if the pressure switch

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.920 
from this however if the pressure switch
fails<00:00:26.750> and<00:00:27.880> then<00:00:28.880> you<00:00:29.060> get<00:00:29.210> a<00:00:29.240> block<00:00:29.509> vent

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
fails and then you get a block vent

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.170 
fails and then you get a block vent
you're<00:00:30.140> gonna<00:00:30.230> have<00:00:30.500> this<00:00:30.800> now<00:00:31.609> you<00:00:31.699> can<00:00:31.970> see

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
you're gonna have this now you can see

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:47.799 
you're gonna have this now you can see
that<00:00:32.360> flame<00:00:32.750> is<00:00:32.960> not<00:00:32.989> even<00:00:45.370> and<00:00:46.540> it<00:00:47.540> finally

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
that flame is not even and it finally

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.330 
that flame is not even and it finally
shut<00:00:48.170> itself<00:00:48.500> off<00:00:50.770> but<00:00:51.770> it's<00:00:51.890> gonna<00:00:52.040> continue

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
shut itself off but it's gonna continue

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.020 
shut itself off but it's gonna continue
doing<00:00:52.969> that<00:00:53.329> and<00:00:54.070> the<00:00:55.070> flame<00:00:55.370> is<00:00:55.790> going<00:00:55.969> to

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
doing that and the flame is going to

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.520 
doing that and the flame is going to
start<00:00:56.270> rolling<00:00:56.480> out<00:00:56.780> the<00:00:56.989> front<00:00:58.539> so<00:00:59.539> this<00:01:00.289> is<00:01:00.500> a

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
start rolling out the front so this is a

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.549 
start rolling out the front so this is a
potentially<00:01:01.370> dangerous<00:01:01.789> situation<00:01:02.559> we'll

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
potentially dangerous situation we'll

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:04.840 
potentially dangerous situation we'll
let<00:01:03.739> that<00:01:03.890> thing<00:01:04.129> go<00:01:04.280> through<00:01:04.580> it<00:01:04.670> one<00:01:04.820> more

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
let that thing go through it one more

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.850 
let that thing go through it one more
time<00:01:05.300> so<00:01:05.570> you<00:01:05.600> can<00:01:05.720> see<00:01:06.050> it<00:01:06.170> again<00:01:06.259> you<00:01:06.530> can

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
time so you can see it again you can

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.029 
time so you can see it again you can
hear<00:01:07.100> all<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:07.280> clicks<00:01:08.590> hot<00:01:09.590> surface<00:01:09.950> igniter

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039 
hear all the clicks hot surface igniter

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:46.679 
hear all the clicks hot surface igniter
is<00:01:10.460> now<00:01:10.729> on

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:50.639 

okay<00:01:47.499> it's<00:01:47.740> shut<00:01:48.009> down<00:01:48.990> now<00:01:49.990> let<00:01:50.259> me<00:01:50.409> go<00:01:50.619> over

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
okay it's shut down now let me go over

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:56.039 
okay it's shut down now let me go over
again<00:01:51.490> what<00:01:52.179> happened<00:01:52.659> here<00:01:55.049> aldehydes

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
again what happened here aldehydes

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.550 
again what happened here aldehydes
everywhere

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
everywhere

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.020 
everywhere
okay<00:01:59.770> if<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:01.070> pressure<00:02:01.400> switch<00:02:01.909> were<00:02:02.360> to<00:02:02.659> fail

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
okay if the pressure switch were to fail

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.550 
okay if the pressure switch were to fail
there<00:02:05.030> is<00:02:05.060> nothing<00:02:05.720> in<00:02:05.869> this<00:02:05.990> furnace<00:02:06.409> that

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
there is nothing in this furnace that

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.630 
there is nothing in this furnace that
will<00:02:06.619> protect<00:02:08.200> shut<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.319> furnace<00:02:09.709> down<00:02:10.039> so

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
will protect shut the furnace down so

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.210 
will protect shut the furnace down so
and<00:02:11.209> tell<00:02:11.870> you<00:02:12.110> that<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.560> pressure<00:02:12.770> switches

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
and tell you that the pressure switches

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.870 
and tell you that the pressure switches
fail

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
fail

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.900 
fail
there's<00:02:14.510> nothing<00:02:14.900> here<00:02:15.140> that'll<00:02:15.410> be<00:02:15.530> done<00:02:15.910> so

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
there's nothing here that'll be done so

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.930 
there's nothing here that'll be done so
the<00:02:17.150> pressure<00:02:17.450> switch<00:02:17.840> fails<00:02:18.340> then<00:02:19.340> later<00:02:19.790> on

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
the pressure switch fails then later on

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.490 
the pressure switch fails then later on
either<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.870> inducer<00:02:21.470> fails<00:02:22.239> or<00:02:23.239> the<00:02:24.230> vent

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
either the inducer fails or the vent

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.740 
either the inducer fails or the vent
gets<00:02:24.770> plug<00:02:25.069> this<00:02:25.640> is<00:02:25.850> what's<00:02:26.060> going<00:02:26.239> to<00:02:26.300> happen

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
gets plug this is what's going to happen

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.820 
gets plug this is what's going to happen
now<00:02:27.739> it's<00:02:28.580> it<00:02:29.120> started<00:02:29.660> again<00:02:29.780> now<00:02:30.200> I<00:02:30.230> think<00:02:30.590> we

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
now it's it started again now I think we

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
now it's it started again now I think we
could<00:02:31.400> watch<00:02:31.580> this<00:02:31.760> in<00:02:32.000> again<00:02:33.640> looks<00:02:34.640> like

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
could watch this in again looks like

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.990 
could watch this in again looks like
it's<00:02:35.030> shut<00:02:35.269> down

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.020 

there<00:02:39.600> is<00:02:40.040> let<00:02:41.040> me<00:02:41.100> see<00:02:41.310> if<00:02:41.400> I<00:02:41.490> can<00:02:41.610> get<00:02:41.730> close

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
there is let me see if I can get close

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.800 
there is let me see if I can get close
here<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:42.420> get<00:02:42.510> some<00:02:42.660> light<00:02:42.900> on<00:02:44.390> okay<00:02:45.390> there<00:02:45.630> is

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
here and get some light on okay there is

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.690 
here and get some light on okay there is
a<00:02:45.840> rollout<00:02:46.200> switch<00:02:46.680> on<00:02:47.040> this<00:02:47.160> thing<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.610> I'm

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
a rollout switch on this thing and I'm

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.990 
a rollout switch on this thing and I'm
gonna<00:02:47.850> get<00:02:48.060> close<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.400> can<00:02:50.610> see<00:02:50.880> it

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
gonna get close to it and you can see it

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.360 
gonna get close to it and you can see it
right<00:02:51.240> there<00:02:51.660> got<00:02:52.320> a<00:02:52.380> red<00:02:52.620> button<00:02:52.950> on<00:02:53.190> it

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
right there got a red button on it

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.240 
right there got a red button on it
because<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.180> is<00:02:54.210> a<00:02:54.360> manual<00:02:54.840> reset<00:02:55.530> if<00:02:55.830> it<00:02:55.980> kicks

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
because it is a manual reset if it kicks

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.600 
because it is a manual reset if it kicks
off<00:02:56.810> that<00:02:57.810> shuts<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.380> furnace<00:02:58.770> off<00:02:59.130> the

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
off that shuts the furnace off the

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.770 
off that shuts the furnace off the
inducer<00:03:00.000> will<00:03:00.150> stay<00:03:00.360> on

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
inducer will stay on

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.870 
inducer will stay on
but<00:03:00.900> first<00:03:01.170> won't<00:03:01.500> heat<00:03:02.180> so<00:03:03.920> that's<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.430> kind

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
but first won't heat so that's the kind

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.020 
but first won't heat so that's the kind
of<00:03:05.940> last<00:03:06.209> line<00:03:06.690> of<00:03:06.720> defense<00:03:07.670> now<00:03:08.670> let<00:03:08.820> me<00:03:08.910> go

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
of last line of defense now let me go

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.570 
of last line of defense now let me go
over<00:03:09.240> this<00:03:09.450> again

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
over this again

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.650 
over this again
if<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.850> pressure<00:03:12.120> switch<00:03:12.600> should<00:03:13.230> fail<00:03:14.660> and

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
if the pressure switch should fail and

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.350 
if the pressure switch should fail and
it<00:03:15.930> sticks<00:03:16.290> closed<00:03:17.000> sometimes<00:03:18.000> they<00:03:18.120> stick

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
it sticks closed sometimes they stick

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.410 
it sticks closed sometimes they stick
open<00:03:18.720> but<00:03:19.350> if<00:03:19.530> it's<00:03:19.770> stuck<00:03:20.040> closed<00:03:20.489> there's

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
open but if it's stuck closed there's

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.840 
open but if it's stuck closed there's
nothing<00:03:21.989> on<00:03:22.140> this<00:03:22.320> first<00:03:22.620> that<00:03:23.040> automatically

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
nothing on this first that automatically

claim properly usually it'll shut it
down<00:04:15.030> but<00:04:15.690> I<00:04:15.720> would<00:04:15.959> not<00:04:16.109> want<00:04:16.320> to<00:04:16.350> guarantee

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
down but I would not want to guarantee

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.500 
down but I would not want to guarantee
you<00:04:16.799> so<00:04:19.790> that's<00:04:20.790> one<00:04:21.000> of<00:04:21.030> the<00:04:21.180> things<00:04:21.359> to<00:04:21.479> be

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
you so that's one of the things to be

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.000 
you so that's one of the things to be
done<00:04:21.660> in<00:04:21.930> the<00:04:22.019> service<00:04:22.470> is<00:04:22.650> you<00:04:22.800> should<00:04:22.979> make

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
done in the service is you should make

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.680 
done in the service is you should make
sure<00:04:23.190> the<00:04:23.520> pressure<00:04:23.729> switch<00:04:24.090> does<00:04:24.419> actually

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
sure the pressure switch does actually

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.020 
sure the pressure switch does actually
work<00:04:24.950> because<00:04:25.950> unlike<00:04:26.340> some<00:04:26.400> of<00:04:26.729> the<00:04:26.820> newer

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
work because unlike some of the newer

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.020 
work because unlike some of the newer
units<00:04:27.800> this<00:04:28.800> one<00:04:29.040> does<00:04:29.280> not<00:04:29.310> test<00:04:29.850> the

pressure<00:04:30.270> switch<00:04:30.780> each<00:04:31.290> time<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:31.950> unit

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
pressure switch each time the unit

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.990 
pressure switch each time the unit
starts<00:04:32.640> and<00:04:33.120> that's<00:04:34.020> a<00:04:34.200> CG<00:04:34.650> you<00:04:34.890> on<00:04:35.250> a<00:04:35.310> flame

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
starts and that's a CG you on a flame

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.360 
starts and that's a CG you on a flame
