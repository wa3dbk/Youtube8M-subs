00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:06.359
 what's up 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.220
 here the speaker is the Jonathan in that 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.519
 first video I'll talk about how 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.759
 put up a tactic in football handling and 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.799
 2014 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.260
 remembering that the situations contained herein 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.880
 are only of my own opinion not 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.460
 it means that it is a truth 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.900
 absolute your own experimentation 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.220
 they are the best way to success 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.960
 in good game so you have a tactic 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.160
 that fits in a consistent way 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.650
 in your team 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.110
 must take into account several factors 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.360
 main is his cast but also 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.890
 the competitions that disputed analyzing 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.989
 the level of opponents who will 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.690
 to think about adding 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.700
 or not new players to the squad 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.710
 the first time to evaluate the 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.960
 cast analyze in which positions 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.940
 present a weak point in this 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.780
 must take into account the attributes of the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.730
 player 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.489
 example if the defender has not 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.239
 marking the position above deserve 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.039
 average 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.399
 improvements should be sought through 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.710
 downloads I recommend you create 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.500
 3 tactics one for each moment of a 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.170
 I usually play offensive work 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.100
 normal one against attack and another everything 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.560
 for everything 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.030
 the normal offensive tactic is for games in 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.009
 we are favorites 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.200
 At first I leave with mentality 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.520
 normal and fluid and balanced 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.520
 In the long game I make the changes 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.020
 instructions in the team instructions. 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.420
 I try to leave with ball possession. 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.850
 direct and fast with much more 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.070
 intensity but more disciplined 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.229
 playing from defense and exploring 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.720
 the sides because the players of the cast 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.090
 has this characteristic 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.920
 the counter-attack tactic is for when 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.810
 we're playing against a better team 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.390
 that's where we leave a comment 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.310
 age of counterattack and rigid fluidity 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.159
 so our defense players do not 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.509
 get out of your position 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.060
 we also have the sides as 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:56.250
 overlaps and strides forward 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.259
 the tactic everything for everything is when 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.070
 we need the result and we are behind 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.530
 of the board 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.420
 independent of the opponent in it all 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.039
 have the freedom to attack with 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.039
 shower and watch the men ahead 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.810
 Good, there's a lot to talk about. 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.220
 when it comes to fm tactics 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.770
 there is no possibility of achieving 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.960
 only a single IMF video universe is 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.360
 very large and there are several types of 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.370
 theme I will leave here a link from the 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.090
 forum management that speaks highly of these 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.700
 themes 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.130
 good for today only personal thanks for 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.150
 who watched until now and until the next 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.150
 worth the
