00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.840

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.840
 scarf if you feel good 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.550
 we are looking christian work here today 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.559
 the press and stadium spokesman that 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.390
 first fc union over the shoulders and 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.809
 now rush into it with him 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.809
 turmoil 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.680
 also smaller 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.240
 it comes 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.810
 press officer at one of the 36 dfl 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:09.050
 clubs is a dream job 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:11.120
 I work where I like where I like the most 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:16.130
 if I always chose 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:18.260
 would like to have worked a whole 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.450
 normal workday starts for me 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.160
 personally at the office at eight o'clock in the morning 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.360
 with the study of the daily press round 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.620
 is for me therefore the overview 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.950
 procure as it has been reported 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.420
 also to look there may be 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.030
 focal points to prepare for 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:43.690
 There should be topics that are virulent 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.690
 they should be picked up 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.220
 Of course it's in professional football 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.930
 First of all, it's quite classic 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.630
 to ensure that the club 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.500
 is represented in the media 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.500
 who imagine that 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.310
 if the world fits the times 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:19.030
 mouth open contract 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.030
 should already be 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.790
 he does not have much time 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.379
 still somehow in rest on something 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.439
 actually prepare this tingle 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:35.819
 as soon as you look everything is ready 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:39.189
 the press stands are prepared for the 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.810
 hotspot for the press is everything 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:42.280
 available 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.230
 colleague of the music he makes the 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.390
 Video wall are all in place 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.410
 when the beating goes on 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.410
 then someday the doors will open 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.510
 Experts of train our customers 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.310
 as a rule, so too is the 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.349
 professional team, of course then 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.409
 someday training has a day where 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:24.939
 So someone from my department this 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:28.500
 training also supervised the 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:28.500
 press representatives who are there 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.950
 So that's going to be a normal one 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.750
 hopefully someday working like that 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.030
 At the end it is good but good 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.970
 few important things today made the 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.099
 own understanding that always then 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.019

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.500
