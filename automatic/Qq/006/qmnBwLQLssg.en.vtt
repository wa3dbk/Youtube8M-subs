the corners here actually seem to get

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.819 
the corners here actually seem to get
stuck<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:54.030> don't<00:00:54.809> know<00:00:54.960> if<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.410> common

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
for the analog sticks they're very

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.539 
for the analog sticks they're very
sensitive<00:01:42.720> which<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.409> nice<00:01:43.619> they<00:01:43.920> have<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> flat

playstation<00:02:06.899> 2<00:02:06.930> remote<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.530> settled<00:02:07.829> for

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
playstation 2 remote so I settled for

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.119 
playstation 2 remote so I settled for
what<00:02:08.160> was<00:02:08.369> available<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.970> me<00:02:09.090> now<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.890> four

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
what was available to me now the four

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.020 
what was available to me now the four
face<00:02:11.340> buttons<00:02:11.370> here

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
face buttons here

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.539 
face buttons here
you<00:02:14.030> hear<00:02:14.209> me<00:02:14.359> clicking<00:02:14.689> them<00:02:14.840> yeah<00:02:15.620> they<00:02:16.219> work

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
you hear me clicking them yeah they work

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.490 
you hear me clicking them yeah they work
but<00:02:16.879> the<00:02:16.969> thing<00:02:17.180> is<00:02:17.209> they<00:02:17.840> come<00:02:18.049> out<00:02:18.260> of<00:02:18.409> the

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
but the thing is they come out of the

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.410 
but the thing is they come out of the
remote<00:02:18.769> a<00:02:18.859> lot<00:02:19.159> more<00:02:19.549> than<00:02:19.819> they<00:02:19.939> would<00:02:20.120> on<00:02:20.180> the

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
remote a lot more than they would on the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.569 
remote a lot more than they would on the
normal<00:02:20.810> PlayStation<00:02:21.319> 2<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:22.250> you<00:02:22.340> actually

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
normal PlayStation 2 so you actually

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.479 
normal PlayStation 2 so you actually
have<00:02:22.879> to<00:02:23.000> press<00:02:23.329> more<00:02:23.719> button<00:02:24.140> than<00:02:25.040> you<00:02:25.250> would

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
have to press more button than you would

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.910 
have to press more button than you would
with<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.730> regular<00:02:26.180> remote<00:02:26.510> now<00:02:27.349> normally

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
with the regular remote now normally

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.920 
with the regular remote now normally
this<00:02:28.069> wouldn't<00:02:28.370> be<00:02:28.609> such<00:02:28.849> an<00:02:29.000> issue<00:02:29.209> however

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
this wouldn't be such an issue however

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.319 
this wouldn't be such an issue however
it<00:02:30.560> actually<00:02:30.709> does<00:02:31.340> seem<00:02:31.579> to<00:02:31.730> hinder<00:02:32.090> some

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
it actually does seem to hinder some

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.780 
it actually does seem to hinder some
gameplay<00:02:32.750> abilities<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.500> it's<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.489> same

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
gameplay abilities and it's the same

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.610 
gameplay abilities and it's the same
problem<00:02:35.329> with<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.719> shoulder<00:02:36.170> buttons<00:02:36.379> as

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
problem with the shoulder buttons as

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.440 
problem with the shoulder buttons as
well

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
well

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.670 
well
now<00:02:38.450> does<00:02:38.689> this<00:02:38.900> make<00:02:39.109> their<00:02:39.290> controller

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
now does this make their controller

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.979 
now does this make their controller
unusable<00:02:40.340> absolutely<00:02:41.329> not<00:02:41.540> it<00:02:41.689> still

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
unusable absolutely not it still

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.750 
unusable absolutely not it still
functions<00:02:42.230> perfectly<00:02:42.709> which<00:02:43.129> is<00:02:43.250> actually

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
functions perfectly which is actually

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.460 
functions perfectly which is actually
why<00:02:43.969> it<00:02:44.030> was<00:02:44.359> the<00:02:44.480> official<00:02:44.810> wireless

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
why it was the official wireless

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.670 
why it was the official wireless
controller<00:02:45.889> for<00:02:46.129> PlayStation<00:02:46.639> 2<00:02:47.139> now<00:02:48.139> more<00:02:48.650> on
