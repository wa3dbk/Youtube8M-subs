00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.050
 hello who would have the florist 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:08.309
 appears today I will you 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.740
 explain how to make a center of 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:15.300
 table for this centerpiece we have 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:19.320
 need the round neck water a knife to 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:22.050
 this date at the base of the mimosa the 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.410
 flowers inevitably and the anemones 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.289
 to realize these centerpieces have 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.359
 already deposited a few drops of dye 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.840
 or make vase this dye is 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.880
 all natural do not live in 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.980
 all the flowers we'll just dropped 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.200
 a few drops at the bottom of them from the vase 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.000
 to actually give a material when 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.500
 an added value the bottom two 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.090
 weeks after putting a few 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.129
 drops of dye necessarily we 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:55.879
 let's go add water just put 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.989
 almost to the vase 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:03.090
 once the water is deposited in the vase 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:05.670
 we take the frozen flowers 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.170
 just lay out my box of tanks I 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.490
 will keep two inches between the 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.649
 flame button is the vase and I 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.799
 simply cut to the width of the 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:15.799
 vase 

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:22.889
 I simply drop the boot of flowers 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.679
 in the vase ensuring that all 

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:29.009
 stems be well in the water and that you 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.179
 buttons be the same league 1 now 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.279
 I will take my second vote of 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:34.399
 flins I would have done exactly the same 

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:34.399
 thing 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.229
 it's always good to cut 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.759
 beveled flowers plus space is wide 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.369
 more water can actually seep into 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.349
 the stem I arrange the boot of flowers to 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.239
 inside the vase while crossing the 

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:49.049
 rods 

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:52.409
 the interest is to really make a 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:55.590
 cross it's going to give you something 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.299
 very light trainers which will be very 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.529
 pretty to see it's necessarily flowers 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.969
 but also the work of the stems 

00:01:58.529 --> 00:02:02.309
 I always take my third ball 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.439
 lemon we're going to do the acts have the 

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:07.499
 same thing just there we go 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:10.399
 reduce the width between the first 

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:10.399
 button the second button 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.330
 I cut a few more stems out 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.440
 this box of flowers to give a little 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:23.170
 more volume 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:29.050
 our centerpiece I always cross 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:31.720
 but stems and there I take my fourth 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.810
 flare mode I'm doing exactly the same 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.810
 thing 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.690
 to embellish this we will drop 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:51.120
 some stems of mimosa flowers of 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:54.930
 season I take my mimosa stems g 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:58.410
 position the flower at the level of the most 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.650
 beautiful of the anemone I take the length 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.900
 I already have cut during the 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.980
 cutting always think about keeping the same 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.370
 cheat length that the first 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.130
 ron years that we will dispose in 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:15.630
 the vase in the same length as the 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:22.950
 anemones I would have done exactly the 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:25.310
 same thing left so I find and I 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.310
 has 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.520
 so I take the third row of 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.380
 the mozart there I go there to dispose we get 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.260
 hands two small masses humiliate 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.260
 anemone so inevitably game will be more 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.569
 short than the first two I'm going 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.490
 has between the two masses of anemone 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.530
 well it's the same two boxes 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.640
 lemon I would have done exactly the same 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.640
 thing on the other side 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.040
 for this last step you have 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.440
 just to reposition the masses of 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.920
 flowers that are well distinct and well 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:10.300
 clean I gently pull the south I 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:12.010
 reposition the mass of anemone I do 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.720
 be careful that the second mass the 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:19.030
 small is about the same level 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:24.550
 but this well separate the same thing from 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:30.820
 the other side I am assured in common 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:33.130
 mimosas did not move now you 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.350
 know how to make a fair centerpiece 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.570
 put some flowers in a vase well 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.280
 align all the flowers are 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.810
 fully bullguard is extremely 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.910
 long time 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.260
 no need for foam no flooding on 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.110
 works we worked today the 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.320
 flower for flora we highlighted 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.320
 the flora
