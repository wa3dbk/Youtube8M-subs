00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
in seconds then go for clamshell but I

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.040 
in seconds then go for clamshell but I
find<00:02:26.170> it<00:02:26.320> much<00:02:26.470> more<00:02:26.530> comfortable<00:02:27.010> because<00:02:27.700> it

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
find it much more comfortable because it

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.750 
find it much more comfortable because it
does<00:02:29.050> take<00:02:29.230> longer<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:29.650> put<00:02:29.830> up<00:02:30.010> but<00:02:30.459> it<00:02:30.580> gives
