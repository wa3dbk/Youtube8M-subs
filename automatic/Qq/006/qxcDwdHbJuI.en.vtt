00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:04.150
 the astronauts brought rocks from the moon and from them the 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.940
 scientists have recently discovered how the 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.940
 satelite 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:14.679
 now it is known that its origin is on earth 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.839
 let's leave behind in time for four thousand 500 million years until 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.689
 the birth of our solar system 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.960
 services for almost a billion comes to rope 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.430
 they are called in English indicated the surface almost alive 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.900
 who is not alone 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.270
 it has a sister called fair 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.290
 if instead it will start around the sun 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.290
 an orbit that will soon cause a collision 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.590
 bruno 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.960
 the impact of these two immense bodies occurred in slow motion 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.380
 no descent day any 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.090
 after almost 50 thousand kilometers 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.580
 turning both planets into molten rock and projecting remains and houses 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.580
 space 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.550
 the ejido this incandescent mass will shine more than the sun 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.160
 15 billion cubic meters of molten rock were fired spinning 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.490
 around the earth in less than ten years this immense ring of 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.430
 minerals and gas was assembled 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.430
 form the moon 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.939
 uu 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:27.230
 the relationship between 50 and 65 meters in this catastrophic way 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:29.829
 From the beginning 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.829
 they were only separated by 30 million euros 

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:47.539
 before hundreds of millions of years 

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:49.189
 it will take 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:52.909
 nearby created spectacular tide on molten lava to do 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.179
 the oceans that are 

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:01.419
 they protested constantly 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:02.939
 of agitated due to 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.939
 the satelite 

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:11.509
 a thousand times greater 

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:18.609
 and because the earth turns it goes much faster 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.939
 the tidal waves covered the newly formed crust 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:24.939
 I came back requesting the pacma has melted 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:35.689
 this is the crucible 

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:38.109
 and with her 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:39.530
 the oceans that while
