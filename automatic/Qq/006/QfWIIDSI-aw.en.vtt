00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.100
 We have had more impact on 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.890
 warrior in acapulco on everything and in 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.800
 coyuca there we have some houses that 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.920
 the only person affected 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.330
 what we have registered now 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.730
 Unfortunately as you want it because 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.240
 also in warrior we have a person 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.820
 also disappeared and good in oaxaca 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.040
 if it would be the next state that has 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.950
 affectations we have there some 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.920
 affectations especially in huatulco in 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.510
 puerto escondido in pinotepa nacional 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.250
 equal damage to homes some 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.610
 shops especially those that are located 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.370
 near the beach in a room 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.950
 obviously the beach furniture that 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:02.160
 there are sometimes as the palapas have suffered 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.130
 affectations and here we keep going up 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.560
 throughout the Pacific as it goes 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.179
 going up I think the affectations are 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.890
 minors according to the reports that 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.780
 we have , however, there is no need 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.600
 trust us especially because this end of 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.850
 week many people grab it by bridge 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.100
 that has a long week then we take 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.170

 federal police and state units 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.060
 they are protective although they are very 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.010
 earrings however the best 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.060
 participation is that of the people 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.180
 now the broth is already flowing 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.950

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.930
 see if the resources I had were 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.290
 enough to handle the emergency and 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.570

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.010

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.720
