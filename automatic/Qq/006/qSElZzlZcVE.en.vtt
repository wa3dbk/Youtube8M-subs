00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
actually look into corners as you

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.789

approach<00:01:50.640> them<00:01:50.960> or<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.110> would<00:01:52.259> be<00:01:52.380> crashing

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
approach them or you would be crashing

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.230 
approach them or you would be crashing
all<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:52.950> time<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.430> all<00:01:53.520> those<00:01:53.670> things<00:01:53.909> we've

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
all the time and all those things we've

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.889 
all the time and all those things we've
been<00:01:54.420> able<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.810> mimic<00:01:55.229> with<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.130> helmet<00:01:56.520> can

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
been able to mimic with this helmet can

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.840 
been able to mimic with this helmet can
and<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.829> that's<00:01:59.159> really<00:01:59.430> what<00:01:59.640> we're

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
and and and and that's really what we're

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.120 
and and and and that's really what we're
you<00:02:00.149> know<00:02:00.270> falling<00:02:01.020> back<00:02:01.290> upon<00:02:01.590> when<00:02:01.740> we<00:02:01.890> call

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
you know falling back upon when we call

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.560 
you know falling back upon when we call
this<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.640> most<00:02:02.820> realistic<00:02:03.240> racing

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
this is the most realistic racing

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.679 
this is the most realistic racing
experience<00:02:03.899> there<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.640> that's<00:02:05.640> what<00:02:05.969> we<00:02:06.149> what

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
experience there is that's what we what

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:07.980 
experience there is that's what we what
we're<00:02:06.840> talking<00:02:07.170> about<00:02:07.259> em

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
we're talking about em

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.480 
we're talking about em
you're<00:02:08.990> not<00:02:09.080> going<00:02:09.259> to<00:02:09.320> get<00:02:09.560> any<00:02:09.860> closer<00:02:10.130> to<00:02:10.310> a

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
you're not going to get any closer to a

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.190 
you're not going to get any closer to a
realistic<00:02:11.300> racing<00:02:11.450> experience<00:02:11.750> that<00:02:12.110> they

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
realistic racing experience that they

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.140 
realistic racing experience that they
are<00:02:12.320> my<00:02:12.440> cat<00:02:12.620> yeah<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:13.430> we<00:02:13.550> noticed<00:02:13.850> here<00:02:14.000> as<00:02:14.120> a

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
are my cat yeah and we noticed here as a

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.390 
are my cat yeah and we noticed here as a
friend<00:02:14.810> Geno<00:02:15.260> here<00:02:15.470> is<00:02:15.590> sort<00:02:15.890> of<00:02:15.920> hitting<00:02:16.190> top

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
friend Geno here is sort of hitting top

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.220 
friend Geno here is sort of hitting top
speed<00:02:16.760> that<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.390> dash<00:02:17.600> is<00:02:17.930> actually

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
speed that the the dash is actually

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.900 
speed that the the dash is actually
blurring<00:02:18.500> out<00:02:18.740> a<00:02:18.800> bit<00:02:19.070> and<00:02:19.100> you're<00:02:19.580> sort<00:02:19.820> of

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
blurring out a bit and you're sort of

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.550 
blurring out a bit and you're sort of
like<00:02:20.090> just<00:02:20.300> laser<00:02:20.750> focused<00:02:21.230> on<00:02:21.350> the<00:02:21.410> road

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
like just laser focused on the road

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.380 
like just laser focused on the road
ahead<00:02:21.710> yeah<00:02:22.010> that's<00:02:22.550> correct<00:02:22.700> yeah<00:02:23.060> that's

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
ahead yeah that's correct yeah that's

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.810 
ahead yeah that's correct yeah that's
trying<00:02:23.600> to<00:02:23.660> mimic<00:02:23.930> kind<00:02:24.530> of<00:02:24.620> what<00:02:24.770> a<00:02:24.800> driver<00:02:25.100> is

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
trying to mimic kind of what a driver is

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.300 
trying to mimic kind of what a driver is
also<00:02:26.060> feeling<00:02:26.510> this<00:02:26.930> does<00:02:27.410> give<00:02:27.590> you<00:02:27.740> focus<00:02:28.190> on

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
also feeling this does give you focus on

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.360 
also feeling this does give you focus on
where<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.700> take<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:29.090> car<00:02:29.360> but<00:02:30.050> also<00:02:30.260> it<00:02:30.890> mimics

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
where to take the car but also it mimics

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.220 
where to take the car but also it mimics
the<00:02:31.520> way<00:02:31.760> that<00:02:32.000> when<00:02:32.300> do<00:02:32.450> you<00:02:32.600> actually<00:02:33.020> think

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
the way that when do you actually think

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.410 
the way that when do you actually think
about<00:02:33.620> checking<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.160> oil<00:02:34.340> pressure<00:02:34.730> or<00:02:35.090> or

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
about checking the oil pressure or or

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.440 
about checking the oil pressure or or
your<00:02:36.350> your<00:02:36.560> gearbox<00:02:36.980> temperature<00:02:37.700> right<00:02:38.150> do

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
your your gearbox temperature right do

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.120 
your your gearbox temperature right do
that<00:02:38.630> when<00:02:38.810> you<00:02:38.930> have<00:02:39.140> time<00:02:39.170> you<00:02:39.440> do<00:02:39.740> not<00:02:39.890> do

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
that when you have time you do not do

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.910 
that when you have time you do not do
that<00:02:40.280> when<00:02:40.459> you<00:02:40.550> go<00:02:40.760> 250<00:02:41.570> miles<00:02:41.959> per<00:02:42.140> hour<00:02:42.290> you

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
that when you go 250 miles per hour you

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.280 
that when you go 250 miles per hour you
don't<00:02:43.130> do<00:02:43.280> it<00:02:43.400> in<00:02:43.459> corners<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.720> that's<00:02:44.990> come

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
don't do it in corners and that's come

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.310 
don't do it in corners and that's come
where<00:02:45.530> we<00:02:45.680> blur<00:02:45.920> and<00:02:46.209> they<00:02:47.209> cook<00:02:47.390> it<00:02:47.600> up<00:02:47.720> okay

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
where we blur and they cook it up okay

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.860 
where we blur and they cook it up okay
so<00:02:48.680> I<00:02:48.709> yeah<00:02:49.490> so<00:02:49.790> there<00:02:50.000> was<00:02:50.209> an<00:02:50.480> example<00:02:50.810> of

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
so I yeah so there was an example of

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.960 
so I yeah so there was an example of
nighttime<00:02:51.170> racing<00:02:51.860> and<00:02:52.040> we'll<00:02:52.640> go<00:02:52.760> ahead<00:02:52.850> and

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
nighttime racing and we'll go ahead and

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.120 
nighttime racing and we'll go ahead and

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
queue up another race right here to

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.980 
queue up another race right here to
check<00:02:55.310> out<00:02:55.459> a<00:02:55.940> little<00:02:56.209> another<00:02:56.480> a<00:02:56.540> little<00:02:56.959> a
