00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.100 

there's<00:02:42.760> something<00:02:43.000> along<00:02:43.239> those<00:02:43.390> lines<00:02:43.450> and

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
there's something along those lines and

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.990 
there's something along those lines and
then<00:02:44.439> you're<00:02:44.620> left<00:02:44.769> with<00:02:44.920> one<00:02:45.129> layer<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:45.640> what

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
then you're left with one layer and what

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.770 
then you're left with one layer and what
I<00:02:46.060> did<00:02:46.299> I<00:02:46.329> just<00:02:46.659> used<00:02:46.870> a<00:02:47.110> ring<00:02:47.439> and<00:02:48.659> made<00:02:49.659> it

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
I did I just used a ring and made it

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.850 
I did I just used a ring and made it
white<00:02:50.069> so<00:02:51.069> it<00:02:51.159> looks<00:02:51.459> like<00:02:51.519> the<00:02:51.970> minigun<00:02:55.860> right

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
white so it looks like the minigun right

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.970 
white so it looks like the minigun right

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
there or you could move it over here and

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.270 
there or you could move it over here and
make<00:03:00.129> it<00:03:00.159> red<00:03:00.459> for<00:03:00.730> a<00:03:01.000> Sharingan<00:03:02.190> whatever<00:03:03.190> you
