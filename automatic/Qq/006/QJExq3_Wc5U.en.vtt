00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.760 

I<00:00:00.089> had<00:00:00.539> everything<00:00:00.750> recorded<00:00:01.170> and<00:00:01.530> I<00:00:01.650> was

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
I had everything recorded and I was

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.710 
I had everything recorded and I was
going<00:00:01.979> to<00:00:02.070> post<00:00:02.190> this<00:00:02.460> review<00:00:02.820> but<00:00:03.240> I<00:00:03.300> couldn't

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
going to post this review but I couldn't

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.450 
going to post this review but I couldn't
help<00:00:03.810> but<00:00:03.899> feel<00:00:04.230> that<00:00:04.259> I<00:00:04.710> may<00:00:04.890> not<00:00:05.040> have<00:00:05.190> given

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
help but feel that I may not have given

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.280 
help but feel that I may not have given
this<00:00:05.549> inverter<00:00:05.910> a<00:00:06.150> completely<00:00:06.720> fair<00:00:06.960> shake

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
this inverter a completely fair shake

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.560 
this inverter a completely fair shake
and<00:00:07.500> I'm<00:00:08.400> gonna<00:00:08.550> do<00:00:08.700> at<00:00:08.820> least<00:00:08.940> one<00:00:09.120> more<00:00:09.300> test

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
and I'm gonna do at least one more test

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.839 
and I'm gonna do at least one more test
year<00:00:09.780> to<00:00:10.280> just<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.400> make<00:00:11.429> sure<00:00:11.550> that<00:00:11.759> I'm

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
year to just to make sure that I'm

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.580 
year to just to make sure that I'm
giving<00:00:11.940> this<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.540> best<00:00:12.719> possible<00:00:12.960> chance<00:00:13.440> of

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
giving this the best possible chance of

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.160 
giving this the best possible chance of
functioning<00:00:14.070> in<00:00:14.280> my<00:00:14.639> previous<00:00:14.940> tests<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.599> had

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
functioning in my previous tests I had

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.950 
functioning in my previous tests I had
connected<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.010> inverter<00:00:17.310> with<00:00:17.609> two<00:00:18.480> sets<00:00:18.750> of

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
connected the inverter with two sets of

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.679 
connected the inverter with two sets of
four<00:00:19.260> gauge<00:00:19.470> cable<00:00:19.949> one<00:00:20.789> was<00:00:21.029> 10<00:00:21.330> feet<00:00:21.510> long

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
four gauge cable one was 10 feet long

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.970 
four gauge cable one was 10 feet long
one's<00:00:22.020> 5<00:00:22.350> feet<00:00:22.560> long<00:00:22.789> so<00:00:23.789> this<00:00:24.660> time<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:25.109> did<00:00:25.410> two

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
one's 5 feet long so this time I did two

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.849 
one's 5 feet long so this time I did two
things<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.460> improve<00:00:26.699> my<00:00:26.849> chances<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.590> have<00:00:28.590> it

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
things to improve my chances I have it

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.830 
things to improve my chances I have it
connected<00:00:29.160> with<00:00:29.250> 4<00:00:29.490> gauge<00:00:29.670> cable<00:00:30.090> with<00:00:30.599> both

true deep cycle batteries but that's

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.440 
true deep cycle batteries but that's
beside<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.030> point

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
beside the point

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.910 
beside the point
I<00:00:48.539> know<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.200> both<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.350> these<00:00:49.530> are<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.770> good

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
I know that both of these are in good

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.069 
I know that both of these are in good
shape<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:51.180> it's<00:00:51.329> connected<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.719> those<00:00:51.870> two

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
shape so it's connected to those two

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.869 
shape so it's connected to those two
batteries<00:00:52.469> through<00:00:52.770> about<00:00:53.010> 2<00:00:53.190> feet<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.640> four

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
batteries through about 2 feet the four

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.270 
batteries through about 2 feet the four
gauge<00:00:54.059> cable<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:55.260> also<00:00:55.440> have<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.890> connected

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
gauge cable and I also have it connected

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.430 
gauge cable and I also have it connected
through<00:00:56.520> about<00:00:56.789> 3<00:00:57.059> feet<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.510> 4<00:00:58.050> gauge<00:00:58.230> cable

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
through about 3 feet a 4 gauge cable

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.170 
through about 3 feet a 4 gauge cable
over<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.039> same<00:00:59.340> automotive<00:00:59.879> battery

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
over to this same automotive battery

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.360 
over to this same automotive battery
that<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.359> had<00:01:00.539> before<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.160> it<00:01:02.160> had<00:01:02.250> my

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
that I had before and it had my

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.250 
that I had before and it had my
45-minute<00:01:03.059> power<00:01:03.180> supply<00:01:03.539> connected<00:01:03.960> as<00:01:04.110> well

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
45-minute power supply connected as well

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.250 
45-minute power supply connected as well
so<00:01:05.159> I'm<00:01:05.280> giving<00:01:05.549> this<00:01:05.670> every<00:01:06.570> possible<00:01:07.020> chance

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
so I'm giving this every possible chance

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.679 
so I'm giving this every possible chance
of<00:01:07.530> working<00:01:07.650> I'm<00:01:08.580> just<00:01:08.640> gonna<00:01:09.180> reduce<00:01:09.479> some<00:01:09.659> of

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
of working I'm just gonna reduce some of

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.410 
of working I'm just gonna reduce some of
the<00:01:09.840> same<00:01:10.049> tests<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.650> have<00:01:11.549> my<00:01:11.729> three<00:01:12.000> resistive

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
the same tests I have my three resistive

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.380 
the same tests I have my three resistive

heater 1000 watt heater and I'm going to

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.859 
heater 1000 watt heater and I'm going to
see<00:01:18.930> if<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.290> thing<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.560> really<00:01:19.799> capable<00:01:20.070> of

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
see if this thing is really capable of

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.560 
see if this thing is really capable of
2,500<00:01:21.869> watts<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.610> also<00:01:23.610> have<00:01:23.850> my<00:01:24.060> client<00:01:24.450> meter

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
2,500 watts I also have my client meter

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.780 
2,500 watts I also have my client meter
connected<00:01:24.750> up<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.040> can<00:01:26.250> see<00:01:26.430> if<00:01:26.610> it

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
connected up so that I can see if it

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.569 
connected up so that I can see if it
draws<00:01:27.320> 320<00:01:28.320> amps<00:01:28.650> or<00:01:28.740> more<00:01:28.950> which<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.280> what

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
draws 320 amps or more which is what

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.359 
draws 320 amps or more which is what
it's<00:01:29.700> used<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.229> really<00:01:31.229> realistically<00:01:32.130> if<00:01:32.280> you

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
it's used to really realistically if you

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.859 
it's used to really realistically if you
try<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.610> draw<00:01:32.790> more<00:01:32.939> than<00:01:33.000> about<00:01:33.240> 300<00:01:33.659> amps

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869

but<00:01:43.130> in<00:01:44.130> any<00:01:44.280> case<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.729> have<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.939> couple<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.659> these

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
but in any case I have a couple of these

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.210 
but in any case I have a couple of these
heaters<00:01:45.960> plugged<00:01:46.320> into<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.649> inverter<00:01:46.979> and

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
heaters plugged into the inverter and

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
one heater plugged into this power strip

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.590 
one heater plugged into this power strip
and<00:01:49.619> I'm<00:01:50.369> measuring<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.790> voltage<00:01:51.149> here<00:01:51.509> at

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
and I'm measuring the voltage here at

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.649 
and I'm measuring the voltage here at
this<00:01:51.750> power<00:01:51.930> strip<00:01:52.340> similar<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.520> before<00:01:53.909> but

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
this power strip similar to before but

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.569 
this power strip similar to before but
this<00:01:55.079> has<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.320> 15<00:01:55.710> amp<00:01:55.890> breaker<00:01:56.009> in<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.520> I'm

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
this has a 15 amp breaker in it and I'm

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.219 
this has a 15 amp breaker in it and I'm
afraid<00:01:56.729> that'll<00:01:57.090> trip<00:01:57.390> I'm<00:01:57.689> actually<00:01:57.840> able<00:01:58.110> to

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
afraid that'll trip I'm actually able to

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.130 
afraid that'll trip I'm actually able to
reach<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.619> full<00:01:58.770> 2500<00:01:59.430> watt<00:01:59.520> rating<00:01:59.960> so<00:02:00.960> what

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
reach the full 2500 watt rating so what

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.440 
reach the full 2500 watt rating so what
I'm<00:02:01.229> going<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.500> do<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.890> run<00:02:02.130> each<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.329> these

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
I'm going to do is run each of these

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
what happens to my voltage and when I

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.229 
what happens to my voltage and when I
figure<00:02:08.190> out<00:02:08.220> what<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.429> maximum<00:02:08.879> load<00:02:09.090> this

them all up and I'll see what output
power<00:02:22.720> this<00:02:22.960> thing<00:02:23.020> was<00:02:23.260> capable<00:02:23.470> of<00:02:23.770> I<00:02:24.010> really

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
power this thing was capable of I really

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.310 
power this thing was capable of I really
don't<00:02:24.970> think<00:02:25.030> that<00:02:25.240> anybody<00:02:25.720> is<00:02:25.900> ever<00:02:26.080> going

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
don't think that anybody is ever going

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.430 
don't think that anybody is ever going
to<00:02:26.410> have<00:02:26.590> a<00:02:26.620> situation<00:02:26.920> better<00:02:27.880> than<00:02:28.150> this<00:02:28.440> two

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
to have a situation better than this two

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.020 
to have a situation better than this two
or<00:02:29.590> three<00:02:29.800> feet<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.040> four<00:02:30.370> gauge<00:02:30.520> cable<00:02:30.760> and

or three feet a four gauge cable and

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.060 
or three feet a four gauge cable and
each<00:02:31.150> lug<00:02:31.420> connected<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.260> three<00:02:32.710> batteries

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
each lug connected to three batteries

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.530 
each lug connected to three batteries
which<00:02:33.310> I<00:02:33.460> know<00:02:33.520> all<00:02:33.790> three<00:02:34.030> of<00:02:34.120> them<00:02:34.270> are<00:02:34.420> in

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
which I know all three of them are in

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.530 
which I know all three of them are in
good<00:02:34.630> shape<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:35.110> a<00:02:36.010> 45<00:02:36.610> amp<00:02:36.790> battery<00:02:37.150> charger

good shape and a 45 amp battery charger

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.320 
good shape and a 45 amp battery charger
I<00:02:38.190> really<00:02:39.190> think<00:02:39.370> that<00:02:39.430> this<00:02:39.580> is<00:02:39.640> absolute

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
I really think that this is absolute

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.790 
I really think that this is absolute
best<00:02:40.540> case<00:02:40.810> now<00:02:41.050> nobody's<00:02:41.500> going<00:02:41.530> to<00:02:41.680> do

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
best case now nobody's going to do

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.830 
best case now nobody's going to do
anything<00:02:41.830> better<00:02:42.280> than<00:02:42.430> this<00:02:42.670> so<00:02:43.000> well<00:02:43.660> really

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
anything better than this so well really

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.640 
anything better than this so well really
see<00:02:44.050> what<00:02:44.170> this<00:02:44.260> is<00:02:44.320> capable<00:02:44.860> of<00:02:44.980> now<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:46.870> I'm

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
see what this is capable of now so I'm

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.920 
see what this is capable of now so I'm
just<00:02:47.740> going<00:02:48.160> to<00:02:48.270> first<00:02:49.270> test<00:02:49.480> I'm<00:02:49.660> just<00:02:49.810> going

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
just going to first test I'm just going

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.650 
just going to first test I'm just going
to<00:02:49.959> put<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.200> camera<00:02:50.560> here<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:51.480> turn<00:02:52.480> one

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
to put the camera here and turn one

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.330 
with that result
I<00:03:42.620> finished<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.740> test<00:03:44.010> I<00:03:45.320> traded<00:03:46.340> plugs

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
I finished the test I traded plugs

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.610 
I finished the test I traded plugs
between<00:03:47.880> this<00:03:48.540> kilowatt<00:03:49.050> so<00:03:49.290> I<00:03:49.350> could<00:03:49.500> measure

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
between this kilowatt so I could measure

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.310 
between this kilowatt so I could measure
the<00:03:49.830> wattage<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:51.270> output<00:03:51.600> of<00:03:51.630> here<00:03:51.960> so

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
the wattage and the output of here so

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.480 
the wattage and the output of here so
that<00:03:52.440> ultimately<00:03:52.650> were<00:03:52.860> always<00:03:52.980> plugged<00:03:53.340> in

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
that ultimately were always plugged in

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.100 
that ultimately were always plugged in
Zhai<00:03:53.670> only<00:03:53.910> plugged<00:03:54.150> one<00:03:54.330> into<00:03:54.540> this<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:54.960> then

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
Zhai only plugged one into this and then

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.290 
Zhai only plugged one into this and then
I<00:03:55.140> just<00:03:55.320> added<00:03:55.530> up<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.740> totals<00:03:56.160> and<00:03:56.370> I<00:03:57.030> found

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
I just added up the totals and I found

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.150 
I just added up the totals and I found
with<00:03:57.540> all<00:03:57.960> three<00:03:58.200> of<00:03:58.290> my<00:03:58.320> my<00:03:58.980> heaters<00:03:59.280> on<00:03:59.490> it

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
with all three of my my heaters on it

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.160 
with all three of my my heaters on it
did<00:04:02.160> pull<00:04:02.490> about<00:04:03.270> two<00:04:03.510> thousand<00:04:03.870> five<00:04:04.020> hundred

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
did pull about two thousand five hundred

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.260 
did pull about two thousand five hundred
and<00:04:04.410> eighty<00:04:04.530> Watts<00:04:04.830> out<00:04:05.130> of<00:04:05.520> the<00:04:05.640> inverter<00:04:05.940> so

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
and eighty Watts out of the inverter so

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.790 
and eighty Watts out of the inverter so
it<00:04:06.360> did<00:04:06.480> supply<00:04:06.750> twenty<00:04:07.080> five<00:04:07.200> hundred<00:04:07.230> watts

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
it did supply twenty five hundred watts

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.490 
it did supply twenty five hundred watts
however<00:04:08.790> that<00:04:09.270> was<00:04:09.390> at<00:04:09.540> 100<00:04:09.930> volts<00:04:10.230> output

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
however that was at 100 volts output

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.320 
however that was at 100 volts output
voltage<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.400> output<00:04:11.430> voltage<00:04:11.970> starting<00:04:12.270> to

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
voltage the output voltage starting to

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.290 
voltage the output voltage starting to
droop<00:04:12.770> well<00:04:13.770> before<00:04:14.130> the<00:04:14.220> 2500<00:04:14.880> watt<00:04:14.970> level

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
droop well before the 2500 watt level

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.140 
droop well before the 2500 watt level
and<00:04:15.739> 100<00:04:16.739> volts<00:04:17.010> is<00:04:17.130> not<00:04:17.520> really<00:04:17.850> usable

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
and 100 volts is not really usable

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.660 
and 100 volts is not really usable
output<00:04:18.540> voltage<00:04:18.870> so<00:04:19.140> I<00:04:19.350> would<00:04:20.070> still<00:04:20.280> say<00:04:20.459> that

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
output voltage so I would still say that

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.220 
output voltage so I would still say that
it's<00:04:20.820> incapable<00:04:21.120> of<00:04:21.420> providing<00:04:21.720> twenty<00:04:22.110> five

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
it's incapable of providing twenty five

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.920 
it's incapable of providing twenty five
hundred<00:04:22.260> watts<00:04:22.710> as<00:04:23.100> advertised<00:04:23.670> the<00:04:24.660> input

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
hundred watts as advertised the input

hundred watts as advertised the input
voltage<00:04:25.230> at<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.470> terminals<00:04:25.890> was<00:04:26.100> around

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
voltage at the terminals was around

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.040 
voltage at the terminals was around
eleven<00:04:26.730> and<00:04:26.820> a<00:04:26.910> half<00:04:27.030> volts<00:04:27.210> so<00:04:27.690> there<00:04:27.930> was

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
eleven and a half volts so there was

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.280 
eleven and a half volts so there was
ample<00:04:28.500> voltage<00:04:29.040> there<00:04:29.340> but<00:04:30.270> still<00:04:30.990> couldn't

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
ample voltage there but still couldn't

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.670 
ample voltage there but still couldn't
do<00:04:31.350> it<00:04:31.910> and<00:04:32.910> once<00:04:33.420> again<00:04:33.540> this<00:04:34.470> peak

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
do it and once again this peak

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.040 
do it and once again this peak
completely<00:04:35.370> meaningless<00:04:35.660> it<00:04:36.660> obviously

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
completely meaningless it obviously

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.170 
completely meaningless it obviously
couldn't<00:04:37.260> do<00:04:37.380> it<00:04:37.530> so<00:04:37.710> I<00:04:38.340> wanted<00:04:38.640> to<00:04:38.760> see<00:04:38.910> what

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
couldn't do it so I wanted to see what

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.550 
couldn't do it so I wanted to see what
this<00:04:39.300> thing<00:04:39.540> could<00:04:39.630> provide<00:04:39.960> with<00:04:40.290> this

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
this thing could provide with this

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.960 
this thing could provide with this
monster<00:04:41.430> battery<00:04:41.760> set<00:04:41.970> up<00:04:43.070> at<00:04:44.070> a<00:04:44.520> usable

monster battery set up at a usable
output<00:04:45.240> voltage<00:04:45.600> so<00:04:45.810> I<00:04:46.170> and<00:04:46.560> just<00:04:46.680> increased

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
output voltage so I and just increased

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.190 
output voltage so I and just increased
increase<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:48.060> load<00:04:48.240> here<00:04:48.450> until<00:04:48.810> the<00:04:48.930> output

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
increase the load here until the output

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.250 
increase the load here until the output
voltage<00:04:49.530> sag<00:04:49.830> to<00:04:50.100> about<00:04:50.310> 110<00:04:50.880> volts<00:04:51.240> from<00:04:51.510> 115

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
voltage sag to about 110 volts from 115

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.820 
voltage sag to about 110 volts from 115
and<00:04:52.940> I<00:04:53.940> added<00:04:54.300> up<00:04:54.510> the<00:04:54.540> load<00:04:54.990> total<00:04:55.410> there<00:04:55.590> and

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
and I added up the load total there and

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.760 
and I added up the load total there and
I<00:04:55.890> got<00:04:56.070> right<00:04:56.520> around<00:04:56.730> 2000<00:04:57.360> Watts<00:04:57.530> 2025<00:04:58.530> when

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
I got right around 2000 Watts 2025 when

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.250 
I got right around 2000 Watts 2025 when
I<00:04:58.830> added<00:04:59.040> them<00:04:59.220> all<00:04:59.340> up<00:04:59.400> so<00:04:59.810> once<00:05:00.810> again<00:05:00.960> I'm

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
I added them all up so once again I'm

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.920 
I added them all up so once again I'm
finding<00:05:01.650> that<00:05:01.800> this<00:05:02.490> inverter<00:05:02.880> is<00:05:03.180> capable<00:05:03.720> of

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
finding that this inverter is capable of

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.570 
finding that this inverter is capable of
about<00:05:04.530> 2,000<00:05:05.190> watts<00:05:05.310> and<00:05:05.970> that's<00:05:06.570> it<00:05:07.130> but<00:05:08.130> one

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
about 2,000 watts and that's it but one

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.210 
about 2,000 watts and that's it but one
more<00:05:08.760> thing<00:05:08.940> that<00:05:08.970> I<00:05:09.090> noticed<00:05:09.710> it<00:05:10.710> is<00:05:11.040> now

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
more thing that I noticed it is now

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.520 
more thing that I noticed it is now
fairly<00:05:11.880> warm<00:05:12.240> just<00:05:12.600> from<00:05:12.810> that<00:05:12.930> very<00:05:13.170> short

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
fairly warm just from that very short

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.130 
fairly warm just from that very short
test<00:05:13.860> so<00:05:14.670> I'm<00:05:14.970> gonna<00:05:15.090> do<00:05:15.180> one<00:05:15.360> more<00:05:15.510> thing<00:05:15.570> I'm

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
test so I'm gonna do one more thing I'm

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.620 
test so I'm gonna do one more thing I'm
going<00:05:16.500> to<00:05:16.590> put<00:05:17.370> about<00:05:17.460> a<00:05:17.580> 2000<00:05:18.090> watt<00:05:18.120> load<00:05:18.420> on

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
going to put about a 2000 watt load on

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.140 
going to put about a 2000 watt load on
it<00:05:18.780> maybe<00:05:19.080> a<00:05:19.170> little<00:05:19.260> bit<00:05:19.470> less<00:05:19.620> and<00:05:20.030> just<00:05:21.030> let

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
it maybe a little bit less and just let

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.910 
it maybe a little bit less and just let
it<00:05:21.180> run<00:05:21.300> for<00:05:21.480> a<00:05:21.540> while<00:05:21.690> and<00:05:21.930> see<00:05:22.380> what<00:05:22.530> happens

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:22.920 
it run for a while and see what happens

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.680 
it run for a while and see what happens
it's<00:05:23.700> supposed<00:05:24.000> to<00:05:24.060> be<00:05:24.180> thermally<00:05:24.540> protected

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
it's supposed to be thermally protected

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.750 
it's supposed to be thermally protected
but<00:05:25.230> I<00:05:25.590> don't<00:05:26.220> know<00:05:26.280> if<00:05:26.370> I'll<00:05:26.460> get<00:05:26.520> it<00:05:26.640> hot

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
but I don't know if I'll get it hot

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.850 
but I don't know if I'll get it hot
enough<00:05:26.880> to<00:05:27.030> actually<00:05:27.480> shut<00:05:27.660> down

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
enough to actually shut down

it's less than 70 degrees Fahrenheit but

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.969 
it's less than 70 degrees Fahrenheit but
I'll<00:05:33.930> let<00:05:34.080> it<00:05:34.199> run<00:05:34.319> for<00:05:34.440> a<00:05:34.530> while<00:05:34.680> and<00:05:34.830> make

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
I'll let it run for a while and make

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:36.649 
I'll let it run for a while and make
sure<00:05:35.129> that<00:05:35.250> it<00:05:35.370> doesn't<00:05:35.520> destroy<00:05:36.180> itself<00:05:36.419> or

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:36.659 
sure that it doesn't destroy itself or

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:37.100 
sure that it doesn't destroy itself or
something

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
something

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.339 
something
I<00:05:37.610> ran<00:05:38.610> the<00:05:38.729> inverter<00:05:39.030> at<00:05:39.240> about<00:05:39.599> 2,000<00:05:40.199> watts

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:40.349 
I ran the inverter at about 2,000 watts

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:42.920 
I ran the inverter at about 2,000 watts
for<00:05:40.800> 15<00:05:41.400> minutes<00:05:41.729> and<00:05:41.970> during<00:05:42.270> that<00:05:42.419> time<00:05:42.750> the

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
for 15 minutes and during that time the

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.420 
for 15 minutes and during that time the
only<00:05:42.990> thing<00:05:43.289> that<00:05:43.470> got<00:05:43.560> uncomfortably<00:05:44.220> warm

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
only thing that got uncomfortably warm

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.409 
only thing that got uncomfortably warm
were<00:05:45.120> my<00:05:45.330> 4<00:05:45.539> gauge<00:05:45.690> cables<00:05:46.139> they<00:05:47.039> got<00:05:47.250> about<00:05:48.000> 70

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 
were my 4 gauge cables they got about 70

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:50.809 
were my 4 gauge cables they got about 70
degrees<00:05:48.720> Celsius<00:05:49.229> witches<00:05:49.590> was<00:05:50.430> getting<00:05:50.699> up

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:50.819 
degrees Celsius witches was getting up

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:52.399 
degrees Celsius witches was getting up
there<00:05:51.000> so<00:05:51.240> I<00:05:51.270> terminated<00:05:51.810> the<00:05:51.900> test<00:05:52.139> for<00:05:52.319> that

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:52.409 
there so I terminated the test for that

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:54.260 
there so I terminated the test for that
reason<00:05:52.800> but<00:05:53.039> that<00:05:53.520> shows<00:05:53.699> that<00:05:53.819> you<00:05:53.909> really<00:05:54.060> do

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
reason but that shows that you really do

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.540 
reason but that shows that you really do
need<00:05:54.509> two<00:05:55.169> sets<00:05:55.379> of<00:05:55.680> cables<00:05:55.800> make<00:05:56.220> sure<00:05:56.370> you

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
need two sets of cables make sure you

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.580 
need two sets of cables make sure you
use<00:05:57.360> both<00:05:57.569> of<00:05:57.599> the<00:05:57.780> lugs<00:05:57.990> if<00:05:58.139> you<00:05:58.229> really<00:05:58.440> want

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
use both of the lugs if you really want

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.999 
use both of the lugs if you really want
to<00:05:58.650> get<00:05:58.710> the<00:05:58.830> full<00:05:58.979> power<00:05:59.220> out<00:05:59.430> of<00:05:59.460> this<00:05:59.960> but

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:01.009 
to get the full power out of this but

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:03.580 
to get the full power out of this but
the<00:06:02.009> outside<00:06:02.370> of<00:06:02.490> the<00:06:02.580> inverter<00:06:03.060> at<00:06:03.240> least

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
the outside of the inverter at least

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.409 
the outside of the inverter at least
stayed<00:06:04.590> relatively<00:06:05.400> cool<00:06:05.789> I<00:06:06.030> think<00:06:06.300> it's

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419 
stayed relatively cool I think it's

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:09.980 
stayed relatively cool I think it's
about<00:06:06.650> 40<00:06:07.650> degrees<00:06:07.949> Celsius<00:06:08.430> and<00:06:08.990> the

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
about 40 degrees Celsius and the

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.680 
about 40 degrees Celsius and the
outcoming<00:06:10.590> air<00:06:10.889> from<00:06:11.250> the<00:06:11.400> fans<00:06:11.639> here<00:06:11.969> was

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690 
outcoming air from the fans here was

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.899 
outcoming air from the fans here was
around<00:06:13.319> 110<00:06:13.860> Fahrenheit<00:06:14.400> whatever<00:06:14.729> that

00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:14.909 
around 110 Fahrenheit whatever that

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:17.809 
around 110 Fahrenheit whatever that
isn't<00:06:15.240> Celsius<00:06:15.659> but<00:06:16.099> so<00:06:17.099> the<00:06:17.219> outside<00:06:17.370> stayed

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:17.819 
isn't Celsius but so the outside stayed

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:20.059 
isn't Celsius but so the outside stayed
fairly<00:06:18.180> cool<00:06:18.360> the<00:06:19.110> way<00:06:19.199> it's<00:06:19.319> constructed<00:06:19.469> the

00:06:20.059 --> 00:06:20.069 
fairly cool the way it's constructed the

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:22.670 
fairly cool the way it's constructed the
the<00:06:20.520> inside<00:06:21.110> probably<00:06:22.110> got<00:06:22.259> quite<00:06:22.469> a<00:06:22.530> bit

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
the inside probably got quite a bit

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.589 
the inside probably got quite a bit
warmer<00:06:22.979> than<00:06:23.009> the<00:06:23.219> outside<00:06:23.250> but<00:06:23.909> it<00:06:24.270> didn't<00:06:24.509> go

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599 
warmer than the outside but it didn't go

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:26.360 
warmer than the outside but it didn't go
into<00:06:24.719> a<00:06:24.900> thermal<00:06:25.500> shutdown<00:06:25.650> condition<00:06:26.280> or

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
into a thermal shutdown condition or

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:27.860 
into a thermal shutdown condition or
anything<00:06:26.520> like<00:06:26.759> that<00:06:26.819> and<00:06:27.240> I<00:06:27.330> didn't<00:06:27.539> open<00:06:27.659> it

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
anything like that and I didn't open it

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.439 
anything like that and I didn't open it
up<00:06:28.020> to<00:06:28.169> inspect<00:06:28.530> the<00:06:28.620> inside<00:06:28.979> so<00:06:29.370> I<00:06:29.610> really

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:30.449 
up to inspect the inside so I really

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:31.610 
up to inspect the inside so I really
don't<00:06:30.599> know<00:06:30.690> what<00:06:30.840> was<00:06:30.960> going<00:06:31.169> on<00:06:31.289> in<00:06:31.440> there

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 
don't know what was going on in there

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.909 
don't know what was going on in there
but<00:06:31.849> it<00:06:32.849> did<00:06:33.029> output<00:06:33.389> 2,000<00:06:33.900> watts<00:06:34.020> for<00:06:34.469> about

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919 
but it did output 2,000 watts for about

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:38.480 
but it did output 2,000 watts for about
15<00:06:35.279> minutes<00:06:35.520> and<00:06:36.680> it<00:06:37.680> survived<00:06:38.039> and<00:06:38.219> it<00:06:38.310> didn't

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
15 minutes and it survived and it didn't

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.849 
15 minutes and it survived and it didn't
shut<00:06:38.669> down
