00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.670
 hey people welcome to one 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.770
 tell next episode gamestar today 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.110
 i see you where ixs the xbox actually 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.540
 where megaman gets his name from 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.429
 and something about a copy protection 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.390
 the early 90s some of which 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.189
 surely never heard of you 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.750
 14 years ago, microsoft entered the 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.609
 console business and made the 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.080
 playstation and nintendo neat 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.510
 competition already exists 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.820
 the xbox 360 and the xbox but want 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.250
 did you know what the ixs in xbox was for 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.600
 Actually, the iks is nothing 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.730
 another as a leftover of the 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.520
 original name of the xbox namely 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.559
 direct xbox the idea for microsoft 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.420
 namely game console came from the team 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.610
 at microsoft that for directx 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.160
 but it was responsible 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.510
 xbox something impractical than consoles 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.370
 Among other things, there were still 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.559
 quite a lot of other suggestions before 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.300
 one agreed on xbox among others 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.210
 I'm reading this very shortly before windows 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.770
 intertainment project midway as 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.640
 allusion to the bridge between pc 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.699
 and console 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.210
 microsoft title gaming means that stands 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.159
 for microsoft interactive network device 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.200
 microsoft interactive center eleven ex 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.450
 and some other names of the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.240
 prototype of the directx box was the way 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.009
 nothing but a pc on that 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.729
 windows was a little hidden with it 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.960
 that looks like game console in the 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.790
 I have you guys past gamestreamers 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.869
 already told that pacman and great 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.060
 mario and many others 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.470
 video game heroes used to be different 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.600
 That is a trend that seems to be 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.750
 to sign off because at megamind it is 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.640
 the same was the former times rock man resp 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.570
 not only in the past but today 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.650
 in japan he is known as rockman resp 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.079
 however, mega-events are beginner 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.700
 a little further back namely until 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.979
 In 1987 there was cup coming with it 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.430
 tasked to develop a game for 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.290
 famous anime and manga astro boy resp 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.390
 maybe someone knows him from you 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.100
 however , there was licensing 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.570
 some problems why you look at cup 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.890
 come then decided that 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.689
 developed a new game 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.509
 nobody occupies the protagonists 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.670
 other than megaman is megaman is 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.140
 so inspired by astro boy the 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.450
 By the way, again inspired by 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.430
 pinocchio very interesting the meaning 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.390
 By the way, the name rock has nothing 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.190
 to do with rocks or stones 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.830
 online comes from the music direction rock 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.150
 and roll because megaman sister means 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.380
 quietly perhaps one remembers 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.000
 or others and if you look at the 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.860
 megaman characters are a little closer 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.420
 look then one discovers such 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.920
 musical allusions again and again 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.310
 there are also characters that 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.570
 Hot tango blues punk reggae and such 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.000
 further on, one looks for there 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.650
 some as it often has the one whether one 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.880
 not so strong at the marketing people 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.160
 leave an impression and that's why 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.209
 you changed that in megaman 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.470
 because that sells much better at 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.060
 I am honest with the result 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.830
 rather old, because I still have them 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.270
 personally witnessed maybe it works 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.590
 yes one or the other of you as well 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.390
 but I'm pretty sure that 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.120
 most of you have never heard of 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.519
 have heard so-called curiel the code 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.709
 wales were with the first and 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.570
 I think today with the most creative 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.250
 copy protection mechanisms for video games 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.380
 it became known that coach wants above all else 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.720
 with monkey island and the deyhle pirate 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.940
 kobe â€‹â€‹that's two rotatable discs on 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.950
 which are two parts of pirate heads 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.600
 you have to turn and thereby one 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.220
 code gets where you turn into 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.019
 can give a game to start it 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.940
 Incidentally, the dress was also very fun 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.860
 up game by sam &amp; max where you get the 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.570
 two protagonists from the game with 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.310
 funny things and clothes 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.079
 some of you will be decorated now 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.390
 surely think what is on such a 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.650
 code wheel please great copy protection there 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.060
 I can just go to the internet 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.590
 and then I invite myself for the solutions 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.690
 down there is a little there 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.130
 problem back in the early 90s 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.950
 there was no internet that came 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.660
 only then 97 98 to Germany and 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.010
 accordingly one has stupid from the 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.269
 Washed this code when you see this code 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.190
 There was little then 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.440
 have been busy playing games again 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.120
 copied to a software called ex cop ii 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.630
 and then again on flea markets 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.880
 sold 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.440
 so that was it with the gamestreamer for 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.930
 this week if you like yours 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.459
 parallel or the play of sam &amp; max 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.630
 look more closely then look 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.100
 below in the description there i have 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.470
 you have two left pockets where 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.239
 you can re-enact this on Monday 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.190
 I'm snapping a new episode 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.640
 wish you a happy easter we see 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.640
 until then
