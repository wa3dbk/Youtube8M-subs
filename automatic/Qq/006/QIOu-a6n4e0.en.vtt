00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.929 
kind of like this if you look in my
previous<00:05:49.139> videos<00:05:49.649> it's<00:05:50.069> so<00:05:50.219> curly<00:05:50.729> it's

00:05:50.929 --> 00:05:50.939 
previous videos it's so curly it's

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:52.550 
previous videos it's so curly it's
curling<00:05:51.270> like<00:05:51.479> this<00:05:51.719> but<00:05:51.899> it's<00:05:52.020> really<00:05:52.080> long

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
curling like this but it's really long

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.379 
curling like this but it's really long
and<00:05:52.830> what<00:05:53.250> I<00:05:53.279> did<00:05:53.550> was<00:05:53.699> that<00:05:53.729> braid<00:05:54.089> is<00:05:54.270> the

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:54.389 
and what I did was that braid is the

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:57.170 
and what I did was that braid is the
front<00:05:54.689> on<00:05:54.960> that<00:05:55.710> on<00:05:55.949> that<00:05:56.009> other<00:05:56.430> video<00:05:56.759> I<00:05:57.000> read

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
front on that on that other video I read

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.790 
front on that on that other video I read
it<00:05:57.300> the<00:05:57.389> front<00:05:57.599> and<00:05:57.899> I<00:05:58.050> just<00:05:58.289> put<00:05:58.469> one<00:05:58.589> of<00:05:58.620> these

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
it the front and I just put one of these

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.379 
it the front and I just put one of these
off<00:05:58.979> but<00:05:59.189> because<00:05:59.490> my<00:05:59.669> hair<00:05:59.909> is<00:05:59.939> I'm<00:06:00.149> going<00:06:00.270> to

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389 
off but because my hair is I'm going to

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:02.809 
off but because my hair is I'm going to
show<00:06:00.539> you<00:06:00.569> it<00:06:00.960> doesn't<00:06:01.500> it<00:06:01.830> doesn't<00:06:02.430> sit<00:06:02.639> as

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:02.819
