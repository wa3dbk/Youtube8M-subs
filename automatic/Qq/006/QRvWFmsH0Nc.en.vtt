00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
here and that you can see through the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.319 
here and that you can see through the
mesh<00:02:00.270> also<00:02:01.280> that's<00:02:02.280> what<00:02:02.520> fly<00:02:02.790> wire<00:02:03.060> is

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
mesh also that's what fly wire is

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.039 
mesh also that's what fly wire is
basically<00:02:03.990> fly<00:02:04.229> wire<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:05.780> integrated<00:02:06.780> in<00:02:06.899> with

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
basically fly wire is integrated in with

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.859 
basically fly wire is integrated in with
the<00:02:07.200> laces<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:07.860> as<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.550> tighten<00:02:08.819> your<00:02:09.300> laces

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
the laces so as you tighten your laces

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.490 
the laces so as you tighten your laces
the<00:02:10.500> fly<00:02:10.800> wire<00:02:11.069> gets<00:02:12.000> tighter<00:02:12.270> as<00:02:12.450> well<00:02:12.720> kind

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
the fly wire gets tighter as well kind

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.700 
the fly wire gets tighter as well kind

here the outsole is rubber with
herringbone<00:03:23.490> pattern<00:03:25.280> this<00:03:26.280> traction

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
herringbone pattern this traction

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.180 
herringbone pattern this traction
doesn't<00:03:27.330> work<00:03:27.570> too<00:03:27.960> well<00:03:28.230> for<00:03:28.290> me<00:03:28.710> there's

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
doesn't work too well for me there's

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.680 
doesn't work too well for me there's
plenty<00:03:29.430> of<00:03:29.610> other<00:03:29.760> shoes<00:03:30.060> out<00:03:30.270> there<00:03:30.300> with

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
plenty of other shoes out there with

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
better traction on both the indoor and

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.680 
better traction on both the indoor and

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
outdoor courts occasionally I do slide

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.320 
outdoor courts occasionally I do slide
so<00:03:37.500> think<00:03:37.770> about<00:03:37.890> that<00:03:38.190> for<00:03:38.670> those<00:03:38.790> who<00:03:39.030> you'd

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
so think about that for those who you'd

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.280 
so think about that for those who you'd
be<00:03:39.480> stopping<00:03:39.750> on<00:03:39.960> a<00:03:39.990> dime

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
be stopping on a dime

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.410 
be stopping on a dime
for<00:03:41.220> real<00:03:42.110> other<00:03:43.110> than<00:03:43.410> that<00:03:43.580> overall<00:03:44.580> these

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
for real other than that overall these

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.810 
for real other than that overall these
shoes<00:03:45.630> are<00:03:45.780> definitely<00:03:46.290> hot<00:03:46.470> in<00:03:46.590> style<00:03:46.890> the

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
shoes are definitely hot in style the

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.850 
shoes are definitely hot in style the
cushioning<00:03:48.270> and<00:03:48.480> second<00:03:48.810> skin<00:03:48.990> feel<00:03:49.290> are<00:03:49.620> off

the<00:03:50.070> chain<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.700> traction<00:03:51.510> does<00:03:51.840> lack<00:03:52.320> but

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
the chain the traction does lack but

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.230 
the chain the traction does lack but
that's<00:03:53.130> pretty<00:03:53.400> much<00:03:53.550> the<00:03:53.730> only<00:03:53.760> thing<00:03:54.120> I

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
that's pretty much the only thing I

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.900 
that's pretty much the only thing I
didn't<00:03:54.630> like<00:03:54.660> about<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:55.260> shoe<00:03:55.490> also<00:03:56.490> they<00:03:56.850> do

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
didn't like about the shoe also they do

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.810 
didn't like about the shoe also they do

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
what you think of them like I said the

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.440 
what you think of them like I said the
price<00:04:07.680> was<00:04:07.710> right<00:04:08.130> I<00:04:08.460> thought<00:04:09.000> they<00:04:09.180> were<00:04:09.240> hot
