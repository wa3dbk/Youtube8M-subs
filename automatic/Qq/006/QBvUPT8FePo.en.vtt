00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:10.889
 okay we see the experimental setup here 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:14.040
 of 1 8 bit cell consisting of two 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.910
 wheels and a motor of this contact 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.760
 disc drives 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.510
 the whole thing is in a series circuit 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.270
 built up 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.859
 that means it can always be exactly one 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.859
 bit are processed 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.470
 in this way, then all bits 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.920
 one after the other from one piece to the other 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.989
 we have processed one here 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.860
 Data memory consisting of eight 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.870
 capacitor and a capacitor for 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.960
 The Caribbean has to be saved as well 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:47.850
 this led will show the condition of the 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.360
 current biz on so one of these 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.870
 Condenser the leds nonsense the rally 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.140
 also serve as reading at the same time 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.520
 amplifier the capacitors become short 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.649
 connected to the computer 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.950
 this attracts and goes into oneself 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:12.170
 hold state about turn it on briefly 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.170
 currently it is connected up 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.200
 As we can see, it works very well now 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.830
 the whole thing works too 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.750
 more quickly 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.750
 I will now briefly the 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.600
 erase memory that works through 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:47.430
 let go through without 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.970
 supply voltage constantly times 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.070
 more quickly 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.070
 turn on the power supply again 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.420
 You can also see higher ones 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.420
 speeds no problem 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.280
 the whole is then later the 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.590
 computer to be installed one 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.349
 Brandpot dialect understands 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.349
 enable minimalist computer 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.520
 so you can see how it works 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.050
 The whole can be used too 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.950
 I'll be counting right now 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.950
 demonstrate once 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:53.819
 so now always to count down again 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:03:02.440
 turn on start at mÃ¼llers 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:03:05.489
 rain overflow now we are at 255 of 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.489
 cells downwards 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:19.359
 Here, too, their speed at 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.359
 cocktail 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.150
 which is still a problem 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.670
 slight contact problems 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.180
 one has just seen the elegies 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.310
 have not properly lit the 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.720
 relays continue to pull on the 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.530
 Capacitors will continue 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.720
 charged 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:02.190
 It is a problem that I then on the 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.950
 otherwise the principle must be a pity 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.180
 to work well 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.870
 I see no reason why not 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.870
 should use
