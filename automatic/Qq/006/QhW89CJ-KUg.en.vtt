00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:08.080
 is there someone to win the lottery or how 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.259
 I manage to kill the lottery of 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.059
 five times out of ten if I 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:15.099
 I would have asked this question ten years ago 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.680
 years I would have said that it is impossible 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.510
 win so many times but after that 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.609
 spent eight years in the development of a 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.710
 system that is guaranteed to win 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:26.380
 five times out of ten now my 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.380
 answer will be if anyone can win 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.810
 to the lottery if you know how to play I'm a 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.820
 math teacher and I've been a 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.219
 passionate about the numbers since he was 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.379
 young I also like to have money 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.940
 tons of it because I was brought up in a 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.500
 poor family and never had the 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.510
 opportunity to drive a car 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.250
 sporting or living in a luxury home 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.559
 until I've won the lottery these 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.420
 two characteristics combined love the 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.370
 money and mathematics has 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.820
 transformed into a lottery player 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.129
 addicted after years without playing a little 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.019
 of luck I was so intrigued with the 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.730
 probability process that I started to 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.679
 study the file of the numbers 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.740
 drawn from any lottery I could 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:07.900
 find was a gigantic work in that 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.610
 moment the internet was not so advanced 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.560
 they did not have much room 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.450
 web search engines and I had to 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.370
 search through physical files 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.920
 manually without needing 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.740
 tools I was looking for a 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.110
 lottery pattern this huge job took 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.630
 about eight years did not matter 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.400
 too much for me I had the time of my 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.370
 life because I was playing with the 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.930
 countless numbers after 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.910
 failed revelations and tests without 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.010
 weekend on a beautiful day in April 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.979
 I've decided to give my other chance 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.970
 last discovery I played a ticket 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.860
 simple that cost me 5 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.080
 next weekend he hit me with 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.440
 the best news of my life I donated 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.780
 200,000 in cash and cash 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.240
 hit the six numbers was not much 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.850
 money at stake that week my first 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.740
 check from that moment on 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.260
 was a piece of cake the 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.479
 lottery pattern was discovered I 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.850
 I knew I would never have to worry 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.610
 for the money again my secret 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.850
 I was making money like crazy after 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.520
 of two weeks another prize 125 thousand 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.800
 dollars he won again as you can see 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.260
 do not win all the times but not 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.450
 it mattered he had enough money and 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.450
 time to perfect my formula yet 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.100
 more I already had the platform of 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.220
 winner and it was only a matter of time 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:35.110
 until I hit the big pot 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:37.450
 prize of 1000 000 in May 2007 and 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.120
 for the next three weeks I was the 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.370
 only person who won the grand prize did not 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.350
 it was possible to be accused of something because 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.750
 everyone knew that that impossible to do 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.580
 cheating in the lottery I was in the 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.860
 front page of newspapers 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.280
 and the money was floating to my 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.890
 accounts I was greedy I must admit it 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.780
 not necessarily for the money but more 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.570
 for fame and this one was about to 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.210
 cost me my life this part you know 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.980
 and I had the most interesting time is the 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.840
 fact that even if I am the man 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.360
 that has broken the rules of the lottery 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.340
 this does not necessarily mean that I 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.580
 I am the smartest player in the 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.800
 lottery fame useless I realized that 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.500
 I feel very good knowing that I can 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.060
 make others happy in this short 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.160
 period of time since I 've 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.230
 shared my winning formula with 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.630
 others I realized that people do not 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.180
 he necessarily wants to get rich so much 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.890
 how they want to get out of debt 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.750
 I have received dozens of letters from 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.730

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.680

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.440
 thanks because my lottery system 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.390
 simple has changed their lives if you 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.040
