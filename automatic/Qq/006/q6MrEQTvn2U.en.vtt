hi guys so we're here to reveal on

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.930 
hi guys so we're here to reveal on
climbing<00:00:08.790> technology<00:00:09.270> I'll<00:00:09.570> bind<00:00:09.870> up<00:00:10.340> on<00:00:11.340> this

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
climbing technology I'll bind up on this

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.170 
climbing technology I'll bind up on this
video<00:00:12.299> we're<00:00:12.600> just<00:00:12.629> gonna<00:00:12.930> go<00:00:13.199> and<00:00:13.590> show<00:00:14.549> you

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:15.180 
video we're just gonna go and show you

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.070 
video we're just gonna go and show you
the<00:00:16.139> overall<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.240> the<00:00:18.240> device<00:00:18.600> how<00:00:19.020> it

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
the overall of the the device how it

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.980 
the overall of the the device how it
works<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.830> what<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.370> look<00:00:20.580> like<00:00:20.610> and<00:00:21.150> the

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
works and what it look like and the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.670 
works and what it look like and the
other<00:00:22.170> videos<00:00:22.790> will<00:00:23.790> follow<00:00:24.090> with<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.720> demo

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
other videos will follow with the demo

other videos will follow with the demo
on<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.990> this<00:00:27.990> side<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.500> section<00:00:28.950> which<00:00:29.580> is

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
on the this side of the section which is

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.319 
on the this side of the section which is
you'd<00:00:29.910> be<00:00:30.060> laying<00:00:30.300> in<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.650> clique<00:00:32.070> up<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.640> or

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
you'd be laying in the clique up and or

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.760 
you'd be laying in the clique up and or
just<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.780> don't<00:00:33.989> nothin<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.350> call<00:00:34.590> either

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
just I don't nothin to call either

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.610 
just I don't nothin to call either
static<00:00:35.370> or<00:00:35.400> dynamic<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.450> then<00:00:37.020> on<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.590> other

static or dynamic and then on the other

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.130 
static or dynamic and then on the other
side<00:00:37.800> it's<00:00:38.670> called<00:00:38.880> a<00:00:39.060> one<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.480> second

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
side it's called a one and second

side it's called a one and second
d'Alene<00:00:43.140> system<00:00:43.590> here<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.570> let's<00:00:45.570> get<00:00:45.750> the

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
d'Alene system here so let's get the

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.960 
d'Alene system here so let's get the
couple<00:00:47.309> things<00:00:47.489> out<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.760> here<00:00:48.079> in<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.970> Innes

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
couple things out of here in the Innes

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.270 
couple things out of here in the Innes
in<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.840> packages<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.470> comes<00:00:52.680> with<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.010> manual

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
in the packages it comes with the manual

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.540 
in the packages it comes with the manual
okay<00:00:54.350> it's<00:00:55.350> got<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> good<00:00:55.739> instruction<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.430> here

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
okay it's got a good instruction in here

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.030 
okay it's got a good instruction in here
so<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.790> should<00:00:57.120> read<00:00:57.270> away<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.600> get<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:58.040> this

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
so you should read away and get it this

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.069 
so you should read away and get it this
is<00:00:59.130> just<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.610> safety<00:01:00.379> little<00:01:01.379> things<00:01:02.780> okay<00:01:03.780> so

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:04.079 
is just a safety little things okay so

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:06.440 
is just a safety little things okay so
the<00:01:04.769> package<00:01:05.129> come<00:01:05.339> with<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.610> Alpine<00:01:06.000> up<00:01:06.180> and

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the package come with the Alpine up and

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.699 
the package come with the Alpine up and
you<00:01:06.869> also<00:01:07.109> get<00:01:07.530> with<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.889> cow<00:01:08.310> beaners<00:01:09.709> the

00:01:10.699 --> 00:01:10.709 
you also get with the cow beaners the

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:13.370 
you also get with the cow beaners the
cabinas<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.459> nothing<00:01:11.819> that<00:01:12.389> unique<00:01:12.990> about<00:01:13.229> it

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
cabinas is nothing that unique about it

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.349 
cabinas is nothing that unique about it
just<00:01:14.329> traditional<00:01:16.009> curviness<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.969> radius

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:18.359 
just traditional curviness the radius

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:20.629 
just traditional curviness the radius
here<00:01:18.539> is<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.689> little<00:01:18.959> bit<00:01:19.049> different<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.920> think

00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:20.639 
here is a little bit different I think

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:23.059 
here is a little bit different I think
maybe<00:01:20.850> works<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.869> little<00:01:22.289> bit<00:01:22.590> better<00:01:22.649> than

00:01:23.059 --> 00:01:23.069 
maybe works a little bit better than

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:27.379 
maybe works a little bit better than
your<00:01:23.310> traditional<00:01:25.549> curviness<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.969> you<00:01:27.209> may

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:27.389 
your traditional curviness that you may

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:29.809 
your traditional curviness that you may
seem<00:01:27.810> like<00:01:28.200> these<00:01:28.409> time<00:01:28.679> these<00:01:28.920> are<00:01:29.039> old<00:01:29.279> but

00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:29.819 
seem like these time these are old but

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:33.230 
seem like these time these are old but
anyway<00:01:30.149> most<00:01:30.899> you<00:01:31.619> know<00:01:31.740> curviness<00:01:32.249> have<00:01:32.579> very

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
anyway most you know curviness have very

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.449 
anyway most you know curviness have very
similar<00:01:33.659> design<00:01:33.810> but<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.709> seems<00:01:35.099> to<00:01:35.249> work<00:01:35.279> a

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:35.459 
similar design but it seems to work a

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:38.599 
similar design but it seems to work a
little<00:01:35.789> bit<00:01:35.969> different<00:01:36.359> because<00:01:36.799> maybe<00:01:37.799> how

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:38.609 
little bit different because maybe how

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:42.469 
little bit different because maybe how
they're<00:01:38.969> shaped<00:01:39.630> but<00:01:40.939> this<00:01:41.939> actually<00:01:42.209> does

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
they're shaped but this actually does

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.539 
they're shaped but this actually does
work<00:01:42.779> so<00:01:43.289> anyway<00:01:45.049> let's<00:01:46.049> go<00:01:46.200> over<00:01:46.529> on<00:01:46.709> the<00:01:46.919> on

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
work so anyway let's go over on the on

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.099 
work so anyway let's go over on the on
the<00:01:48.029> device<00:01:48.329> itself<00:01:48.539> so<00:01:49.529> this<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.509> design<00:01:51.509> for

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:52.109 
the device itself so this the design for

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:53.659 
the device itself so this the design for
pretty<00:01:52.439> much<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.919> right<00:01:53.069> what<00:01:53.279> you<00:01:53.399> need<00:01:53.549> to

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:53.669 
pretty much the right what you need to

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:56.300 
pretty much the right what you need to
the<00:01:53.759> left<00:01:53.969> hand<00:01:54.450> or<00:01:54.719> right<00:01:54.749> hand<00:01:54.929> but<00:01:55.889> based<00:01:56.159> on

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
the left hand or right hand but based on

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.389 
the left hand or right hand but based on
a<00:01:56.369> diagram<00:01:56.909> if<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.869> right<00:01:58.139> hand<00:01:58.469> it

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
a diagram if you right hand it

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.269 
a diagram if you right hand it
it's<00:01:59.789> the<00:01:59.969> perfect<00:02:00.179> math<00:02:01.139> because<00:02:01.679> you<00:02:02.009> can't

00:02:02.269 --> 00:02:02.279 
it's the perfect math because you can't

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:04.849 
it's the perfect math because you can't
really<00:02:02.459> get<00:02:02.700> lost<00:02:03.179> on<00:02:04.020> what<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.499> should<00:02:04.739> be

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:04.859 
really get lost on what you should be

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:06.409 
really get lost on what you should be
doing<00:02:04.889> okay

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:06.419 
doing okay

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:08.660 
doing okay
your<00:02:06.899> hands<00:02:07.439> are<00:02:07.560> here<00:02:08.069> so<00:02:08.280> that's<00:02:08.489> your

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
your hands are here so that's your

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.200 
your hands are here so that's your
feeding<00:02:09.119> rope<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:10.370> this<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.550> climber<00:02:12.030> so

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
feeding rope and this is a climber so

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.930 
feeding rope and this is a climber so
the<00:02:12.480> Rope<00:02:12.690> gotta<00:02:13.080> be<00:02:13.320> going<00:02:13.860> this<00:02:14.040> way<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.310> you

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
the Rope gotta be going this way and you

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.150 
the Rope gotta be going this way and you
brake<00:02:15.720> in<00:02:15.750> this<00:02:16.170> way<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:17.310> got<00:02:17.550> your<00:02:17.760> handlebar

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
brake in this way you got your handlebar

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.700 
brake in this way you got your handlebar
there<00:02:20.160> leverage<00:02:20.610> so<00:02:21.180> this<00:02:21.450> is<00:02:21.710> basically

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
there leverage so this is basically

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.180 
there leverage so this is basically
repelling<00:02:23.630> your<00:02:24.630> partner<00:02:25.020> down<00:02:25.170> or<00:02:25.680> you

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
repelling your partner down or you

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.760 
repelling your partner down or you
rappelling<00:02:26.940> down<00:02:27.470> okay<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.500> it's

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
rappelling down okay and it's

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:29.770 
rappelling down okay and it's
spring-loaded

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
spring-loaded

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.810 
spring-loaded
because<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:30.930> can<00:02:31.110> can't<00:02:31.380> click<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:31.830> it<00:02:32.580> also

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
because you can can't click and it also

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.300 
because you can can't click and it also
has<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.180> little<00:02:33.420> indentation<00:02:33.810> here<00:02:34.470> so<00:02:34.770> you

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
has a little indentation here so you

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.170 
has a little indentation here so you
know<00:02:35.430> you're<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:36.240> grab<00:02:36.750> this<00:02:37.020> real<00:02:37.380> easy<00:02:37.740> okay

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
know you're you grab this real easy okay

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.350 
know you're you grab this real easy okay
and<00:02:39.200> in<00:02:40.200> back<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.740> you<00:02:40.860> only<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:42.150> lever

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
and in back of you only the lever

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.180 
and in back of you only the lever
there's<00:02:42.930> like<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.140> little<00:02:45.380> concaved<00:02:46.380> section

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
there's like a little concaved section

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.970 
there's like a little concaved section
here<00:02:47.340> that's<00:02:47.790> is<00:02:48.270> just<00:02:48.840> for<00:02:49.020> the<00:02:49.080> rope<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:49.830> they

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
here that's is just for the rope so they

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.920 
here that's is just for the rope so they
have<00:02:50.160> enough<00:02:50.610> space<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.210> it<00:02:51.390> you<00:02:51.570> know<00:02:51.690> they

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
have enough space to it you know they

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.320 
have enough space to it you know they
then<00:02:52.560> just<00:02:52.800> make<00:02:52.950> a<00:02:52.980> solid<00:02:53.550> sit<00:02:54.360> down<00:02:54.510> rub

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
then just make a solid sit down rub

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.920 
then just make a solid sit down rub
okay<00:02:57.330> now<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.130> on<00:02:59.130> this<00:02:59.430> side<00:02:59.780> there<00:03:00.780> is<00:03:00.810> a

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
okay now the on this side there is a

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.500 
okay now the on this side there is a
plastic<00:03:01.200> piece<00:03:01.590> it's<00:03:02.490> a<00:03:02.610> spring-loaded<00:03:03.030> and

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
plastic piece it's a spring-loaded and

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.600 
plastic piece it's a spring-loaded and
that's<00:03:04.440> a<00:03:04.500> part<00:03:04.710> of<00:03:04.740> the<00:03:04.860> function<00:03:05.160> of<00:03:05.280> the

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
that's a part of the function of the

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:06.770 
that's a part of the function of the
clicker

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
clicker

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.440 
clicker
okay<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:07.440> I<00:03:07.710> guess<00:03:07.860> in<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.070> next<00:03:08.190> videos<00:03:08.610> when

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
okay and I guess in the next videos when

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.130 
okay and I guess in the next videos when
I<00:03:09.480> demo<00:03:10.320> with<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.190> rope<00:03:11.630> you'll<00:03:12.630> get<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.930> see

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
I demo with the rope you'll get to see

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.310 
I demo with the rope you'll get to see
what<00:03:13.440> I<00:03:13.740> like<00:03:14.010> okay<00:03:14.580> so<00:03:15.480> on<00:03:15.750> this<00:03:15.900> part<00:03:16.140> you

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
what I like okay so on this part you

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.220 
what I like okay so on this part you
have<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.860> Carina<00:03:17.280> go<00:03:17.460> in<00:03:17.850> here<00:03:20.810> with<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:22.050> rope

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
have the Carina go in here with the rope

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
have the Carina go in here with the rope
such<00:03:22.980> this<00:03:23.370> way<00:03:23.610> and<00:03:24.600> also<00:03:24.780> in<00:03:25.470> here<00:03:25.950> now<00:03:26.100> this

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
such this way and also in here now this

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.559 
such this way and also in here now this
is<00:03:26.310> dynamic

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
is dynamic

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.850 
is dynamic
considered<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.620> dynamic<00:03:29.280> is<00:03:29.520> like<00:03:30.180> your

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
considered the dynamic is like your

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.650 
considered the dynamic is like your
traditional<00:03:31.920> ATC<00:03:32.940> okay

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
traditional ATC okay

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.510 
traditional ATC okay
now<00:03:35.150> in<00:03:36.150> order<00:03:36.330> to<00:03:36.450> actually<00:03:37.400> put<00:03:38.400> your

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
now in order to actually put your

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.940 
now in order to actually put your
carabiner<00:03:39.000> through<00:03:39.360> I<00:03:40.290> had<00:03:40.560> to<00:03:40.620> go<00:03:40.740> through<00:03:40.800> a

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
carabiner through I had to go through a

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.620 
carabiner through I had to go through a
few<00:03:41.130> times<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:41.520> through<00:03:41.670> this<00:03:41.790> out<00:03:42.000> maybe<00:03:42.450> I

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
few times and through this out maybe I

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.140 
few times and through this out maybe I
was<00:03:42.780> just<00:03:42.960> dumb<00:03:43.230> enough<00:03:43.260> but<00:03:43.740> you<00:03:44.640> can't<00:03:44.940> get

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
was just dumb enough but you can't get

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.930 
was just dumb enough but you can't get
to<00:03:45.360> it<00:03:45.390> except<00:03:45.950> there's<00:03:46.950> only<00:03:47.160> one<00:03:47.400> way<00:03:47.580> to<00:03:47.610> fit

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
to it except there's only one way to fit

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.490 
to it except there's only one way to fit
this<00:03:48.120> and<00:03:48.330> that<00:03:48.660> is

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
this and that is

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.710 
this and that is
right<00:03:51.340> here<00:03:54.030> so<00:03:55.030> that's<00:03:55.270> how<00:03:55.480> you<00:03:55.540> have

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
right here so that's how you have

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.150 
right here so that's how you have
finished<00:03:56.200> okay

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
finished okay

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.960 
finished okay
I<00:03:57.930> think<00:03:58.930> is<00:03:59.080> it's<00:03:59.380> actually<00:04:00.130> designed<00:04:00.670> so

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
I think is it's actually designed so

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.270 
I think is it's actually designed so
well<00:04:01.500> see<00:04:02.500> right<00:04:02.650> now<00:04:02.800> I'm<00:04:02.950> perpendicular

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
well see right now I'm perpendicular

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:13.770 
well see right now I'm perpendicular
look<00:04:06.280> at<00:04:06.370> that<00:04:06.490> how<00:04:06.640> how<00:04:08.010> tight<00:04:09.010> it<00:04:09.250> is<00:04:12.780> that's

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
look at that how how tight it is that's

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.090 
look at that how how tight it is that's
how<00:04:13.900> well<00:04:14.140> this<00:04:14.320> is<00:04:14.500> design<00:04:14.830> okay<00:04:15.670> so<00:04:16.950> take<00:04:17.950> the

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
how well this is design okay so take the

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.100 
how well this is design okay so take the
carabiners<00:04:18.609> on<00:04:18.730> the<00:04:18.790> side<00:04:20.190> so<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.280> overall

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.110 
carabiners on the side so the overall

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.800 
carabiners on the side so the overall
it's<00:04:23.110> got<00:04:23.290> a<00:04:23.320> two<00:04:23.500> plates<00:04:23.800> centerpiece<00:04:24.810> it's

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
it's got a two plates centerpiece it's

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.840 
it's got a two plates centerpiece it's
got<00:04:26.020> some<00:04:26.170> anchor<00:04:26.650> for<00:04:27.100> the<00:04:27.130> this<00:04:27.940> part<00:04:28.240> of<00:04:29.850> one

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
got some anchor for the this part of one

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:37.950 
got some anchor for the this part of one
in<00:04:31.060> two<00:04:31.750> seconds<00:04:32.610> for<00:04:33.610> blame<00:04:36.750> let's<00:04:37.750> talk

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
in two seconds for blame let's talk

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.580 
in two seconds for blame let's talk
about<00:04:38.080> the<00:04:38.290> braking<00:04:38.890> part<00:04:39.160> it's<00:04:40.060> got<00:04:40.210> that

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
about the braking part it's got that

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.250 
about the braking part it's got that
notches<00:04:41.590> here<00:04:42.120> and<00:04:43.120> I'm<00:04:43.450> gonna<00:04:43.630> see<00:04:43.930> if<00:04:43.960> I<00:04:44.110> can

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
notches here and I'm gonna see if I can

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.530 
notches here and I'm gonna see if I can
show<00:04:44.530> you<00:04:44.590> better

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
show you better

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
you can tell it's sort of l-shaped go

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:54.570 
you can tell it's sort of l-shaped go
down<00:04:49.780> inside<00:04:50.380> okay<00:04:52.710> I'm<00:04:53.710> gonna<00:04:53.860> try<00:04:54.160> the<00:04:54.250> point

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
down inside okay I'm gonna try the point

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.480 
down inside okay I'm gonna try the point
right<00:04:54.820> like<00:04:54.970> finger<00:04:55.419> it<00:04:55.540> is<00:04:56.190> that<00:04:57.190> portion

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
right like finger it is that portion

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.370 
right like finger it is that portion
here<00:04:57.970> is<00:04:58.000> actually<00:04:58.600> a<00:04:58.630> rope<00:04:58.870> oh<00:04:59.110> and<00:04:59.290> actually

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
here is actually a rope oh and actually

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.640 
here is actually a rope oh and actually
lock<00:04:59.950> it<00:05:00.190> when<00:05:00.880> carabiners<00:05:01.840> and<00:05:02.020> rope<00:05:02.260> or

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
lock it when carabiners and rope or

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.110 
lock it when carabiners and rope or
slide<00:05:03.430> up<00:05:03.669> here

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
slide up here

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.230 
slide up here
and<00:05:04.240> that's<00:05:04.720> where<00:05:04.990> the<00:05:05.230> rope<00:05:05.520> hit<00:05:06.520> so<00:05:07.030> that's

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
and that's where the rope hit so that's

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.680 
and that's where the rope hit so that's
where<00:05:07.479> locks<00:05:07.780> and<00:05:08.080> obviously<00:05:08.700> you<00:05:09.700> you<00:05:10.270> break

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
where locks and obviously you you break

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
where locks and obviously you you break
in<00:05:10.960> your<00:05:11.169> feeding<00:05:12.010> rope<00:05:12.340> right<00:05:12.580> here<00:05:12.640> so<00:05:13.710> once

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
in your feeding rope right here so once

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.920 
in your feeding rope right here so once
that<00:05:14.830> happening<00:05:15.640> and<00:05:15.940> clicks<00:05:16.450> in<00:05:17.729> it<00:05:18.729> just<00:05:19.000> it

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
that happening and clicks in it just it

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.450 
that happening and clicks in it just it
just<00:05:19.960> locks<00:05:20.380> okay<00:05:21.370> very<00:05:22.030> simple<00:05:22.120> and<00:05:23.190> easy<00:05:24.190> to

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
just locks okay very simple and easy to

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.310 
just locks okay very simple and easy to
disengage<00:05:25.030> okay<00:05:25.690> I<00:05:25.720> will<00:05:25.930> show<00:05:26.020> it<00:05:26.140> on<00:05:26.229> the

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
disengage okay I will show it on the

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.189 
disengage okay I will show it on the
next<00:05:26.470> video

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:35.969 

so<00:05:29.770> on<00:05:29.949> this<00:05:30.159> side<00:05:30.460> is<00:05:30.819> basically<00:05:31.509> for<00:05:34.979> blind

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
so on this side is basically for blind

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:39.689 
so on this side is basically for blind

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:44.489 
some someone below you okay and you're
anchoring<00:05:40.180> this<00:05:41.009> to<00:05:42.009> the<00:05:42.129> wall<00:05:42.340> and<00:05:43.349> you<00:05:44.349> have

00:05:44.489 --> 00:05:44.499 
anchoring this to the wall and you have

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:46.409 
anchoring this to the wall and you have
your<00:05:44.650> two<00:05:44.860> ropes<00:05:45.129> coming<00:05:45.550> down<00:05:45.669> here<00:05:45.939> the

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
your two ropes coming down here the

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:49.290 
your two ropes coming down here the
pictures<00:05:46.930> here<00:05:47.139> shows<00:05:47.439> you<00:05:47.710> the<00:05:48.580> hand<00:05:48.879> which

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
pictures here shows you the hand which

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.140 
pictures here shows you the hand which
is<00:05:49.330> the<00:05:49.479> inner<00:05:49.779> part<00:05:50.169> and<00:05:50.469> then<00:05:51.340> in<00:05:51.460> climber<00:05:51.789> is

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
is the inner part and then in climber is

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:57.179 
is the inner part and then in climber is
the<00:05:52.599> outside<00:05:53.699> okay<00:05:54.699> so<00:05:55.539> you<00:05:55.659> be<00:05:55.870> the<00:05:56.139> you're<00:05:56.860> on

00:05:57.179 --> 00:05:57.189 
the outside okay so you be the you're on

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:58.769 
the outside okay so you be the you're on
this<00:05:57.580> portion<00:05:57.909> again

00:05:58.769 --> 00:05:58.779 
this portion again

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:00.269 
this portion again
you're<00:05:58.930> breaking<00:05:59.409> because<00:05:59.529> your<00:05:59.800> rope<00:06:00.069> is

00:06:00.269 --> 00:06:00.279 
you're breaking because your rope is

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:02.070 
you're breaking because your rope is
right<00:06:00.610> inside<00:06:00.849> you<00:06:01.509> already<00:06:01.870> have<00:06:01.990> it

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
right inside you already have it

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.559 
right inside you already have it
breaking<00:06:02.469> and<00:06:02.650> then<00:06:02.740> you're<00:06:03.120> climbing<00:06:04.120> on<00:06:04.389> our

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:04.569 
breaking and then you're climbing on our

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:08.550 
breaking and then you're climbing on our
rope<00:06:04.839> so<00:06:05.639> questions<00:06:06.639> below<00:06:06.999> it's<00:06:07.960> coming<00:06:08.379> out

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
rope so questions below it's coming out

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.309 
rope so questions below it's coming out
and<00:06:09.129> you're<00:06:09.400> pulling<00:06:09.639> down

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:11.319 
and you're pulling down

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:13.920 
and you're pulling down
I<00:06:11.349> guess<00:06:12.129> this<00:06:12.430> function<00:06:12.939> is<00:06:13.089> very<00:06:13.360> similar<00:06:13.449> to

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
I guess this function is very similar to

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:19.829 
I guess this function is very similar to
the<00:06:15.180> Petzl<00:06:16.800> refer<00:06:17.800> so<00:06:18.039> I<00:06:18.279> think<00:06:18.430> ATC<00:06:18.999> maybe<00:06:19.330> ok

00:06:19.829 --> 00:06:19.839 
the Petzl refer so I think ATC maybe ok

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:25.350 
the Petzl refer so I think ATC maybe ok
and<00:06:21.150> and<00:06:22.150> work<00:06:23.110> the<00:06:23.319> same<00:06:23.499> way<00:06:23.529> and<00:06:24.400> of<00:06:24.999> course

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
and and work the same way and of course

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.369 
and and work the same way and of course
to<00:06:25.449> have<00:06:25.569> a<00:06:25.599> picture<00:06:25.990> for<00:06:26.199> carabiners<00:06:28.379> you'll

00:06:29.369 --> 00:06:29.379 
to have a picture for carabiners you'll

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:32.309 
to have a picture for carabiners you'll
bring<00:06:29.529> the<00:06:29.650> Rope<00:06:29.800> in<00:06:29.979> and<00:06:30.219> you<00:06:30.400> tied<00:06:30.909> in<00:06:31.089> so<00:06:31.360> in
