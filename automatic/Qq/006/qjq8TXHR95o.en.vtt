00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.230
 from the dock reed in tucumÃ¡n that 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:16.230
 amber presents us his future falcon ford 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.230
 1971 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.279
 hello my name is german kÃ¶rting we are 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.660
 at the peak of the cadillal to present 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:41.060
 in a ford falcon model 1971 is a ford 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.060
 Falcon future standard model 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.659
 and did a while I was looking for 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.440
 one way I was looking for a coupe I was looking for 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:59.089
 give yourself a gtx or a torino but good 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.129
 I started looking for a bit of history and it 's 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.559
 the one who represents us the most is the 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.290
 Ford Falcon because it has so much more 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.450
 production time in Argentina and 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.490
 good is a car that until today 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.140
 you get even everything that is 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.090
 after this labor including 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.119
 it is very accessible in my power I have it 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.789
 recently about two months ago 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:23.600
 and half that I have it the car is very 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:25.580
 well has gas equipment has air 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.050
 conditioning works absolutely 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:34.179
 everything to 102 to 101 forward and another one back to 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.179
 this third American 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.620
 as the men were exactly in 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.290
 this state the only thing I had to do 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.450
 was to review the brake issue how 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.540
 it's a very powerful car out there I did not know 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.670
 how this car itself in the year 1961 is 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.800
 a car that stops to say it of some 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.890
 way with the foot impulse not so much 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.530
 with the power pump I know that neither 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.210
 has discs on the front wheels 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.980
 but it comes with four drums or 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.170
 bells on all four wheels so that 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.070
 is much heavier the subject of 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.070
 brake travel 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.440
 has a 188 engine that will come is one of 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.510
 the smallest of the portal with has a 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.250
 breed that is called American breed of 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.270
 third behind the wheel and it's totally 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.410
 original 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:38.420
 the mechanics is has mechanical direction 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.680
 it is not hydraulic the only thing that is 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.650
 adapted was the air team 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.870
 conditioning of the form of the 74 no 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.390
 I represent in my house my old man handles 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.730
 and even my lady lately they're going to 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.410
 driving is a car that really 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.230
 the state would not take even 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.360
 mohamed that gives him the sun more than anything is 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.310
 for there is some exhibition to get it out of 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.019
 once in a while but do not leave it in the 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.019
 street or nothing 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.310
 and I bought it in that state another of the 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.710
 frequent consultations if you want it 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.120
 sell and good for now is not in 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.159
 sale 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.830
 for now I want to have it be a 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.810
 more time and the feeling of the people is 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.170
 pretty diffusive go down the street 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.510
 he said is taught 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.330
 everyone looks at you, makes a sign that 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.550
 the car is 10 and salute and there is 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.440
 a pleasant feeling where the 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.090
 car does not go unnoticed and the truth 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.860
 that I have it just the only 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.239
 anecdote that I have where I'm going left him 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.940
 parked for example if I go to 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.069
 supermarket where it came and I have 34 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.989
 stacked in the car asking me if 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.090
 I want to sell if like was that is 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.890
 the walk or they want to see it they have to 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.420
 Many of the parents are curious 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.730
 that go with the smallest guys 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.170
 teenagers approach and show him the 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.540
 side that ends them in trans auto 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.940
 that time in this state and good is for 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.250
 there is that kind of anecdote the most 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.060
 I have 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.060
 and no more 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.630
 not the truth that when you buy or you 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.820
 I buy for the same reason for the boot 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.890
 for the chair interista the truth that is 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.920
 much more comfortable the individual armchair 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.050
 but I think it's more commemorative 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.070
 or more 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.350
 to say it somehow more 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.820
 striking the boot lisa people almost no longer 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.470
 you see that kind of vehicles by 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.180
 example wood new cars 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.560
 they come with individual seats too 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.540
 this makes us see a different era 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.280
 where someone matters when he has been 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.320
 created in america has been designed to 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.300
 carry six people in my future 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.640
 If you would like to add that it would be something 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.010
 sound something for the antenna not of that 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.610
 style that is what I like but of 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.610
 there nothing more 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.240
 Sun 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.780
 good many thanks for sharing 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:06.550
