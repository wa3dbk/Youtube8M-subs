00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
the Android App Store which I think it's

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.770 
the Android App Store which I think it's
worth<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.710> for<00:01:43.829> 99<00:01:44.189> cents<00:01:44.490> for<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.850> for<00:01:45.750> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
worth it for 99 cents for the for the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.870

features that it provides I do wish that
there<00:01:48.240> were<00:01:48.540> some<00:01:48.810> added<00:01:49.110> features<00:01:49.140> so

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
there were some added features so

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.950 
there were some added features so
instead<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.040> doing<00:01:50.369> voice<00:01:50.790> command<00:01:51.240> for<00:01:51.930> a

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.780 
instead of doing voice command for a
time<00:01:52.200> delay<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.770> wish<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.399> there<00:01:53.490> was<00:01:53.610> some

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
time delay I wish that there was some

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.870 
time delay I wish that there was some
sort<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:54.060> maybe<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.020> dial<00:01:55.520> option<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.670> had
