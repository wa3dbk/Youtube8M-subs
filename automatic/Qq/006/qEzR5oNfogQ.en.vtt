00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
I'm going to dry her hair and then do

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.940 
I'm going to dry her hair and then do
another<00:02:37.630> formula<00:02:38.470> it's<00:02:38.620> going<00:02:38.739> to<00:02:38.800> be<00:02:38.860> her

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
another formula it's going to be her

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.729 
another formula it's going to be her
actual<00:02:39.280> dark<00:02:39.640> formula<00:02:40.120> I'm<00:02:40.269> using<00:02:40.569> 4n<00:02:41.319> and

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
actual dark formula I'm using 4n and

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.680 
actual dark formula I'm using 4n and
then<00:02:42.220> I'm<00:02:42.370> using<00:02:42.750> 6<00:02:43.750> GI<00:02:44.260> and<00:02:44.769> 3<00:02:45.310> na<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:46.360> reason

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
then I'm using 6 GI and 3 na the reason

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.140 
then I'm using 6 GI and 3 na the reason
why<00:02:46.810> I'm<00:02:47.019> using<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.769> the<00:02:48.220> GI<00:02:48.459> and<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.819> NA<00:02:49.090> is

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
why I'm using the the GI and the NA is

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.640 
why I'm using the the GI and the NA is
because<00:02:49.630> we<00:02:49.810> just<00:02:49.840> added<00:02:50.200> like<00:02:50.260> a<00:02:50.350> little<00:02:50.560> bit

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
because we just added like a little bit

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:51.809 
because we just added like a little bit
of<00:02:50.709> warmth<00:02:51.010> so<00:02:51.160> I<00:02:51.190> just<00:02:51.340> want<00:02:51.519> to<00:02:51.580> be<00:02:51.640> able<00:02:51.700> to

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
of warmth so I just want to be able to

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.759 
of warmth so I just want to be able to
neutralize<00:02:52.000> that<00:02:52.569> and<00:02:52.840> then<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.350> N<00:02:53.500> is

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
neutralize that and then the N is

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.350 
neutralize that and then the N is
basically<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.400> color<00:02:54.580> that<00:02:54.790> we're<00:02:54.910> going<00:02:55.060> for

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
basically the color that we're going for

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.780
