00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
reminds me so much of the old BMW and

00:00:34.510 --> 00:01:08.440 
reminds me so much of the old BMW and
that's<00:00:34.899> a<00:00:35.019> good<00:00:35.199> thing<00:00:35.260> here's<00:00:36.159> why

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.750 

just<00:01:09.450> one<00:01:09.690> look<00:01:09.870> at<00:01:10.050> the<00:01:10.170> BMW<00:01:10.380> 228<00:01:11.340> eye<00:01:11.370> and

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
just one look at the BMW 228 eye and

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.880 
just one look at the BMW 228 eye and
it's<00:01:11.940> easy<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.300> see<00:01:12.480> its<00:01:12.600> lineage<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.500> replaces

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
it's easy to see its lineage it replaces

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.980 
it's easy to see its lineage it replaces
the<00:01:14.130> old<00:01:14.280> one<00:01:14.550> theory<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.360> bigger<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:15.780> just

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
the old one theory and is bigger in just

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.230 
the old one theory and is bigger in just
about<00:01:16.110> every<00:01:16.410> dimension<00:01:16.950> but<00:01:17.430> overall<00:01:17.880> I'd

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
about every dimension but overall I'd

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.180 
about every dimension but overall I'd
say<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.540> design<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.170> leaner<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.890> more

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
say the design is a leaner and more

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.610 
say the design is a leaner and more
toned<00:01:20.250> looking<00:01:20.880> but<00:01:21.750> all<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:21.960> see<00:01:22.350> when<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.560> look

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
toned looking but all I see when I look

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.500 
toned looking but all I see when I look
at<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.190> a<00:01:23.340> modern<00:01:23.700> interpretation<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
at it is a modern interpretation of the

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.350 
at it is a modern interpretation of the
e46<00:01:25.110> 3<00:01:25.650> Series<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.490> especially<00:01:26.820> think<00:01:27.180> that

but as I mentioned this vmw comes in at

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.680 
but as I mentioned this vmw comes in at
over<00:02:19.790> $40,000<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.060> has<00:02:21.239> a<00:02:21.269> few<00:02:21.660> options

is<00:02:24.900> one<00:02:25.050> of<00:02:25.080> my<00:02:25.230> favorites<00:02:25.860> in<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.040> industry

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489
