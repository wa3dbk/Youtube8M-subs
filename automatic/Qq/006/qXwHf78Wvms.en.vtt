00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
 do not 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.150
 or not 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.860
 and here we are in a new tutorial of 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.710
 minecraft and this time what you 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.660
 I come to bring is a juncker repairman 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.400
 and loja milk remember that when 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.980
 we use many get to crack 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.289
 even to break, I'll show you 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.360
 the way that never happens to us again 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.400
 this we have to recreate 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.370
 an area because the previous one has been 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.200
 broken by use obviously so here what 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.360
 You see, it's cracked, it's broken 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.010
 I'm going to give you this button and it's going to 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.620
 repair here you are seeing it to me 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.449
 has completely repaired to look at what 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.089
 I'm going to throw an arrow with fire and 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:41.739
 I will repair many will ask 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:43.719
 how this clip works and why 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.280
 versions is worth it first so then not 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.059
 eat me in the comments 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.670
 works from version 1 point 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.980
 7.5 and obviously the new ones work in 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.539
 apps I have not tried it in versions 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.550
 earlier so if you want to try it 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:00.100
 but I do not know, I know it works 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.350
 at 1 point 7.5 this video was seen in 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.760
 the channel of an American I think 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.890
 who is American because his English 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.020
 It's a bit weird 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.790
 that is called panda I will leave you here the 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.530
 link to your channel so you can see it and 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.540
 there he explains perfectly for the one who 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.520
 know English how it works worth is for 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.650
 people who know a lot about minecraft 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.900
 technical that has a very high level like that 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.760
 that is very complicated to understand and not what 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.140
 I'm going to explain it's a subject of 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.820
 block update and changes 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.410
 of air from one block to another and that everything 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.840
 block has to end in an idea of 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.130
 three is a roll, so I'm not going 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.619
 to explain why the tutorial would be 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.270
 long and heavy and nobody would see it when 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.979
 actually what's cool is this put a 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.780
 anvil and that other curious data is repaired 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.000
 also works with black wool by 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.700
 example I put a block of black wool 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.910
 I give it to him and he changes it to the air 3 that 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.950
 would be cyan or light blue wool 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.560
 so let's not move to the constitution 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.000
 we messed up more and you see perfect thanks to 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.149
 this would never have to go back to 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.619
 spend iron on go to go back 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.149
 to make another thousand because here you have a 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.710
 Skillful when you are about to 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.690
 break simply we will give the button 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.440
 and for the simple price of a little arrow 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.720
 then you will notice a skillful repaired then nothing 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.950
 let's start I do not know where I was going first 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.620
 what we have to do is a base of 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.819
 three blocks and in the center we throw two 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.310
 blocks more towards 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:18.400
 and we make a perfect three by three 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.260
 very well in the end unleash in the culin 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.200
 untie at the end I'm going to put a piston 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.719
 sticky and just in front a cauldron to 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.060
 each side in the extremes forgive me 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:29.859
 go up is two blocks to the left more 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.409
 the one of the base that we already had and two 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:35.349
 blocks to the right now I need 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:36.609
 bars I will place bars in the last 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.069
 column block that I have placed 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:42.010
 closing the column you see him placed three 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.719
 bars and close now I need this 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.819
 terrace is worth doing with three 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:47.859
 blocks more out and this is us 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.510
 it's like this I'm going to teach you by the 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:52.329
 another side so you can see it well and not 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.639
 there is no perfect confusion 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.290
 now we take a wooden button and what 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:58.599
 we put here in the second block of the 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.180
 right and just behind that button 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.579
 wood restor antorchitas on top of 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.859
 santurtzi block and on top of that block 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.139
 another torch of rest now we need 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:09.699
 remains to close the circuit of this 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:11.739
 torch we have to take it reston 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:14.769
 towards this very easy corner one two 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.750
 three and four taps of the rest now 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.390
 we need a dispenser look 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.970
 dispenser no 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.769
 and we will place this dispenser 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.269
 here right in the center of our 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.209
 land appointment as I told you of our 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.040
 balcony he cited looking down 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.420
 this dispenser is looking down and 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.580
 is going to be the one that will dispense 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.349
 arrows that we can already put them into 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.720
 put the arrows here a lot of people have 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.310
 asked how do I do this copy 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.950
 the object so fast that I 'm going and what 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.780
 does to copy the object then the 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.970
 minecraft by default comes that the button 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.650
 mouse central mouse wheel and 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.690
 the click inwards copies you the 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.220
 object but minecraft options 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.640
 you can change the button that gives you the 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.959
 I win I have to copy objects 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.510
 any key you can put it for 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.190
 example the jy with the jota because you could 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.560
 copy the objects this fast I do not 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.780
 more mess with that it is worth we need a re 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.540
 peter to 4 ticks that will go on top of 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.629
 this dispenser on top of the dispenser 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.459
 repeat was 4 ticks worth now we put you 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:14.769
 a block in front 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.870
 one of rest and here looking towards the 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.630
 dispenser down a reston torch and 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.180
 the circuit is already stretched very well 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.550
 now we will need a block and put it 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.130
 here right in the middle look here because 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.510
 inside is going to go lava and look at that if I 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.400
 I have open the lava looks towards 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.900
 back so I put the block in there and 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.120
 Now when I put the lava in there it goes 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.880
 to be perfect we only have left to 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.740
 finish two more repeats on the side of 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.270
 the left that was free saw 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.970
 from this reston down you 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:46.390
 I put a re peter to four tics and a re 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.920
 peter to three tics now I come here to 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.290
 the back of my circuit I'm 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.360
 looking front to the back the 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.570
 circuit and to the right of the piston here 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.970
 I put a block and one of rest and over 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.380
 from that rest another block this is going to 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.820
 do when the current comes to me 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.530
 around here this is re peter me going to 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.150
 energize the block that is going to 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.700
 energize this rest that is going to be that the 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.410
 piston will stretch and this is also going to be 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.240
 that the piston is stretched with which to the 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:14.170
 get there so fast the signal the piston will 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:16.630
 will extend and be collected very quickly 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:19.120
 now I take out my lava cube and I put it 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.490
 in here and this would work 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.650
 perfectly here you will see here what 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.820
 are you going to see my boy hey how are you 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.460
 escape 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.410
 with a very damaged anvil look I'm going to 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.590
 take the one that is very damaged I put it 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.940
 there I give the little button and it repairs me 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.590
 the anvil here you are seeing it good no 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.930
 I know if you have seen it is damaged 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.740
 I'm going to give it to him and it's going to 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:43.840
 repair the anvil as I say you can have 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:46.330
 very easily and here you see it and very 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.520
 economic an anvil that is going to repair 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.900
 whenever you want with which you do not go 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.580
 to have to be spending those three 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.800
 blocks of 'iron and those four ingots 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.320
 of iron or iron to make this 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.120
 anvil because the truth is quite expensive 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.150
 and if you can create this circuit so 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.010
 simple you can see by the simple price of 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.440
 an arrow you will be able to repair your 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:08.410
 juncker as I see it is great 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:11.380
 It is wonderful and yes it is good if you work 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.910
 black wool and you do not have to get it 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.740
 nation well I also suppose that 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.780
 will work with more blocks but I have not 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.850
 tested so I'll stick with what 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.320
 anvil that fascinates me is worth this 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.060
 to be able to give it a button and to be repaired 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.040
 wonderful 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.080
 well judicious nothing liked the video
