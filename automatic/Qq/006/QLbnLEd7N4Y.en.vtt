what looks like a old old bicycle wheel

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.569 
what looks like a old old bicycle wheel
i'll<00:00:40.110> zoom<00:00:40.290> up<00:00:40.500> on<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> second<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.399> got

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
i'll zoom up on that in a second it got

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.369 
i'll zoom up on that in a second it got
only<00:00:41.730> knows<00:00:42.000> what<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.510> but<00:00:43.260> it's

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
only knows what it is but it's

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.160 
only knows what it is but it's
definitely<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:44.100> sign<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.480> settlement<00:00:46.020> that

used to live here and now I have to

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.549 
used to live here and now I have to
think<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.120> if<00:00:48.360> there<00:00:48.510> wasn't<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.870> bad<00:00:49.110> lookout

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
think that if there wasn't a bad lookout
