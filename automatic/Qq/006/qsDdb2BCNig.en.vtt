00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
just to the tentacles sushi at about

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.630 
just to the tentacles sushi at about
that<00:00:51.660> speed<00:00:51.899> go<00:00:52.110> back<00:00:52.430> everything<00:00:53.430> they've

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
that speed go back everything they've

lifespan hundred twenty two hundred
eighty<00:00:57.629> Days<00:00:57.870> yep<00:00:58.170> I'll<00:00:59.070> grow<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.520> two<00:00:59.670> or

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
eighty Days yep I'll grow it two or

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.549 
eighty Days yep I'll grow it two or
three<00:00:59.760> millimeters<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.270> day<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:01.410> they're

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
three millimeters a day so they're

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.380 
three millimeters a day so they're
living<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.859> life<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.309> rock<00:01:02.489> star<00:01:02.789> yep

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
living the life of the rock star yep

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.880 
living the life of the rock star yep
that's<00:01:03.780> everything<00:01:04.350> about<00:01:04.530> these<00:01:04.680> guys

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
that's everything about these guys

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.310 
that's everything about these guys
happens<00:01:05.519> at<00:01:05.640> breakneck<00:01:06.150> pace<00:01:06.390> how<00:01:07.140> many

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
happens at breakneck pace how many

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
happens at breakneck pace how many
columns<00:01:07.729> potentially<00:01:08.729> can<00:01:09.540> one<00:01:10.340> jellyfish

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
columns potentially can one jellyfish

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.000 
columns potentially can one jellyfish
produce<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:12.659> one<00:01:13.200> reproductive<00:01:13.860> center

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
produce in one reproductive center

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.940 
produce in one reproductive center
female<00:01:14.820> probably<00:01:15.270> sheds<00:01:15.570> half<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.560> million<00:01:16.740> to

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
female probably sheds half a million to

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.010 
female probably sheds half a million to
a<00:01:17.009> million<00:01:17.159> eggs<00:01:17.509> keep<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:18.600> mind<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.869> each

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
a million eggs keep in mind that each

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.120 
a million eggs keep in mind that each
one<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.200> those<00:01:19.320> eggs<00:01:19.560> can<00:01:19.710> then<00:01:19.860> produce<00:01:20.009> a

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
one of those eggs can then produce a

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.039 
one of those eggs can then produce a
polyp<00:01:20.520> each<00:01:20.759> one<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:20.939> those<00:01:21.030> polyps<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.600> sexy<00:01:21.960> to

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
polyp each one of those polyps a sexy to

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.140 
polyp each one of those polyps a sexy to
reproduce<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:23.280> it's<00:01:23.610> infinite<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.600> billion

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
reproduce so it's infinite a billion

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.330 
reproduce so it's infinite a billion
female<00:01:26.570> roughly<00:01:27.020> yep<00:01:27.320> and<00:01:27.530> that's<00:01:28.010> one<00:01:28.160> of<00:01:28.190> the

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
female roughly yep and that's one of the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.590 
female roughly yep and that's one of the
things<00:01:28.370> people<00:01:28.790> often<00:01:29.000> say<00:01:29.030> can't<00:01:29.510> we

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
things people often say can't we

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.810 
things people often say can't we
eradicate<00:01:30.110> these<00:01:30.260> things<00:01:30.500> if<00:01:31.040> you<00:01:31.490> wanted<00:01:31.730> to

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
eradicate these things if you wanted to

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.310 
eradicate these things if you wanted to
eradicate<00:01:32.000> them<00:01:32.360> you<00:01:32.810> have<00:01:32.960> to<00:01:32.990> get<00:01:33.170> rid<00:01:33.260> of

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
eradicate them you have to get rid of

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.500 
eradicate them you have to get rid of
every<00:01:33.890> single<00:01:34.490> jellyfish<00:01:34.880> because<00:01:35.360> you<00:01:35.450> need

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
every single jellyfish because you need

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.660 
every single jellyfish because you need
one<00:01:35.840> male<00:01:36.050> and<00:01:36.080> one<00:01:36.230> female<00:01:36.320> and<00:01:36.830> repopulate

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
one male and one female and repopulate

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.930 
one male and one female and repopulate
the<00:01:37.820> whole<00:01:38.150> area<00:01:38.390> all<00:01:38.660> over<00:01:38.840> again<00:01:39.700> that<00:01:40.700> is<00:01:40.820> a

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
the whole area all over again that is a

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.940 
the whole area all over again that is a
seriously<00:01:41.510> cool<00:01:41.630> and<00:01:42.320> bad<00:01:43.010> anymore<00:01:44.860> say<00:01:45.860> the

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
seriously cool and bad anymore say the

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.750 
seriously cool and bad anymore say the
ways<00:01:46.100> pulsing<00:01:46.490> so<00:01:46.910> that<00:01:47.690> area<00:01:48.230> there<00:01:48.650> and<00:01:48.920> here

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760
