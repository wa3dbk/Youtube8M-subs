the watch to bright light it will

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:00.669 
the watch to bright light it will
automatically<00:01:59.630> connect<00:02:00.020> to<00:02:00.049> the<00:02:00.200> satellites

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
also change daylight savings time by

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.480 
also change daylight savings time by
pushing<00:02:12.140> on<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:12.410> lower<00:02:12.650> right<00:02:12.950> button<00:02:12.980> while
