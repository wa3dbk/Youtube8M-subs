topics at certain times throughout the
year<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.910> for<00:01:03.090> example<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.690> one<00:01:03.750> has<00:01:04.350> got<00:01:04.650> the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
year so for example this one has got the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.210 
year so for example this one has got the
folder<00:01:05.489> called<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.820> Amazon<00:01:06.270> rainforest<00:01:07.220> so

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
folder called the Amazon rainforest so

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.070 
folder called the Amazon rainforest so
the<00:01:08.580> pupils<00:01:08.939> can<00:01:09.090> see<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.570> images<00:01:10.020> and

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
images which is then placed on the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.080 
images which is then placed on the
canvas<00:01:15.900> we<00:01:16.619> double-click<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.759> image

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
canvas we double-click the on the image

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.850 
canvas we double-click the on the image

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.590 
and then we can drag and drop it and
rotate<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.640> move<00:01:20.700> would<00:01:20.970> do<00:01:21.060> anything<00:01:21.299> we

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
rotate and move would do anything we

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.890 
rotate and move would do anything we
