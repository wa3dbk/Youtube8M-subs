how<00:01:56.679> much<00:01:57.009> of<00:01:57.069> his<00:01:57.310> physics<00:01:57.819> space<00:01:58.090> and<00:01:58.360> how

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
how much of his physics space and how

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.690 
how much of his physics space and how
much<00:01:58.569> of<00:01:58.720> his<00:01:58.810> animation<00:01:59.380> driven<00:01:59.710> but<00:02:00.190> you<00:02:00.399> can

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
much of his animation driven but you can

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.249 
much of his animation driven but you can
tell<00:02:01.060> the<00:02:01.179> difference<00:02:01.390> I<00:02:01.720> can't<00:02:01.899> even<00:02:02.020> front

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259

like you can't to the graphics are off
the<00:02:04.659> chain<00:02:04.840> why<00:02:04.990> me<00:02:05.170> aids<00:02:05.470> never<00:02:05.890> disappointed

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
the chain why me aids never disappointed

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.090 
the chain why me aids never disappointed
with<00:02:06.580> graphics<00:02:06.970> but<00:02:07.780> it<00:02:07.960> this<00:02:08.200> looks<00:02:08.619> next

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
with graphics but it this looks next

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.610 
with graphics but it this looks next
generation<00:02:09.640> so<00:02:09.759> I<00:02:09.819> can't<00:02:10.119> say<00:02:10.390> that<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:11.470> game

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
generation so I can't say that the game

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.960 
generation so I can't say that the game
is<00:02:11.739> gonna<00:02:11.890> look<00:02:12.010> fresh<00:02:12.280> but<00:02:12.489> you<00:02:12.610> could<00:02:12.760> always

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
is gonna look fresh but you could always

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.600 
is gonna look fresh but you could always
have<00:02:13.269> said<00:02:13.510> that<00:02:13.660> I'm<00:02:14.350> a<00:02:14.890> couple<00:02:15.100> and<00:02:15.340> I'm<00:02:15.400> just

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
throwing out random things one thing see

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.470 
throwing out random things one thing see
that's<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.310> struggle<00:02:18.579> i'm<00:02:18.790> talking<00:02:19.090> about<00:02:19.150> me

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
that's the struggle i'm talking about me

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.590 
that's the struggle i'm talking about me
and<00:02:19.600> they<00:02:19.660> are<00:02:19.690> fighting<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:21.010> know<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:22.360> you

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
and they are fighting you know to you

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.110 
and they are fighting you know to you
could<00:02:22.750> see<00:02:23.489> there<00:02:24.489> looks<00:02:24.760> like<00:02:24.850> there's

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
could see there looks like there's

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.449 
could see there looks like there's
agility<00:02:25.600> in<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.870> game<00:02:26.079> and<00:02:26.350> with<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.709> way<00:02:27.250> he

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
agility in the game and with the way he

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.580 
agility in the game and with the way he
makes<00:02:27.640> a<00:02:27.850> move<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.299> cutting<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.900> change<00:02:29.440> of

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
makes a move to cutting the change of

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.610 
makes a move to cutting the change of
direction<00:02:29.709> looks<00:02:30.250> right<00:02:30.519> so<00:02:30.820> the<00:02:30.910> player

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
direction looks right so the player

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.560 
direction looks right so the player
movement<00:02:32.620> or<00:02:33.130> animations<00:02:34.090> look<00:02:34.239> good<00:02:34.420> to

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
movement or animations look good to

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.900 
movement or animations look good to
change<00:02:34.780> direction<00:02:34.930> now<00:02:35.799> the<00:02:35.859> actual<00:02:36.430> movement

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
change direction now the actual movement

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.310 
change direction now the actual movement
of<00:02:36.970> like<00:02:37.150> running<00:02:37.510> we<00:02:37.930> don't<00:02:38.049> know<00:02:38.290> yet

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
of like running we don't know yet

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.080 
of like running we don't know yet
because<00:02:38.620> it<00:02:38.950> does<00:02:39.400> seem<00:02:39.640> like<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.820> hunchback

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
because it does seem like the hunchback

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.150 
because it does seem like the hunchback
there<00:02:40.480> goes<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:40.690> protec<00:02:41.079> yo<00:02:41.769> they<00:02:41.950> just

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
there goes the protec yo they just

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.140 
there goes the protec yo they just
channel<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:42.609> powers<00:02:42.910> that<00:02:42.940> ian<00:02:43.329> cummings<00:02:43.510> uh
