other game types in plays but team

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.730 
other game types in plays but team
slayer<00:01:27.570> spawns<00:01:27.810> were<00:01:27.930> absolutely<00:01:28.290> perfect

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.080 
slayer spawns were absolutely perfect
nothing<00:01:29.100> wrong<00:01:29.220> there<00:01:29.460> but<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.759> capture<00:01:30.030> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
nothing wrong there but the capture the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.850 
nothing wrong there but the capture the
flag<00:01:30.270> spawns<00:01:30.600> when<00:01:31.320> we<00:01:31.409> were<00:01:31.530> up<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.710> their

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
flag spawns when we were up in their

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.920 
flag spawns when we were up in their
base<00:01:31.979> trying<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.280> steal<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.850> flag<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.780> was

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
base trying to steal the flag it was

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.679 
base trying to steal the flag it was
still<00:01:34.079> spoiling<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.560> other<00:01:34.710> base<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.220> maybe

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
still spoiling the other base so maybe

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.359 
still spoiling the other base so maybe
to<00:01:36.689> remit<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.500> remedy<00:01:37.890> linger<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.220> with

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
to remit in the remedy linger this with

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.490 
to remit in the remedy linger this with
you<00:01:38.520> maybe<00:01:38.759> widen<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.780> spawn<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> little<00:01:40.380> bit

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
you maybe widen the spawn a little bit

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.859 
you maybe widen the spawn a little bit
on<00:01:40.650> all<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.369> game<00:01:41.549> types<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.600> know<00:01:42.689> just

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
on all the game types and you know just

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.690 
on all the game types and you know just
usually<00:01:43.170> just<00:01:43.290> duplicate<00:01:43.680> spawns<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.460> then

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
usually just duplicate spawns and then

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.090 
usually just duplicate spawns and then
just<00:01:44.850> change<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.149> game<00:01:45.270> cuttable<00:01:45.890> but<00:01:46.890> yeah

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
the edge of a building like looking off

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.699 
the edge of a building like looking off
so<00:02:07.560> when<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.220> spawn<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.759> like<00:02:09.289> sprint<00:02:10.289> forward<00:02:10.560> so

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
so when I spawn I like sprint forward so

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.320 
so when I spawn I like sprint forward so
I<00:02:10.739> nearly<00:02:10.920> killed<00:02:11.129> myself<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:11.670> unlike<00:02:12.180> maybe

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
rocket launcher spawn which is really

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.009 
rocket launcher spawn which is really
