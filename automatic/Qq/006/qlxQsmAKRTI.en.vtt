00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello how welcome are you to my channel 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.340
 lupita in today's video I'm going to 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.530
 talk about a method or an anti plague 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.230
 Home for you to do at home 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.880
 super practical super simple and super 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.250
 economic that you know that all 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.220
 my videos what I try to 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.800
 recommend them are good economic things 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.990
 super practices on everything and well 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.720
 simple to do or that I'm going to 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.500
 talk about a plague that I have in a 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.340
 of the plants that is this that there are all 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.650
 those little white groups that I have in the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.350
 trunk of the plant 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.690
 the plague that is taking too many 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.360
 little leaves are making them yellow and 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.680
 This plant is deteriorating 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.740
 that I am beginning to do is 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.490
 apply the anti plague that I give them 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.910
 I am going to mention 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:57.220
 in a bowl cited a fret cited with water 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.050
 it can be of garrafon or it can be of the 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.150
 idea then it is optional as you decide 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:05.960
 add two tablespoons 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.270
 of soap powder or detergent the 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.970
 soap that you decide ok 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.950
 that's for frets and it's for to wash 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.410
 the clothes ok this is what I added to 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.920
 my fret mix it super well and I started 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:21.260
 to scratch my plant with this anti plague or 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.840
 you can also add it to a sprayer 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.450
 like this one and start spraying all your 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.600
 plant with that water and soap and you will see 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.520
 that your plague really goes to and you have 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.020
 what to do when your plague is still 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.940
 controllable when you can 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.090
 control still when the plague already 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.520
 is too strong or the 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.130
 problem is very big then the best 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.950
 what you should do is prune the other 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.979
 recommendation when you detect it is 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.080
 that you have a plant full of plague what 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.640
 The first thing to do is to separate the 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.680
 the others because the plague is going to 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.869
 jump from one plant to another and another and 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.660
 the problem is going to be much greater 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.000
 ok another way to prepare the water with 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.600
 Soap for the plants is the following 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.090
 you can boil super well boiled water 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.789
 well well well hot as it is 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.250
 hot you add the soap we wait for 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.470
 let it cool down and then we apply to the 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.180
 plant, do not add it hot 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.570
 because obviously you are going to hurt the 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.190
 plant and you're going to deteriorate ok because 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.640
 that boil the water because supposedly 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.430
 when the water boils, certain 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.430
 soap chemicals and it comes with a lot 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.730
 more force to limit to eliminate the plague 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.570
 from your plant that how many times should we 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.890
 of spraying soap to the plant 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.370
 approximately 3 to 4 times per 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.060
 week until your check is that the 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.890
 plague is completely eliminated that 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.170
 thanks for watching my video thanks for watching 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.150
