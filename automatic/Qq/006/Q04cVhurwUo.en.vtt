00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.590 
what we're gonna do is drop this we're
in<00:03:08.530> about<00:03:08.620> nine<00:03:08.950> feet<00:03:09.280> of<00:03:09.310> water<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:09.910> so<00:03:10.450> we'll

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
in about nine feet of water and so we'll

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.690 
in about nine feet of water and so we'll
drop<00:03:10.780> this<00:03:10.959> down<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:11.260> see<00:03:12.130> how<00:03:12.220> quickly<00:03:12.459> the

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
drop this down and see how quickly the

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.199 
drop this down and see how quickly the
crawdads<00:03:13.090> find<00:03:13.330> it

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.479 

we've<00:03:19.209> got<00:03:19.360> a<00:03:19.390> float<00:03:19.689> attached<00:03:20.140> to<00:03:21.129> the<00:03:21.250> end<00:03:21.370> of

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
we've got a float attached to the end of

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.690 
we've got a float attached to the end of
our<00:03:21.610> string<00:03:21.909> where<00:03:22.450> we<00:03:22.599> can<00:03:22.750> identify<00:03:23.700> whose

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
our string where we can identify whose

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.080 
our string where we can identify whose
trap<00:03:24.970> it<00:03:25.150> is<00:03:25.269> and<00:03:25.599> and<00:03:26.379> this<00:03:27.340> float<00:03:27.610> identify

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
trap it is and and this float identify

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.729 
trap it is and and this float identify
is<00:03:28.150> obviously<00:03:28.599> where<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:28.870> trap<00:03:29.200> is<00:03:29.379> under<00:03:29.650> the

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
is obviously where the trap is under the

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.740 
is obviously where the trap is under the
water<00:03:29.860> so<00:03:30.670> we<00:03:30.790> can<00:03:30.909> actually<00:03:31.060> just<00:03:31.239> drop<00:03:31.569> this

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
water so we can actually just drop this

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.380 
water so we can actually just drop this
in<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:31.989> water<00:03:32.170> and<00:03:32.700> it'll<00:03:33.700> float<00:03:34.000> and<00:03:34.180> let<00:03:34.299> us

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
in the water and it'll float and let us

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.319 
in the water and it'll float and let us
know<00:03:34.540> exactly<00:03:34.930> where<00:03:35.530> that<00:03:35.680> trap<00:03:35.950> is<00:03:36.209> we<00:03:37.209> have

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
know exactly where that trap is we have

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.449 
know exactly where that trap is we have
so<00:03:37.540> much<00:03:37.659> vegetation<00:03:38.349> in<00:03:38.500> straw<00:03:38.739> or<00:03:38.920> a<00:03:38.950> lot<00:03:39.280> of

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
so much vegetation in straw or a lot of

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.850 
so much vegetation in straw or a lot of

that's<00:03:41.980> gonna<00:03:42.190> that's<00:03:42.280> going<00:03:42.700> to<00:03:42.760> really

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
that's gonna that's going to really

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.610 
that's gonna that's going to really
appeal<00:03:44.109> to<00:03:44.140> crawfish<00:03:44.799> but<00:03:46.079> in<00:03:47.079> addition<00:03:47.530> to
