00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
it's a pure expression I'm able to think

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.140 
it's a pure expression I'm able to think
about<00:00:09.450> an<00:00:09.719> idea<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.320> create<00:00:11.309> an<00:00:11.429> entire<00:00:11.730> world

we're<00:02:14.480> in<00:02:14.540> agreement<00:02:14.780> because<00:02:15.350> we<00:02:15.860> have<00:02:16.040> such

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
we're in agreement because we have such

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.980 
we're in agreement because we have such
different<00:02:16.400> backgrounds<00:02:16.760> and<00:02:17.330> we<00:02:17.660> have<00:02:17.780> so

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
different backgrounds and we have so

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.590 
different backgrounds and we have so
many<00:02:18.140> different<00:02:18.410> yes<00:02:19.100> priorities<00:02:20.090> as<00:02:20.270> far<00:02:20.480> as

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
many different yes priorities as far as

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.740 
many different yes priorities as far as
what<00:02:20.840> product<00:02:21.170> development<00:02:21.650> means<00:02:21.830> that<00:02:22.750> when

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
what product development means that when

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.690 
what product development means that when
we're<00:02:24.110> in<00:02:24.200> agreement<00:02:24.500> even<00:02:25.130> though<00:02:25.220> we<00:02:25.400> right

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
we're in agreement even though we right

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.699 
we're in agreement even though we right
there<00:02:25.910> from<00:02:26.000> two<00:02:26.239> different<00:02:26.390> places<00:02:26.600> like<00:02:27.230> we

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
there from two different places like we

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.500 
there from two different places like we
know<00:02:27.800> it's<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.070> right<00:02:28.160> way<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:28.370> go<00:02:28.459> and<00:02:28.850> I

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
know it's the right way to go and I

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.570 
know it's the right way to go and I
think<00:02:29.870> that<00:02:30.080> that<00:02:30.530> kind<00:02:30.830> of<00:02:30.920> contrast<00:02:31.430> between

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
think that that kind of contrast between

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.449 
think that that kind of contrast between
us<00:02:32.000> is<00:02:32.180> why<00:02:32.780> that<00:02:33.620> agreement<00:02:34.040> works<00:02:34.220> so<00:02:34.430> well

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
us is why that agreement works so well

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.240 
us is why that agreement works so well
we<00:02:35.209> were<00:02:35.390> at<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:36.200> exploratorium<00:02:36.830> here<00:02:37.040> in<00:02:37.100> San

which is looking around one of their

which is looking around one of their
exhibits<00:02:41.590> are<00:02:41.830> these<00:02:42.160> bunch<00:02:42.400> of<00:02:42.520> strings<00:02:42.850> and

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
exhibits are these bunch of strings and

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.060 
exhibits are these bunch of strings and
if<00:02:43.480> you<00:02:43.690> look<00:02:43.960> at<00:02:44.110> it<00:02:44.140> from<00:02:44.230> most<00:02:44.530> angles<00:02:44.680> it's

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
if you look at it from most angles it's

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.980 
if you look at it from most angles it's
just<00:02:45.250> this<00:02:45.340> crazy<00:02:45.700> bunch<00:02:46.120> of<00:02:46.210> strings<00:02:46.540> but<00:02:46.870> if

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
just this crazy bunch of strings but if

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.410 
just this crazy bunch of strings but if
you<00:02:47.080> look<00:02:47.230> at<00:02:47.350> it<00:02:47.380> from<00:02:47.500> this<00:02:47.860> great<00:02:48.490> angle<00:02:48.940> it

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
you look at it from this great angle it

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.120 
you look at it from this great angle it
resolves<00:02:49.780> itself<00:02:49.930> into<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.320> chair<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:50.920> we're

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
resolves itself into a chair and we're

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.920 
resolves itself into a chair and we're
like<00:02:51.250> Oh<00:02:51.400> that'd<00:02:51.880> be<00:02:52.000> cool<00:02:52.180> like<00:02:52.540> we<00:02:52.780> could

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
like Oh that'd be cool like we could

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.990 
like Oh that'd be cool like we could
rotate<00:02:53.230> stuff<00:02:53.740> and<00:02:54.220> like<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:54.670> know<00:02:54.700> it<00:02:54.910> would

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
rotate stuff and like you know it would

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.580 
rotate stuff and like you know it would
be<00:02:55.120> pretty<00:02:55.300> easy<00:02:55.420> to<00:02:55.660> build<00:02:55.840> we<00:02:56.410> knew<00:02:56.560> we

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
be pretty easy to build we knew we

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.950 
be pretty easy to build we knew we
wanted<00:02:56.860> something<00:02:57.250> this<00:02:58.060> role<00:02:58.360> that<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.810> user

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
wanted something this role that the user

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.500 
wanted something this role that the user
could<00:02:59.260> you<00:02:59.950> know<00:03:00.010> feel<00:03:00.400> at<00:03:00.790> least<00:03:00.970> as<00:03:01.150> much<00:03:01.300> as

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
could you know feel at least as much as

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.740 
could you know feel at least as much as
possible<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:02.200> touchscreen<00:03:02.710> and<00:03:03.300> that<00:03:04.300> was<00:03:04.420> an

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
possible the touchscreen and that was an

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.930 
possible the touchscreen and that was an
important<00:03:05.230> design<00:03:05.890> aspect<00:03:06.460> and<00:03:06.610> design

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
important design aspect and design

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.810 
important design aspect and design
choice<00:03:07.150> for<00:03:07.480> us<00:03:07.710> we<00:03:08.710> wanted<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.310> player<00:03:09.580> to<00:03:09.730> be

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
choice for us we wanted the player to be

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.390 
choice for us we wanted the player to be
able<00:03:10.000> to<00:03:10.060> immerse<00:03:10.540> themselves<00:03:10.980> in<00:03:11.980> this<00:03:12.130> world

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
able to immerse themselves in this world

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.980 
able to immerse themselves in this world
and<00:03:12.640> really<00:03:12.790> have<00:03:13.030> a<00:03:13.060> really<00:03:13.390> nice<00:03:13.510> tactile

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
and really have a really nice tactile

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.530 
and really have a really nice tactile
experience<00:03:14.590> for<00:03:14.980> us<00:03:15.130> 3d<00:03:15.460> was<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.850> easy<00:03:16.000> way<00:03:16.300> of

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
experience for us 3d was the easy way of

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.650 
experience for us 3d was the easy way of
neither<00:03:17.470> of<00:03:17.710> us<00:03:17.860> can<00:03:18.160> draw<00:03:18.400> so<00:03:18.970> we<00:03:19.120> had<00:03:19.270> to<00:03:19.300> do<00:03:19.630> a

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
neither of us can draw so we had to do a

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.140 
neither of us can draw so we had to do a
3d<00:03:19.930> game<00:03:20.020> like<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.740> 2-d<00:03:21.610> game<00:03:21.640> would've<00:03:22.000> worked

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
3d game like a 2-d game would've worked

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.670 
3d game like a 2-d game would've worked
I<00:03:22.390> think<00:03:22.540> there<00:03:22.690> are<00:03:22.720> lots<00:03:22.960> of<00:03:23.080> examples<00:03:23.230> of

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
I think there are lots of examples of

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.860 
I think there are lots of examples of
great<00:03:23.950> 3d<00:03:24.280> games<00:03:24.640> I<00:03:24.940> think<00:03:25.390> it's<00:03:25.510> starting<00:03:25.690> to

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
great 3d games I think it's starting to

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.690 
great 3d games I think it's starting to
come<00:03:26.080> into<00:03:26.230> its<00:03:26.470> own<00:03:26.590> on<00:03:26.770> mobile<00:03:27.100> as<00:03:27.220> well<00:03:27.250> I

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
come into its own on mobile as well I

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.790 
come into its own on mobile as well I
mean<00:03:27.880> that<00:03:28.090> we<00:03:28.390> were<00:03:28.570> able<00:03:28.690> to<00:03:28.840> ship<00:03:29.170> lost<00:03:29.440> toys

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
mean that we were able to ship lost toys

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.400 
mean that we were able to ship lost toys
in<00:03:30.130> full<00:03:30.430> 3d<00:03:30.460> on<00:03:31.000> mobile<00:03:31.360> and<00:03:31.840> I<00:03:31.930> think<00:03:32.170> for<00:03:32.350> an

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
in full 3d on mobile and I think for an

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.130 
in full 3d on mobile and I think for an
indie<00:03:32.650> studio<00:03:32.830> that's<00:03:33.220> relatively<00:03:33.970> new<00:03:34.270> but

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
indie studio that's relatively new but

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.620 
indie studio that's relatively new but
it's<00:03:35.770> it<00:03:36.040> won't<00:03:36.190> always<00:03:36.370> be<00:03:36.520> new<00:03:36.820> I<00:03:37.030> think<00:03:37.510> it's

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
it's it won't always be new I think it's

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.720 
it's it won't always be new I think it's
the<00:03:37.690> direction<00:03:38.050> everyone<00:03:38.950> is<00:03:39.070> moving<00:03:39.220> in<00:03:39.520> and

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
the direction everyone is moving in and

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.580 
the direction everyone is moving in and
as<00:03:39.850> mobile<00:03:40.750> phones<00:03:40.780> become<00:03:41.230> more<00:03:41.410> powerful

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
as mobile phones become more powerful

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.800 
as mobile phones become more powerful
that's<00:03:42.130> just<00:03:42.340> just<00:03:43.209> the<00:03:43.330> way<00:03:43.450> things<00:03:43.510> are

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
that's just just the way things are

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.340 
that's just just the way things are
going<00:03:43.840> to<00:03:44.080> go<00:03:44.230> there's<00:03:44.650> so<00:03:45.209> many<00:03:46.209> obstacles<00:03:46.540> to

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
going to go there's so many obstacles to

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.500 
going to go there's so many obstacles to
creating<00:03:47.709> a<00:03:47.770> game<00:03:48.010> like<00:03:48.580> especially<00:03:49.270> your

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
creating a game like especially your

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.360 
creating a game like especially your
first<00:03:49.750> time<00:03:50.050> like<00:03:50.440> we<00:03:50.830> didn't<00:03:51.070> know<00:03:51.190> what

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
first time like we didn't know what

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.920 
first time like we didn't know what
we're<00:03:51.520> doing<00:03:51.910> we<00:03:52.239> didn't<00:03:52.690> have<00:03:52.720> any

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
we're doing we didn't have any

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.910 
we're doing we didn't have any
experience<00:03:53.590> doing<00:03:53.890> it<00:03:54.840> we<00:03:55.840> really<00:03:56.650> have<00:03:56.770> any
