inside<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.410> package<00:00:37.800> we<00:00:38.219> can<00:00:38.340> also<00:00:38.460> use

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
inside the package we can also use

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.729 
inside the package we can also use
firewire<00:00:39.090> 800<00:00:39.329> which<00:00:39.809> i<00:00:39.930> would<00:00:39.989> be<00:00:40.200> using<00:00:40.590> and

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
firewire 800 which i would be using and

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.799 
firewire 800 which i would be using and
trying<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.040> out<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.460> testing<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.239> speeds<00:00:42.540> and

trying it out and testing the speeds and
we<00:00:43.530> can<00:00:43.739> also<00:00:43.890> use<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> tender<00:00:44.700> bottle<00:00:44.940> adapter

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
we can also use a tender bottle adapter

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.029 
we can also use a tender bottle adapter
although<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.110> internal<00:00:46.410> part<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.800> /<00:00:46.950> is

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
although the internal part of that / is

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.069 
although the internal part of that / is
quite<00:00:47.250> expensive<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:48.149> still<00:00:48.600> have<00:00:48.750> an<00:00:48.930> option

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
quite expensive you still have an option

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.920 
quite expensive you still have an option
to<00:00:49.260> use<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:49.860> just<00:00:50.550> travel<00:00:50.910> work<00:00:51.270> as<00:00:51.539> good

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
to use it and just travel work as good

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.990 
to use it and just travel work as good
as<00:00:52.079> possible<00:00:52.530> with<00:00:52.829> 10<00:00:53.070> gigabytes<00:00:53.399> per<00:00:53.579> second

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
as possible with 10 gigabytes per second

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.060 
as possible with 10 gigabytes per second
of<00:00:54.120> transfer<00:00:54.719> rate<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.500> let's<00:00:55.649> go<00:00:55.770> ahead<00:00:55.800> and

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
of transfer rate so let's go ahead and

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.369 
of transfer rate so let's go ahead and
slice<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:56.699> open<00:00:57.210> right<00:00:58.020> about<00:00:58.440> cheer<00:01:00.289> so<00:01:01.289> as

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
slice this open right about cheer so as

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.900 
slice this open right about cheer so as
you<00:01:01.469> can<00:01:01.559> see<00:01:01.739> we<00:01:01.980> have<00:01:02.010> quite<00:01:02.219> some<00:01:02.670> things

you can see we have quite some things

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.789 
you can see we have quite some things
inside<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.329> boss<00:01:03.539> we<00:01:03.780> can<00:01:03.960> see<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.559> hard

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
inside the boss we can see the hard

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.340 
inside the boss we can see the hard
drive<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.689> the<00:01:06.689> end<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.930> box<00:01:07.110> right<00:01:07.290> here

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
drive and the end of the box right here

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.219

so let's take on the hard drive and here

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.830 
so let's take on the hard drive and here
we<00:01:10.350> have<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.830> hard<00:01:11.010> drive<00:01:11.220> itself<00:01:11.659> let's<00:01:12.659> put

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
we have the hard drive itself let's put

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.719 
we have the hard drive itself let's put
the<00:01:12.960> side<00:01:13.229> for<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.500> while<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.950> we'll<00:01:14.460> take<00:01:14.670> a

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
the side for a while and we'll take a

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.640 
the side for a while and we'll take a
look<00:01:14.970> at<00:01:15.210> what's<00:01:16.020> more<00:01:16.380> inside<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> box<00:01:17.159> so

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
look at what's more inside the box so

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.499 
look at what's more inside the box so
let's<00:01:19.650> go<00:01:19.799> ahead<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.070> take<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.820> packet<00:01:21.270> out

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
let's go ahead and take this packet out

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:31.270 
let's go ahead and take this packet out
and<00:01:22.229> she<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.310> let's<00:01:24.060> open<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:24.600> up<00:01:24.780> and

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.670 

basically<00:01:32.280> what<00:01:32.549> we<00:01:32.670> have<00:01:32.850> inside<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.990> USB

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
basically what we have inside is the USB

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.569 
basically what we have inside is the USB
3.0<00:01:35.130> cable<00:01:35.390> to<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.420> mini<00:01:36.869> USB<00:01:37.710> adapter<00:01:38.369> and

3.0 cable to the mini USB adapter and
the<00:01:39.570> power<00:01:40.320> adapter<00:01:40.530> for<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.369> hard<00:01:41.579> drive<00:01:41.759> so

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
the power adapter for the hard drive so

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.719 
the power adapter for the hard drive so
that<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.840> pretty<00:01:42.990> much<00:01:43.170> about<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:44.490> the

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
that is pretty much about it in the

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.969 
that is pretty much about it in the
prompt<00:01:44.970> box<00:01:45.180> basically<00:01:45.720> let's<00:01:46.619> go<00:01:46.740> ahead<00:01:46.860> and

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979

to keep this aside and let's go ahead
and<00:02:30.060> box<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.660> hard<00:02:30.840> drive<00:02:31.020> itself<00:02:31.290> so<00:02:34.160> let's

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
and box the hard drive itself so let's

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.700 
and box the hard drive itself so let's
go<00:02:35.250> ahead<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.430> take<00:02:35.670> this<00:02:35.910> out<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.600> here<00:02:37.590> we

go ahead and take this out and here we

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.970 
go ahead and take this out and here we
have<00:02:37.740> the<00:02:38.340> hard<00:02:38.820> drive<00:02:39.090> itself<00:02:39.840> so<00:02:40.500> as<00:02:40.740> you<00:02:40.800> can

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
have the hard drive itself so as you can

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.430 
have the hard drive itself so as you can
see<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.850> hard<00:02:42.030> drive<00:02:42.180> is<00:02:42.270> pretty<00:02:42.630> slim<00:02:43.050> it<00:02:43.290> is

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
see the hard drive is pretty slim it is

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.680 
see the hard drive is pretty slim it is
quite<00:02:43.680> heavy<00:02:43.950> compared<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:45.000> most<00:02:45.240> of<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.510> hard

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
quite heavy compared to most of the hard

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.680 
quite heavy compared to most of the hard
drives<00:02:45.780> in<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.230> market<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:47.180> well<00:02:48.180> it's<00:02:48.420> a

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
drives in the market and well it's a

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.890 
drives in the market and well it's a
free<00:02:49.370> okay<00:02:50.370> for<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.790> tweeter<00:02:51.270> bite<00:02:51.450> hard<00:02:51.660> drive

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
free okay for a tweeter bite hard drive

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.280 
free okay for a tweeter bite hard drive
and<00:02:52.370> let's<00:02:53.370> take<00:02:53.490> a<00:02:53.580> look<00:02:53.760> at<00:02:53.910> what<00:02:54.300> is<00:02:54.570> on<00:02:55.260> it

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
and let's take a look at what is on it

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.920 
and let's take a look at what is on it
so<00:02:55.650> we<00:02:55.800> have<00:02:56.010> here<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.850> heating<00:02:57.240> length<00:02:57.450> so<00:02:57.780> if

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
so we have here the heating length so if

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.630 
so we have here the heating length so if
for<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.290> hard<00:02:58.410> room<00:02:58.530> gets<00:02:58.680> heated<00:02:58.860> other<00:02:59.250> fans

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
for the hard room gets heated other fans

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.050 
for the hard room gets heated other fans
will<00:03:00.330> take<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.900> heat<00:03:01.020> out<00:03:01.050> from<00:03:01.530> here<00:03:01.770> we<00:03:02.670> have

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
will take the heat out from here we have

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.230 
will take the heat out from here we have
the<00:03:03.420> power<00:03:03.900> adapter<00:03:03.960> port<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.890> the

proprietary USB port and we have the
capacity<00:03:09.260> lights<00:03:10.260> so<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:11.340> morn<00:03:11.550> fills<00:03:11.820> up<00:03:12.000> the

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
capacity lights so the morn fills up the

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.840 
capacity lights so the morn fills up the
more<00:03:12.300> lights<00:03:12.480> will<00:03:12.690> blink<00:03:13.050> and<00:03:13.410> go<00:03:14.400> over<00:03:14.610> on

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
more lights will blink and go over on

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.930 
more lights will blink and go over on
the<00:03:14.940> top<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.470> if<00:03:16.470> it's<00:03:16.980> not<00:03:17.160> filled<00:03:17.610> up<00:03:17.760> it

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
the top and if it's not filled up it

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.400 
the top and if it's not filled up it
would<00:03:18.090> be<00:03:18.209> just<00:03:18.390> one<00:03:18.630> light<00:03:18.810> or<00:03:19.020> no<00:03:19.110> light<00:03:19.290> at

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
would be just one light or no light at

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.680 
would be just one light or no light at
all<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:19.860> this<00:03:20.220> hard<00:03:20.489> drive<00:03:20.610> s<00:03:20.880> has<00:03:21.300> a<00:03:21.330> sleep

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690
