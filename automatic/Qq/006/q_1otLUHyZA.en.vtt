00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.889 

I'm<00:00:05.190> going<00:00:05.670> to<00:00:05.730> demonstrate<00:00:06.240> how<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:06.450> make<00:00:06.629> a

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
I'm going to demonstrate how to make a

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.930 
I'm going to demonstrate how to make a
yarn<00:00:07.170> over<00:00:07.319> there's<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.309> couple<00:00:08.519> things<00:00:08.760> you

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
yarn over there's a couple things you

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.669 
yarn over there's a couple things you
need<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.120> remember<00:00:09.420> about<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.870> yarn<00:00:10.139> over<00:00:10.440> which

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
need to remember about a yarn over which

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.190 
need to remember about a yarn over which
is<00:00:10.889> that<00:00:11.250> it<00:00:11.490> is<00:00:11.639> an<00:00:11.790> increase<00:00:12.330> so<00:00:12.990> if<00:00:13.110> you

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
is that it is an increase so if you

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.079 
is that it is an increase so if you
don't<00:00:13.410> want<00:00:13.590> your<00:00:13.710> knitting<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.130> grow<00:00:14.340> after

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
don't want your knitting to grow after

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.490 
don't want your knitting to grow after
every<00:00:15.389> increase<00:00:15.809> you're<00:00:16.170> going<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.350> need<00:00:16.470> a

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
every increase you're going to need a

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.120 
every increase you're going to need a
decrease<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.550> I'll<00:00:17.640> show<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:17.910> what<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.180> mean<00:00:18.420> in

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
decrease so I'll show you what I mean in

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.490 
decrease so I'll show you what I mean in
this<00:00:20.130> pattern<00:00:20.640> I'm<00:00:20.880> alternating<00:00:21.480> simple<00:00:22.230> yarn

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
this pattern I'm alternating simple yarn

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.359 
this pattern I'm alternating simple yarn
overs<00:00:22.890> first<00:00:23.789> two<00:00:24.660> stitches<00:00:24.900> in<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.560> then<00:00:26.010> six

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
overs first two stitches in and then six

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.700 
overs first two stitches in and then six
stitches<00:00:26.609> in<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.510> now<00:00:27.660> I'm<00:00:27.810> on<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> two<00:00:28.260> stitches

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
stitches in so now I'm on a two stitches

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.049 
stitches in so now I'm on a two stitches
in<00:00:28.740> row<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.670> I'm<00:00:29.789> going<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.150> slip<00:00:30.750> one<00:00:30.779> knit<00:00:32.059> two

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
in row so I'm going to slip one knit two

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.569 
in row so I'm going to slip one knit two
and<00:00:33.390> now<00:00:34.020> I'm<00:00:34.170> ready<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.530> work<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.920> yarn<00:00:35.160> over<00:00:35.430> I

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
and now I'm ready to work a yarn over I

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.090 
and now I'm ready to work a yarn over I
want<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.940> insert<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.570> hole<00:00:36.840> here<00:00:37.380> because<00:00:38.070> a

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
want to insert a hole here because a

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.549 
want to insert a hole here because a
yarn<00:00:38.370> over<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.879> just<00:00:39.300> basically<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.930> hole<00:00:40.260> and

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
yarn over is just basically a hole and

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.100 
yarn over is just basically a hole and
to<00:00:41.280> do<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.730> I'm<00:00:41.969> going<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.420> bring<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.899> yarn

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
to do that I'm going to bring the yarn

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.889 
to do that I'm going to bring the yarn
in<00:00:43.410> front<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.399> needles<00:00:44.780> coming<00:00:45.780> from

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
in front of the needles coming from

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.869 
in front of the needles coming from
between<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.350> tips<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.829> then<00:00:47.399> back<00:00:47.670> over

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
between the tips and then back over

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.690 
between the tips and then back over
again<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.660> back<00:00:48.980> when<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.010> stick<00:00:50.430> my<00:00:50.640> needle

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
again to the back when I stick my needle

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.670 
again to the back when I stick my needle
in<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.420> knit<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.870> next<00:00:52.050> stitch<00:00:52.230> i'll

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
in to knit the next stitch i'll

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.520 
in to knit the next stitch i'll
matically<00:00:53.579> be<00:00:53.850> bringing<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.360> yarn<00:00:54.660> over<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
matically be bringing that yarn over the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.529 
matically be bringing that yarn over the
needle<00:00:55.559> because<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.699> order<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.969> knit<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.270> stitch

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
needle because in order to knit a stitch

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.470 
needle because in order to knit a stitch
the<00:00:57.840> yarn<00:00:58.020> has<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.440> wrap<00:00:58.620> around<00:00:58.949> from<00:00:59.219> behind

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
the yarn has to wrap around from behind

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.450 
the yarn has to wrap around from behind
now<00:01:00.480> however<00:01:00.930> before<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.710> knit<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.129> next

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
now however before I knit that next

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.609 
now however before I knit that next
stitch<00:01:02.670> remember<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.539> yarn<00:01:03.809> over<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.320> an

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
stitch remember that a yarn over is an

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.310 
stitch remember that a yarn over is an
increase<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:06.360> I'm<00:01:06.510> going<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.900> immediately

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
increase and so I'm going to immediately

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.039 
increase and so I'm going to immediately
need<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.920> go<00:01:08.100> into<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.430> decrease<00:01:09.030> here<00:01:09.420> that

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
need to go into a decrease here that

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.200 
need to go into a decrease here that
doesn't<00:01:10.350> happen<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.740> every<00:01:11.070> pattern<00:01:11.310> but<00:01:12.090> in

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
doesn't happen in every pattern but in

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.140 
doesn't happen in every pattern but in
this<00:01:12.420> yarn<00:01:12.720> over<00:01:13.020> pattern<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.799> does<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.790> I've

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
this yarn over pattern it does so I've

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.780 
this yarn over pattern it does so I've
brought<00:01:15.570> my<00:01:15.750> yarn<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.170> front<00:01:16.500> I'm<00:01:16.860> going

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
brought my yarn to the front I'm going

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.030 
brought my yarn to the front I'm going
to<00:01:17.939> stick<00:01:18.270> my<00:01:18.509> needle<00:01:18.570> through<00:01:19.140> both<00:01:19.680> stitches

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
to stick my needle through both stitches

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.850 
to stick my needle through both stitches
making<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.060> knit<00:01:21.360> two<00:01:21.540> together<00:01:21.780> decrease<00:01:22.590> and

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
making a knit two together decrease and

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.780 
making a knit two together decrease and
then<00:01:23.790> bring<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.630> yarn<00:01:24.810> around<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.740> knit<00:01:26.520> one

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
then bring the yarn around and knit one

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.870 
then bring the yarn around and knit one
stitch<00:01:27.890> so<00:01:28.890> here<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.220> can<00:01:29.369> see<00:01:29.610> on<00:01:29.790> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
stitch so here you can see on the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.330 
stitch so here you can see on the
needles<00:01:30.210> I've<00:01:30.390> got<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.810> yarn<00:01:31.079> floating<00:01:31.979> over

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
needles I've got the yarn floating over

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.069 
needles I've got the yarn floating over
the<00:01:32.369> needle<00:01:32.729> here<00:01:33.060> just<00:01:33.630> going<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.900> make<00:01:34.049> a

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
the needle here just going to make a

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.289 
the needle here just going to make a
hole<00:01:34.409> but<00:01:35.100> it's<00:01:35.220> not<00:01:35.400> complete<00:01:35.820> until<00:01:36.150> I've

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
hole but it's not complete until I've

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.240 
hole but it's not complete until I've
pearled<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.840> on<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.110> back<00:01:37.320> because<00:01:37.770> these

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
pearled it on the back because these

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.800 
pearled it on the back because these
yarn<00:01:38.579> overs<00:01:38.850> are<00:01:39.000> happening<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:39.570> a

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
yarn overs are happening on a

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.770 
yarn overs are happening on a
stockinette<00:01:40.799> sample<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:42.090> now<00:01:42.270> I'm<00:01:42.509> going<00:01:42.720> to

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
stockinette sample so now I'm going to

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.460 
stockinette sample so now I'm going to
knit<00:01:43.020> six<00:01:44.000> one<00:01:45.000> two

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
knit six one two

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:56.460 
knit six one two
three<00:01:48.540> four<00:01:49.540> five<00:01:50.910> six<00:01:53.010> and<00:01:54.900> insert<00:01:55.900> my<00:01:56.110> next

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
three four five six and insert my next

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.160 
three four five six and insert my next
yarn<00:01:56.710> over<00:01:57.010> which<00:01:58.000> should<00:01:58.240> line<00:01:58.450> up<00:01:58.480> directly

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
yarn over which should line up directly

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.750 
yarn over which should line up directly
with<00:01:59.290> that<00:01:59.440> one<00:01:59.740> from<00:01:59.980> the<00:02:00.100> last<00:02:00.310> row<00:02:00.550> where<00:02:00.730> I

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
with that one from the last row where I

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.680 
with that one from the last row where I
did<00:02:00.940> two<00:02:01.180> and<00:02:01.210> then<00:02:01.480> six<00:02:01.720> there<00:02:02.530> it<00:02:02.650> is<00:02:02.770> so<00:02:03.690> yarn
