fashion now so we're thinking out into
the<00:00:20.670> future<00:00:20.880> you<00:00:21.180> know<00:00:21.300> what<00:00:21.539> what<00:00:22.140> would<00:00:22.260> be

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
the future you know what what would be

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.679 
the future you know what what would be
wonderful<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.890> have<00:00:23.130> in<00:00:23.519> five<00:00:23.699> years<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.029> we

wonderful to have in five years and we

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.769 
wonderful to have in five years and we
try<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.840> make<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.080> today<00:00:25.640> so<00:00:26.640> we<00:00:26.910> add<00:00:27.119> some<00:00:27.570> new

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
try to make it today so we add some new

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.470 
try to make it today so we add some new
technologies<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.500> innovation<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.730> textiles

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
technologies and innovation to textiles

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.359 
technologies and innovation to textiles
and<00:00:30.720> make<00:00:31.140> something<00:00:31.619> special<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.219> magical

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
and make something special and magical

and make something special and magical
have<00:00:33.059> been<00:00:33.270> within<00:00:33.510> close<00:00:44.390> this<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.570> sort<00:00:45.780> of

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
have been within close this is sort of

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.959 
have been within close this is sort of
like<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.820> electronics<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:48.420> know<00:00:49.969> debugging

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
like the electronics you know debugging

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.520 
like the electronics you know debugging
and<00:00:51.090> assembly<00:00:51.539> discs<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.930> obviously<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.440> not

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
and assembly discs this obviously is not

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.470 
and assembly discs this obviously is not
a<00:00:52.590> wearable<00:00:52.920> technology<00:00:53.550> but<00:00:53.699> sometimes<00:00:54.329> we

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
a wearable technology but sometimes we

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.720 
a wearable technology but sometimes we
get<00:00:54.600> new<00:00:54.780> technology<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.410> we<00:00:55.620> have<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.579> have<00:00:56.699> a

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
get new technology and we have to have a

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.279 
get new technology and we have to have a
board<00:00:56.969> like<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.449> evaluate<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.170> then

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
board like this to evaluate it and then

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.590 
board like this to evaluate it and then
later<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.590> we<00:00:58.980> can<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.850> know<00:00:59.969> integrate<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.510> in

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
later on we can you know integrate it in

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.779 
later on we can you know integrate it in
something<00:01:00.809> much<00:01:01.079> smaller<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:02.010> can<00:01:02.219> become

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
something much smaller it can become

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.630 
something much smaller it can become
part<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.329> garment<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:05.070> when<00:01:05.250> we<00:01:05.369> first

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
part of the garment and when we first

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.660 
part of the garment and when we first
started<00:01:05.790> out<00:01:06.180> people<00:01:06.510> thought<00:01:06.689> we<00:01:06.869> were<00:01:06.900> crazy

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
started out people thought we were crazy

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.830 
started out people thought we were crazy
and<00:01:08.670> in<00:01:09.060> fact<00:01:09.240> when<00:01:09.390> we<00:01:09.540> would<00:01:09.659> try<00:01:09.750> to

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
and in fact when we would try to

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.870 
and in fact when we would try to
describe<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.500> concept<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:11.100> cute<00:01:11.369> circuit<00:01:11.760> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
describe the concept of cute circuit the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.950 
describe the concept of cute circuit the
type<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.060> fashion<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.600> we<00:01:12.630> were<00:01:12.780> producing

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
type of fashion that we were producing

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.800 
type of fashion that we were producing
they<00:01:13.830> didn't<00:01:14.100> understand<00:01:14.549> they<00:01:14.760> said<00:01:14.939> how<00:01:15.750> can

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
they didn't understand they said how can

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.080 
they didn't understand they said how can
technology<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.680> clothing<00:01:16.950> be<00:01:17.250> together<00:01:17.430> it

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
technology and clothing be together it

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.060 
technology and clothing be together it
doesn't<00:01:18.299> make<00:01:18.450> any<00:01:18.509> sense<00:01:18.869> well<00:01:19.500> primarily

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
doesn't make any sense well primarily

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.010 
doesn't make any sense well primarily
because<00:01:20.430> there's<00:01:20.700> no<00:01:20.850> there's<00:01:21.630> no<00:01:21.689> metaphor

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
because there's no there's no metaphor

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.570 
because there's no there's no metaphor
there's<00:01:22.350> no<00:01:22.439> paradigm<00:01:22.860> for<00:01:23.130> this<00:01:23.280> sort<00:01:23.490> of

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
there's no paradigm for this sort of

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.480 
there's no paradigm for this sort of
thing<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:24.380> in<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.500> world<00:01:25.710> we<00:01:25.979> were<00:01:26.070> making

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
thing to in the world we were making

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.740 
thing to in the world we were making
something<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.790> was<00:01:26.880> entirely<00:01:27.180> new<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.689> it

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
something that was entirely new so it

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.050 
something that was entirely new so it
didn't<00:01:27.960> fit<00:01:28.170> any<00:01:28.350> predetermined<00:01:29.220> category

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
didn't fit any predetermined category

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:41.530 
didn't fit any predetermined category
that<00:01:30.240> they<00:01:30.390> could<00:01:30.540> sort<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:30.960> slot<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.350> into

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.940 

gradually<00:01:42.540> as<00:01:42.690> we<00:01:42.900> started<00:01:43.260> to<00:01:43.320> develop<00:01:43.620> more

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
gradually as we started to develop more

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.130 
gradually as we started to develop more
and<00:01:44.160> more<00:01:44.370> pieces<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:44.940> the<00:01:45.030> collection<00:01:45.150> they

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
and more pieces in the collection they

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.750 
and more pieces in the collection they
started<00:01:46.410> to<00:01:46.500> understand<00:01:46.890> ah<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.550> pretty

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
started to understand ah this is pretty

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.820 
started to understand ah this is pretty
cool<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:48.330> is<00:01:48.480> really<00:01:48.630> interesting<00:01:49.260> it's<00:01:49.590> an

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
cool this is really interesting it's an

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.520 
cool this is really interesting it's an
it's<00:01:50.010> a<00:01:50.100> new<00:01:50.280> approach<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.670> fashion<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.530> that

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
it's a new approach to fashion and that

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.980 
it's a new approach to fashion and that
it<00:01:53.520> was<00:01:53.730> a<00:01:53.760> long<00:01:54.000> battle<00:01:54.270> but<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.630> think<00:01:54.870> we're

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
it was a long battle but I think we're

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.450 
it was a long battle but I think we're
starting<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.380> win<00:01:55.560> now<00:01:55.800> because<00:01:56.100> people<00:01:56.370> are

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
starting to win now because people are

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.830 
starting to win now because people are
getting<00:01:56.610> very<00:01:56.730> excited<00:01:57.000> about<00:01:57.480> the<00:01:57.630> sort<00:01:57.810> of

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
getting very excited about the sort of

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.260 
getting very excited about the sort of
things<00:01:58.050> we're<00:01:58.230> designing<00:01:58.470> and<00:01:59.340> this<00:02:00.030> one<00:02:00.180> is

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
things we're designing and this one is

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.660 
things we're designing and this one is
one<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.660> latest<00:02:00.870> like<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.590> prototype<00:02:02.370> sub

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
one of the latest like a prototype sub

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.820 
one of the latest like a prototype sub
hug<00:02:02.880> shirt<00:02:03.150> and<00:02:03.510> basically<00:02:03.900> the<00:02:04.080> hug<00:02:04.260> shirt<00:02:04.530> is

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
hug shirt and basically the hug shirt is

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.620 
hug shirt and basically the hug shirt is
a<00:02:04.860> t-shirt<00:02:05.400> that<00:02:05.430> lets<00:02:05.730> you<00:02:05.820> send<00:02:06.000> hugs<00:02:06.330> over

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
a t-shirt that lets you send hugs over

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.560 
a t-shirt that lets you send hugs over
distance<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:08.070> you<00:02:08.459> put<00:02:08.610> on<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.850> shirt<00:02:09.119> you

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
distance so you put on the shirt you

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.810 
distance so you put on the shirt you
give<00:02:09.720> yourself<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:10.170> squeeze<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.800> sensors<00:02:11.610> in

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
give yourself a squeeze and sensors in

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.850 
give yourself a squeeze and sensors in
these<00:02:11.970> areas<00:02:12.180> on<00:02:12.570> the<00:02:12.720> fabric<00:02:12.900> capture<00:02:13.560> where

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
these areas on the fabric capture where

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.920 
these areas on the fabric capture where
you're<00:02:14.010> touching<00:02:14.250> how<00:02:15.060> strong<00:02:15.420> your<00:02:15.540> touching

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
you're touching how strong your touching

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.170 
you're touching how strong your touching
for<00:02:16.200> how<00:02:16.410> long<00:02:16.590> time<00:02:16.890> all<00:02:17.370> this<00:02:17.640> data<00:02:17.850> goes

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
for how long time all this data goes
