00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 let's see how we can create this 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.580
 effect of light leaks or light leaks in 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.649
 if you have seen the term in 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.420
 English but we will be working 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.519
 using lightroom instead of 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.200
 photoshop because lightroom loves us very much 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.000
 and it allows us to do this faster than 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.350
 the bottle 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.510
 then the first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.640
 to be select the original photo and we 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.080
 we go to the developing part and what 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.090
 we're going to be doing is we're going to 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.369
 be working with the graduated filter 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.170
 what is this incognito of here you can 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.650
 to be accessing him by poking him there 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.540
 by clicking on it or pressing the m key 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.600
 then we are going to create a filter of this 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.460
 side for example and what we're going to do 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.500
 is going to be raise the exposure pretty 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.469
 so you can see where it's going to be 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.239
 the effect so I'm going to put it 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.300
 here more or less you can be playing 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.070
 also with the width here of the filter and 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.590
 that what he's going to be doing is going to be 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.899
 how the gradient is being noticed in the 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.430
 part that is affecting the image by 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.579
 example there is more width then the 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.320
 degraded is softer and if I 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.239
 I do very little then then you get there 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.619
 to see almost a line in the change that is 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.360
 is doing this is going to depend 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.120
 really of your tastes 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.010
 there is not a formula out there so let's go 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.870
 to leave it there and now we're going to put it in 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.820
 temperature everything yellow and everything 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.830
 green really you are going to be able to be 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.600
 playing with this later with more calm 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.760
 is depending on the colors that you 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.490
 want to get for now I know the 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.550
 I'll leave there then depending on 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.050
 the photo and the look that you already have 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.940
 it may be that with just one filter already 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.040
 you are able to get the effect that 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.530
 you want however I'm going to put 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.140
 another one but first I will remember 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.420
 of the settings that I have here because 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.220
 at the time that we get this 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.140
 second filter what we are going to do is 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.320
 that we are going to be canceling the effect 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.270
 from the first to the point where I 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.009
 want right now you're going to see how is this 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:55.380
 clearer then I had 1.51 1.66 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.160
 here in the first filter so here you 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.350
 I will put just the opposite less 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.119
 1.66 and instead of being in all the 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.759
 yellow end I'm going to go to the 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.330
 blue and instead of the green end towards 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.220
 the purple then this look there is 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.140
 what I told you the second filter 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.870
 is canceling the action 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.430
 the first filter creating that strip there from 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.370
 light that is what we want 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.130
 have as a light leak precisely 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.260
 so if I turn on and off these 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.900
 filters look here on the corner 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.800
 top right i have the colors 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.020
 originals of my photo and there it was already 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.030
 start creating this leak effect 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.770
 of light now remember that when you put 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.600
 the first and the second filter do not have 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.250
 that be parallel between them you 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.530
 you can be playing there with the 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.080
 inclinations because the light leaks do not 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.480
 they were always symmetrical or even if 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.790
 you all start crossing then 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.400
 you can also start to find 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.530
 interesting things in the images 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.709
 like here in this part that is already 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.510
 altering towards the purple color but it's going 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.250
 to really depend on your image of the 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.800
 colors that you already have and so on 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.570
 etcetera then once it is already 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.400
 this we can continue with the processing 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.370
 going here to the part of dividing 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.769
 tones and we're going to choose, I'm not going to 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.019
 put here nothing more quickly these 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.780
 colors you can be selecting 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.100
 the ones you want and be playing with more 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.080
 calm with them 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.870
 only here I want to be giving 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.130
 another tonality to the image to try 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.440
 of 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.080
 get a little more is the look that 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.280
 they usually have leaking photos 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.800
 of light 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.500
 and another thing that you can be doing 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.390
 is to be working here on the curve of 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.370
 shades of fact I like more there 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.350
 because you can be working for 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.090
 channels and then you can be 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.560
 altering in a more precise way 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:51.600
 all the colors of your of your image and 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.910
 we can also do for example here 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.310
 a contrast cut that normally 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.920
 it is very much so associated with those leaks 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.620
 of light that lack of contrast as a type 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.980
 a little vintage then you can already 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.110
 be driving also there and then 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.300
 I do not know anything else it 's a matter of you 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.070
 you're going to put playing with everyone 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.070
 those settings until you can find 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.109
 the look that you want in any 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.120
 moment thanks to lightroom you can 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.540
 be returning to the filter part 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.590
 of tier to graduate filter forgiveness and 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.560
 you select 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.510
 the points that you had already put in 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.370
 case you want to be changing 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.680
 something out there that you did not like the 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.479
 better and you want to make it more aggressive or 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.120
 you want to make it softer then 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:38.160
 you can be changing the values ​​here 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.500
 Remember that if you keep a point 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.350
 you have to be altering the other to 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.570
 can be canceling the effect on the 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.180
 rest of the image less clear than you 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:51.389
 can you want to be having 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.760
 this kind of flaws in there that you notice 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:56.000
 very different colors from one side to 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.000
 other 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.390
 another option that you can be doing 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.480
 for example here I used two filters 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:07.420
 but I also used the brush to create 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.880
 this strip here then you can 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:13.030
 to be having I do not know you already have some 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:16.900
 retouch there done for example that in 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:19.180
 this case I used three filter points 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.860
 of gradient to achieve this look and 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.230
 the best and I want to put something else 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.180
 so I can go to the brush you can 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.070
 be playing here with the options of 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.810
 fade and the size of the brush 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.870
 remember that fade is like the 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:34.180
 hardness of your brush and more or less like 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.070
 we did it here with these stripes that 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.020
 we were driving up the 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.510
 exhibition we will also do it with 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.120
 the brush and then I can do for 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.670
 example a line out there or crossing 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.560
 next to the image I know that you are 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.540
 you can be playing there with that option 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.090
 to the best and one is the biggest one could 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.790
 be more interesting there is 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.860
 and again I can be playing here 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.230
 for example with light variations or 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.380
 those of color to be getting 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:03.669
 other things there more interesting and nothing 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.889
 more is a matter of you being 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:08.560
 practice and practice with your photos of 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:10.960
 according to what you want to have because 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.850
 times with a single gradient you can 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.550
 already having the effects that 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.440
 you want or sometimes like in this picture I 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.540
 What I did was put four filters each 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.760
 one with different colors and different 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.070
 light contrast issues things for 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.470
 the style until I found some look 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.660
 that I liked but also I was 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.490
 working here on the right side in the 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.370
 tone curve in each of the 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.889
 channels to be altering a bit more 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:38.290
 the colors of my image then 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:40.180
 simply the joke is that you get to 

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:42.580
 play with all those options that you 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.229
 I just taught to be able to get what 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.370
 whatever you want or whatever 

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:47.370
 you are looking for
