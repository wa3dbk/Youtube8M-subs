00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
train and he lifts them up I guess with

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.680 
train and he lifts them up I guess with
this<00:03:20.930> telegraphic<00:03:21.590> mind<00:03:21.860> and<00:03:22.390> sends<00:03:23.390> them<00:03:23.510> to

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
this telegraphic mind and sends them to

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.300 
this telegraphic mind and sends them to
the<00:03:23.780> cops<00:03:23.989> and<00:03:24.400> he's<00:03:25.400> late<00:03:25.640> to<00:03:25.880> cook<00:03:26.060> dinner

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
the cops and he's late to cook dinner

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.220 
the cops and he's late to cook dinner
and<00:03:28.310> then<00:03:29.060> at<00:03:29.269> the<00:03:29.420> end<00:03:29.450> he<00:03:29.690> says<00:03:29.900> call<00:03:30.110> me

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230

and then at the end he says call me
chakra<00:03:30.739> that's<00:03:31.489> the<00:03:31.850> end

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
chakra that's the end

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.500 
chakra that's the end
then<00:03:33.170> in<00:03:33.470> afterward<00:03:34.250> I<00:03:34.610> guess<00:03:35.000> as<00:03:35.150> a<00:03:35.180> bunch<00:03:35.390> of

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510

then in afterward I guess as a bunch of
information<00:03:35.750> and<00:03:37.090> behind<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.209> scenes<00:03:38.420> of<00:03:38.540> how
