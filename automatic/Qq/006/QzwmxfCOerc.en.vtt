very knowledgeable about nutrition and

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.010 
very knowledgeable about nutrition and
weight<00:04:37.640> loss<00:04:37.820> and<00:04:38.180> i<00:04:38.300> was<00:04:38.390> talking<00:04:38.660> about<00:04:38.720> it

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
weight loss and i was talking about it

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.450 
weight loss and i was talking about it
she<00:04:39.230> was<00:04:39.350> like<00:04:39.410> you<00:04:39.740> know<00:04:40.840> um<00:04:41.840> a<00:04:42.410> lot<00:04:43.160> of<00:04:43.280> things

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
she was like you know um a lot of things

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.980 
she was like you know um a lot of things
that<00:04:43.669> was<00:04:43.790> two<00:04:43.970> and<00:04:44.090> a<00:04:44.150> half<00:04:44.330> pounds<00:04:44.690> of<00:04:44.780> fat

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
that was two and a half pounds of fat

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.110 
that was two and a half pounds of fat
because<00:04:45.770> you<00:04:46.100> only<00:04:46.250> had<00:04:46.460> a<00:04:46.490> few<00:04:46.550> slices<00:04:46.910> of

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
because you only had a few slices of

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.990 
because you only had a few slices of
pizza<00:04:47.360> and<00:04:48.250> when<00:04:49.250> I<00:04:49.280> thought<00:04:49.520> about<00:04:49.580> it<00:04:49.820> I

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
pizza and when I thought about it I

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.180 
pizza and when I thought about it I
thought<00:04:50.030> she's<00:04:50.479> right<00:04:50.780> there's<00:04:51.290> only<00:04:51.440> I<00:04:51.890> mean

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
thought she's right there's only I mean

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
thought she's right there's only I mean
there's<00:04:52.550> 3,000<00:04:53.479> calories<00:04:53.660> in<00:04:54.050> a<00:04:54.110> pound<00:04:54.790> so<00:04:55.790> in

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
there's 3,000 calories in a pound so in

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.390 
there's 3,000 calories in a pound so in
order<00:04:56.419> to<00:04:56.660> gain<00:04:56.930> two<00:04:57.260> and<00:04:57.380> a<00:04:57.440> half<00:04:57.620> pounds<00:04:58.190> I

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
order to gain two and a half pounds I

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.340 
order to gain two and a half pounds I
would<00:04:58.580> have<00:04:58.790> had<00:04:58.940> to<00:04:59.090> consume<00:05:01.930> 9,000<00:05:02.930> calories

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
would have had to consume 9,000 calories

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.530 
would have had to consume 9,000 calories
and<00:05:03.590> I<00:05:03.650> know<00:05:03.710> there<00:05:04.220> weren't<00:05:04.400> nine<00:05:05.150> thousand

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
and I know there weren't nine thousand

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.900 
and I know there weren't nine thousand
calories<00:05:06.669> those<00:05:07.669> cookies<00:05:08.660> in<00:05:08.870> the<00:05:09.140> cookie<00:05:09.910> so

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
calories those cookies in the cookie so

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.980 
calories those cookies in the cookie so
she<00:05:10.970> was<00:05:11.419> like<00:05:11.600> what<00:05:11.780> it<00:05:11.870> probably<00:05:12.290> is<00:05:12.440> is

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
she was like what it probably is is

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.750 
she was like what it probably is is
water<00:05:14.990> weight<00:05:15.169> your<00:05:15.440> water<00:05:15.650> is<00:05:15.860> your<00:05:16.160> father's

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
water weight your water is your father's

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.130 
water weight your water is your father's
probably<00:05:16.940> just<00:05:17.180> holding<00:05:17.570> on<00:05:17.690> to<00:05:17.810> the<00:05:17.930> water

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.140 
probably just holding on to the water

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.219 
probably just holding on to the water
that<00:05:18.590> you're<00:05:18.919> drinking<00:05:19.000> because<00:05:20.000> of<00:05:20.630> all<00:05:21.080> the

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229 
that you're drinking because of all the

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:24.100 
that you're drinking because of all the
salt<00:05:21.530> that<00:05:21.740> you<00:05:21.860> had<00:05:22.040> in<00:05:22.160> the<00:05:22.190> pizza<00:05:22.990> and<00:05:23.990> that

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
salt that you had in the pizza and that

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.500 
salt that you had in the pizza and that
makes<00:05:24.320> sense<00:05:24.590> so<00:05:25.010> what<00:05:25.280> I<00:05:25.340> deal<00:05:25.580> in<00:05:25.610> Sunday<00:05:26.120> was

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
makes sense so what I deal in Sunday was

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.950 
makes sense so what I deal in Sunday was
I<00:05:28.120> continue<00:05:29.120> to<00:05:29.240> drink<00:05:29.419> lots<00:05:29.540> of<00:05:29.690> water

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
I continue to drink lots of water

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.219 
I continue to drink lots of water
always<00:05:30.350> drink<00:05:30.710> a<00:05:30.950> lot<00:05:31.310> of<00:05:31.340> water<00:05:31.580> about<00:05:32.240> 10<00:05:33.140> to

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
always drink a lot of water about 10 to

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:37.420 
always drink a lot of water about 10 to
12<00:05:33.440> glasses<00:05:33.590> a<00:05:33.950> day<00:05:34.270> but<00:05:35.270> I<00:05:35.750> basically<00:05:36.590> made<00:05:37.250> it

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
12 glasses a day but I basically made it

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.730 
12 glasses a day but I basically made it
a<00:05:37.520> point<00:05:37.760> to<00:05:38.000> not<00:05:38.120> have<00:05:38.360> any<00:05:38.660> salt<00:05:39.140> all<00:05:39.470> day

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
a point to not have any salt all day

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.610 
a point to not have any salt all day
long<00:05:39.919> so<00:05:40.520> I<00:05:40.900> usually<00:05:41.900> put<00:05:42.110> salt<00:05:42.440> on<00:05:42.590> my

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
long so I usually put salt on my

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.410 
long so I usually put salt on my
scrambled

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
scrambled

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.270 
scrambled
no<00:05:43.840> salt<00:05:44.140> my<00:05:44.290> scrambled<00:05:44.650> eggs<00:05:44.800> I<00:05:45.040> watched

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
no salt my scrambled eggs I watched

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.190 
no salt my scrambled eggs I watched
everything<00:05:45.670> like<00:05:46.000> I<00:05:46.090> made<00:05:46.330> everything<00:05:46.870> I<00:05:46.990> ate

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
everything like I made everything I ate

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.320 
everything like I made everything I ate
and<00:05:47.800> I<00:05:47.860> made<00:05:48.040> sure<00:05:48.220> there<00:05:48.400> was<00:05:48.460> no<00:05:48.790> salt<00:05:49.120> on<00:05:49.300> it

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
and I made sure there was no salt on it

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.840 
and I made sure there was no salt on it
and<00:05:51.810> so<00:05:52.810> anyway<00:05:53.110> I<00:05:53.980> weighed<00:05:54.370> myself<00:05:54.400> this

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:54.850 
and so anyway I weighed myself this

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.010 
and so anyway I weighed myself this
morning<00:05:55.120> and<00:05:56.100> as<00:05:57.100> a<00:05:57.160> result<00:05:57.610> she<00:05:58.150> was<00:05:58.180> right<00:05:58.600> I

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
morning and as a result she was right I

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.750 
morning and as a result she was right I
think<00:05:59.290> it<00:05:59.380> was<00:05:59.590> the<00:05:59.770> water<00:05:59.920> weeks<00:06:00.160> after

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
think it was the water weeks after

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.440 
think it was the water weeks after
having<00:06:00.880> no<00:06:01.120> salt<00:06:01.480> yesterday<00:06:02.730> this<00:06:03.730> morning<00:06:03.790> I

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:04.450 
having no salt yesterday this morning I

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:09.090 
having no salt yesterday this morning I

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
waited 1:27 and I know that's not as low

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.960 
waited 1:27 and I know that's not as low
as<00:06:09.340> what<00:06:09.490> I<00:06:09.520> weighed<00:06:09.880> on<00:06:11.760> Saturday<00:06:12.760> when<00:06:12.940> I
