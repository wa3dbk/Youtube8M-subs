00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
world wall around the world edge will be

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.130 
world wall around the world edge will be
overwritten<00:01:17.430> by<00:01:17.610> newly<00:01:18.060> generated<00:01:18.210> tiles<00:01:18.840> to

overwritten by newly generated tiles to

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.780 
overwritten by newly generated tiles to
make<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.409> world<00:01:19.439> size<00:01:19.860> increase<00:01:20.310> seamless

make the world size increase seamless

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.580 
make the world size increase seamless
when<00:01:21.180> disabled<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.840> world<00:01:22.020> size<00:01:22.170> increase

when disabled the world size increase

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.240

will leave all original tiles intact so
what<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.520> means<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:26.909> every<00:01:27.299> block<00:01:27.720> that's

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
what this means is every block that's

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.520 
what this means is every block that's
within<00:01:28.439> thirty<00:01:28.799> two<00:01:28.950> edges<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:30.150> map<00:01:30.530> so

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
override and go into new field right now

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.899 
override and go into new field right now
everything<00:01:37.740> within<00:01:37.920> thirty<00:01:38.250> two<00:01:38.400> blocks<00:01:38.729> of

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
the original edge of the map will be

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.590 
the original edge of the map will be
gone<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.579> will<00:01:41.670> kind<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:41.939> like<00:01:42.119> overwrite<00:01:42.570> that

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
gone it will kind of like overwrite that

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.109 
gone it will kind of like overwrite that
and<00:01:43.020> make<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.200> into<00:01:43.439> thin<00:01:43.740> air<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.759> I'm<00:01:45.000> gonna

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
and make it into thin air so I'm gonna

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.429 
and make it into thin air so I'm gonna
leave<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.329> check<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:45.869> if<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.079> have<00:01:46.200> anything

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
leave that check so if you have anything

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.109 
leave that check so if you have anything
close<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.100> edge<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.430> map<00:01:47.640> like<00:01:47.909> within

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
close to the edge of the map like within

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.840 
close to the edge of the map like within
thirty<00:01:48.600> two<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.140> those<00:01:49.200> blocks<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.860> would<00:01:50.820> just

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
thirty two of those blocks I would just

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.490 
thirty two of those blocks I would just
say<00:01:51.090> leave<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.630> off<00:01:51.810> don't<00:01:52.140> click<00:01:52.439> it

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
say leave this off don't click it

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.830 
say leave this off don't click it
because<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.310> did<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:53.939> with<00:01:54.180> my<00:01:54.360> tutorial

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
because I did this with my tutorial

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.510 
because I did this with my tutorial
world<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.229> one<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.649> my<00:01:55.770> main<00:01:55.979> shins<00:01:56.159> was<00:01:56.310> right

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
world and one of my main shins was right

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.109 
world and one of my main shins was right
next<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.880> map<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:58.430> basically<00:01:59.430> got<00:01:59.969> rid

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
next to the map and it basically got rid

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.730 
next to the map and it basically got rid
of<00:02:00.149> some<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.329> my<00:02:00.450> house<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:01.170> I'm<00:02:01.439> gonna<00:02:01.560> leave

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
of some of my house so I'm gonna leave

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.399 
of some of my house so I'm gonna leave
it<00:02:01.860> unchecked<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.520> we're<00:02:02.880> going<00:02:03.210> to

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
it unchecked and we're going to

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.870 
it unchecked and we're going to
everything<00:02:04.409> looks<00:02:04.740> right<00:02:04.979> we're<00:02:05.640> going<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.790> go

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
everything looks right we're going to go

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.930 
everything looks right we're going to go
load<00:02:06.119> now<00:02:06.420> let's<00:02:06.659> test<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:07.079> out<00:02:07.700> so<00:02:08.700> this<00:02:08.849> is

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
load now let's test this out so this is

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.279 
load now let's test this out so this is
the<00:02:09.000> first<00:02:09.209> time<00:02:09.360> I've<00:02:09.509> gone<00:02:09.629> on<00:02:09.720> new<00:02:09.989> field

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
the first time I've gone on new field

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.309 
the first time I've gone on new field
now<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:10.950> did<00:02:11.160> try<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.580> make<00:02:11.910> my<00:02:12.420> tutorial

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
now I did try to make my tutorial

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.130 
now I did try to make my tutorial
at<00:02:13.590> one<00:02:13.799> point<00:02:14.390> because<00:02:15.390> say<00:02:15.689> you<00:02:15.749> don't<00:02:15.989> like

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
at one point because say you don't like

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.110 
at one point because say you don't like
what<00:02:16.469> you<00:02:16.530> did<00:02:16.829> so<00:02:17.549> that's<00:02:17.730> one<00:02:17.909> great<00:02:18.060> thing

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
what you did so that's one great thing

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.209 
what you did so that's one great thing
so<00:02:18.540> if<00:02:18.749> I<00:02:18.870> did<00:02:19.049> put<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.379> seamless<00:02:19.799> world<00:02:20.010> on

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:20.219 
so if I did put that seamless world on

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:23.000 
so if I did put that seamless world on
or<00:02:20.489> whatever<00:02:20.700> what<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.569> would<00:02:21.659> do<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:22.049> it<00:02:22.139> will

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
or whatever what it would do is it will

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.429 
or whatever what it would do is it will
cut<00:02:23.579> off<00:02:23.609> some<00:02:23.819> of<00:02:23.879> the<00:02:23.969> map<00:02:24.090> like<00:02:24.269> I<00:02:24.389> said<00:02:24.689> but

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:25.439 
cut off some of the map like I said but

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.110 
cut off some of the map like I said but
it<00:02:25.650> doesn't<00:02:25.980> mean<00:02:26.069> you<00:02:26.249> have<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.489> save<00:02:26.819> it<00:02:26.999> so

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
it doesn't mean you have to save it so

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.629 
it doesn't mean you have to save it so
that's<00:02:27.299> something<00:02:27.420> actually<00:02:27.629> really<00:02:28.319> cool<00:02:28.639> so

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:29.639 
that's something actually really cool so

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:33.349 
that's something actually really cool so
here<00:02:30.299> is<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.900> original<00:02:31.189> you<00:02:32.189> need<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.400> map<00:02:32.670> the

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.359 
here is the original you need a map the

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:35.059 
here is the original you need a map the
original<00:02:33.810> end<00:02:33.959> of<00:02:34.139> the<00:02:34.260> map<00:02:34.439> on<00:02:34.590> new<00:02:34.799> field

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
original end of the map on new field

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.059 
original end of the map on new field
city<00:02:35.280> right<00:02:35.819> over<00:02:36.030> here<00:02:36.299> and<00:02:36.889> waiting<00:02:37.889> for<00:02:37.980> the

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
city right over here and waiting for the

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.679 
city right over here and waiting for the
map<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.400> load<00:02:38.519> em<00:02:39.349> so<00:02:40.349> now<00:02:40.829> we<00:02:41.400> can<00:02:41.609> go<00:02:41.849> past<00:02:42.389> the

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
map to load em so now we can go past the

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:45.949 
map to load em so now we can go past the
map<00:02:42.930> isn't<00:02:43.439> that<00:02:43.499> so<00:02:43.799> awesome<00:02:44.310> so<00:02:45.209> again<00:02:45.629> this

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
map isn't that so awesome so again this

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.599 
map isn't that so awesome so again this
was<00:02:46.169> right<00:02:46.409> next<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.769> map<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.159> if<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.370> turn

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
was right next to the map so if I turn

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:49.970 
was right next to the map so if I turn
that<00:02:47.760> seamless<00:02:48.209> thing<00:02:48.419> on<00:02:48.650> that's<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.769> most

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
that seamless thing on that's the most

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.220 
that seamless thing on that's the most
option<00:02:50.430> it<00:02:50.609> would<00:02:50.730> cut<00:02:50.909> off<00:02:50.939> the<00:02:51.299> 32<00:02:51.689> blocks<00:02:51.930> so

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
option it would cut off the 32 blocks so

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.839 
option it would cut off the 32 blocks so
probably<00:02:52.590> all<00:02:52.799> the<00:02:52.919> way<00:02:52.980> up<00:02:53.159> to<00:02:53.189> right<00:02:53.459> around

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
probably all the way up to right around

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.119 
probably all the way up to right around
here<00:02:54.329> now<00:02:55.260> like<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:55.769> was<00:02:55.799> saying<00:02:55.889> earlier

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
here now like I was saying earlier

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.429 
here now like I was saying earlier
though<00:02:56.609> say<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.239> press<00:02:57.959> that<00:02:57.989> by<00:02:58.230> accident

00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:58.439 
though say you press that by accident

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.179 
though say you press that by accident
just<00:02:59.069> undo<00:02:59.519> you<00:02:59.669> undo<00:03:00.299> it<00:03:00.329> by<00:03:00.629> unsaved<00:03:01.189> encoder

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:02.189 
just undo you undo it by unsaved encoder

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:04.099 
just undo you undo it by unsaved encoder
world<00:03:02.370> before<00:03:02.790> you<00:03:02.879> exit<00:03:03.269> that<00:03:03.480> would<00:03:03.930> be<00:03:03.989> the

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
world before you exit that would be the

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.439 
world before you exit that would be the
best<00:03:04.290> way<00:03:04.409> make<00:03:04.829> sure<00:03:04.859> autosave<00:03:05.669> is<00:03:05.879> disabled

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:06.449 
best way make sure autosave is disabled

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:09.140 
best way make sure autosave is disabled
and<00:03:06.769> that's<00:03:07.769> really<00:03:07.949> the<00:03:08.129> best<00:03:08.280> way<00:03:08.370> I<00:03:08.790> mean<00:03:09.120> I

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
and that's really the best way I mean I

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.759 
and that's really the best way I mean I
like<00:03:09.449> that<00:03:09.599> they<00:03:09.750> did<00:03:09.930> add<00:03:10.049> that<00:03:10.230> feature<00:03:10.409> to

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
like that they did add that feature to

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.140 
like that they did add that feature to
where<00:03:10.889> if<00:03:11.069> you<00:03:11.219> didn't<00:03:11.549> want<00:03:11.669> to<00:03:11.730> do<00:03:11.819> that<00:03:11.849> you

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
where if you didn't want to do that you

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.909 
where if you didn't want to do that you
can<00:03:12.299> go<00:03:12.419> back<00:03:12.599> and<00:03:12.659> kind<00:03:12.900> of<00:03:13.049> change<00:03:13.290> it<00:03:13.500> so<00:03:13.889> I

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:13.919 
can go back and kind of change it so I

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:16.220 
can go back and kind of change it so I
do<00:03:14.129> like<00:03:14.340> that<00:03:14.549> feature<00:03:14.730> now<00:03:15.659> I'm<00:03:15.810> not<00:03:15.989> sure

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
do like that feature now I'm not sure

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.830 
do like that feature now I'm not sure
after<00:03:16.709> you<00:03:16.829> change<00:03:17.069> the<00:03:17.310> world<00:03:17.579> sighs<00:03:17.879> so<00:03:18.689> say

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
after you change the world sighs so say
