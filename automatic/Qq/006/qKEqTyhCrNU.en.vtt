spot<00:01:41.549> on<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.030> map<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.420> can<00:01:42.450> see<00:01:42.720> right<00:01:42.930> here

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
spot on the map you can see right here

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.020 
spot on the map you can see right here
down<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.920> bottom<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.369> says<00:01:44.549> speak<00:01:44.790> with

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
there and that's not where it is so it's

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.920 
there and that's not where it is so it's
like<00:01:50.220> if<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.490> on<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.149> map<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.509> was<00:01:51.659> supposed<00:01:51.899> to

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
like if I on the map I was supposed to

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.749 
like if I on the map I was supposed to
be<00:01:52.049> right<00:01:52.320> here<00:01:52.649> see<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.040> that's<00:01:53.460> where<00:01:53.640> it's

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
be right here see it that's where it's

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.580 
be right here see it that's where it's
supposed<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.149> be<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.960> should<00:01:55.200> be<00:01:55.380> and

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
supposed to be and it should be and

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.719 
supposed to be and it should be and

tunnel there's no nothing and that was

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.959 
tunnel there's no nothing and that was
frustrating<00:01:58.649> me<00:01:58.860> they<00:01:59.310> nor<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.579> go<00:01:59.729> so<00:01:59.909> I'm

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
frustrating me they nor to go so I'm

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.730 
frustrating me they nor to go so I'm
running<00:02:00.119> around<00:02:00.299> bla<00:02:00.570> bla<00:02:00.689> bla<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.500> next

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
running around bla bla bla so the next

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.310 
running around bla bla bla so the next
best<00:02:01.890> thing<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.250> did<00:02:02.490> but<00:02:03.360> hopefully<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.170> can

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
best thing I did but hopefully you can

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.389 
best thing I did but hopefully you can
just<00:02:04.469> cut<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.740> out<00:02:04.799> for<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.040> guys<00:02:05.219> and

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
just cut that out for you guys and

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.080 
just cut that out for you guys and
that's<00:02:05.549> probably<00:02:05.790> why<00:02:05.909> you're<00:02:06.030> watching

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
that's probably why you're watching

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.730 
that's probably why you're watching
either<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.960> or<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.110> just<00:02:07.170> want<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.469> see<00:02:07.590> some

either that or you just want to see some

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.710 
either that or you just want to see some
dumb<00:02:07.860> guard<00:02:08.099> right<00:02:08.250> away<00:02:08.399> but<00:02:09.239> what<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.479> did

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
dumb guard right away but what I did

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.889 
dumb guard right away but what I did
right<00:02:09.869> away<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.200> a

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
right away is a

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.509 
right away is a
to<00:02:11.049> fix<00:02:11.290> this<00:02:11.470> as<00:02:11.650> I<00:02:11.739> was<00:02:11.950> just<00:02:12.010> looking<00:02:12.489> for

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
to fix this as I was just looking for

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.399 
to fix this as I was just looking for
the<00:02:12.700> icon<00:02:13.120> on<00:02:13.360> my<00:02:13.510> little<00:02:13.689> slider<00:02:14.019> bar<00:02:14.260> up

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:14.409 
the icon on my little slider bar up

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:16.229 
the icon on my little slider bar up
there<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:14.799> so<00:02:15.189> what<00:02:15.280> I<00:02:15.310> did<00:02:15.430> is<00:02:15.640> I<00:02:15.760> ran<00:02:15.939> down

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
there and so what I did is I ran down

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.789 
there and so what I did is I ran down
here<00:02:16.540> down<00:02:16.780> past<00:02:17.079> this<00:02:17.230> hill<00:02:17.409> you<00:02:17.560> go<00:02:17.680> either

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
here down past this hill you go either

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.100 
here down past this hill you go either
way<00:02:18.209> but<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.329> point<00:02:19.360> is<00:02:19.689> you<00:02:19.810> need<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:19.959> get

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
way but the point is you need to get

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.630 
way but the point is you need to get
down<00:02:20.260> there<00:02:20.319> and<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:20.739> see<00:02:20.950> this<00:02:21.069> beacon<00:02:21.340> right

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
down there and you see this beacon right

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.039 
down there and you see this beacon right
here<00:02:21.909> the<00:02:22.090> one<00:02:22.209> right<00:02:22.420> there<00:02:22.629> in<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.810> middle

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
here the one right there in the middle

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.610 
here the one right there in the middle
of<00:02:23.110> our<00:02:23.140> sword<00:02:23.470> in<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.620> middle<00:02:23.829> died<00:02:24.280> Fox<00:02:25.620> you

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
of our sword in the middle died Fox you

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.140 
of our sword in the middle died Fox you
need<00:02:26.799> to<00:02:26.950> go<00:02:27.129> towards<00:02:27.430> that<00:02:27.609> and<00:02:27.790> that's<00:02:27.939> how<00:02:28.030> I

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
need to go towards that and that's how I

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.759 
need to go towards that and that's how I
ended<00:02:28.269> up<00:02:28.599> figuring<00:02:28.810> it<00:02:29.140> out<00:02:29.200> after<00:02:29.530> a<00:02:29.560> while

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
ended up figuring it out after a while

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.410 
ended up figuring it out after a while
as<00:02:30.040> you<00:02:30.340> see<00:02:30.579> how<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:30.790> gets<00:02:30.879> a<00:02:31.030> little<00:02:31.120> bigger

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
as you see how it gets a little bigger

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.270 
as you see how it gets a little bigger
that<00:02:31.689> means<00:02:32.140> you're<00:02:32.290> getting<00:02:32.470> close<00:02:32.560> to<00:02:32.950> it<00:02:33.069> so

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
that means you're getting close to it so

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.470 
that means you're getting close to it so
you<00:02:33.370> just<00:02:33.400> need<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.700> run<00:02:33.849> over<00:02:33.909> there<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:34.359> it

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
you just need to run over there to it

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.789 
you just need to run over there to it
and<00:02:34.569> I'll<00:02:34.629> show<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:34.810> on<00:02:34.989> the<00:02:35.079> map<00:02:35.230> right<00:02:35.620> where

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
and I'll show you on the map right where

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.479 
and I'll show you on the map right where
it's<00:02:35.950> at<00:02:36.099> in<00:02:36.310> a<00:02:36.459> second<00:02:37.019> but<00:02:38.019> why<00:02:38.470> it's<00:02:39.040> not<00:02:39.250> at

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
it's at in a second but why it's not at

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.819 
it's at in a second but why it's not at
that<00:02:39.640> spot<00:02:39.939> other<00:02:40.209> well<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:41.049> reason<00:02:41.500> is<00:02:41.650> it's

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
that spot other well the reason is it's

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.250 
that spot other well the reason is it's
because<00:02:42.129> that<00:02:42.340> on<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.420> map<00:02:43.599> it's<00:02:43.840> showing<00:02:44.139> the

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
because that on the map it's showing the

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.470 
because that on the map it's showing the
other<00:02:44.379> side<00:02:44.650> of<00:02:44.799> this<00:02:44.889> tunnel<00:02:45.430> where<00:02:46.060> this

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
other side of this tunnel where this

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.750 
other side of this tunnel where this
isn't<00:02:46.720> really<00:02:46.959> on<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.319> normal<00:02:47.889> map<00:02:48.129> of<00:02:48.340> Skyrim

bolts so I don't know if you'll be able

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.750 
bolts so I don't know if you'll be able
to<00:03:35.109> get<00:03:35.260> like<00:03:35.409> you<00:03:35.470> know<00:03:35.620> every<00:03:36.010> bolt<00:03:36.310> stages

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.309 
to get like you know every bolt stages
bollocks<00:03:37.060> and<00:03:37.120> all<00:03:37.239> that<00:03:37.419> probably<00:03:37.959> because

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
bollocks and all that probably because

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.259 
bollocks and all that probably because
there's<00:03:38.470> different<00:03:38.769> arrows<00:03:38.919> so<00:03:39.250> I'm<00:03:39.849> assuming

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
there's different arrows so I'm assuming

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:41.729 
there's different arrows so I'm assuming
there's<00:03:40.449> different<00:03:40.780> ammo<00:03:41.169> is<00:03:41.319> for<00:03:41.530> the

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
there's different ammo is for the

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.039 
there's different ammo is for the
crossbow<00:03:42.150> so<00:03:43.150> that's<00:03:43.269> kind<00:03:43.540> of<00:03:43.599> cool<00:03:43.750> right

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
crossbow so that's kind of cool right

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.629 
crossbow so that's kind of cool right

probably should have cut some of this
part<00:04:20.669> out<00:04:20.789> but<00:04:21.539> the<00:04:21.690> crossbow<00:04:22.079> is<00:04:22.109> pretty<00:04:22.500> neat

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
what the bolts were were but I'm sure at

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.920
