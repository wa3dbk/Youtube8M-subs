my<00:01:05.970> opinion<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.299> released<00:01:06.570> ultimate<00:01:06.869> team

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
my opinion the released ultimate team

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.940 
my opinion the released ultimate team
too<00:01:07.170> early<00:01:07.409> they<00:01:07.530> should<00:01:07.680> have<00:01:07.770> done<00:01:07.860> what

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
too early they should have done what

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.010 
too early they should have done what
they<00:01:08.010> did<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.189> previous<00:01:08.340> using<00:01:09.299> release<00:01:09.869> it

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
they did in previous using release it

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.660 
they did in previous using release it
maybe<00:01:10.200> two<00:01:10.470> or<00:01:10.500> three<00:01:10.650> months<00:01:10.830> later<00:01:11.400> on

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
maybe two or three months later on

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.330 
maybe two or three months later on
because<00:01:12.049> it<00:01:13.049> keeps<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.560> game<00:01:13.710> going<00:01:13.920> but<00:01:14.189> you

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
because it keeps a game going but you

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.160 
because it keeps a game going but you
know<00:01:14.460> with<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.060> Euro<00:01:15.360> game<00:01:15.600> gonna<00:01:15.810> come<00:01:16.020> out

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
I'm not sure if they're doing your a

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.740 
I'm not sure if they're doing your a
game<00:01:17.520> they<00:01:17.640> did<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:17.850> New<00:01:17.970> Age<00:01:18.090> 2008<00:01:18.540> they<00:01:18.630> did

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
game they did in New Age 2008 they did

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.969 
game they did in New Age 2008 they did
the<00:01:18.810> world<00:01:18.960> cup<00:01:19.140> game<00:01:19.320> but<00:01:19.470> if<00:01:19.590> they're<00:01:19.740> making

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
the world cup game but if they're making

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.320 
the world cup game but if they're making
a<00:01:20.040> euro<00:01:20.189> game<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.549> but<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.880> coming<00:01:21.150> out<00:01:21.240> as

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
a euro game that but that coming out as

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.749 
a euro game that but that coming out as
well<00:01:21.830> again<00:01:22.830> don't<00:01:22.979> quote<00:01:23.189> me<00:01:23.310> on<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.430> but

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
well again don't quote me on that but

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.510 
well again don't quote me on that but
the<00:01:24.630> benefit<00:01:25.049> street<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.979> think<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.369> just

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
the benefit street and I think it's just

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.730 
the benefit street and I think it's just
the<00:01:26.670> perfect<00:01:26.909> timing<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.900> bring<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.229> out<00:01:28.320> so

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
the perfect timing to bring it out so

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.800 
the perfect timing to bring it out so
I'm<00:01:28.860> quite<00:01:29.040> happy<00:01:29.130> with<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:30.630> was

I'm quite happy with that and I was

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.380 
I'm quite happy with that and I was
talking<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.189> Roberta<00:01:32.189> about<00:01:32.790> what<00:01:33.150> he<00:01:33.360> thinks

stagnant<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.920> not<00:02:08.489> as<00:02:09.020> there's<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.410> concept

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
you could be running backwards

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.210 
you could be running backwards
and<00:03:32.690> it's<00:03:32.780> still<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.110> same<00:03:33.140> exact<00:03:33.830> way<00:03:34.010> to<00:03:34.070> be

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
and it's still the same exact way to be

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.979 
and it's still the same exact way to be
like<00:03:34.400> it's<00:03:34.850> down<00:03:35.300> and<00:03:35.570> like<00:03:35.690> a<00:03:35.720> cross

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
like it's down and like a cross

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.070 
like it's down and like a cross
assumption<00:03:36.380> down<00:03:36.830> in<00:03:36.980> 180<00:03:37.570> so<00:03:38.570> no<00:03:38.989> matter

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
assumption down in 180 so no matter

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.120 
assumption down in 180 so no matter
which<00:03:39.320> way<00:03:39.350> you're<00:03:39.560> running<00:03:39.620> it's<00:03:39.830> the<00:03:39.920> same

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
which way you're running it's the same

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.229 
which way you're running it's the same
thing<00:03:40.160> so<00:03:40.580> it's<00:03:40.700> going<00:03:40.790> to<00:03:40.880> take<00:03:40.970> a<00:03:41.000> while<00:03:41.060> to

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
thing so it's going to take a while to

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.000 
thing so it's going to take a while to
get<00:03:41.330> used<00:03:41.540> to<00:03:41.690> any<00:03:41.870> few<00:03:42.080> so<00:03:42.530> I<00:03:42.590> play<00:03:42.769> a<00:03:42.799> lot<00:03:42.890> of

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.180 
completely new to me and our and three
you<00:04:45.830> know<00:04:46.009> I<00:04:46.250> guess<00:04:47.199> it's<00:04:48.199> the<00:04:48.470> demos<00:04:48.919> anything

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
you know I guess it's the demos anything

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.529 
you know I guess it's the demos anything
out<00:04:49.310> for<00:04:49.430> like<00:04:49.550> three<00:04:49.879> days<00:04:49.909> by<00:04:50.240> the<00:04:50.300> time<00:04:50.479> I

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
out for like three days by the time I

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:52.420 
out for like three days by the time I
upload<00:04:50.720> it<00:04:51.080> so<00:04:51.289> it's<00:04:51.979> not<00:04:52.099> gonna<00:04:52.190> be<00:04:52.280> anything

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
upload it so it's not gonna be anything

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.409 
upload it so it's not gonna be anything
special<00:04:52.610> but<00:04:52.849> I<00:04:52.970> think<00:04:53.120> it's<00:04:53.210> going<00:04:53.270> to<00:04:53.360> be

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
special but I think it's going to be

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:54.580 
special but I think it's going to be
really<00:04:53.569> enjoyable<00:04:53.990> it's<00:04:54.319> going<00:04:54.470> to<00:04:54.530> be

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
really enjoyable it's going to be

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.290 
really enjoyable it's going to be
something<00:04:54.740> new<00:04:55.039> something<00:04:55.460> fresh<00:04:55.699> and<00:04:56.000> um

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
something new something fresh and um

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.210 
something new something fresh and um
it's<00:04:56.990> gonna<00:04:57.139> be<00:04:57.319> like<00:04:57.680> something<00:04:58.039> really

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
an 8 out of 10 because I haven't played

any of the other game modes that's
purely<00:06:32.460> that's<00:06:33.060> the<00:06:33.270> only<00:06:33.419> reason<00:06:33.510> to<00:06:33.960> eight

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110

out of 10 overall I think it's going to
be<00:06:37.440> a<00:06:37.680> real<00:06:38.400> hit<00:06:38.729> I'm<00:06:38.970> not<00:06:39.090> sure<00:06:39.150> many<00:06:39.419> people
