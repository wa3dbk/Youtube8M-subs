00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.020
 nothing here we have and candle chips 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.200
 home literally how much 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.769
 through there three days just how did it appear 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.039
 yes this is the second of two new tastes lays 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.320
 So if I made a brandy video already about 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.910
 first taste is we had potatoes with 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.160
 dill I told everything there 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.769
 the intro was the beginning of the video somewhere 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.500
 about five minutes I was telling that 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.109
 if anyone knows what that taste is and what 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.600
 this is for some new garbage choose your 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.910
 taste vote for taste look then 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.700
 video I told it there first 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.559
 second taste in ticks at home which 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.430
 I waited first and foremost 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.020
 it was his turn to try 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:50.070
 I will not immediately say if someone saw 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.829
 did not look about potatoes with dill yes 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.079
 like I did not like here 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.149
 what grade and if someone put a video 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.710
 haven't watched it tightly first 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.100
 I waited for hiv and home 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:07.380
 here and let 's look now already 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:10.439
 I can not stand yet open a new taste 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.049
 yes I will cut the ribbon cut 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.010
 when something new opens up and 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:21.600
 now we will cut 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:35.310
 solemn moment of the video was with 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:41.430
 introduction immediately get down to business i 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:43.680
 I like to lay myself I do not know how to cook but although 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:49.200
 and this chef studied at the shape of Engineering 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:52.380
 Kotov and from the very as his I love 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.149
 In general I like natural buckwheat 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.149
 mostly but 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.119
 the smell is not similar and the little rings have 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.369
 home I really do not understand 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.640
 in these we treat them there are several different 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.370
 types of speech here I do not know if I see flying 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.120
 I buy in the store 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.860
 that is, as if this is not by smell 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.300
 similar to the ones treated for which i love 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.890
 this is the smell of generally cash passer 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.690
 meeting at home can be so 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.989
 should gave must be smell to lie down and 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:43.160
 here at home in the picture looks in 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:44.989
 principle so let's try immediately with 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.790
 dill they were directly sprinkled with dill 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.790
 mighty not sprinkled with ordinary chips 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:17.150
 feel the taste right there drawn here 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:19.280
 tomatoes and peppers are so green 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.530
 there is such a pepper to sweet pepper 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.959
 there is red and green here at once 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.019
 taste of green pepper is felt straight 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.200
 right away 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.200
 nothing like 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.319
 I would not say that the sense of taste is, 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.900
 only the taste of this is felt 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.909
 sweet pepper but the taste is very nice i 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.209
 would put 8 out of 10 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:54.890
 I would put 10 if there would be a defecting 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.290
 candle from the act only the taste of this sweet 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:01.450
 pepper but the taste is very good very 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.450
 good taste like what i put 8 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:15.709
 what I would on the site of the seller of the vine is this 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:31.039
 taste very cool sweet pepper such 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:32.510
 juicy cool what I think 5 minutes 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:36.590
 Th stacked in principle, there can still be 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:39.440
 talk so here's this taste yes i'm for 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.120
 I vote as now I would say that 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.680
 It is whether it is my my favorite, not all 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.080
 chips lays etched on my favorite with 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.700
 bacon kebabs here I would say that 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.630
 type now this taste lecho 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:52.460
 at home in my favorite part of the 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.760

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.580
 now and this too when teaches sweet 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.770
 the source of which pepper Vlad again want 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.900
 remind what a few years ago 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.080
 Lys chips in black glasses were produced 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.550
 called the forest new sensations and here I am 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.630
 very fond of lys chips 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:14.720
 Thai version was very tasty but 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:17.000
 sorry they are only short in short 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.710
 interval they were released and then them 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.139
 stopped releasing and all of them so far 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.449
 so there is no I really adored them right 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:27.409

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:29.569

 that was so sharp sweet but it 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:37.580
 I also like that is apparently they 

00:05:35.179 --> 00:05:40.129
 decided you replace they decided that not 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.860
 release and release this one here although I would 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:44.869
 better I would probably then I would not 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.919
 what probably I would definitely be better 

00:05:44.869 --> 00:05:48.649
