00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.340
 brush type if you brush your hair 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.649
 helps protect the wires and 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.469
 with long-term use it helps in 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.430
 strengthening and reconstruction 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.890
 two wires 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.710
 then it the base of silk complex 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.829
 hydrolyzed it also contains proteins 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.379

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.019
 Rich, do not count those silicones. 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.479

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.880
 stay in the league and the cup well and he can 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.460
 also be used on the skin 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.860
 You remember that some time ago 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.580
 I made you the review of the heat 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.549
 quitéria piquet is also a finisher 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.130
 thermal protector is only that comparing a 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.619
 with each other they are quite different 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.009
 the heat it has a texture more than 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.990
 silicone it is transparent has this 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.200
 silicone texture and when people 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.540
 apply to hair we feel it has 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.909
 something involving your hair 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.189
 Do you feel that your hair is and is? 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.380
 involved by a product is that 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.040
 feel even of people that we have 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.840
 when they use silicone but his formula 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.340
 It's very rich, too. It's just to leave. 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.290
 clear and already the heat that fusion it is an eye 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.909
 to compare with something as soon as 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.710
 have you heard 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.470
 it is an oil more or less of the type of 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.740
 wall cannoise o douro 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.680
 I take care and you do not feel it in the hair 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.430
 after applying it is very fluid and the 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.230
 hair by-product is as it is known 15 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.620
 minutes after you applied the 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.690
 product disappeared hair byproducts 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:23.840
 with the ceará that for you it is an oil 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:25.940
 Yellow neighbor looks just do not know if it's going 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.860
 I can see it right but he is 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.010
 yellow 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.630
 it is well zinho fluid is not very 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:39.050
 it is not so dense it is more fluid and 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:42.200
 when so applied the hair it logo 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.510
 some as much of hair as of skin 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.330
 the hand of the hand is not that 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.440
 Oily hand knows it looks like the hand absorbs 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.780
 I do not know either 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.990
 I used it yesterday and it's out before 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:57.260
 make the hair dry by pulling with the 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.330
 brush and after drying my hair when I 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.040
 I'll finish raining the tips with the 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.620
 Wow, that cell phone noise 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.019
 to finish only the tips with the I 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.290
 I use a little bit of it again only 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:11.870
 the tips for ironing and 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.290
 the next day that would be today I just 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:19.310
 do it with you I give this is more 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.920
 A little pass in him to get this cold. 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.230
 this little creep that stays and stops 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.350
 give it an extra sparkle and yet with 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.390
 using this overdose using a 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.080
 Time after time using using today 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:35.180
 tomorrow he does not weigh my hair is mine 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.910
 hair does not get heavy does not stand still 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.549
 continues with the movement as if I do not 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.370
 had applied the only thing different 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:46.190
 I feel it gives an apple tree more 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.560
 So I know that, right? 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:52.040
 different ways before the chap 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.760
 before making the brush. 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:59.390
 dry and as a finisher and the way I 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.220
 most I really liked is using before 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.610
 to dry your hair with wet hair 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:08.180
 still applies if it applies throughout the 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.350
 hair extension and saw the hair and I 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.080
 I feel my hair stay 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.320
 much smoother it leaves the hair very 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.480
 smooth, it seems that it 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.430
 smooth effect get very happy racing 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.680
 What are you giving him to see? 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.860
 suitable for all types of hair 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.230
 especially the brittle hair 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.500
 weakened hair and the people who 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:34.680
 how do i make much use of 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.780
 from babyliss 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.600
 so it even helps to leave the hair 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.420
 stronger and protect your hair even 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.610
 protect the wire from heat can be used 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.100
 in any type of hair I also 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.230
 I thought about his curly hair. 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.890
 and gives enough shine hair stays 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.630
 cacheadinho but I do not know that for hair 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.430
 curly as I have hair 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.310
 Murilo also a silk 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.560
 I like the sinterp effect more 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.780
 curly hair is what I 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.530
 I already said cracked hair. 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:10.530
 tendency to appear is resected and its 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.990
 after this criterion he gives this guy 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.000
 treated hair in curly hair 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.100
 not that this one did not give it here gives 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.530
 appearance gives a shine and everything else 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:23.250
 curly hair letter and still got 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:26.730
 Silke, now for my hair type. 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.920
 which is chemically treated that I use 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.580
 much to these sources of heat and everything 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.460
 more 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:35.130
 This one is a hand on the wheel. 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.840
 indispensable because I felt I was 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.690
 using it is just over a week 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.390
 and I felt that my ends are 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.610
 better because as you go using 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.680
 the hat used to model and everything 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.990
 But it's okay that she's one step too many. 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.020
 times but still you feel those 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:55.260
 tips blank blank know know with 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.750
 porosity and it has helped a lot in this 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:00.480
 and the main thing is that it does not weigh the 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.300
 hair because it is an oil it does not weigh 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.400
 hair and I felt that it potentiates 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.470
 this thing in my hair gets smoother 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.620
 I feel my hair much smoother with 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:14.190
 he and he helps a lot to decrease the 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.330
 cold, too, it's just stressing it's free 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.970
 of parabens and 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:21.210
 does not contain alcohol as I already told you it's a 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.870
 and rich formula and formula're good it 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.349
 good 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:28.020
 and so the smell is a thing there is a 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:30.389
 Delight is very good for those who have hair 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.360
 thinner because it does not weigh the wire 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:35.520
 absorbs the product well and 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:39.210
 generally who has thin hair has the 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:42.509
 more rally tips but ugly but went to 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:44.969
 and helps to strengthen 

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:47.060
 hair because he is a reconstructor by 

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:50.460
 silk extract which is a protein 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:53.430
 and soybean also strengthens the 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:56.190
 a lot of hair and I feel my hair 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:59.250
 stronger with him mainly the 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:02.280

 and break even leaves the hair very 

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:11.819

 that the little complex and the lighthouse that is 

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:29.370
