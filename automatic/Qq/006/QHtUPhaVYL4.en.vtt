acetate piece just so that I'm not
covering<00:04:36.840> up<00:04:37.110> as<00:04:37.290> much<00:04:37.620> of<00:04:37.680> that<00:04:38.000> background

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
covering up as much of that background

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.720 
covering up as much of that background
that<00:04:39.420> I've<00:04:39.690> created<00:04:39.980> and<00:04:40.980> just<00:04:41.280> to<00:04:41.400> make<00:04:41.430> it<00:04:41.580> a

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
that I've created and just to make it a

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.810 
that I've created and just to make it a
bit<00:04:41.910> softer<00:04:42.390> as<00:04:42.540> well<00:04:42.780> i'm<00:04:43.040> adding<00:04:44.040> a<00:04:44.280> tag<00:04:44.550> here

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
works of art really the theory and were

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.410 
works of art really the theory and were
not<00:04:56.580> involved<00:04:57.000> but<00:04:57.800> just<00:04:58.800> the<00:04:59.520> process<00:05:00.180> that

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
not involved but just the process that

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.820 
not involved but just the process that
she<00:05:00.750> goes<00:05:00.960> through<00:05:01.170> to<00:05:01.320> make<00:05:01.470> them<00:05:01.680> whether

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
she goes through to make them whether

she goes through to make them whether
it's<00:05:02.130> just<00:05:02.430> I<00:05:02.640> spent<00:05:03.090> all<00:05:03.360> of<00:05:03.390> our<00:05:03.750> layouts<00:05:04.170> or

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
it's just I spent all of our layouts or

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.350 
it's just I spent all of our layouts or
works<00:05:04.650> of<00:05:04.830> art<00:05:05.040> really<00:05:06.830> but<00:05:07.830> I<00:05:08.070> I<00:05:08.700> was<00:05:09.060> so

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
works of art really but I I was so

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.210 
works of art really but I I was so
worried<00:05:09.870> going<00:05:10.110> into<00:05:10.230> the<00:05:10.470> flour<00:05:10.680> if<00:05:11.040> I'm

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
worried going into the flour if I'm

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.020 
worried going into the flour if I'm
going<00:05:11.460> to<00:05:11.610> be<00:05:11.640> honest<00:05:12.060> because<00:05:12.350> it<00:05:13.730> yeah<00:05:14.730> mixed

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
going to be honest because it yeah mixed

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.110 
going to be honest because it yeah mixed
media<00:05:15.420> is<00:05:15.690> just<00:05:16.100> still<00:05:17.100> quite<00:05:17.370> a<00:05:17.520> scary<00:05:17.910> thing

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
media is just still quite a scary thing

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.990 
media is just still quite a scary thing
for<00:05:18.180> me<00:05:18.450> but<00:05:19.050> I<00:05:19.080> really<00:05:19.800> really<00:05:20.370> love<00:05:20.580> how<00:05:20.820> this

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
for me but I really really love how this

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.930 
for me but I really really love how this
turned<00:05:21.360> out<00:05:21.540> and<00:05:22.130> so<00:05:23.130> I'm<00:05:23.400> definitely<00:05:23.550> going

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
turned out and so I'm definitely going

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.550 
turned out and so I'm definitely going
to<00:05:24.060> keep<00:05:24.240> trying<00:05:24.450> it<00:05:24.810> I<00:05:24.930> think<00:05:25.140> the<00:05:25.260> clear

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
to keep trying it I think the clear

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.930 
to keep trying it I think the clear
embossing<00:05:25.710> just<00:05:26.460> adds<00:05:27.240> a<00:05:27.810> little<00:05:27.840> bit<00:05:28.080> extra

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
embossing just adds a little bit extra

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.220 
embossing just adds a little bit extra
again<00:05:29.940> I<00:05:30.000> don't<00:05:30.210> have<00:05:30.330> G<00:05:30.510> so<00:05:30.690> I<00:05:30.900> don't<00:05:31.050> have<00:05:31.200> a

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
again I don't have G so I don't have a

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.070 
again I don't have G so I don't have a
lot<00:05:31.380> of<00:05:31.410> stencils<00:05:32.010> I<00:05:32.160> don't<00:05:32.340> have<00:05:32.580> pace<00:05:33.419> you

at<00:06:23.760> the<00:06:24.230> embellishments<00:06:25.230> of<00:06:25.320> the<00:06:25.500> title<00:06:25.860> and

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.070 
at the embellishments of the title and

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.670 
at the embellishments of the title and
my<00:06:26.970> gene<00:06:27.180> clusters<00:06:27.660> in<00:06:27.810> the<00:06:28.020> mist<00:06:28.230> of<00:06:28.410> my

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
my gene clusters in the mist of my

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.290 
my gene clusters in the mist of my
background<00:06:28.980> and<00:06:29.280> it's<00:06:29.520> just<00:06:29.730> a<00:06:29.850> formula<00:06:30.270> that

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 
background and it's just a formula that

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.750 
background and it's just a formula that
works<00:06:30.600> for<00:06:30.810> me<00:06:30.840> and<00:06:31.310> you<00:06:32.310> know<00:06:32.340> you<00:06:32.490> don't<00:06:32.640> have

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:32.760 
works for me and you know you don't have

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.960 
works for me and you know you don't have
to<00:06:33.000> do<00:06:33.120> something<00:06:33.300> different<00:06:33.390> every<00:06:33.960> time<00:06:34.200> and

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:34.970 
to do something different every time and

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.559 
to do something different every time and
whatever<00:06:35.970> works<00:06:36.210> for<00:06:36.419> you<00:06:36.479> is<00:06:36.539> fine<00:06:37.250> so

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:39.569 
whatever works for you is fine so

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:43.519 
whatever works for you is fine so
I'm<00:06:39.689> just<00:06:39.929> adding<00:06:40.229> my<00:06:40.469> title<00:06:40.919> now<00:06:41.099> and<00:06:42.169> I<00:06:43.169> was<00:06:43.469> a

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:43.529 
I'm just adding my title now and I was a

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:45.679 
I'm just adding my title now and I was a
little<00:06:44.039> bit<00:06:44.159> hesitant<00:06:44.339> to<00:06:44.699> cover<00:06:45.089> up<00:06:45.330> that

00:06:45.679 --> 00:06:45.689 
little bit hesitant to cover up that

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:49.309 
little bit hesitant to cover up that
background<00:06:46.259> work<00:06:46.499> but<00:06:47.629> my<00:06:48.629> layouts<00:06:48.990> usually

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:49.319 
background work but my layouts usually

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:51.320 
background work but my layouts usually
are<00:06:49.469> quite<00:06:49.740> simple<00:06:50.039> and<00:06:50.399> do<00:06:50.789> use<00:06:51.029> a<00:06:51.059> lot<00:06:51.209> of

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:51.330 
are quite simple and do use a lot of

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.659 
are quite simple and do use a lot of
white<00:06:51.629> space<00:06:51.659> and<00:06:52.319> I<00:06:52.889> thought<00:06:53.099> that<00:06:53.399> it<00:06:53.580> was

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:53.669 
white space and I thought that it was

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:56.449 
white space and I thought that it was
just<00:06:53.789> a<00:06:53.969> nice<00:06:54.149> home<00:06:54.599> for<00:06:54.899> though<00:06:55.589> that<00:06:55.979> title

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:56.459 
just a nice home for though that title

00:06:56.459 --> 00:07:01.149 
just a nice home for though that title
to<00:06:57.119> be<00:06:57.270> on<00:06:57.389> top<00:06:57.659> of<00:06:57.719> that<00:06:59.089> you<00:07:00.089> know<00:07:00.119> that

00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:01.159 
to be on top of that you know that

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:04.459 
to be on top of that you know that
watercolor<00:07:02.159> and<00:07:02.809> you<00:07:03.809> can<00:07:03.990> still<00:07:04.229> see<00:07:04.439> the

00:07:04.459 --> 00:07:04.469 
watercolor and you can still see the

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:06.649 
watercolor and you can still see the
effect<00:07:04.919> through<00:07:05.249> it<00:07:05.399> and<00:07:05.639> it's<00:07:06.240> nice<00:07:06.449> and

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:06.659 
effect through it and it's nice and

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:09.379 
effect through it and it's nice and
subtle<00:07:06.899> and<00:07:07.289> it<00:07:07.919> just<00:07:08.159> I<00:07:08.429> feel<00:07:08.819> like<00:07:09.029> if<00:07:09.240> I

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:09.389 
subtle and it just I feel like if I

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:11.359 
subtle and it just I feel like if I
floated<00:07:09.990> the<00:07:10.229> title<00:07:10.619> somewhere<00:07:10.860> else<00:07:11.129> it<00:07:11.339> just

00:07:11.359 --> 00:07:11.369 
floated the title somewhere else it just

00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:14.299 
floated the title somewhere else it just
wouldn't<00:07:11.789> have<00:07:11.879> looked<00:07:12.029> as<00:07:12.270> good<00:07:12.360> and<00:07:13.129> so<00:07:14.129> now

00:07:14.299 --> 00:07:14.309 
wouldn't have looked as good and so now

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:15.859 
wouldn't have looked as good and so now
