00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hey people and welcome tsum 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.940
 unboxing the lg g 4 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.940
 I wish you a lot of fun 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.520
 the lg feeling becomes in a simple one 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:31.489
 white red box delivered 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.989
 here is lg g4 and on the front 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.870
 back are still important 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.210
 Information about the device as well can 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.550
 we from the packaging something quite 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.129
 interesting to take in that that 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.280
 Although smartphone is not rounded 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.949
 quite as strong as the flex 2 it is only 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.680
 bought minimal but now it is time 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.589
 lift the lid to see what 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.010
 I hide everything underneath and here 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:01:00.439
 we have the feeling of lg around you 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.530
 cross course we put it first to 

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:06.680
 page and look at what lg nonetheless 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.720
 so next to the device with supplies as 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.630
 very first in a beautiful red 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.540
 envelope paperwork what else 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.150
 but here we have something very special 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.240
 lg was so generous and gave us one 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.280
 second backcover settled because you can 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.009
 the cover on the back from 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.350
 make and replace it with another 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.450
 and here we have a dull one 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.490
 golden cover to charge the 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.450
 Of course, credit requires a charging cable 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.590
 and we have a micro usb here 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.539
 USB cable 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.310
 here we have the power plug for 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.920
 Charge via the outlet 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.740
 and then we have something for me here 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.560
 I was really looking forward to 1000 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.210
 milliampere battery while so many 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.119
 Manufacturer on a removable battery 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.450
 dispense and even samsung at 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.670
 s6 as lg at the g4 one clearly 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.210
 more mobile chosen what the battery 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.639
 As for 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.609
 and at the very conclusion would be here in 

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:07.069
 this little box the 93 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:09.979
 headphones make you look really good 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:12.890
 with the fun and good, I think so 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.040
 the lg g4 is turned on falls one 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.860
 immediately the cascade display on this 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.890
 it is a quad age the ips 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.319
 could display at 55 inches 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.330
 So it's not an amoled display 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.970
 Colors are realistic and not 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.920
 necessarily supersaturated means but also 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.260
 that the blacks is never so cool 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.629
 as with amoled 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.200
 we have a 16 megapixel camera here 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:40.480
 with a aperture of 1.8 and a laser 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.680
 People I'm curious how the 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.230
 pictures look like this 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.540
 But let's take a look around the device 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.420
 because there we find nothing more than that 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.519
 Charging socket and the headphone jack 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.010
 because the keys are found on the 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.690
 back this has been since the g2 already 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.569
 and I think that's great 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.700
 For one thing, because the G4 has a side to it 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.799
 you can not find it and you do not 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.379
 Looks at the buttons 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.780
 user interface of lg is mine 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:10.150
 some are too colorful and 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.920
 I also do not like some fans that way 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.470
 but that was mine now 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.359
 unboxing and the first impression 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.940
 I can tell you now but from youtube 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:21.790
 Two more buddies at box into the formal 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.790
 The g4 recommend namely once from 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.280
 love four years from a review has 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.829
 I also find the lega variant 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.650
 pretty nice then one more of that 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.510
 love parea from cube the links to the 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.260
 You can find videos in the video 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.449
 description 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.579
 I hope so failed as it should 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:41.579
 I'll be fine soon
