is I know Venus doesn't really well but
Venus<00:00:23.189> already<00:00:23.400> knows<00:00:23.880> how<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.240> take<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> bow<00:00:24.779> so

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
Venus already knows how to take a bow so

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.080 
Venus already knows how to take a bow so
I<00:00:25.710> thought<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.189> would<00:00:26.340> try<00:00:26.580> something<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:27.060> little

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
I thought I would try something a little

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.630 
I thought I would try something a little
bit<00:00:27.539> different<00:00:28.019> um<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.830> have<00:00:29.160> some<00:00:29.400> cheese<00:00:29.580> in

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
bit different um I have some cheese in

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.299 
bit different um I have some cheese in
the<00:00:29.849> car<00:00:30.029> from<00:00:30.449> teaching<00:00:31.410> another<00:00:31.679> dog<00:00:32.040> that

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
the car from teaching another dog that

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.459 
the car from teaching another dog that
we<00:00:32.399> were<00:00:32.489> working<00:00:32.669> with<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.899> was<00:00:34.079> thinking

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
we were working with and I was thinking

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.709 
we were working with and I was thinking
that<00:00:34.500> if<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.460> use<00:00:35.700> cheese<00:00:36.030> instead<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.660> a

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
that if I use cheese instead of a

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.190 
that if I use cheese instead of a
frisbee<00:00:37.100> to<00:00:38.100> simulate<00:00:39.000> what<00:00:39.809> it's<00:00:39.930> like<00:00:40.050> to

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
frisbee to simulate what it's like to

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.990 
frisbee to simulate what it's like to
teach<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.500> dog<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:41.190> take<00:00:41.340> about<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.610> think<00:00:41.879> that

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
teach a dog to take about I think that

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.340 
teach a dog to take about I think that
would<00:00:42.090> be<00:00:42.120> really<00:00:42.390> effective<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.840> reason<00:00:43.230> for

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
would be really effective the reason for

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.560 
would be really effective the reason for
that<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.980> I'm<00:00:44.850> not<00:00:45.030> going<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.270> tell<00:00:45.450> her

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
that is is I'm not going to tell her

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.940 
that is is I'm not going to tell her
what<00:00:45.750> trick<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.200> we're<00:00:46.320> doing<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:46.739> I'm<00:00:46.829> gonna

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
what trick that we're doing so I'm gonna

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.310 
what trick that we're doing so I'm gonna
basically<00:00:47.550> have<00:00:48.059> Venus<00:00:48.450> try<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.840> relearn<00:00:49.289> it

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
basically have Venus try and relearn it

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.810 
basically have Venus try and relearn it
again<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.860> don't<00:00:50.070> know<00:00:50.160> if<00:00:50.280> it's<00:00:50.370> gonna<00:00:50.460> work<00:00:50.670> or

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
again I don't know if it's gonna work or

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.580 
again I don't know if it's gonna work or
not<00:00:50.969> it's<00:00:51.239> going<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.690> watch<00:00:51.840> her<00:00:51.989> brainstorm

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
not it's going to watch her brainstorm

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.840 
not it's going to watch her brainstorm
in<00:00:52.739> today's<00:00:52.980> video<00:00:53.129> I'm<00:00:53.399> gonna<00:00:53.520> show<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.730> how

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
in today's video I'm gonna show you how

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.119 
in today's video I'm gonna show you how
to<00:00:53.910> teach<00:00:54.030> your<00:00:54.210> dog<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.629> trick<00:00:54.930> called<00:00:55.289> bow<00:00:55.680> and

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
to teach your dog a trick called bow and

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.350 
to teach your dog a trick called bow and
I'm<00:00:56.309> actually<00:00:56.460> gonna<00:00:56.670> use<00:00:56.760> food<00:00:57.149> today

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
I'm actually gonna use food today

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.000 
I'm actually gonna use food today
because<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.719> think<00:00:57.930> for<00:00:58.109> most<00:00:58.260> dogs<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.829> is

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
because I think for most dogs this is

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.740 
because I think for most dogs this is
the<00:00:59.129> best<00:00:59.309> way<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.489> teach<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.120> Venus

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
the best way to teach it and Venus

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.479 
the best way to teach it and Venus
happens<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.199> be<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.350> dual-currency<00:01:02.100> dog
