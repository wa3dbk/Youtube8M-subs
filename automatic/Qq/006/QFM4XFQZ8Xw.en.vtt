00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.769
 purchased such amaranth seeds see 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.830
 they are pretty 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:16.470
 from match heads are quite small and 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.029
 Nikolai Evgenjevich how to plant them in order to 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:24.320
 kherson they grew up you know it 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:28.260
 unique plant and a in Kherson she 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:31.080
 growing already have a long wild birth 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.989
 amaranth is schiritsa well we settle 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.660
 we know this bell is half a meter tall 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.320
 our ancestors go home and eat schiritsa and 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.690
 animals used it well well amanat 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.020
 it is a little different from the power weight 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.940
 through the party and relatives if you take on 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.469
 crop on the set several times worn 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.020
 Above see the seeds they are purple for me 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.539
 seeds start yellow and white 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.030
 there are red if different very different 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.500
 many varieties and all practical varieties 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:09.030
 amaranth they are useful and the seeds themselves 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.260
 useful leaves flowers on 7 in the light 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.280
 to make tea 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.110
 if you take for example landing technology in 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.619
 our Kherson in Kherson 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.869
 This landing then when warms the earth 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.939
 if we are talking about amaranth this plant 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.220
 the second half of summer, that is, she is waiting 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.950
 until miss warms the earth when the soil 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.110
 warm up then sow need 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.810
 surface almost one to two 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.840
 centimeter deep so here well 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.930
 it is necessary that the land be prepared 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.950
 I mean that is office 8 was land ready 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.079
 Ishim was on the power of moisture and or 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.030
 let's say people put a drip 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.159
 irrigation there is a blessing and 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.439
 surface sowed bring depths 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.560
 deeply post it she just isn't 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:59.820
 ascend but there is no such strength to enter 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.610
 from the depth therefore 12 well a maximum of three 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.120
 centimeter and senate example sandy there 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.540
 there she is a little bit 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.460
 deeper but it is important that the moisture that's been 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.220
 time is valid there on field conditions 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:15.250
 goes there harrowing a few times here a 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.160
 then reconsolidation after sowing is the axis 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.860
 Comrade, well, just that there was moisture and 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.560
 just at this morning it was tighter to the soil 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.500
 then she quickly come to hurt 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.350
 very beautiful here and in the beginning it will be 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.150
 such as nondescript little leaves but 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.870
 then this plant is very quickly gaining 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:38.200
 growth and by autumn to the growing season by August 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.800
 month and our acquires about two 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:45.250
 meter how would you height there huge 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.560
 half a meter brush is formed from 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.170
 again everything depends on the grade they are from 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.750
 different in color that steel and 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.660
 at this time when the plant grows it 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.120
 you can eat the lower leaves you can 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.660
 quietly tear off a few 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.470
 plants and make salads do pickles 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.870
 various 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.370
 she she is very helpful a lot of calcium 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.130
 potassium for the heart 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.440
 wrote that he and meat replaces protein 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.980
 contains a lot of protein 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.350
 seeds is considered the benchmark protein this 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.770
 start this seed amaranth that is 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.660
 protein quality standard is amaranth then 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.590
 there is amaranth oil that is to have very 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:29.350
 the highest healing qualities acting 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.739
 substance in amaranth it allows 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.530
 heal various wounds heal wounds 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:38.410
 she just pulls it all if 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.030
 apply cosmetology this is champ and again 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.010
 internal problem various pro 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.050
 health she strongly tighten if we 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.680
 say we want to go to 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:50.350
 vegetarianism and replace meat before start 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.870
 that is samara amaranth there she is all 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:56.350
 do do baking do different 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.280
 cutlets are very, very beautiful bread 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.480
 it turns out that you just need it 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.140
 adapt it that is enter in 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.150
 everyday life 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.660
 because how much are we talking about 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.940
 amaranth that's all praises him 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.700
 scholarly articles write what he is 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.600
 good on ancestors wear it and mari 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.640
 Cannes and 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.850
 and our people used 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.609
 and this machine but for some reason it is now 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.660
 moves very slowly at when 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.970
 production 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.210
 its seeds can germinate it 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.120
 unique remedy for people health 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.100
 guys who play sports 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.860
 who deals there well farmer okay 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.390
 your body is a very useful place 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.660
 various additives 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:43.300
 i am very kind of good to consume 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.210
 amaranth here it goes well with 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.720
 other plants and seedlings in that 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:52.660
 including I thought it was an analog 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.970
 of some plant that grew toast 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.130
 where the Inca civilization was they somehow 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.290
 was called and this is our analogue 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.650
 plants yes yes this is the same plant 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:06.430
 there is bla because we have institutions 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:09.669
 who have kept on planting seed 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.680
 material got carry in the wild from 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:13.900
 there were still many tribes 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.910
 was previously introduced to the culture it 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.760
 many plants just on her on it on 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:21.430
 this plant lived there ideas from and tribes 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.950
 maya on they just but deified it 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.550
 plant if with this failure Crimea so 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:29.080
 all sorts of spiritual things 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.810
 political issues this amaranth was 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.210
 for some reason forbid now 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.610
 is trying to revive this world 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.460
 culture help and then cultures is just 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.380
 you know this protein and protein itself as 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.330
 core value why meat is average 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.850
 because protein is necessary 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.890
 why are there animal doctors grow 7 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.470
 plants but me how many times be cheaper 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.900
 cost than the meat of animals why them 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.000
 drop out if you can just you just 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.970
 plant the plant frets yourself full 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 protein which is well stored which 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:04.210
 my unique in its properties can 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.419
 you can bake you can make sprouts 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.620
 make butter and in all these kinds of everything 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:12.070
 it can be used 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:14.289
 can combine with other products in 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.090
 this year in the club make amaranth 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:18.669
 the day that's where everything will be about amaranth 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:21.340
 gather people to tell Kherson 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:24.039
 how to cook like athletes 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.480
 use like butter do yeah here 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:26.970
 somehow 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:30.180
 put together you know x good idea let's 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:32.160
 take it on board and when 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.500
 amaranth harvest will appear 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.290
 you can already show an example 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.300
 plants to cocaine divisions happens 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:41.460
 conduct workshops that you can 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.230
 cook it is very important it 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.980
 unique , everything can be done 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:47.250
 by myself 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.900
 our products from amaranth it happens yes 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:52.430
 how would high quality products 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:55.100
 aircraft on usually well possesses 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:58.560
 quite expensive 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:01.320
 on finance and if you do it yourself 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.840
 it can be done and not difficult just 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:06.420
 now up an example we can do 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:08.250
 free easily from amaranth seed oil 

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:11.070
 which is very expensive in pharmacies and 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:13.350
 which he already lies there and but 

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:16.170
 quality is lost and citizens for themselves 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.520
 to that oil by extraction there in 

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:20.430
 vegetable oils 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:23.390
 it will be very easy and how 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.390
 would be a cheaper way
