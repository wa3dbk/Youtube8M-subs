I<00:01:00.729> think<00:01:01.180> it's<00:01:01.299> a<00:01:01.360> great<00:01:01.479> idea<00:01:01.809> they<00:01:01.930> have<00:01:02.080> to

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:02.229 
I think it's a great idea they have to

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.680 
I think it's a great idea they have to
do<00:01:02.350> it<00:01:02.500> why<00:01:02.909> because<00:01:03.909> otherwise<00:01:04.269> there's<00:01:04.570> no

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
do it why because otherwise there's no

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.350 
do it why because otherwise there's no
liquidity<00:01:04.930> at<00:01:05.290> the<00:01:05.409> banks<00:01:05.830> and<00:01:06.070> basically<00:01:06.580> the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
liquidity at the banks and basically the

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.670 
liquidity at the banks and basically the
transmission<00:01:07.960> of<00:01:08.049> the<00:01:08.140> economy<00:01:08.530> is<00:01:08.590> gonna

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
transmission of the economy is gonna

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.100 
transmission of the economy is gonna
slow<00:01:08.950> down<00:01:08.979> do<00:01:09.940> you<00:01:10.000> think<00:01:10.060> it<00:01:10.270> should<00:01:10.479> be<00:01:10.510> the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
slow down do you think it should be the

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.310 
slow down do you think it should be the
taxpayers<00:01:11.590> problem<00:01:12.460> though<00:01:12.780> not<00:01:13.780> really<00:01:14.170> but

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
taxpayers problem though not really but

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.679 
taxpayers problem though not really but
it's<00:01:14.469> it's<00:01:14.770> too<00:01:14.979> late<00:01:15.159> now<00:01:15.509> there<00:01:16.509> should<00:01:16.659> have

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
it's it's too late now there should have
