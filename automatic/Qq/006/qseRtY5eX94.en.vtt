remove and install grips on a bicycle

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.560 
remove and install grips on a bicycle
using<00:00:10.740> an<00:00:10.860> air<00:00:11.010> compressor<00:00:11.210> you<00:00:12.210> might<00:00:12.360> say

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
using an air compressor you might say

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.910 
using an air compressor you might say
well<00:00:12.719> that's<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.960> pretty<00:00:13.139> simple<00:00:13.530> tip<00:00:13.740> why

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
well that's a pretty simple tip why

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.160 
well that's a pretty simple tip why
would<00:00:14.070> you<00:00:14.190> make<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.340> video<00:00:14.700> on<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:14.940> well<00:00:15.840> when

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
would you make a video on that well when

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.050 
would you make a video on that well when
someone<00:00:16.530> showed<00:00:16.800> me<00:00:16.830> this<00:00:17.070> tip<00:00:17.310> years<00:00:17.580> ago<00:00:17.850> it

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
someone showed me this tip years ago it

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.510 
someone showed me this tip years ago it
saved<00:00:18.480> me<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:19.050> much<00:00:19.289> time<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.980> effort<00:00:20.369> in

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
saved me so much time and effort in

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.370 
saved me so much time and effort in
putting<00:00:21.269> these<00:00:21.359> grips<00:00:21.599> on<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:21.990> off

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
putting these grips on and off

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.470 
putting these grips on and off
I<00:00:22.410> used<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.070> use<00:00:23.220> hairspray<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.880> put<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.240> grips

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
I used to use hairspray to put the grips

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.660 
I used to use hairspray to put the grips
on<00:00:24.660> which<00:00:25.289> worked<00:00:25.529> okay<00:00:25.949> but<00:00:25.980> if<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.279> ever<00:00:26.460> got

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
on which worked okay but if it ever got

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.339 
on which worked okay but if it ever got
wet<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.269> would<00:00:27.390> cause<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.810> grip<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.140> come

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
wet it would cause the grip to come

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.669 
wet it would cause the grip to come
loose<00:00:28.880> also<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:29.910> would<00:00:30.300> use<00:00:30.509> glue<00:00:30.779> at<00:00:31.019> times<00:00:31.289> and

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
loose also I would use glue at times and

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.200 
loose also I would use glue at times and
that's<00:00:31.740> pretty<00:00:32.070> messy<00:00:32.310> and<00:00:32.550> really<00:00:32.790> hard<00:00:33.060> to

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
that's pretty messy and really hard to

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.330 
that's pretty messy and really hard to
get<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.510> grip<00:00:33.720> off<00:00:33.900> using<00:00:34.770> an<00:00:35.040> air<00:00:35.160> compressor

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
get the grip off using an air compressor

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.970 
get the grip off using an air compressor
puts<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.150> grip<00:00:36.360> on<00:00:36.540> really<00:00:37.260> easily<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.800> it's

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
puts the grip on really easily and it's

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.430 
puts the grip on really easily and it's
just<00:00:38.280> stays<00:00:38.520> secure<00:00:39.090> now<00:00:39.690> obviously<00:00:40.289> this

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
just stays secure now obviously this

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.680 
just stays secure now obviously this
does<00:00:40.680> not<00:00:40.829> apply<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.219> lock-on<00:00:42.000> grips<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.420> use

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
does not apply to lock-on grips that use

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.689 
does not apply to lock-on grips that use
collars<00:00:43.199> because<00:00:44.010> those<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.430> would<00:00:44.550> just

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
collars because those you would just

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.180 
collars because those you would just
turn<00:00:44.910> some<00:00:45.149> screws<00:00:45.449> to<00:00:45.750> take<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.949> grips

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
turn some screws to take the the grips

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.549 
turn some screws to take the the grips
on<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.489> off<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.660> for<00:00:48.930> rubber<00:00:49.260> type

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
on and off so this is for rubber type

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.220 
on and off so this is for rubber type
grips<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.129> also<00:00:50.789> foam<00:00:51.149> grips<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.780> what<00:00:52.109> you

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
grips and also foam grips so what you

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.439 
grips and also foam grips so what you
want<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.410> do<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.039> put<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.520> grip<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:53.969> as<00:00:54.180> far

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
want to do is is put the grip on as far

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.830 
want to do is is put the grip on as far
as<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.660> can<00:00:55.079> with<00:00:55.530> just<00:00:55.559> your<00:00:55.980> hand<00:00:56.309> and

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
as you can with just your hand and

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.420 
as you can with just your hand and
sometimes<00:00:57.840> you'll<00:00:58.019> get<00:00:58.140> some<00:00:58.350> air<00:00:58.590> built<00:00:59.280> up

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
sometimes you'll get some air built up

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.889 
sometimes you'll get some air built up
in<00:00:59.550> there<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.850> can<00:01:00.000> actually<00:01:00.120> slide<00:01:00.629> that

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
in there and you can actually slide that

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.490 
in there and you can actually slide that
on<00:01:02.420> then<00:01:03.590> peel<00:01:04.590> back<00:01:04.620> the<00:01:05.040> grip<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:06.350> put<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
on then peel back the grip and put the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.100 
on then peel back the grip and put the
air<00:01:07.680> nozzle<00:01:08.250> underneath<00:01:08.730> as<00:01:08.970> far<00:01:09.570> as<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.900> can

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
air nozzle underneath as far as you can

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.830 
air nozzle underneath as far as you can
and<00:01:10.409> push<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.159> grip<00:01:11.430> while<00:01:12.210> releasing<00:01:12.540> the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
and push on the grip while releasing the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.670 
and push on the grip while releasing the
air<00:01:14.420> there<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.540> go<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.259> there<00:01:16.439> really

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
air there you go it is on there really

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.760 
air there you go it is on there really
secure<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.580> cannot<00:01:18.420> twist<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:18.990> grip<00:01:19.350> unless<00:01:19.619> I

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
secure I cannot twist this grip unless I

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.490 
secure I cannot twist this grip unless I
just<00:01:20.009> use<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> ton<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.820> effort<00:01:21.150> now<00:01:22.079> when<00:01:22.290> doing

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
just use a ton of effort now when doing

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.830 
just use a ton of effort now when doing
the<00:01:22.740> second<00:01:23.280> grip<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:24.119> actually<00:01:24.509> have<00:01:24.689> to

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
the second grip you actually have to

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.620 
the second grip you actually have to
hold<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.409> other<00:01:25.619> one<00:01:25.920> on<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.090> usually<00:01:27.450> just

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
hold the other one on and I usually just

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.929 
hold the other one on and I usually just
prop<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.110> up<00:01:28.200> against<00:01:28.619> me<00:01:28.740> because<00:01:29.610> if<00:01:29.759> you

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
prop it up against me because if you

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.460 
prop it up against me because if you
don't<00:01:30.240> it'll<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.840> air<00:01:30.990> pressure<00:01:31.290> will

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
don't it'll the air pressure will

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.410 
don't it'll the air pressure will
actually<00:01:31.860> shoot<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.820> one<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.270> already

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
actually shoot the one that you already

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.440 
actually shoot the one that you already
have<00:01:33.689> installed<00:01:34.140> off<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.369> bike<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:36.149> I'm

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
have installed off the bike so I'm

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.090 
have installed off the bike so I'm
pushing<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.170> other<00:01:37.320> one<00:01:37.470> against<00:01:37.770> my<00:01:37.890> belly

release<00:01:50.219> the<00:01:50.369> air<00:01:53.899> there<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.170> go<00:01:55.380> both<00:01:55.920> grips

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
release the air there you go both grips

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.300 
release the air there you go both grips
are<00:01:56.579> installed<00:01:57.740> removing<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.890> grip<00:01:59.100> is

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
are installed removing the grip is

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.359 
are installed removing the grip is
pretty<00:01:59.670> much<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.180> same<00:02:00.420> procedure<00:02:01.110> just<00:02:02.039> put

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
pretty much the same procedure just put

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.249 
pretty much the same procedure just put
the<00:02:02.490> nozzle<00:02:02.700> underneath<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.659> grip<00:02:03.869> as<00:02:04.079> much

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
the nozzle underneath the grip as much

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.770 
the nozzle underneath the grip as much
as<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.530> can<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.100> while<00:02:06.030> you're<00:02:06.299> releasing

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
as you can and while you're releasing

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.190 
as you can and while you're releasing
the<00:02:06.869> air<00:02:07.020> pull<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.530> off

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
the air pull it off

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.010 
the air pull it off
foam<00:02:10.200> grips<00:02:10.560> can<00:02:10.860> be<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.280> bear<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:12.240> install<00:02:12.780> and

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
foam grips can be a bear to install and

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.480 
foam grips can be a bear to install and
I've<00:02:13.110> actually<00:02:13.290> tried<00:02:13.770> to<00:02:13.800> do<00:02:14.010> this<00:02:14.160> without

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
I've actually tried to do this without

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.330 
I've actually tried to do this without
air<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.570> took<00:02:15.750> me<00:02:15.960> like<00:02:16.110> half<00:02:16.320> an<00:02:16.530> hour<00:02:16.680> so

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
air and it took me like half an hour so

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.860 
air and it took me like half an hour so
I'm<00:02:17.520> going<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.700> attempt<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.090> do<00:02:18.300> this<00:02:18.480> one

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
I'm going to attempt to do this one

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.530 
I'm going to attempt to do this one
when<00:02:19.110> they're<00:02:19.230> new<00:02:19.440> are<00:02:19.830> just<00:02:20.489> really<00:02:21.150> really

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
when they're new are just really really

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.440 
when they're new are just really really
stiff<00:02:21.900> so<00:02:22.500> again<00:02:23.040> I've<00:02:23.190> put<00:02:23.489> this<00:02:23.670> on<00:02:23.940> as<00:02:24.180> far

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
stiff so again I've put this on as far

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.290 
stiff so again I've put this on as far
as<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.750> can<00:02:24.810> I'm<00:02:25.709> going<00:02:26.069> to<00:02:26.129> open<00:02:26.430> up<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.940> grip

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
as I can I'm going to open up the grip

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.270 
as I can I'm going to open up the grip
try<00:02:27.599> to<00:02:27.660> stick<00:02:27.989> this<00:02:28.140> air<00:02:28.410> nozzle<00:02:28.860> under<00:02:29.010> there

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
try to stick this air nozzle under there

00:02:29.280 --> 00:03:27.210 
try to stick this air nozzle under there
as<00:02:29.400> best<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:29.849> can<00:02:30.050> and<00:02:31.050> then<00:02:31.410> give<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:32.010> shot

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.910 

so<00:03:28.220> that<00:03:28.550> is<00:03:28.730> one<00:03:28.970> and<00:03:29.270> that's<00:03:30.020> a<00:03:30.230> lot<00:03:30.590> harder

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
so that is one and that's a lot harder

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.640 
so that is one and that's a lot harder
than<00:03:31.099> a<00:03:31.250> rubber<00:03:31.550> grip<00:03:31.790> but<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.239> air<00:03:32.510> makes<00:03:33.440> it

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
than a rubber grip but the air makes it

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.350 
than a rubber grip but the air makes it
so<00:03:33.890> much<00:03:34.099> easier<00:03:34.400> I've<00:03:34.670> tried<00:03:34.940> to<00:03:35.120> use

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
so much easier I've tried to use

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.620 
so much easier I've tried to use
hairspray<00:03:35.750> on<00:03:36.319> these<00:03:37.069> and<00:03:37.489> I<00:03:37.760> mean<00:03:37.940> I<00:03:38.030> wrestled

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
hairspray on these and I mean I wrestled

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.990 
hairspray on these and I mean I wrestled
that<00:03:38.720> thing<00:03:39.020> like<00:03:39.890> I<00:03:39.920> said<00:03:40.250> for<00:03:40.370> like<00:03:40.610> half<00:03:40.849> an

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
that thing like I said for like half an

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.479 
that thing like I said for like half an
hour<00:03:41.120> so<00:03:41.510> there<00:03:41.989> you<00:03:42.140> go<00:03:42.290> it's<00:03:42.590> it's<00:03:42.920> really<00:03:43.310> on

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
hour so there you go it's it's really on

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.300 
hour so there you go it's it's really on
there<00:03:43.850> well<00:03:44.239> I<00:03:44.540> like<00:03:45.170> the<00:03:45.319> foam<00:03:45.830> grips<00:03:46.069> by<00:03:46.250> the

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
there well I like the foam grips by the

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.400 
there well I like the foam grips by the
way<00:03:46.489> because<00:03:46.880> of<00:03:47.300> the<00:03:47.600> way<00:03:47.720> they<00:03:47.870> feel<00:03:48.110> they're

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
way because of the way they feel they're

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.309 
way because of the way they feel they're
really<00:03:48.830> light<00:03:49.180> once<00:03:50.180> you<00:03:50.330> get<00:03:50.480> them<00:03:50.630> on<00:03:50.810> they

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
really light once you get them on they

rubber ones on and off when they start

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.979 
rubber ones on and off when they start
to<00:04:06.590> just<00:04:06.830> get<00:04:07.100> a<00:04:07.130> little<00:04:07.400> bit<00:04:07.760> of<00:04:08.299> play<00:04:08.569> in<00:04:08.600> them

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
easy to get them off dry it out with the

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.509 
easy to get them off dry it out with the
air<00:04:15.049> compressor<00:04:15.230> and<00:04:15.560> then<00:04:15.739> put<00:04:15.920> the<00:04:16.040> rubber

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
air compressor and then put the rubber

air compressor and then put the rubber
ones<00:04:16.790> back<00:04:16.970> on<00:04:17.180> the<00:04:17.720> foam<00:04:17.989> ones<00:04:18.380> I<00:04:18.680> found<00:04:19.010> just

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
ones back on the foam ones I found just

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.280 
ones back on the foam ones I found just
stay<00:04:19.609> put<00:04:19.910> they<00:04:20.090> even<00:04:20.479> when<00:04:20.630> you<00:04:20.720> get<00:04:20.870> them<00:04:21.049> wet

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
stay put they even when you get them wet

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.379 
stay put they even when you get them wet
they<00:04:21.560> just<00:04:21.799> don't<00:04:22.520> move<00:04:22.760> but<00:04:23.000> if<00:04:23.090> they<00:04:23.210> do<00:04:23.270> you

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
they just don't move but if they do you

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.090 
they just don't move but if they do you
could<00:04:23.720> pull<00:04:23.900> it<00:04:23.990> off<00:04:24.080> use<00:04:24.350> the<00:04:24.500> same<00:04:24.680> technique

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
could pull it off use the same technique

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.710 
could pull it off use the same technique
and<00:04:25.280> put<00:04:26.180> them<00:04:26.330> back<00:04:26.450> on<00:04:26.510> thanks<00:04:27.290> for<00:04:27.410> watching
