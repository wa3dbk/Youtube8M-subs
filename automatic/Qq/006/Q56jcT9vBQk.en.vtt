 ammonium nitrate 700 milliliters of water and 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:20.160
 newspapers we roll the newspaper in order 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.760
 that it was more convenient for us to fill saltpeter 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.760
 a bottle 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.940
 Well

 sides and we get smoke 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.500
 and 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:03.620
 the more we roll the newspapers the more 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.620
 our checker will be more effective 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.190
 and
