is on one-on-ones especially on the
professional<00:00:24.700> difficulty<00:00:25.390> level<00:00:25.660> so<00:00:25.960> that

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
professional difficulty level so that

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.750 
professional difficulty level so that

when he does give it when you do give up

when he does give it when you do give up
a<00:00:27.850> chance<00:00:28.030> and<00:00:28.180> he<00:00:28.240> does<00:00:28.420> get<00:00:28.539> in<00:00:28.690> on<00:00:28.810> goal<00:00:29.020> he's

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
a chance and he does get in on goal he's

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.600 
a chance and he does get in on goal he's
gonna<00:00:29.260> he's<00:00:29.710> going<00:00:29.860> to<00:00:29.920> take<00:00:30.070> the<00:00:30.190> chance<00:00:30.369> more

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
gonna he's going to take the chance more

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.310 
gonna he's going to take the chance more
often<00:00:30.850> than<00:00:30.970> not<00:00:31.029> it<00:00:31.539> obviously<00:00:31.720> makes<00:00:32.079> for<00:00:32.289> a

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
often than not it obviously makes for a

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.110 
often than not it obviously makes for a
more<00:00:32.469> challenging<00:00:32.800> experience<00:00:33.640> and<00:00:33.910> at<00:00:34.030> the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
more challenging experience and at the

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.000 
more challenging experience and at the
higher<00:00:34.270> levels<00:00:34.660> obviously<00:00:35.379> you<00:00:35.680> really<00:00:35.890> got

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
higher levels obviously you really got

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
higher levels obviously you really got
to<00:00:36.100> be<00:00:36.160> on<00:00:36.190> your<00:00:36.280> guard<00:00:36.520> to<00:00:36.670> make<00:00:36.820> sure<00:00:36.910> you're

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
to be on your guard to make sure you're

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:44.219 
to be on your guard to make sure you're
not<00:00:37.090> giving<00:00:37.359> up<00:00:37.420> good<00:00:37.600> chances<00:00:37.960> and<00:00:38.140> cpu<00:00:43.229> as

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:44.229 
not giving up good chances and cpu as

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:45.750 
not giving up good chances and cpu as
for<00:00:44.499> some<00:00:44.649> new<00:00:44.859> things<00:00:45.190> that<00:00:45.370> I<00:00:45.429> think<00:00:45.489> we're

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
for some new things that I think we're

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.430 
for some new things that I think we're
adding<00:00:46.059> that<00:00:46.089> I<00:00:46.449> think<00:00:46.839> we're<00:00:46.960> innovating<00:00:47.260> on

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
adding that I think we're innovating on

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.979 
adding that I think we're innovating on
the<00:00:47.530> cpu<00:00:47.829> I<00:00:47.889> in<00:00:48.010> a<00:00:48.069> couple<00:00:48.370> ways<00:00:48.719> one<00:00:49.719> of<00:00:49.870> them

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
the cpu I in a couple ways one of them

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.020 
the cpu I in a couple ways one of them
that<00:00:50.139> is<00:00:50.319> really<00:00:50.649> cool<00:00:50.679> to<00:00:51.010> me<00:00:51.159> I've<00:00:51.489> always

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
that is really cool to me I've always

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.899 
that is really cool to me I've always
liked<00:00:52.920> possession<00:00:53.920> football<00:00:54.280> I'm<00:00:54.429> an<00:00:54.519> arsenal

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
fan so so when I when I play the game

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.539 
fan so so when I when I play the game
and<00:00:57.819> I'm<00:00:57.909> playing<00:00:57.940> against<00:00:58.269> the<00:00:58.359> cpu<00:00:58.679> in<00:00:59.679> times

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:00.549 
and I'm playing against the cpu in times

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:03.180 
and I'm playing against the cpu in times
past<00:01:00.699> in<00:01:01.149> previous<00:01:01.719> years<00:01:01.749> it<00:01:02.440> was<00:01:02.589> very<00:01:02.799> very

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
past in previous years it was very very

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.100 
past in previous years it was very very
attacking<00:01:03.909> mine<00:01:04.180> it<00:01:04.360> would<00:01:04.510> get<00:01:04.659> forward<00:01:05.019> all

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
attacking mine it would get forward all

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.480 
attacking mine it would get forward all
the<00:01:05.140> time<00:01:05.379> but<00:01:05.500> it<00:01:05.590> wasn't<00:01:05.799> always<00:01:05.830> as<00:01:06.100> patient

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
the time but it wasn't always as patient

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.190 
the time but it wasn't always as patient
as<00:01:06.580> we<00:01:06.670> would<00:01:06.790> like<00:01:06.820> so<00:01:07.450> we've<00:01:07.630> implemented

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
as we would like so we've implemented

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.450 
as we would like so we've implemented
some<00:01:08.470> features<00:01:08.770> about<00:01:08.890> keeping<00:01:09.310> possession

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
some features about keeping possession

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.460 
some features about keeping possession
this<00:01:09.940> year<00:01:10.120> so<00:01:10.330> that<00:01:10.690> he's<00:01:10.840> a<00:01:10.870> little<00:01:11.350> more

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
this year so that he's a little more

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.930 
this year so that he's a little more
calm<00:01:11.710> depending<00:01:12.190> especially<00:01:12.550> depending<00:01:12.670> on

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
calm depending especially depending on

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.370 
calm depending especially depending on
the<00:01:13.030> custom<00:01:13.360> tactics<00:01:13.750> that<00:01:13.840> you<00:01:13.960> set<00:01:14.170> up<00:01:14.290> but

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
the custom tactics that you set up but

if you have a possession style fee he's
a<00:01:16.240> little<00:01:16.390> more<00:01:16.510> calm<00:01:16.720> on<00:01:16.900> the<00:01:16.990> ball<00:01:17.170> and

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
a little more calm on the ball and

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
plays in the different leagues so you

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.690 
plays in the different leagues so you
get<00:01:32.620> a<00:01:32.650> lot<00:01:32.800> of<00:01:32.830> variety<00:01:33.280> when<00:01:33.430> you're<00:01:33.550> playing

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
get a lot of variety when you're playing

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.090 
get a lot of variety when you're playing
different<00:01:33.850> opponents

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.200 

personality<00:01:40.100> plus<00:01:40.280> is<00:01:40.490> one<00:01:40.640> of<00:01:40.730> our<00:01:40.820> big

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
personality plus is one of our big

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.520 
personality plus is one of our big
features<00:01:41.630> this<00:01:41.780> year<00:01:41.960> we're<00:01:42.200> trying<00:01:42.410> to

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
features this year we're trying to

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.290 
features this year we're trying to
really<00:01:42.950> work<00:01:43.250> hard<00:01:43.280> on<00:01:43.550> the<00:01:43.670> attributes<00:01:44.120> and

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
really work hard on the attributes and

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.180 
really work hard on the attributes and
make<00:01:44.450> players<00:01:44.690> feel<00:01:45.560> like<00:01:45.740> their<00:01:45.920> real<00:01:46.070> life

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
make players feel like their real life

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.040 
make players feel like their real life
counterparts<00:01:46.250> so<00:01:46.880> this<00:01:47.360> is<00:01:47.510> really<00:01:47.660> cool<00:01:47.870> for

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
counterparts so this is really cool for

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.380 
counterparts so this is really cool for
us<00:01:48.080> on<00:01:48.260> the<00:01:48.350> cpu<00:01:48.710> GPU<00:01:48.979> AI<00:01:49.760> side<00:01:50.150> of<00:01:50.270> things

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
us on the cpu GPU AI side of things

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.270 
us on the cpu GPU AI side of things
because<00:01:50.600> when<00:01:51.590> you're<00:01:51.710> playing<00:01:51.920> against<00:01:52.190> the

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
because when you're playing against the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.310 
because when you're playing against the
cpu<00:01:52.460> better<00:01:52.970> dribblers<00:01:53.390> will<00:01:53.660> do<00:01:53.810> more<00:01:53.990> trying

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
cpu better dribblers will do more trying

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.490 
cpu better dribblers will do more trying
to<00:01:54.380> take<00:01:54.530> you<00:01:54.710> on<00:01:54.890> we<00:01:55.760> had<00:01:55.850> a<00:01:55.880> feature<00:01:56.150> or<00:01:56.750> one

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
to take you on we had a feature or one

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.890 
to take you on we had a feature or one
of<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.680> decisions<00:01:58.369> that<00:01:58.400> cpu<00:01:58.910> has<00:01:59.420> to<00:01:59.600> make<00:01:59.750> is

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
of the decisions that cpu has to make is

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.710 
of the decisions that cpu has to make is
whether<00:02:00.229> or<00:02:00.470> not<00:02:00.530> I'm<00:02:00.680> safe<00:02:00.979> so<00:02:01.670> as<00:02:01.940> he's

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
whether or not I'm safe so as he's

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.000 
whether or not I'm safe so as he's
dribbling<00:02:02.900> around<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.410> pitch<00:02:03.590> he<00:02:03.740> needs<00:02:03.920> to

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
dribbling around the pitch he needs to

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.040 
dribbling around the pitch he needs to
make<00:02:04.130> a<00:02:04.160> decision<00:02:04.220> do<00:02:04.670> I<00:02:04.700> pass<00:02:04.940> do<00:02:05.270> I<00:02:05.300> continue

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
make a decision do I pass do I continue

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.010 
make a decision do I pass do I continue
to<00:02:06.200> dribble<00:02:06.500> do<00:02:07.040> I<00:02:07.070> turn<00:02:07.910> away<00:02:08.060> and<00:02:08.420> one<00:02:08.899> of<00:02:08.959> the

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
to dribble do I turn away and one of the

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.090 
to dribble do I turn away and one of the
ways<00:02:09.050> he<00:02:09.170> does<00:02:09.380> this<00:02:09.500> is<00:02:09.649> he<00:02:09.739> has<00:02:09.860> something

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
ways he does this is he has something

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.430 
ways he does this is he has something
that<00:02:10.340> we<00:02:10.429> call<00:02:10.580> a<00:02:10.640> safe<00:02:10.940> zone<00:02:10.970> where<00:02:11.750> as<00:02:11.959> a<00:02:12.020> as

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
that we call a safe zone where as a as

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.410 
that we call a safe zone where as a as
an<00:02:12.709> apple<00:02:12.980> and<00:02:13.160> an<00:02:13.370> opponent<00:02:13.850> will<00:02:14.120> approach

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
an apple and an opponent will approach

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.699 
an apple and an opponent will approach
him<00:02:14.660> he'll<00:02:14.870> determine<00:02:15.320> whether<00:02:15.470> he's

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
him he'll determine whether he's

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.340 
him he'll determine whether he's
becoming<00:02:16.580> safe<00:02:16.850> for<00:02:17.030> now<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.330> this<00:02:17.840> logic<00:02:18.230> in

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
becoming safe for now and this logic in

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.260 
becoming safe for now and this logic in
past<00:02:18.950> years<00:02:19.130> has<00:02:19.310> been<00:02:19.459> very<00:02:19.670> generic<00:02:20.090> so

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
past years has been very generic so

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.670 
past years has been very generic so
everybody<00:02:20.630> safe<00:02:20.870> zone<00:02:21.080> was<00:02:21.260> relatively

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
everybody safe zone was relatively

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.770 
everybody safe zone was relatively
similar<00:02:21.980> this<00:02:22.790> meant<00:02:23.030> that<00:02:23.090> it<00:02:23.570> didn't<00:02:23.750> matter

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
similar this meant that it didn't matter

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.360 
similar this meant that it didn't matter
if<00:02:23.989> you<00:02:24.020> I<00:02:24.080> Cristiano<00:02:24.530> Ronaldo<00:02:24.950> on<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.160> ball

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
if you I Cristiano Ronaldo on the ball

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.000 
if you I Cristiano Ronaldo on the ball
or<00:02:25.700> messy<00:02:26.060> on<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.270> ball<00:02:26.480> versus<00:02:27.170> Rio

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
or messy on the ball versus Rio

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.949 
or messy on the ball versus Rio
Ferdinand<00:02:28.580> or<00:02:28.850> richard<00:02:29.270> donner's<00:02:29.690> are

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
Ferdinand or richard donner's are

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.540 
Ferdinand or richard donner's are
somebody<00:02:30.470> that<00:02:30.650> really<00:02:31.070> wouldn't<00:02:31.340> try<00:02:31.520> and

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
somebody that really wouldn't try and

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.280 
somebody that really wouldn't try and
take<00:02:31.790> somebody<00:02:32.150> off<00:02:32.180> but<00:02:32.750> this<00:02:32.870> year<00:02:33.110> were

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
take somebody off but this year were

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.140 
take somebody off but this year were
dynamically<00:02:34.100> changing<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.700> size<00:02:34.940> of<00:02:35.120> that

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
dynamically changing the size of that

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.449 
dynamically changing the size of that
safe<00:02:35.540> zone<00:02:35.810> based<00:02:36.410> on<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.709> players<00:02:36.920> attribute

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
safe zone based on the players attribute

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.430 
safe zone based on the players attribute
so<00:02:37.880> players<00:02:38.120> like<00:02:38.330> Messi<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:38.780> Cristiano

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
so players like Messi and Cristiano

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.320 
so players like Messi and Cristiano
Ronaldo<00:02:40.130> will<00:02:40.370> still<00:02:40.640> try<00:02:40.820> and<00:02:40.880> dribble<00:02:41.239> out

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
Ronaldo will still try and dribble out

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.940 
Ronaldo will still try and dribble out
of<00:02:41.450> tight<00:02:41.630> situations<00:02:41.840> like<00:02:42.410> they<00:02:42.590> do<00:02:42.650> in<00:02:42.769> the

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
of tight situations like they do in the

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.470 
of tight situations like they do in the
real<00:02:43.100> world<00:02:43.370> so<00:02:43.820> it's<00:02:43.970> cool<00:02:44.030> it<00:02:44.299> brings

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
real world so it's cool it brings

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.630 
real world so it's cool it brings
another<00:02:44.799> little<00:02:45.799> bit<00:02:45.860> of<00:02:46.010> character<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.430> the

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
another little bit of character to the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.160 
another little bit of character to the
CPU<00:02:47.030> AI<00:02:47.150> when<00:02:47.390> you're<00:02:47.510> playing<00:02:47.690> against<00:02:47.959> them

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
CPU AI when you're playing against them

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.720 
CPU AI when you're playing against them
and<00:02:48.290> these<00:02:48.590> guys<00:02:48.799> might<00:02:49.010> try<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:49.310> take<00:02:49.430> you<00:02:49.580> on

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
and these guys might try and take you on

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:50.920 
and these guys might try and take you on
and<00:02:49.910> you<00:02:49.970> might<00:02:50.120> be<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.269> little<00:02:50.420> bit<00:02:50.570> surprised

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
and you might be a little bit surprised

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.660 
and you might be a little bit surprised
of<00:02:51.110> what<00:02:51.140> they<00:02:51.290> can<00:02:51.440> do<00:02:51.590> so<00:02:51.890> it's<00:02:52.310> quite<00:02:52.459> cool

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
of what they can do so it's quite cool

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.770 
of what they can do so it's quite cool
when<00:02:52.850> you're<00:02:52.910> playing<00:02:53.060> against<00:02:53.299> a<00:02:53.390> CPU

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
when you're playing against a CPU

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.289 
when you're playing against a CPU
sometimes<00:02:54.410> it's<00:02:54.620> a<00:02:54.709> little<00:02:54.739> bit<00:02:55.070> humbling<00:02:56.000> and

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
sometimes it's a little bit humbling and

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.030 
sometimes it's a little bit humbling and
so<00:02:56.780> I'm<00:02:56.900> quite<00:02:57.260> excited<00:02:57.350> about<00:02:57.620> that<00:02:57.830> feature

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
so I'm quite excited about that feature
