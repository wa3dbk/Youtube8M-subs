00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.830 
also if you see this is angled angle on
it's<00:01:44.619> different<00:01:45.159> so<00:01:45.340> your<00:01:45.460> hand<00:01:45.700> is<00:01:45.909> open<00:01:46.330> but

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
it's different so your hand is open but

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.600 
it's different so your hand is open but
this<00:01:46.899> right<00:01:47.259> here<00:01:47.319> you're<00:01:47.890> cutting<00:01:48.250> a<00:01:48.340> little

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
this right here you're cutting a little

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.279 
this right here you're cutting a little
bit<00:01:48.700> closer<00:01:48.940> which<00:01:49.270> you<00:01:49.450> have<00:01:49.659> a<00:01:49.690> small<00:01:50.020> hand

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
bit closer which you have a small hand

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:51.630 
bit closer which you have a small hand
so<00:01:50.470> this<00:01:50.619> is<00:01:50.740> a<00:01:50.830> little<00:01:51.130> bit<00:01:51.220> of<00:01:51.310> a<00:01:51.399> large

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
so this is a little bit of a large

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.999 
so this is a little bit of a large
handle<00:01:52.210> you<00:01:52.960> got<00:01:53.110> to<00:01:53.229> think<00:01:53.319> of<00:01:53.470> it<00:01:53.560> like<00:01:53.740> I'm
