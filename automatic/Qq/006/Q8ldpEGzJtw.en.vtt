recently I was trying to transfer a
couple<00:00:12.269> billion<00:00:12.480> or<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:13.530> my<00:00:13.679> main<00:00:13.920> account<00:00:14.070> and

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
couple billion or to my main account and

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.400 
couple billion or to my main account and
after<00:00:15.000> sending<00:00:15.360> individual<00:00:15.900> marches<00:00:16.260> for

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
after sending individual marches for

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.800 
after sending individual marches for
about<00:00:16.560> half<00:00:16.770> an<00:00:16.890> hour<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.369> lost<00:00:17.850> faith<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.480> try

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
about half an hour I lost faith and try

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.349 
about half an hour I lost faith and try
to<00:00:18.869> attack<00:00:19.350> my<00:00:19.560> account<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:20.189> always<00:00:21.060> knew<00:00:21.240> there

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
to attack my account I always knew there

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.090 
to attack my account I always knew there
was<00:00:21.420> an<00:00:21.600> invisible<00:00:22.080> tax<00:00:22.320> but<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.619> forgot<00:00:22.920> how

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
was an invisible tax but I forgot how

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.519 
was an invisible tax but I forgot how
significant<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.820> was<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.300> was<00:00:25.199> trying<00:00:25.439> to

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
significant it was I was trying to

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.029 
significant it was I was trying to
transfer<00:00:25.949> around<00:00:26.630> 2.2<00:00:27.630> billion<00:00:27.930> or<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.650> I

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
transfer around 2.2 billion or and I

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.640 
transfer around 2.2 billion or and I
think<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.340> was<00:00:29.460> taxed<00:00:29.939> around<00:00:30.269> 750<00:00:31.199> million<00:00:31.410> or

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
think I was taxed around 750 million or

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.979 
think I was taxed around 750 million or
in<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.920> end<00:00:32.130> as<00:00:32.430> opposed<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.719> eight

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
in the end as opposed to the eight

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.990 
in the end as opposed to the eight
percent<00:00:34.410> market<00:00:35.070> tax<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.640> would<00:00:35.880> have

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
percent market tax that I would have

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.580 
percent market tax that I would have
gotten<00:00:36.180> if<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.570> continued<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.170> send<00:00:37.380> with<00:00:37.559> a

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
gotten if I continued to send with a

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.220 
gotten if I continued to send with a
stronghold<00:00:37.860> 21<00:00:38.399> market<00:00:38.790> but<00:00:39.660> anyways<00:00:40.050> I

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
stronghold 21 market but anyways I

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.569 
stronghold 21 market but anyways I
thought<00:00:40.440> in<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:40.649> video<00:00:40.950> we<00:00:41.160> would<00:00:41.280> discover

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
thought in this video we would discover

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.170 
thought in this video we would discover
how<00:00:41.910> much<00:00:42.840> exactly<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.500> attack<00:00:43.950> tax<00:00:44.219> was<00:00:44.520> so

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
how much exactly the attack tax was so

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.490 
how much exactly the attack tax was so
what<00:00:45.300> I've<00:00:45.390> done<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.600> I've<00:00:45.840> prepared<00:00:46.200> at<00:00:46.379> all

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
what I've done is I've prepared at all

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.170 
what I've done is I've prepared at all
and<00:00:46.829> I'm<00:00:46.920> going<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.100> compare<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.610> troop<00:00:47.850> load

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
and I'm going to compare the troop load

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.990 
and I'm going to compare the troop load
to<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.930> actual<00:00:49.289> yield<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.250> we<00:00:50.700> can<00:00:50.850> take

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
to the actual yield so we can take

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.119 
to the actual yield so we can take
approximately<00:00:51.660> 10<00:00:51.870> million<00:00:52.199> resources<00:00:52.890> and

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
approximately 10 million resources and

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.650 
approximately 10 million resources and
I'm<00:00:53.340> going<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.550> go<00:00:53.670> ahead<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.879> attack<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.539> see

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
I'm going to go ahead and attack and see

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.569 
I'm going to go ahead and attack and see
what<00:00:54.809> we<00:00:54.899> actually<00:00:54.930> get<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.710> return<00:00:55.949> I'm

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
what we actually get in return I'm

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.819 
what we actually get in return I'm
thinking<00:00:57.000> being<00:00:57.239> visible<00:00:57.570> taxes<00:00:58.410> twenty<00:00:58.770> or

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
thinking being visible taxes twenty or

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.500 
thinking being visible taxes twenty or
thirty<00:00:59.010> percent<00:00:59.340> on<00:00:59.520> any<00:00:59.760> resource<00:01:00.239> let's

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
thirty percent on any resource let's

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.029 
thirty percent on any resource let's
just<00:01:00.660> go<00:01:00.780> ahead<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:00.960> take<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.260> look<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:01.890> with

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
just go ahead and take a look so with

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.319 
just go ahead and take a look so with
the<00:01:02.100> 10<00:01:02.309> ml<00:01:02.460> load<00:01:02.670> let's<00:01:02.910> see<00:01:03.030> what<00:01:03.180> we

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
the 10 ml load let's see what we

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.609 
the 10 ml load let's see what we
actually<00:01:03.359> recovered<00:01:04.350> as<00:01:05.990> you<00:01:06.990> can<00:01:07.140> see<00:01:07.380> with

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
actually recovered as you can see with

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.090 
actually recovered as you can see with
everything<00:01:08.010> combined<00:01:08.430> we<00:01:08.820> recovered<00:01:09.390> around

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
everything combined we recovered around

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.010 
everything combined we recovered around
seven<00:01:11.100> million<00:01:11.280> resources<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.210> with<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> 10

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
seven million resources and with a 10

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.200 
seven million resources and with a 10
mil<00:01:13.200> load<00:01:13.470> if<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.799> do<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.100> math<00:01:14.130> that's<00:01:14.340> about

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
mil load if you do the math that's about

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.330 
mil load if you do the math that's about
a<00:01:15.240> thirty<00:01:15.509> percent<00:01:15.869> resource<00:01:16.650> tax<00:01:16.979> that's<00:01:17.220> an

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
a thirty percent resource tax that's an

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.039 
a thirty percent resource tax that's an
invisible<00:01:17.790> tox<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.360> know<00:01:18.420> everyone

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
invisible tox that I know everyone

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.870 
invisible tox that I know everyone
realizes<00:01:19.439> there's<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.890> tax<00:01:20.220> but<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.520> think<00:01:20.729> some

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
realizes there's a tax but I think some

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.490 
realizes there's a tax but I think some
people<00:01:21.119> don't<00:01:21.299> really<00:01:21.420> understand<00:01:22.380> how

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
people don't really understand how

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.649 
people don't really understand how
significant<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.189> was<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.150> just<00:01:24.360> double

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
significant it was so to just double

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.420 
significant it was so to just double
check<00:01:24.869> as<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.290> can<00:01:25.409> see<00:01:25.619> this<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.040> report

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
check as you can see this is the report

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.300 
check as you can see this is the report
from<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.939> attackers<00:01:27.450> perspective<00:01:28.080> i<00:01:28.320> sent<00:01:29.070> an

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
from the attackers perspective i sent an

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.830 
from the attackers perspective i sent an
odd<00:01:29.520> number<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.850> troops<00:01:30.150> just<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.540> get<00:01:30.689> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
odd number of troops just to get the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.929 
odd number of troops just to get the
load<00:01:31.020> as<00:01:31.229> close<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.829> 10<00:01:31.950> million<00:01:32.189> as<00:01:32.400> possible

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
load as close to 10 million as possible

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.399 
load as close to 10 million as possible
and<00:01:33.150> now<00:01:33.479> let's<00:01:33.689> just<00:01:33.810> go<00:01:33.930> ahead<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.140> get<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
and now let's just go ahead and get the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.280 
and now let's just go ahead and get the
defenders<00:01:34.860> perspective<00:01:35.509> alright<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:36.840> as<00:01:37.020> the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
defenders perspective alright so as the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.350 
defenders perspective alright so as the
defender<00:01:37.770> we<00:01:38.579> still<00:01:39.030> lost<00:01:40.939> we<00:01:41.939> still<00:01:42.180> lost

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
defender we still lost we still lost

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.719 
defender we still lost we still lost
upwards<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.990> 10<00:01:43.170> million<00:01:43.470> resources<00:01:44.070> but<00:01:44.610> as

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
upwards of 10 million resources but as

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.670 
upwards of 10 million resources but as
you<00:01:44.880> can<00:01:45.000> see<00:01:45.240> as<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.810> attacker<00:01:46.170> we<00:01:46.500> only

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
you can see as the attacker we only

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.889 
you can see as the attacker we only
gained<00:01:47.009> around<00:01:47.189> seven<00:01:47.670> million<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.390> again<00:01:48.659> the

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
gained around seven million so again the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.480 
gained around seven million so again the
invisible<00:01:49.350> attack<00:01:49.619> tax<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.040> around<00:01:50.250> thirty

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
invisible attack tax is around thirty

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.249 
invisible attack tax is around thirty
percent<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.119> think<00:01:51.750> that's<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.960> little<00:01:52.049> bit

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
percent I think that's a little bit

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.780 
percent I think that's a little bit
harsh<00:01:52.470> but<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.829> mean<00:01:53.009> we<00:01:53.100> have<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.250> deal<00:01:53.430> with<00:01:53.610> it

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
harsh but I mean we have to deal with it

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.969 
harsh but I mean we have to deal with it
so<00:01:54.210> if<00:01:54.600> when<00:01:54.899> you're<00:01:54.990> transferring<00:01:55.380> resources

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
so if when you're transferring resources

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.219 
so if when you're transferring resources
from<00:01:56.070> your<00:01:56.310> farm<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.939> would<00:01:57.329> suggest<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.899> you

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
from your farm I would suggest that you

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.830 
from your farm I would suggest that you
use<00:01:58.259> your<00:01:58.530> market<00:01:59.100> but<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.570> could<00:02:00.750> be<00:02:00.810> a

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
use your market but that could be a

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.450 
use your market but that could be a
little<00:02:01.020> bit<00:02:01.170> more<00:02:01.290> time<00:02:01.530> consuming<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:02.340> if

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
little bit more time consuming so if

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.800 
little bit more time consuming so if
you're<00:02:02.610> aware<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.060> tax<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.540> don't<00:02:03.689> mind

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
you're aware of the tax and don't mind

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.149 
you're aware of the tax and don't mind
that<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.140> could<00:02:04.259> go<00:02:04.350> ahead<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.560> attack<00:02:04.979> i

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
that you could go ahead and attack i

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.399 
that you could go ahead and attack i
guess<00:02:05.369> but<00:02:05.700> this<00:02:05.880> video<00:02:06.210> was<00:02:06.630> just<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.170> point

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
guess but this video was just to point

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.830 
guess but this video was just to point
out<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.710> facts<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.489> there<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.270> an<00:02:09.599> invisible

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
out the facts that there is an invisible

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.020 
out the facts that there is an invisible
resource<00:02:10.470> tax<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.129> is<00:02:11.250> actually<00:02:11.550> quite

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
resource tax and it is actually quite

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.309 
resource tax and it is actually quite
significant<00:02:12.810> so<00:02:13.110> there

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
significant so there

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.690 
significant so there
you<00:02:13.379> go<00:02:13.530> guys<00:02:13.739> thanks<00:02:14.099> for<00:02:14.129> watching<00:02:14.249> we'll
