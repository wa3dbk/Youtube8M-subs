00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.810
 so today i said this generator yet 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:09.630
 it consists of what details like a pupil 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:14.450
 because after all, behind his cover she is 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.450
 of this is called a voltage regulator 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:24.210
 further capacitor interference suppression and on 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:28.880
 this goes the climate terminal cable which 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.990
 goes on charging the battery it goes on 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.559
 charge indicator 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.149
 the battery in the cabin is the lamp 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:42.809
 which production she should 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:45.620
 go out this regulator 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.770
 voltage to the video here are two brushes 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.629
 principle this voltage regulator can 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.309
 do not buy a new one but just buy brushes 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.350
 They are pennies in essence to change them after all 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.260
 here you can do them 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.300
 Well, do not fall out more precisely need small 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.559
 Drill Drill two holes were from 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.830
 there springs gs 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.470
 old pull out new stick out there and 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.150
 solder accordingly and accordingly 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.299
 I will have to buy a new regulator 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:19.040
 just clearly clearly worth a penny further 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:22.920
 he is still well here was the impeller 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.619
 chamfer goes to our roots too 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.170
 chosen in principle since then 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.820
 will be coming here 4 cogs which 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.680
 keeps his body himself too in advance 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:40.579
 Iâ€™m going to tell you first 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:44.280
 exactly take this is called a stator and 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:46.649
 here is a fast - moving block well in the middle 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.780
 generator 35 itself with it never 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.560
 problems are not nice this lord there 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.040
 there are diodes 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.320
 diode bridge or rather, but if 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.320
 how to properly use a generator 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.020
 see here he is all mass here with 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.850
 65 amg tags 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:07.380
 Well, it means the battery, respectively 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:10.850
 dial 65 1 or less but by no means 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.610
 case no more than 5 as projects 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.590
 emulator if you doubt whether he gives 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.120
 exercise 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.680
 go in cars just take off right if 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.660
 she then stall means you 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.610
 battery packs 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.380
 well, or take a multimeter and then 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.230
 can you hi what he will be so he 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.830
 should produce current on the battery not 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:34.070
 less than 14 even more should be found than 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:37.460
 14 battery itself and these even 1014 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:40.850
 cooking it recharge it matches 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.190
 the meter of the company went on already on new cars 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.740
 There is another kind of battery bosch 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.650
 They differ in that here goes back 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:52.610
 part of his plastic cover well this 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:55.190
 the part is a little different further still consists 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.100
 this part as you can see so far chip nick 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.450
 one here is another star 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.330
 by the way these bearings are better off 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.000
 stripper as if here so put 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.630
 kill him he is a stupid option it 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.650
 very much you then you can break the very 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.810
 here is the impeller and 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.120
 I had such problems so much better 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.200
 shoot get and here are two form 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.210
 as you can see with me 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.640
 which keeps why their environment and so what 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.710
 you are almost a click yourself do not ruin ruin you 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.140
 only it will be possible well do not ruin with mikom 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.570
 only this part and the bearing itself there 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.930
 it remains only to open it already broken 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.660
 I have 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.710
 but this principle can eliminate it for 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:36.500
 boil an aluminum electrode but speak 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.040
 I'll tell you right away on direct current if 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.580
 you have a vakas to do it all the time 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.850
 try to improve further here see this 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:50.440
 the company on it will be these two rings 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:54.470
 I have a bit of a mess and they are no longer 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.450
 you fall because it would be necessary to go 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.510
 generator working of us car she own 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.790
 Pastoral another since 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.819
 the thermostat here this part was with broken 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.170
 on it when I shot it we will see but 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.730
 not to put it in its place this part 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.220
 I took another generator as I have 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.129
 was together with the engine we can put this 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.220
 do next as in thong ativ Omsk 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:17.169
 take off completely remove the rotor and 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.049
 here and here to shoot and here are the bearings 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.030
 this part of the well, or immediately but can 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.539
 rather, this part is put it thicker 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:29.320
 here's a drake and insert it in a drake 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:32.199
 well that includes the dragon whispers a court 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.970
 represents file matching 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:36.400
 when it will turn this part of the will 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.070
 so not those who dwarf anka themselves with 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:45.100
 them for themselves and no arises 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:48.039
 difficulties as you can see what I thought 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.979
 sort of told all the organizers if 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:52.720
 pictures will be questions write comment 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.590
 and like and subscribe to my 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.590
 channel all bye
