00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
for watching first off I'm going to

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.520 
for watching first off I'm going to
brush<00:00:11.940> my<00:00:12.120> hair<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.509> make<00:00:12.660> sure<00:00:12.840> everything<00:00:13.380> is

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
brush my hair to make sure everything is

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.180 
brush my hair to make sure everything is
smooth<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.160> easy<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.610> manage<00:00:15.770> then<00:00:16.770> I'm<00:00:16.890> going

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
smooth and easy to manage then I'm going

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.220 
smooth and easy to manage then I'm going
to<00:00:17.250> divide<00:00:17.550> my<00:00:17.730> hair<00:00:17.910> from<00:00:18.300> behind<00:00:18.600> into<00:00:19.020> two

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
to divide my hair from behind into two

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.260 
to divide my hair from behind into two
equal<00:00:19.590> parts<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.189> I'm<00:00:20.279> going<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.670> tie<00:00:20.850> off<00:00:21.060> one

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
equal parts and I'm going to tie off one

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.970 
equal parts and I'm going to tie off one
of<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.449> sections<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:22.260> that<00:00:22.410> it's<00:00:22.560> not<00:00:22.680> in<00:00:22.740> the

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
of the sections so that it's not in the

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.740 
of the sections so that it's not in the
way<00:00:25.400> now<00:00:26.400> from<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.730> front<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.150> my<00:00:27.269> head<00:00:27.510> I'm

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
way now from the front of my head I'm

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.900 
way now from the front of my head I'm
going<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.140> divide<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.769> hair<00:00:28.800> vertically<00:00:29.699> and

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
going to divide the hair vertically and

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.330 
going to divide the hair vertically and
split<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.480> into<00:00:30.630> three<00:00:31.019> equal<00:00:31.170> parts<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.890> this

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
split it into three equal parts and this

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.790 
split it into three equal parts and this
will<00:00:32.489> be<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.730> start<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.210> braid<00:00:33.530> so<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.559> just

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
will be the start of the braid so I just

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.410 
will be the start of the braid so I just
placed<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.399> bun<00:00:35.579> strand<00:00:36.000> over<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.329> middle

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
placed the bun strand over the middle

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.660 
placed the bun strand over the middle
strand<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.260> then<00:00:37.469> placing<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.040> top<00:00:38.340> strand

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
strand and then placing the top strand

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.729 
strand and then placing the top strand
over<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.030> middle<00:00:39.149> so<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.230> just<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.530> simple

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
over the middle so this is just a simple

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.090 
over the middle so this is just a simple
braid<00:00:41.070> at<00:00:41.160> first<00:00:41.399> I'll<00:00:41.730> do<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.120> same<00:00:42.300> thing

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
braid at first I'll do the same thing

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.010 
braid at first I'll do the same thing
but<00:00:44.100> with<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:44.789> strand<00:00:45.120> I'm<00:00:45.270> going<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.780> gather

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
but with this strand I'm going to gather

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.740 
but with this strand I'm going to gather
some<00:00:46.500> hair<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.450> incorporate<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.570> with<00:00:48.600> a

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
what you did to the top and then you're

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:21.180 
what you did to the top and then you're
going<00:02:03.369> to<00:02:03.460> tie<00:02:03.640> it<00:02:03.700> off
