 this one can hang now, in principle, quite direct successors 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:24.579
 Consider this first day in the companies 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:31.469
 all the functions that the HTC Kapsch had also the HTC Touch 3g it would only 

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:33.400
 improved in many ways 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.140
 as you can see already by the name that is just 3g capable that dominates as 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.930
 UMTS and also the 4u is called the PEA 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.240
 but not too happy 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.590
 otherwise Phoenix Mischa voters had Ottilie PS so it's too TPS 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.640
 No navigation software from ZF we see included here 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.380

 including CDs and 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.100
 we have the HTC Touch 3g 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.040
 it has a very rounded corners 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.220
 rough surface so that there is always trade very well in the 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.970
 Hand and gives just 8 90 grams 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.450
 the fia-chef percent memory 2 9 56 MB in size 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.580
 and that with micro sdhc cards expandable Krad weighs in the thriller 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.170
 just 8 90 grams so 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.890
 Yashin easily manageable Schmehl on the software design itself 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.480
 all around a business phone 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.770
 "Mad Man" also a camera that now has in a triangle times two more 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.850
 Pixel, however, no one knows photo light no autofocus 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.140
 So the focus is clearly on the here 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.840
 Business aspect also the process that some are much more powerful 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.780
 at the 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.049
 before that so that also flew that now runs a lot of physicists 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.020
 So you know what to do first of the catch is included 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.790
 Kerner a quick guide that is really very very short 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.850
 but of course there is one more 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.180
 full 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.000
 Guide a 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.520
 Heermann Opti 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.520
 Conti card 

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:12.619
 after that is ever the headphones 

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:16.839
 but here it is over this one can own headphones 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.569
 only through an adapter then the man to buy must have something for me 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:22.729
 have to 

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:26.499
 shame about the attached headphones here the clothes only a mediocre 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:29.549
 quality 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.639

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:36.639
 our Germans were hiding 

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:43.149

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:53.099
 UnternÃ¤hrer Porsches USB Charger in turn to transfer data 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.939
 on the other hand, but also to charge the phone 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:59.729
 if you connect the phone directly to the PC it will be known to us 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:01.629
 that my as mass storage 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.859
