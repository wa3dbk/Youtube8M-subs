00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.700
 Saturday afternoon was in front of the A1 of PSV 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.859
 an important and always loaded 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.870
 contest on the program because on the 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.590
 own herdgang played with against the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.540
 peers of ajax and ajax that is 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.130
 the leader in the league for at 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.840
 junior team 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.510
 fred grim and Ronald took the farmer 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.420
 29 points from 11 games 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.680
 PSV is third with 23 out of 11 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.880
 and so it will have to win at 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.109
 to keep in touch with the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.109
 amsterdammers here the first 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.140
 possibility for psv joshua brenet 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.780
 two steam up but his pass is too 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.280
 sharp for his teammates 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.980
 He is therefore the leader in this 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.690
 competition it did not lose either and 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.600
 so it might just be a difficult afternoon 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.000
 for PSV 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.449
 tikes the big strong left back from ajax 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.920
 looking forward to school and this is 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.780
 youssef fennich 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.430
 He tries but is on behalf of Ajax but the 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:02.180
 chances are not great in the first 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.180
 half to is then 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.250
 good pressure put by antonio 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.729
 Ajax is trying to distribute 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.670
 worry boss of fanny pak a he had 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.680
 already looked at a misunderstanding with travel 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.270
 promising but it would just be 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.220
 a chance on the other side 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.890
 be the first to go through gravenberch 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.530
 the right back position is posted 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.600
 keep the overview this is one 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.400
 substitute rosheuvel but he chases him 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.460
 about the van hecke 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.500
 on the herdgang and so still 0 0 a lot 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.910
 audience it is of course fun 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.520
 poster 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:41.210
 PSV Ajax whatever teams compete against each other 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.820
 play it remains a loaded duel 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.050
 that antonio with a header and rescue 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.920
 for the night were options 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.920
 get bigger 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.280
 jorrit hendrix as a result 4 he extended 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.050
 despite his contract in Eindhoven 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.590
 sends zakaria bakkali away handsome 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.590
 assumption 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:06.670
 summer and sort of hear a tone and 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.670
 rescue van van de rakt 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.790
 what PSV can take the lead in this phase 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.790
 come 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.980
 hendriks 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.510
 well done ok forest farm then you can have one 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.430
 excellent basis or wait and that comes 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:25.290
 therefore Overbeek this with sign 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.660
 overview tikes 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.070
 the front is low orange , he turns 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.840
 shoot 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.959
 certain of gestation not to take action 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.959
 come 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.280
 [Music] 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.909
 ajax then through our hill 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:48.579
 so a and beyond stupid comes the right back 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.200
 joining mike pluses the name is one 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.120
 pass becomes intercepted highest bus 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.859
 once again 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.609
 and this time the bar brings salvation 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:03:00.129
 psv de but there are nigel bertrams and 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:02.260
 his men well away here leslie de zag 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.000
 tries only once but Zakaria 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.650
 Bakkali are in the right place 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.329
 You ca n't do this too smartly and do this 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.590
 terribly difficult play ball on 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.419
 bertrams 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.879
 it's shot things in between but that 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:14.200
 looking ball off target and 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.970
 Jorrit Hendrix who seems stinging 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.319
 blockade to say man such a ball you can 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.239
 not play back that way 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.780
 but luckily it all runs with one 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.790
 sissier than he comes again lesly de sa 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.859
 gets the ball with luck 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.560
 so she even gets a plastic bag for the ball 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:32.079
 tically and there a lot of ajax 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.739
 just before time it seems fisscher this 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.739
 contest to decide 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.159
 it all comes about happily 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.109
 Here he gets the ball in the plot with 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:42.310
 lesly de sa 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.919
 then hendrikx cannot do enough 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.579
 Fishermen's intervention and so does Ajax win 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:49.989
 op became can with a zero of psv a1 and 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.290
 losing ajax 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.290
 that hurts
