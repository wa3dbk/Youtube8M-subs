helped<00:01:41.950> me<00:01:42.010> loads<00:01:42.220> because<00:01:42.430> you<00:01:42.730> get<00:01:42.910> see<00:01:43.120> how

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
helped me loads because you get see how

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.260 
helped me loads because you get see how
much<00:01:43.420> speed<00:01:43.720> you<00:01:43.930> need<00:01:43.960> and<00:01:44.380> stuff<00:01:44.650> and<00:01:45.270> yeah

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
then I can just copy them and I don't

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.980 
then I can just copy them and I don't
have<00:01:48.610> to<00:01:48.670> do<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:49.000> horrible<00:01:49.390> part<00:01:49.420> where<00:01:49.840> you

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
have to do the horrible part where you

00:01:49.990 --> 00:02:30.510 
have to do the horrible part where you
test<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:50.440> jump<00:01:50.680> out

that<00:02:32.960> big<00:02:33.170> jump<00:02:33.410> I<00:02:33.560> almost<00:02:33.770> felt<00:02:34.040> like<00:02:34.100> I<00:02:34.280> was

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
that big jump I almost felt like I was

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.130 
that big jump I almost felt like I was
on<00:02:34.430> my<00:02:34.580> snowmobile<00:02:34.910> jump<00:02:35.690> in<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:35.840> backcountry

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
on my snowmobile jump in the backcountry

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:43.550 
on my snowmobile jump in the backcountry
back<00:02:36.470> home

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.870 

for<00:02:44.560> me<00:02:44.680> it's<00:02:44.860> just<00:02:44.950> all<00:02:45.130> tricks<00:02:45.430> I've<00:02:45.580> done<00:02:45.760> on

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
for me it's just all tricks I've done on

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.930 
for me it's just all tricks I've done on
my<00:02:45.970> BMX<00:02:46.300> bike<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:47.050> it's<00:02:47.980> whether<00:02:48.430> or<00:02:48.610> not<00:02:48.760> I

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
my BMX bike and it's whether or not I

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.700 
my BMX bike and it's whether or not I
can<00:02:49.030> actually<00:02:49.630> make<00:02:49.810> them<00:02:49.930> work<00:02:50.140> in<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.440> snow

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
can actually make them work in the snow

00:02:50.710 --> 00:03:03.390 
can actually make them work in the snow
because<00:02:51.130> this<00:02:51.580> snow<00:02:51.730> makes<00:02:52.360> it<00:02:52.570> so<00:02:52.900> sketchy

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.819 

when<00:03:04.329> I'm<00:03:04.480> riding<00:03:04.659> it<00:03:04.930> let's<00:03:05.319> just<00:03:05.379> see<00:03:05.650> how<00:03:05.799> I

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
when I'm riding it let's just see how I

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.890 
when I'm riding it let's just see how I
feel<00:03:06.159> and<00:03:06.430> see<00:03:06.670> what<00:03:06.790> tricks<00:03:07.000> energy<00:03:07.390> but<00:03:07.629> I'm

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
feel and see what tricks energy but I'm

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.470 
feel and see what tricks energy but I'm
definitely<00:03:08.349> not<00:03:08.829> going<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.099> 360<00:03:09.700> yet<00:03:09.760> like

definitely not going to 360 yet like

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.580 
definitely not going to 360 yet like
that<00:03:10.780> would<00:03:10.930> be<00:03:11.110> ridiculous

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:42.710
