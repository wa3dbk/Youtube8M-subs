00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.440
 hello to all these nitot cars 67 so 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.469
 for the nokia test video dominates at 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.019
 520 so I received yesterday so finally 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.240
 I could see just about every 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.900
 fonctionnalities 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.920
 so here we are on the home screen 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.430
 so we can change 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.960
 we can change the background on the hour the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.580
 day and date of the ag but a code 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.439
 so we come to the main menu 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.170
 so we will start with the functions 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.329
 basic so there are thumbnails 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.890
 so that's pretty handy so me 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.050
 I like to throw under android so that 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.230
 change a bit so I had to adapt a bit 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.550
 but well so the thumbnails we have the 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.899
 possibility to change places 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.000
 so we keep up so we can tonight 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:55.559
 remove it the main screen is the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.829
 shrink or enlarge it up and then on 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.420
 can move it anywhere so I 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.640
 limit like that so you put like 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.559
 you want your screen so we're going 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.909
 start so already there were not the 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.760
 settings so I added the 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.549
 settings music photos 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.659
 internet explorer even though I use 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.659
 binning so with this button 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.970
 so knowing that on the main screen 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.750
 then we have that when balance on the 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:28.049
 aside that's all the all 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.329
 features we'll say so at the beginning 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.850
 we have and therefore do not recommend if you have a 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.770
 problem are you going in there 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.500
 so that's it I went I had a 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.150
 problem it's really excellent it 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.549
 really explains everything so that's 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.780
 for calculator calendar weapons 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.600
 I do not need to explain to you 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.119
 contacts so that's to search 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.530
 with the car and internal exploit the 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.750
 games so the apps 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.240
 this is a list of the best 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.329
 applications music messages videos from 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.650
 this graveyard music son to take 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.200
 notes so in the settings 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.790
 so here we can change the ringtone on 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.140
 has the theme so I liked it in green on 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.760
 can put it any color 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.500
 it depends on your hull or six months 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.190
 she is black but hey you take a 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.490
 blue hull or meta in blue so there 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.140
 there is the wii so did the wi fi that's 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.470
 easy to configure no problem the 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.150
 airplane mode the bluetooh location so 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.400
 and also something that is not bad 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.070
 the battery saver so when 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.640
 your battery is low you activate 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.170
 this is your cell phone 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.730
 everything to save battery so 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.380
 there he also scored 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.670
 the remaining autonomy for me so a 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.560
 day 15 years old I do not reload it and then 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:46.160
 then what are the backups the 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.950
 brightness the keyboard the language even one 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.900
 can also located the laptop as 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.060
 like everything now can make 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.910
 connection sharing also that's it 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.730
 practice so hop I created myself a 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.250
 blow of nokia of course then there are the 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.110
 Claj Blinds bloomed so sorry I can 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.880
 not everything show you so the 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.440
 audio music applications so the surface 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.959
 created accounts is there to transfer 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.580
 data if you change your laptop 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.890
 and you want to bring your tests 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:17.000
 put your savall contacts so has 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:20.890
 then the camera so he has a 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.890
 quality rather not bad 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.870
 yeah that's a quality or 5 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.810
 megapixels did not hurt so we did 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.930
 contacts the messages so the 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:37.910
 so call there you have several so 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.350
 there I received no call so there could 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:46.220
 search in your contacts there it is for 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:48.370
 compose a call that's for the 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.370
 messaging 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:56.400
 so maybe I'm getting closer 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.750
 so then in fact we have the impression 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.930
 that there are a lot of things in fact 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.370
 this laptop but eventually when we 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.550
 look at the end so here I made you 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.300
 an explanation basically there is no there 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.850
 there are not so many things 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:15.060
 so of course you have to create an account 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:20.190
 hotmail a nokia account for all this 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:24.979
 what is all applications and 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:27.270
 So here while I tell you a big 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.280
 what I had to say 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.020
 so you ask me questions so there 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.940
 I really did a video of 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:38.240
 different features so I have 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:41.160
 not too thorough but tell me 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.330
 if you want to know something 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.290
 particular so I will make myself a pleasure 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.479
 to answer you 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.830
 so this is it is there so there is 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.380
 a very good value for money 1 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.910
 frankly i was i was surprised 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.270
 frozen for a day frankly it does not 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:05:03.360
 leave more so here are of course the 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:05.729
 buttons there is for so that's for 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.610
 directly go on the internet which bing 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:12.210
 search engine windows 8 la for 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.490
 go back to the main screen is there so 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.479
 to return to the favorite page 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.770
 previous and if you hold the 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:18.410
 arrow so that's the different pages 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.550
 accused only an open page but 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.770
 otherwise you have several so that 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.000
