00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:22.009
 O 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:23.749
 what's up guys 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:26.009
 no extra called same video 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.630
 here I come back commenting on it 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.839
 wahrmann aicep irons 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:33.860
 It's something the people have asked for. 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.370
 the timbre here basic and latifah is what I already explained 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.850
 in that site 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.120
 ii tricks 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.120
 It's the cabin and the tietÃª are 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.830
 the world 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.280
 the only thing missing was that 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.600
 in that video 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.760
 that's when the first thing I say here and about the prisoners 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.150
 he will be benhur by multiplying them here 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.200
 if you have a 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.680
 a measure 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.479
 in my case here the only thing I did was high change the process to 70 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.790
 it's important that the pain that's what I do that the tightness 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.600
 ray 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.610
 is 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.870
 it must be because when you trigger his show it will give a little more gain 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.600
 so sometimes you put a transplant 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.450
 without the soil 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.759
 paulo the dream can be half felipe mass that was beautiful 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.240
 ah 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.089
 so let's go there more 

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:11.039
 when you put 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.559
 the amazon 

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:15.559
 first beware of its chain of effects 

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:20.009
 and watch for you placed after training 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:23.399
 and obviously then our price is not 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:25.759
 Why do you come here? 

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:28.469
 the mona lisa 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:31.469
 too much noise if the judges are here 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.509
 will have to work on it and 

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:38.509
 then you will have problems in 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.359
 another tip 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.359
 It is annoying to put it at the beginning of the chain so it would be up 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.329
 O 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.019
 10 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.179
 powder 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:55.179
 I'm not going the goal 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.589
 I only listened to this at the beginning of the chain 

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:08.079
 rita 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:10.369
 impossible not 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:12.689
 and the reason for it here 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.559
 your guitar team is already here 

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:19.519
 in my case it's being turned into two more voices so I have three 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:20.839
 voices coming 

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:23.629
 entering the building where the crime occurred 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.589
 hence the climate 

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:29.159
 then it comes to us, we need 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.639
 one thing 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:33.739
 not much 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.889
 advised 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:38.889
 but this one voting here afterwards 

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:42.799
 improvement of the lesion 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.769
 as well as many adjustments 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.809
 remembering that the one that you choose the type of voice nÃ© 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:50.090
 in two voices this additional 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.090
 the world 

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:58.259
 the selected the voices of the world to nintendo 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:00.709
 O 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.709
 the ones selected in 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:16.319
 here I have every attempt touching in my case that pain 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.829
 I hear about it - 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.789
 an important tip when putting it here and the voice 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:31.599
 beware 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:36.550
 I suggest that you always put interval lower then that such a 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.900
 third lower 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.620
 if you come to 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.340
 an upper range 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.340
 I suggest you do not go above 

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:46.499
 of the top third, right? 

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:49.189
 and the sea 

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:52.139
 v 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.749
 From then on, it's been a long time since we started to paint, for example 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:02.169
 impracticable, right? 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:04.870
 the third article from Tuesday above still 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.710
 I could give a 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.710
 use 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.789
 but I still prefer the ranges below 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:16.789
 It is thus to be released to dictate the main 

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:19.349
 the last and most acute 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:24.569
 not infrequently also made more evident hides behind 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.180
 of the lawn 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:32.159
 plum tree 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:33.800
 Ah, little cool thing. 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.800
 Take it or here for me 50 is more than 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:39.759
 great 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:42.800
 yes you increase and it comes from the factory with senac 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:51.569
 theme 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:53.219
 but people 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:55.089
 Pleasing is too big. 

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:57.659
 so we'll boot 15 50 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:00.659
 what time do you listen there? 

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:06.189
 daiane does his job without 

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:09.020
 it is very unpleasant leaves 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.409
 the second voice 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:14.409
 Here I am using 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:16.550
 the top third 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.129
 so I had to start 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:22.469
 or dye it 

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:24.039
 it's a Tuesday 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:27.039
 now my mother is a she weighs low to 2 on Tuesday 5 

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:47.379
 rel 

00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:52.959
 venice the big hug hug guys and see you around
