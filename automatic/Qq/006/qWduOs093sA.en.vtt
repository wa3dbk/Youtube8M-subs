horizontal slot in the soil and closed

horizontal slot in the soil and closed
very<00:00:34.530> efficiently

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
very efficiently

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.069 
very efficiently
well<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.820> main<00:00:35.969> fight<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.510> very<00:00:36.719> low

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
well the main fight is the very low

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.530 
well the main fight is the very low
disturbance<00:00:37.770> all<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.399> can<00:00:38.520> see<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.879> narrow

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
disturbance all you can see is a narrow

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.080 
disturbance all you can see is a narrow
slot<00:00:39.840> in<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.110> ground<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.649> what<00:00:41.489> other<00:00:41.670> drivel

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
slot in the ground and what other drivel

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.970 
slot in the ground and what other drivel
you<00:00:42.149> see<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.690> lot<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.870> brown<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.410> which<00:00:43.829> of

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
you see a lot of brown so which of

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.610 
you see a lot of brown so which of
course<00:00:44.040> who's<00:00:44.399> destroying<00:00:44.940> soil<00:00:45.930> biology<00:00:46.110> and

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
course who's destroying soil biology and

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.220 
course who's destroying soil biology and
perhaps<00:00:47.070> allowing<00:00:47.489> moisture<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.940> escape

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
perhaps allowing moisture to escape

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.590 
perhaps allowing moisture to escape
because<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.350> blade<00:00:49.559> runs<00:00:50.000> really<00:00:51.000> tight<00:00:51.360> to

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
because the blade runs really tight to

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.080 
because the blade runs really tight to
the<00:00:51.750> disc<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.890> allows<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.219> drill<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.879> any

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
the disc it allows you to drill in any

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.760 
the disc it allows you to drill in any
sort<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.360> residue<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:55.320> we<00:00:55.410> can<00:00:55.530> drill<00:00:55.680> into

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
sort of residue so we can drill into

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.490 
sort of residue so we can drill into
cover<00:00:56.039> crops<00:00:56.399> or<00:00:56.809> we<00:00:57.809> could<00:00:57.960> drill<00:00:58.109> into<00:00:58.379> an

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
cover crops or we could drill into an

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.889 
cover crops or we could drill into an
old<00:00:58.620> sward<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.309> rejuvenate<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.239> very

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
old sward and rejuvenate it very

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.740 
old sward and rejuvenate it very
successfully<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.590> lose<00:01:01.800> any<00:01:01.980> moisture

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.960 

what<00:01:08.750> gives<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:09.440> cross<00:01:09.800> light<00:01:09.980> its<00:01:10.130> name<00:01:10.340> is

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
what gives the cross light its name is

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.540 
what gives the cross light its name is
this<00:01:11.180> wing<00:01:11.480> here<00:01:11.900> there's<00:01:12.800> a<00:01:12.890> horizontal<00:01:13.130> flap

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
this wing here there's a horizontal flap

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.790 
this wing here there's a horizontal flap
of<00:01:13.730> soil<00:01:14.000> to<00:01:14.510> enable<00:01:14.900> the<00:01:15.050> seed<00:01:15.260> to<00:01:15.410> be<00:01:15.440> left<00:01:15.680> on

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
of soil to enable the seed to be left on

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.670 
of soil to enable the seed to be left on
a<00:01:15.860> Ledge<00:01:16.070> about<00:01:16.400> here<00:01:17.200> and<00:01:18.200> this<00:01:18.380> pressure

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
a Ledge about here and this pressure

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.350 
a Ledge about here and this pressure
will<00:01:18.890> controls<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.430> depth<00:01:19.670> and<00:01:19.820> just<00:01:20.030> seals

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
will controls the depth and just seals

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.330 
will controls the depth and just seals
that<00:01:20.479> slot<00:01:20.900> back<00:01:21.050> up<00:01:21.200> again<00:01:23.440> depth<00:01:24.440> control<00:01:24.770> is

that slot back up again depth control is
by<00:01:25.580> this<00:01:25.729> turnbuckle<00:01:26.420> here<00:01:27.070> and<00:01:28.070> just<00:01:28.280> lifts

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
by this turnbuckle here and just lifts

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.100 
by this turnbuckle here and just lifts
or<00:01:28.760> lowers<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:29.330> press<00:01:29.540> wheels<00:01:31.780> we've<00:01:32.780> put<00:01:33.020> the

or lowers the press wheels we've put the

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.510 
or lowers the press wheels we've put the
fan<00:01:33.320> on<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:33.500> back<00:01:33.680> of<00:01:33.830> the<00:01:33.890> drill<00:01:34.070> just<00:01:34.250> simply

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
fan on the back of the drill just simply

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.010 
fan on the back of the drill just simply
to<00:01:34.610> take<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:34.880> noise<00:01:35.090> of<00:01:35.330> that<00:01:35.420> away<00:01:35.690> from<00:01:35.900> the

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
to take the noise of that away from the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.380 
to take the noise of that away from the
operator<00:01:36.470> we've<00:01:37.220> made<00:01:37.430> it<00:01:37.610> easy<00:01:38.000> to<00:01:38.210> maintain

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
operator we've made it easy to maintain

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.570 
operator we've made it easy to maintain
because<00:01:39.170> you<00:01:39.320> can<00:01:39.440> just<00:01:39.619> lift<00:01:39.800> these<00:01:39.979> wings<00:01:40.340> up

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
because you can just lift these wings up

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.889 
because you can just lift these wings up
and<00:01:40.610> get<00:01:40.940> them<00:01:41.030> at<00:01:41.149> convenient<00:01:41.570> height<00:01:41.750> to

and get them at convenient height to

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.260 
and get them at convenient height to
grease<00:01:42.140> or<00:01:42.350> change<00:01:42.619> wearing<00:01:42.950> metal<00:01:46.210> this<00:01:47.210> is
