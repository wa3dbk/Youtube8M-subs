instance let's say you're using the Vudu
service<00:00:51.270> well<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.930> means<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.440> can<00:00:52.649> actually

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
service well that means you can actually

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.250 
service well that means you can actually
take<00:00:53.340> those<00:00:53.579> files<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.510> you're<00:00:54.690> using<00:00:54.960> that

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
take those files that you're using that

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.720 
take those files that you're using that
you're<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.469> buying<00:00:55.949> or<00:00:56.160> purchasing<00:00:56.579> or<00:00:56.699> renting

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
usually with Vudu you've got a computing

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.609 
usually with Vudu you've got a computing
cloud<00:01:03.120> that's<00:01:03.390> actually<00:01:03.840> delivering<00:01:04.260> all<00:01:04.530> of

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
level of a media server which is really

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.530 
level of a media server which is really
neat<00:01:31.740> now<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.340> technology<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.299> hard

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
neat now the technology on the hard

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.420 
neat now the technology on the hard
drive<00:01:33.750> works<00:01:33.960> both<00:01:34.200> ways<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:34.890> not<00:01:35.100> only<00:01:35.189> can

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
drive works both ways so not only can

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.039 
drive works both ways so not only can
you<00:01:35.579> put<00:01:35.759> information<00:01:35.970> on<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.630> draw<00:01:36.810> but<00:01:36.990> you

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
you put information on the draw but you

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.990 
you put information on the draw but you
can<00:01:37.170> also<00:01:37.350> take<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.710> off<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.310> can<00:01:38.460> take<00:01:38.700> things

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
can also take it off you can take things

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.190 
can also take it off you can take things
stored<00:01:39.270> on<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.479> drive<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.720> put<00:01:39.990> them<00:01:40.079> on<00:01:40.170> a

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
stored on the drive and put them on a

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.289

so let's say you put an auto your CD in

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.899 
so let's say you put an auto your CD in
there<00:01:58.680> well<00:01:59.219> this<00:01:59.399> device<00:01:59.579> will

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
there well this device will

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.910 
there well this device will
automatically<00:02:00.360> connect<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.810> Gracenote<00:02:01.590> and

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.850 
if you get a numerical track listing
much<00:02:15.420> less<00:02:15.660> you<00:02:16.020> know<00:02:16.110> all<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.440> information

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
much less you know all the information

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.640
