00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.550
 We want to find a smaller common multiplier for 30 and 25 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.850
 So let's get out our diary 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.160
 We are the ones who care about us 30 and 25 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.820
 I work using analysis to initial factors 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.560
 I love the way di 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.080
 So let us begin by finding the primary factors 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.160
 For both of the two numbers 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.470
 The 30 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.520
 Equal to 2 * 15 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.160
 And 15 equals 3 * 5 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.770
 Now we have expressed the 30 as a hit 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.030
 Preparing the primer is 2 multiplied by 3 multiplied by 5 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.360
 Deloitte has the same process but with 25 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.357
 25 are only 5 multiplied by 5 

00:00:41.357 --> 00:00:42.440
 Flendon is so 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.060
 25 = 5 * 5 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.000
 Now we find the smaller common multiplier 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.870
 The smaller common multiplier 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:00.320
 For 25 and 30 will be a number 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.510
 The analysis of its initial factors is a set of 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.370
 The figures we extracted from the analysis 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.734
 The same number of times the number came out of the analysis 

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:10.150
 So the smaller common multiplier 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.050
 You must accept the section on 30 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:18.360
 So the number must be multiplied by 2 at 3 in 5 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.220
 The section will accept 30 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.740
 But it is necessary to accept the oath on 25 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.010
 In order to accept the section on 25 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.430
 You need to keep your number 5 in the analysis 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.210
 At the moment the analysis is fun in 5 one 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.885
 Let us think 

00:01:34.885 --> 00:01:36.260
 We have 5 now 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.110
 They need 5 seconds 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.670
 Let's put another 5 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.550
 Now the figure has become a multiplication of 25 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.110
 Thus the section is accepted to 25 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.040
 And thanks to him we got the smaller common multiplier 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.797
 If only we wanted to get a common multiplier 

00:01:50.797 --> 00:01:52.380
 We can put other factors in Hannah 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.000
 You will definitely accept the section on 30 and 25 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.340
 But the number is the one with the lowest number 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.060
 One of the first possible factors to accept 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.210
 Section on 25 and 30 if you try to get rid of any 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.950
 Of those factors will not be divisible by partition 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.170
 Any of the two numbers if you get rid of 2 will not become 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.670
 Interviewed by Ali 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.860
 If I get rid of any 5 I will not accept the partition on 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.610
 After that 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.860
 So let us beat them together 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.680
 This is the first analysis of 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.540
 Smaller subscriber multiplier 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:23.230
 It equals 2 multiplied by 3 = 6 and 6 * 5 = 30 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.810
 And 5 * 30 = 150 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.630
 Certainly we can make sure of the correctness, 150 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.340
 Make sure of them. And we got the right answer
