was<00:00:56.000> the<00:00:56.120> hardest<00:00:56.329> part<00:00:56.540> about<00:00:56.809> this<00:00:57.110> whole

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
was the hardest part about this whole

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.080 
was the hardest part about this whole
process<00:00:57.559> since<00:00:57.980> the<00:00:58.160> time<00:00:58.370> you<00:00:58.399> got<00:00:58.730> injured

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090

in<00:00:59.239> in<00:00:59.480> this<00:00:59.750> building<00:01:00.140> I<00:01:00.260> see<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:00.710> hardest

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
in in this building I see the hardest

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.799 
in in this building I see the hardest
part<00:01:01.250> probably<00:01:01.489> going<00:01:01.969> to<00:01:02.090> become<00:01:02.210> on<00:01:02.570> it<00:01:02.750> i

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
part probably going to become on it i

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.450 
part probably going to become on it i
mean<00:01:02.960> you<00:01:03.380> tell<00:01:03.620> them<00:01:03.800> all<00:01:03.920> everything<00:01:04.370> that

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
mean you tell them all everything that

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.460 
mean you tell them all everything that
you<00:01:04.610> can<00:01:04.790> do<00:01:04.970> it<00:01:05.120> but<00:01:05.420> you<00:01:05.840> believe<00:01:06.110> you<00:01:06.200> can<00:01:06.350> do

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
you can do it but you believe you can do

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.930 
you can do it but you believe you can do
but<00:01:06.620> you<00:01:06.740> can't<00:01:06.950> actually<00:01:07.100> show<00:01:07.430> them<00:01:07.580> solid

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
but you can't actually show them solid

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.100 
but you can't actually show them solid
say<00:01:08.090> that<00:01:08.240> was<00:01:08.330> probably<00:01:08.510> one<00:01:08.750> of<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:08.870> hardest

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
say that was probably one of the hardest

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.780 
say that was probably one of the hardest
things<00:01:09.350> cuz<00:01:09.560> have<00:01:09.830> to<00:01:09.979> watch<00:01:10.190> the<00:01:10.430> combine

already<00:02:21.989> I<00:02:22.319> mean<00:02:22.800> coaches<00:02:23.160> already<00:02:23.370> know<00:02:23.489> what

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
whether if he has to sit out or not I

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.479 
whether if he has to sit out or not I
mean<00:02:31.080> it<00:02:31.260> shows<00:02:31.440> that<00:02:31.650> he's<00:02:32.010> gonna<00:02:32.160> still<00:02:32.459> be

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
for the most part union with the DB

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.580 
for the most part union with the DB
coaches<00:03:09.660> and<00:03:09.840> when<00:03:09.930> you<00:03:10.019> do<00:03:10.140> your<00:03:10.230> formal

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
coaches and when you do your formal

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.170

interviews<00:03:10.950> at<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.130> combine<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:11.760> meet<00:03:12.000> with

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
interviews at the combine you meet with

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.500

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
the owners and head coach so they don't

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.030 
the owners and head coach so they don't
really<00:03:15.570> that's<00:03:15.989> probably<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.680> first<00:03:16.859> time

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
really that's probably the first time

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.380 
really that's probably the first time
that<00:03:17.100> they<00:03:17.340> actually<00:03:17.459> get<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:17.790> meet<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:18.209> so

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
that they actually get to meet you so

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.819 
that they actually get to meet you so
now<00:03:18.570> they're<00:03:18.750> starting<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:19.109> evaluate<00:03:19.650> players

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
now they're starting to evaluate players

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.670 
now they're starting to evaluate players
and<00:03:20.220> you'll<00:03:21.150> probably<00:03:21.269> get<00:03:21.570> a<00:03:21.630> better<00:03:22.560> look

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
and you'll probably get a better look

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.500 
and you'll probably get a better look
towards<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.310> end<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.519> April<00:03:23.880> what<00:03:24.359> are<00:03:24.420> you

and practice i'm thinking September but

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.030 
and practice i'm thinking September but
from<00:03:30.510> there<00:03:30.660> really<00:03:30.930> just<00:03:31.109> depends<00:03:31.410> on<00:03:31.590> how

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040

comfortable you feel and I mean it's

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.210 
comfortable you feel and I mean it's
different<00:03:34.049> from<00:03:34.109> practice<00:03:34.590> to<00:03:34.739> plant<00:03:35.070> in<00:03:35.190> the
