00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.340
 hello very vast which I am be here 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.690
 told rivas a little bit more today I come to 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.830
 bring is the following technique that you 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.900
 I promised that it was going to be a technique 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.519
 difficult so nothing are going to start 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.169
 because we are in a hurry you know 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.269
 this is as fast as possible so what 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:16.860
 first lace distances I said it the 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.000
 last time the distance for this 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.550
 technique we will need a distance 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.110
 minimum of 190 that little bit more even 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.490
 ok but that distance is 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.800
 advisable then first thing we go to 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.080
 do is going to be press efe let's go to 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.750
 contract the left pectoral and the 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.390
 straight 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.270
 we raise our shoulders rise in both 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:39.650
 shoulders and here we do in the 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.940
 abdominals to see if I remember the 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:46.790
 We extend the abdominals 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:50.600
 ok with we bring the bleach 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.310
 with we bring left or extend left and 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.070
 hell you see that all this is going 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.480
 back is the same with the other good side 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.670
 I will also leave a notepad 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.250
 with a word where he taught them 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.420
 continuously so nothing are we going to give to 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.860
 space 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.340
 space 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.350
 space space space you have all the 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.190
 steps in the place that I'm going to 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.770
 spend it 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:19.130
 we give another space and there we make a 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:23.149
 extending with both knees 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.990
 we will find both ankles and we will 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.899
 see what happens 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.840
 we give space twice and there we make a 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.189
 tear off 40 thousand head a technique 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.409
 really strong 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.090
 as I always say then finish it as 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.009
 you want but as you see to get up you have 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.780
 seen where I command the head really 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.390
 far is more does not give time to fall 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.580
 but well you can continue it is a 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.500
 bestially strong technique is that 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.390
 has no point of comparison with the 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.340
 other the only thing that the other character 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.690
 It has to be still and as I did the 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.550
 last time I will teach you in the 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.100
 multiplayer so for now we're going to 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.450
 see how effective it is and see you later 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.280
 and good if you see I am here and we are going to see 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.900
 How is the fight going? Let's start 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.570
 to do it fast this time I do not explain it 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:09.030
 because no hurry and is a technique 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.000
 It takes a while to see extending 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.319
 and I've gone to a public room as much as 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.650
 similar to what we were looking for 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.060
 it's not exact but technically good if 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.420
 the more or less approaching should 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.190
 function 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.110
 as you see the movement would be here 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.959
 because they have spent here spend much more 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.130
 but I can take turns everything 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.950
 you want to hold moving more 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.600
 little more but it's going to be pretty I see it 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.580
 quite difficult 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.790
 so let's get a little more contracted 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.400
 legs but I'm telling you for the 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.920
 online this technique serves us as you see 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.340
 I can give a whole mortal 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.520
 It is very very good 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.410
 except for that because it does not work 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.880
 it's a shit I'll wait for one more turn 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.480
 to practically give it a leg 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.519
 at the end more than anything 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.050
 as a starting technique if you have to 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.780
 advance for example in percussion more 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.840
 well it 's fine it's not the best way what 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.890
 it is better to walk but good serves so 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.830
 nothing now or try to win the fight 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:12.020
 you have seen that this technique has failed 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.700
 completely but good 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.640
 the techniques are not only for 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.950
 multiplayer I told you this technique 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.000
 there will be no multiplayer served him 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.590
 He is trying so let's see how 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.540
 follow the fight because the moment does not 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.060
 we have hurt ourselves 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.770
 it's worth nothing has left me a blow 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.930
 our way that can not be touched and I 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.910
 has disqualified so nothing 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.500
 enough of thanks 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.020
