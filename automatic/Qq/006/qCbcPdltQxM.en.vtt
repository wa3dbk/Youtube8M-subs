00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
do is we are gonna carefully use a knife

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.490 
do is we are gonna carefully use a knife
or<00:00:59.969> some<00:01:00.270> tool<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.629> can<00:01:00.750> use<00:01:00.809> pliers<00:01:01.140> if<00:01:01.410> you

or some tool you can use pliers if you
want<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:02.039> snap<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.640> corners<00:01:03.030> off<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.989> way<00:01:04.110> it

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
want to snap the corners off that way it

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.780 
want to snap the corners off that way it
will<00:01:04.260> sink<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.710> little<00:01:04.799> bit<00:01:04.949> deeper<00:01:05.070> depending

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
will sink a little bit deeper depending

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.429 
will sink a little bit deeper depending
on<00:01:05.909> how<00:01:06.030> big<00:01:06.240> your<00:01:06.360> acoustic<00:01:06.570> cases<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.320> can

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
on how big your acoustic cases that can

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.440 
on how big your acoustic cases that can
be<00:01:07.560> important<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.220> I'll<00:01:08.760> show<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.030> after<00:01:09.360> we

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
be important so I'll show you after we

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:17.810 
be important so I'll show you after we
have<00:01:09.600> all<00:01:09.869> four<00:01:10.110> corners<00:01:10.409> snapped<00:01:11.100> off

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.160 

so<00:01:18.820> now<00:01:18.970> you<00:01:19.030> can<00:01:19.210> see<00:01:19.360> we<00:01:19.480> left<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:19.750> corner<00:01:19.990> to

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
so now you can see we left the corner to

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.560 
so now you can see we left the corner to
pop<00:01:20.320> off<00:01:20.940> depending<00:01:21.940> on<00:01:22.060> which<00:01:22.270> type<00:01:22.540> of

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
pop off depending on which type of

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.790 
pop off depending on which type of
subcarrier<00:01:23.290> you<00:01:23.470> have<00:01:25.170> okay<00:01:26.170> so<00:01:26.200> now<00:01:26.530> just

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
subcarrier you have okay so now just

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.100 
subcarrier you have okay so now just
together<00:01:27.160> pretty<00:01:27.520> nice<00:01:27.790> pretty<00:01:28.330> thin<00:01:28.840> and

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
together pretty nice pretty thin and

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.760 
together pretty nice pretty thin and
this<00:01:29.920> is<00:01:30.040> the<00:01:30.130> part<00:01:30.400> where<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:35.110> I'm<00:01:35.290> just<00:01:35.560> going

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
this is the part where so I'm just going

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.670 
this is the part where so I'm just going
to<00:01:35.830> drill<00:01:36.460> the<00:01:36.580> holes<00:01:36.790> just<00:01:37.619> like<00:01:38.619> this

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
to drill the holes just like this

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.760 
to drill the holes just like this
careful<00:01:41.680> not<00:01:41.770> to<00:01:41.920> drill<00:01:42.130> all<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.460> way<00:01:42.490> and<00:01:43.770> now

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
careful not to drill all the way and now

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.260 
careful not to drill all the way and now
we'll<00:01:44.979> speed<00:01:45.220> up<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.430> video<00:01:45.550> and<00:01:46.000> just<00:01:46.119> show

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
we'll speed up the video and just show

00:01:46.270 --> 00:02:14.380 
we'll speed up the video and just show
you<00:01:46.300> as<00:01:46.540> I<00:01:46.660> do

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.170 

at<00:02:15.390> this<00:02:16.170> point<00:02:16.470> your<00:02:17.370> resurrection<00:02:17.640> plant

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
at this point your resurrection plant

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.520 
at this point your resurrection plant
should<00:02:18.420> approximately<00:02:19.020> look<00:02:19.140> like<00:02:19.290> this

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
should approximately look like this

00:02:19.530 --> 00:03:23.890 
should approximately look like this
we're<00:02:20.130> halfway<00:02:20.400> through<00:02:20.870> your<00:03:18.170> planet<00:03:19.170> we've

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.080 

actually<00:03:24.900> perhaps<00:03:25.500> we<00:03:25.709> should<00:03:29.060> now<00:03:30.060> that

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
actually perhaps we should now that

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.020 
actually perhaps we should now that
tests<00:03:30.540> were<00:03:30.990> conceived<00:03:31.320> our<00:03:31.500> sponges<00:03:31.890> I'm<00:03:32.100> or

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
tests were conceived our sponges I'm or

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.830 
tests were conceived our sponges I'm or
exactly

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:51.830

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
soaking wet you'll notice that they're a

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.180 
soaking wet you'll notice that they're a
little<00:03:57.120> bit<00:03:57.300> too<00:03:57.569> big<00:03:57.810> for<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:58.110> container<00:03:58.470> now

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
we're not gonna just do any hack job and

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.320 
we're not gonna just do any hack job and
squish<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:01.620> in<00:04:01.860> there<00:04:02.040> like<00:04:02.160> this<00:04:02.400> we're<00:04:03.090> going

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
squish it in there like this we're going

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.150 
squish it in there like this we're going
to<00:04:03.450> trim<00:04:03.870> it<00:04:03.900> off<00:04:04.140> to<00:04:04.410> make<00:04:04.560> sure<00:04:04.739> it<00:04:04.860> fits

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160

question how often do I need to resew

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.340 
question how often do I need to resew
piece<00:05:23.160> I<00:05:23.400> would<00:05:24.060> recommend<00:05:24.570> soaking<00:05:24.780> it<00:05:25.110> every

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
piece I would recommend soaking it every

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.420 
piece I would recommend soaking it every
week

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
week

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.680 
week
think<00:05:27.790> you<00:05:27.910> need<00:05:28.090> to<00:05:28.120> if<00:05:28.389> you<00:05:28.479> have<00:05:28.600> an

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
think you need to if you have an

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.920 
think you need to if you have an
airtight<00:05:28.900> guitar<00:05:29.830> case<00:05:30.100> then<00:05:31.000> every<00:05:31.660> two

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
airtight guitar case then every two

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.780 
airtight guitar case then every two
weeks<00:05:32.139> is<00:05:32.259> probably<00:05:32.560> sufficient<00:05:33.130> and<00:05:33.699> of

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
weeks is probably sufficient and of

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.490 
weeks is probably sufficient and of
course<00:05:34.060> you<00:05:34.240> don't<00:05:34.419> need<00:05:34.630> one<00:05:34.810> of<00:05:34.840> these<00:05:35.020> in<00:05:35.320> a

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
course you don't need one of these in a

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.350 
course you don't need one of these in a
sucker<00:05:35.740> unless<00:05:36.669> you<00:05:36.820> live<00:05:37.000> in<00:05:37.150> the<00:05:37.240> Arctic

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
sucker unless you live in the Arctic

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.330 
sucker unless you live in the Arctic
because<00:05:38.259> the<00:05:38.410> summer<00:05:38.620> time<00:05:38.889> has<00:05:39.100> enough

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
because the summer time has enough

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:45.420 
because the summer time has enough
humidity<00:05:39.900> you'll<00:05:40.900> be<00:05:41.020> good<00:05:41.139> to<00:05:41.199> go<00:05:44.280> we<00:05:45.280> only

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
humidity you'll be good to go we only

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.159 
humidity you'll be good to go we only
have<00:05:45.580> one<00:05:45.789> thing<00:05:45.970> left<00:05:46.030> to<00:05:46.240> do<00:05:46.449> before<00:05:46.870> we<00:05:46.900> put

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
have one thing left to do before we put

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.980 
have one thing left to do before we put
in<00:05:47.229> our<00:05:47.380> guitar<00:05:47.710> case<00:05:47.919> and<00:05:48.490> that<00:05:48.820> is<00:05:49.000> to<00:05:49.240> dry

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
in our guitar case and that is to dry

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:56.159
