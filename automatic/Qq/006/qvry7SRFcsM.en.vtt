00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.319
 a video in collaboration with our lives 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.179

 distil fishing ti or dita von teese 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.639
 however we have a little remastered new 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.949

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.550
 that you will appreciate mobile phones I 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.410
 first of all apply abbas to 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.699
 with a matte finish all over the 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.910
 eyelid mobile and flush with eyelashes 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.910
 lower 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.960
 I am applying a belchamp lighthouse 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.280
 the brow bone that with this base 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.079
 will be holding all day 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.940
 you have to apply with a flat brush 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.010
 tapping and being taken to 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.340
 outside and down to the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.340
 mobile eyelid 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.260
 I then take a farmar duclair and 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.600
 play click in the wide cros with a 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.210
 bull brush and I make small buy 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.010
 comes from left to right of the inner corner 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.720
 towards the stern point for many shots 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.990
 and the matter and for it to end 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.150
 well 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.160
 with the brow bone for more 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.440
 define my crau wide but use a 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.330
 brown lighthouse a little darker than the 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.190
 first who plays applied in the pot 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.140
 wide and I then pull them to the 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.240
 outer corner and then I'm going to sounds 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.830
 peace with a brush bond arms for 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.830
 to have an even more idle rendering 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.390
 you take a pop rock brush and you 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.160
 rest is paid the same area needs 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:51.220
 little cat these circulars and eti is going 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:54.010
 and comes again I then ask a 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.900
 headlight cream-colored matte all over the 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.730
 mobile eyelid such as pat with a 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.380
 flat brush but this time I'm going 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.960
 not to drop in pro wide or 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.630
 to highlight the two colors 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.610
 me marot and beige without mixing them 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.610
 to make a kind of crisis 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.510
 and I have illuminated your eyes 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.860
 using a beige lighthouse a clear goal 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.420
 an internal point 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:39.709
 he remains at the leap going back to 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:42.590
 inside we pass the primordial stage 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.629
 This make the installation of the liner so 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.810
 I make a very thick liner and very 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:50.090
 stretched or old-fashioned so for this 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.440
 times I'm going to use an intruder and by 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.510
 liquid air lines for what I want 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.060
 we put the application is really 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.099
 perfect and with the liquid liners in has 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.110
 often tend to drool weiner 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.690
 so loved that dries a little more 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.730
 slowly and with a chocolate gel 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.670
 much easier maneuverability 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.190
 with the principles so I prefer this 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.340
 method anyway I'm going to take my 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.430
 time we are relaxed we are in a hurry 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.970
 not and it allows the mother but really 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.970
 nickel 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.290
 I prepare the ground by applying 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.430
 mascara because by situating 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.430
 applied but fossils 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.460
 I pose then put fossils this time 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.540
 these are false eyelashes quite imposing 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:59.400
 I think it's a makeup 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.930
 in which we highlight especially 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.800
 the eyes soft but as possible 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.800
 they are developed 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.400
 with the application of fossils really 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.530
 imposing I look a little bit 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.150
 leaded so I used a cruel for 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.220
 the opener just prefer to use 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.750
 from pej to whites because white 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.940
 do not at all our frail and peach 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:34.500
 I find that so good alternative and the 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:36.390
 rendering is more natural I apply 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.490
 then a light brown lighthouse so that's 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.630
 the cock or worse of my customers want 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.370
 apply in their haste if the stone 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.930
 with a flat brush and I do relay 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.930
 who comes and goes to stop them 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.450
 and I also put mascara on 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.450
 lower lashes 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.790
 so it's a mascara that's 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:06.400
 specially adapted for the 6 of ras of 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:09.300
 eyelashes with brush and nice landry do you 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.300
 lose my two best apps 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.040
 we go to the heel I'm going to use a 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.290
 stuffing worship years to dig but plays 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.330
 we want to use a principle hours they 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.890
 have come and go on the temples and we 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.890
 go back to book 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.360
 I'm actually going to ask my blog so a 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:44.160
 rather red color blush that pulls 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.500
 a little on the brown zug when 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.389
 goes everywhere on my skin I like 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.860
 use them with with all 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:53.240
 makeup because I find they 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.240
 fit all geeks 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.479
 and we end with the student of whom I 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.870
 will use that comes in at ease 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:10.610
 matte so to get married will bring to 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.370
 red left because for me the 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.840
 red symbolizes the makeup kinect by 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.659
 excellence for me it's classic 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.550
 it's glamorous is there that represents 

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:22.659
 full show really feminine so here we go 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.659
 it's the color that I prefer 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.150
 and to finish 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.850
 the application of the mole so 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.199
 I have no natural damage 

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:15.360
 so the Greeks embarrass us on time and a 

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:18.270
 very small precision fault brush it's 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:22.110
 fun and that was also the 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:23.520
 pinup makeup according to me I hope that 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.930
