00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.920
 hello very good today I'm going to make a video 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:10.999
 to explain basically what it's for 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:13.969
 the touch that there are tools that when 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:16.699
 the love you get touch of silk I have 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.880
 here some is testing and more I'm going to 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:18.880
 do 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.810
 so that you go looking at different 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.410
 I have not tried it 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.590
 so it can be anything 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.630
 the first thing to get the block of 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:42.670
 grass what herbs and horses with a 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:44.690
 normal stick the diamond made by 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:50.120
 diamond that can be made of stone can 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:52.969
 be in a way that I get 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.469
 one of normal earth but it is done with 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.890
 this one that has touches of silk and the 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:56.890
 second 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.330
 it comes out 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.840
 you leave block of grass if this one 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.840
 arrives 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.900
 good 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.970
 we leave this there 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.490
 good ice bed the ice can be 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.800
 get a lot of people do not know me 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.800
 it seems that yes 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:34.560
 I do not know what 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.560
 put the management they put it but it 's 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.070
 if you do it with the normal peak it breaks 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.720
 and it is already 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.040
 if you do it with the peak of touch of 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.040
 silk that gets 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.660
 so we get it 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.680
 another plus rest lamps 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.900
 lit 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.430
 they are the rest because 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.430
 who has the shoe for parents 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:10.280
 and this was with the peak if I took it and the 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.280
 broke with the beak that come out lit 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.390
 if you break them with the normal peak then you 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.390
 they are off 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.290
 happy and from these for me I could idea because 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.290
 when you put them to pay but good 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.350
 these taxes 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.170
 to something else 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.910
 the mushrooms these mushrooms are in appear in 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.210
 mushroom biomes 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.980
 of the mushroom cows is very difficult 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.810
 find but you can also do them 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.420
 these mushrooms you if there is a hole 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.770
 of 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.959
 gap 8 x 8 x 8 high and raises 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.020
 a 7 gives a thousand or a mushroom will come out 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:55.500
 it looked like this and you have are totally 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:59.310
 dark or good this is asshole but 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.260
 if you break the rates and then you do not know 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.800
 nothing good there's a chance that 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.800
 be tired 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:12.160
 but if it breaks with the ax of touch with 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.160
 touches of silk or the block will come out 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.950
 go from the block 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.150
 and what is this for? 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:31.950
 to decorate and you're done 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:34.080
 here is michelle me the mycelium in the 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.910
 land that appears in the language of the 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.490
 wax you're where the mushroom cows come from 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.970
 which is very difficult to get 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:45.230
 Well, if you break it with a normal shovel, 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.230
 one normal earth comes out 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.569
 I'm going to put it here to stay there 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.409
 but if he breaks it with the 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.829
 of touch of silk breaks is very fast 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:57.829
 because it has 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.170
 a lot 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.319
 in efficiency credits then 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.450
 the frame coefficient 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.230
 Well, what if you break it against AIDS? 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.230
 or mystery comes out 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.770
 in case one day I found it 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:20.049
 otherwise the oven can get 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.049
 also a furnace turned on looking 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.560
 and could win 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.340
 no 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.210
 while it is on if the clothes with 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.210
 the touch of silk 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:40.740
 how many things come out 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.740
 and we get 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:44.480
 because it does not come out 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.040
 controls 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.040
 I've seen this I was a page 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.690
 the eye just a coal 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.430
 if you have nothing 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:11.689
 good a fail what is not to prove it 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:15.019
 before I do not know anymore I thought so but no 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:16.969
 other things and lastly what's 

00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:19.230
 get blocks and get one of 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:22.080
 these are achieved 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.470
 perfection diamonds and saving that 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:28.550
 get in the pleasant 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:31.760
 the coal the carbon and the connector that 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.650
 one coal comes out 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.660
 and break the looks the lounge 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:39.420
 emeralds and breaks still 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:42.800
 with the triumph this is or the following 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.800
 and so everything 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.210
 Rest 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.730
 and with the arrest 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:00.110
 but I also understood that if so 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.110
 and they launch day 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:07.770
 I could break it and it would come out 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.590
 but no 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.110
 Well, it's already 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:17.410
 put what can break we review the 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:23.470
 several blocks that are coal the rest 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:23.470
 emeralds diamond and lapis lazuli 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.229
 the iron if you break it ts from the mine 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.150
 iron the gold if it breaks it out of the 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:35.580
 gold mine and then you have to love it 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:35.580
 others are the oven on 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.960
 the mycelium that is the land of the 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:45.020
 biomass of the cow 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.630
 the mushrooms that we have seen before 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:51.850
 lamps of burning remains that 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.850
 we see that they go out after putting it 

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:59.870
 but good if you want to have the stops 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:07:02.810
 I go to the ice that is 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:04.330
 we have not seen before and the blocks of 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:07.870
 grass 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:10.440
 I hope you have liked to subscribe 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:15.140
 and you will have more curiosities 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:15.140
 and nothing until the next video
