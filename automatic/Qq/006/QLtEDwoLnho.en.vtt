00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.790
 all winter now as much as desired 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.859
 this winter 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.469
 not even the time to realize it and 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.370
 spring is coming, there are no more 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.549
 half seasons 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.650
 the rivers garage there money on and remember 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.980
 to remove the blanket if ready 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.750
 start rocket but you are sure of 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.080
 be ready for a new season in 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.180
 bike remember to remove the blanket 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.490
 I'm sure so, but I want to propose to you 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.289
 the same you have to go through together like 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.540
 facing it before it was in motion is the auction 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:38.280
 hello how to face your first lap 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:42.440
 in motorbike of the season first 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.440
 remember that you have enemies out there 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.559
 nice those don't look in the face 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.170
 nobody 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:51.780
 it's mom look at me and i should have 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.600
 afraid of something you jerk 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.760
 you should exclude the maximum imperative 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.340
 to assign assign the superclassification of 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.360
 what kind of marketers who want badly 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.480
 who of you in the eighth place plait 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.310
 air france the bastard there is always species 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.960
 in which slow mountain hairpins where 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.610
 maybe you can accompany it by some 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.610
 trace of mud from the foliage 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.250
 dragged there by passing tractors 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.930
 in winter then the asphalt crumbles and 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.460
 in the darling of the other do a lot 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.740
 be careful because you can't find 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.840
 on the outside of the curve drop in 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.030
 entry when you go to disconnect or even 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.920
 in the middle of the curve and it is not beautiful 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.180
 at the end of winter you could also find 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.310
 of coarse salt 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.950
 another nice solution devised for 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.590
 take us out of the seventh place we find 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.119
 the duc 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.400
 even for them the winter was one 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.040
 dough and new ones were born too 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.500
 roads that you are sure to know 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.990
 the water penetrates and with the cold it swells 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.119
 the asphalt to create cracks o 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.070
 real craters in a while 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.290
 they will begin to touch them but it is not said 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.270
 that things will improve even sixth 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.940
 place for great classics of the good ones 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.430
 we become Italians and construction sites in this 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.970
 season the yards last longer and 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.620
 get dirty before and after don't forget 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.510
 moreover that on the mountain roads o 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.760
 coastal states may have been gods 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.200
 sagging or landslides due 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.630
 heavy rains 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.540
 adorable conquer fifth place 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.820
 the animals rouse you awake puma si 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.489
 they also wake up they have the best 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.470
 intentions but annoyingly await 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.019
 to get stuck in the middle of the street 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.510
 while you are getting dogs instead 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.930
 they tend to suddenly cross like this 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.360
 without looking at summer, eva arrives but in 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.710
 spring knows how to be insidious on the fourth 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.960
 her there 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.280
 water a storm can last longer 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.500
 de even colder 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.080
 so far it is rather elementary often 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.580
 but we forget the water of the rivulets 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.140
 that come down suddenly or 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.280
 of the frozen puddles we find 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.680
 on the mountain passes 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.780
 in short, a whole series of pitfalls 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.940
 which make the road more slippery not 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.390
 could be missing on the third step of the 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.600
 podium 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.430
 they are the cold temperatures you 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.770
 will seem trivial but I can assure you that 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.780
 as well as ruining your day can 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.850
 make your trip much more dangerous 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.020
 to cool down to much more consequences 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.870
 heavy of a simple cold 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.060
 because it can be the reflections or 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.490
 prevent you from performing correctly 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.470
 normal functions like braking the moment 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.050
 right or set up one correctly 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.700
 curve we greet you as brothers 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.220
 but sometimes they can be among the most 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.910
 threatening the pitfalls they are 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.220
 other riders you are prudent you are a 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.860
 but this is an excellent rider 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.490
 all tend to sopravvalutarci 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.230
 same way 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.910
 we tend to underestimate others 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.800
 riders who in turn yes 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.720
 they overestimate what I mean 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.370
 that you have to keep an eye on what 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.110
 others do because it is not said that 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.110
 they are all good but above all 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:52.540
 as prudent as ever 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.830
 unfailingly at the top of the rankings 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.180
 who hurt you 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:00.250
 they are careless drivers 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.870
 unfortunately they do not see us and especially in 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.240
 weekend roam around unaware of being 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.040
 steering wheel of the most lethal weapon 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.590
 no more bars need to be shown 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.210
 suddenly and when I saw a car it is 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.280
 very likely that those who are driving it 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.590
 don't be completely focused on that 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.980
 that does and even more so on what 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.980
 you do 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.170
 what you can do to bring it home 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.850
 Pellaccia I start from the basics some things 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.590
 that will sound like obvious but it's better 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.780
 don't take anything for granted 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.400
 first increase the distance from 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.440
 whoever precedes you is not just a question 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.420
 of reaction times it comes to 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.760
 being able to foresee what you 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.740
 what the motorist will do will happen 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.190
 or what is going to end up under the 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.780
 wheels 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.360
 if a lot you don't go that way 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.000
 even if your favorite street on the 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.180
 which holds the record of records not 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.650
 take it for granted that you know it 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.530
 possibly a warm up lap 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.210
 an inspection to see that everything is in 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.490
 order that winter but left 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.040
 surprises like dead branches leaves 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.340
 mud holes slit water rivulets 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.110
 iced craters guide yards with 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.210
 even more prudence than usual not 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.140
 vent all your desire immediately 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.700
 motion 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.520
 keep some gas in the pocket for 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.200
 when the road will be more welcoming 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.540
 savor and enjoy the fact that this is 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.490
 the first of many laps 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.440
 make sure you have everything in order 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.880
 a clean visor is essential but 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.640
 also have the appropriate equipment 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.440
 at the temperature the sun sets early 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.620
 temperatures drop quickly and 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.840
 better to have some extra garments from 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.270
 if necessary, always wear them 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.400
 behind a sweatshirt or a more 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.930
 simple rain also a 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.480
 Balaclava like this can turn out to be 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.160
 very useful if you want to tell you where 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.050
 you are headed for your first exit you can 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.330
 do it below in the comments 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.300
 or send me a mind of street 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.020
 snail motoretta punto.it find me 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.599
 also on twitter 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.099
 it very right thanks for attention 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:57.699
 and I recommend it from the gas but 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:57.699
 responsibly
