definitely be fine so when generating a

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.180 
definitely be fine so when generating a
world<00:00:50.600> after<00:00:51.600> that's<00:00:51.809> done<00:00:52.140> we<00:00:52.620> should<00:00:52.920> be<00:00:53.100> in

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
world after that's done we should be in

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.630 
world after that's done we should be in
a<00:00:53.280> channel<00:00:53.579> bio<00:00:54.559> so<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.770> thing<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.190> is

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
a channel bio so the thing is that is

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.930 
a channel bio so the thing is that is
new<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.329> game<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.829> channel<00:00:59.280> biome<00:00:59.730> is

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
new to the game in the channel biome is

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.020 
new to the game in the channel biome is
that<00:01:00.390> there's<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.690> new<00:01:01.109> mop<00:01:01.520> I've<00:01:02.520> been<00:01:02.820> waiting

will dep find it if you're running

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.670 
will dep find it if you're running
around<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.310> jungle<00:01:59.579> biome<00:02:00.030> like<00:02:00.469> this<00:02:01.469> for

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
around in a jungle biome like this for

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.940 
around in a jungle biome like this for
example<00:02:02.149> it's<00:02:03.149> pretty<00:02:03.630> rare<00:02:03.930> it's<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.649> little

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
example it's pretty rare it's a little

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.190 
example it's pretty rare it's a little
bit<00:02:05.219> like<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.610> wolves<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.600> had<00:02:07.020> to

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
bit like the wolves that you had to

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.120 
bit like the wolves that you had to
search<00:02:07.439> them<00:02:07.770> for<00:02:07.940> such<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.539> long<00:02:09.750> time

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
search them for such a long time

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.090 
search them for such a long time
until<00:02:10.880> you<00:02:11.030> finally<00:02:11.330> found<00:02:11.780> some<00:02:12.110> then<00:02:12.440> right

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
until you finally found some then right

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.920 
until you finally found some then right
now<00:02:13.310> it<00:02:13.490> feels<00:02:13.520> like<00:02:13.910> you're<00:02:14.180> finding<00:02:14.570> wolves

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
now it feels like you're finding wolves

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.830 
now it feels like you're finding wolves
all<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.470> time<00:02:15.710> but<00:02:16.160> yeah<00:02:17.000> it's<00:02:17.180> always<00:02:17.450> if
