is<00:02:18.990> you<00:02:19.830> would<00:02:19.920> think<00:02:20.190> just<00:02:20.520> by<00:02:20.610> looking<00:02:21.000> at

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
is you would think just by looking at

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.730 
is you would think just by looking at
them<00:02:21.180> just<00:02:21.540> by<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.750> way<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:22.050> game<00:02:22.200> plays<00:02:22.230> and

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
them just by the way the game plays and

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.490 
them just by the way the game plays and
I<00:02:22.830> kind<00:02:23.070> of<00:02:23.250> silliness<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.000> games<00:02:24.210> that

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.410 
I kind of silliness to the games that
they're<00:02:25.500> billed<00:02:25.890> for<00:02:26.010> children<00:02:26.730> they're

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
they're billed for children they're

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.750 
they're billed for children they're
really<00:02:27.540> not<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.740> games<00:02:28.980> themselves<00:02:29.220> are

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
really not the games themselves are

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.480 
really not the games themselves are
really<00:02:30.180> deep<00:02:30.470> like<00:02:31.470> if<00:02:31.680> you<00:02:31.770> like<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:31.980> Pokemon<00:02:32.340> X
