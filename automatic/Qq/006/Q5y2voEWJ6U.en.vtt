00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
two reasons for one thing we're gonna

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.540 
two reasons for one thing we're gonna
sear<00:00:54.719> these<00:00:54.960> steaks<00:00:55.289> with<00:00:55.739> temperatures<00:00:56.219> well

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
we're going to brine them not however in

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.590 
we're going to brine them not however in
a<00:01:02.219> liquid<00:01:02.730> we're<00:01:02.820> just<00:01:02.940> gonna<00:01:03.090> sprinkle

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
a liquid we're just gonna sprinkle

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.280 
a liquid we're just gonna sprinkle
liberally<00:01:04.409> with<00:01:05.010> kosher<00:01:05.309> salt<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:06.450> then<00:01:06.810> wait

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
that 60 minutes moisture will be pulled

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.690 
that 60 minutes moisture will be pulled
to<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.540> surface<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.080> will<00:01:10.799> dissolve<00:01:11.340> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
to the surface and will dissolve the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.350 
to the surface and will dissolve the
salt<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.960> course<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.979> some<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.549> is

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
salt and of course the some of that is

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.310 
salt and of course the some of that is
that<00:01:15.689> bacteria<00:01:16.100> don't<00:01:17.100> like<00:01:17.670> salt<00:01:18.420> at<00:01:18.840> all

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
that bacteria don't like salt at all

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.880 
that'll make the pieces of reasonable
length<00:03:37.300> for<00:03:37.510> consumption<00:03:38.020> but<00:03:38.620> when<00:03:38.770> you're

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
length for consumption but when you're

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.620 
length for consumption but when you're
ready<00:03:39.040> to<00:03:39.190> slice<00:03:39.550> you<00:03:39.790> want<00:03:39.820> to<00:03:39.970> go<00:03:40.030> against

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
ready to slice you want to go against

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.420 
ready to slice you want to go against
the<00:03:40.870> grain<00:03:40.900> so<00:03:41.590> that<00:03:41.709> it<00:03:41.770> will<00:03:41.830> be<00:03:41.950> more<00:03:42.100> tender

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
the grain so that it will be more tender

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.460 
the grain so that it will be more tender
to<00:03:42.850> the<00:03:43.090> tooth<00:03:43.510> and<00:03:43.660> I<00:03:43.720> like<00:03:43.870> to<00:03:43.959> go<00:03:44.050> on<00:03:44.170> a<00:03:44.200> bias

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
to the tooth and I like to go on a bias

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.440 
to the tooth and I like to go on a bias
so<00:03:45.130> that<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.310> pieces<00:03:45.520> actually<00:03:45.820> look<00:03:46.180> bigger

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
so that the pieces actually look bigger

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.709 
so that the pieces actually look bigger
on<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:47.290> plate

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:50.719 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:56.209 

now<00:03:52.969> you<00:03:53.969> could<00:03:54.269> if<00:03:54.510> you<00:03:54.810> felt<00:03:55.019> like<00:03:55.079> it<00:03:55.219> move

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:56.219 
now you could if you felt like it move

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:58.160 
now you could if you felt like it move
all<00:03:56.400> this<00:03:56.549> to<00:03:57.180> a<00:03:57.209> platter<00:03:57.510> and<00:03:57.659> then<00:03:57.870> pour<00:03:58.049> the

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
all this to a platter and then pour the

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.209 
all this to a platter and then pour the
remaining<00:03:58.379> juices<00:03:58.859> over<00:03:59.129> it<00:03:59.250> and<00:04:00.150> stir<00:04:00.329> it<00:04:01.219> all

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:02.219 
remaining juices over it and stir it all

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:05.750 
remaining juices over it and stir it all
exact<00:04:02.640> some<00:04:02.790> nice<00:04:03.049> grilled<00:04:04.049> vegetables<00:04:05.010> then

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
exact some nice grilled vegetables then

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.679 
exact some nice grilled vegetables then
again<00:04:07.790> you<00:04:08.790> could<00:04:08.939> just<00:04:09.120> sit<00:04:09.269> here<00:04:09.420> and<00:04:09.540> knead

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:09.689 
again you could just sit here and knead

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:12.920 
again you could just sit here and knead
it<00:04:09.840> which<00:04:10.590> is<00:04:10.709> what<00:04:10.829> I'm<00:04:10.920> going<00:04:11.129> to<00:04:11.189> do<00:04:11.930> hey
