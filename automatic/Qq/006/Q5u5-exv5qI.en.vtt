I'll<00:00:48.059> throw<00:00:48.300> rebound<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.050> look<00:00:49.170> at<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.469> and

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
I'll throw rebound and look at that and

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.470 
I'll throw rebound and look at that and
it's<00:00:49.739> like<00:00:49.890> okay<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.730> take<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.149> out<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.329> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
it's like okay you take that out of the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.540 
it's like okay you take that out of the
game<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:52.230> know<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.620> once<00:00:52.980> again<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.399> have

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
that number I just really think it's a

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.790 
that number I just really think it's a
matter<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.969> heart<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.840> don't<00:01:00.899> know<00:01:01.079> what

we're gonna do how we're gonna solve
this<00:01:03.149> but<00:01:03.539> it's<00:01:03.780> got<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.049> be<00:01:04.080> solved<00:01:04.589> if

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
this but it's got to be solved if

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.070 
this but it's got to be solved if

happens you're going to get beat and
it's<00:03:54.560> just<00:03:54.740> they<00:03:55.220> played<00:03:55.520> with<00:03:55.730> the

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
it's just they played with the

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.120 
it's just they played with the
desperation<00:03:56.420> with<00:03:56.870> a<00:03:56.900> sense<00:03:57.200> of<00:03:57.350> urgency<00:03:57.530> that

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
desperation with a sense of urgency that

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.780 
desperation with a sense of urgency that
we<00:03:58.550> didn't<00:03:58.940> have<00:03:59.120> I<00:04:00.100> thought<00:04:01.100> we<00:04:01.310> missed<00:04:01.610> some

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
we didn't have I thought we missed some

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.390 
we didn't have I thought we missed some
good<00:04:01.820> really<00:04:02.330> good<00:04:02.570> looks<00:04:03.170> but<00:04:03.590> some<00:04:04.220> nights

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
good really good looks but some nights

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.170 
good really good looks but some nights
your<00:04:04.790> shots<00:04:05.150> won't<00:04:05.480> go<00:04:05.690> down<00:04:05.870> and<00:04:06.820> then<00:04:07.820> you

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
your shots won't go down and then you

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.940 
your shots won't go down and then you
have<00:04:08.209> to<00:04:08.570> count<00:04:08.810> on<00:04:08.900> a<00:04:08.959> big<00:04:09.290> fancy<00:04:09.560> if<00:04:09.740> you<00:04:09.800> have

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
have to count on a big fancy if you have

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.620 
have to count on a big fancy if you have
to<00:04:10.070> count<00:04:10.280> on<00:04:10.370> your<00:04:10.430> rebound<00:04:10.820> and<00:04:11.209> it<00:04:11.510> was

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
to count on your rebound and it was

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.030 
to count on your rebound and it was
unfortunate<00:04:12.140> because<00:04:12.410> I<00:04:12.650> thought<00:04:12.860> we'd

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
unfortunate because I thought we'd

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.030 
unfortunate because I thought we'd
really<00:04:13.340> defended<00:04:13.820> well<00:04:14.000> at<00:04:14.180> times<00:04:14.800> and<00:04:15.800> then

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
really defended well at times and then

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.039 
really defended well at times and then
gave<00:04:16.430> up<00:04:16.609> a<00:04:16.670> rebound<00:04:17.450> with<00:04:17.600> the<00:04:17.660> second-chance

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
gave up a rebound with the second-chance

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.860 
gave up a rebound with the second-chance
points<00:04:18.230> so<00:04:18.850> you<00:04:19.850> know<00:04:19.970> critics<00:04:20.299> of<00:04:20.390> Washington

balls<00:04:24.200> in<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:24.740> paint<00:04:24.980> when<00:04:25.190> there<00:04:25.310> was<00:04:25.430> the

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
balls in the paint when there was the

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.430 
balls in the paint when there was the
rebounds<00:04:26.480> that<00:04:26.570> were<00:04:26.630> popping<00:04:26.870> around<00:04:27.050> so

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
rebounds that were popping around so

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.320 
rebounds that were popping around so
that<00:04:28.430> was<00:04:28.550> tough<00:04:28.700> for<00:04:28.880> us<00:04:28.940> and<00:04:29.120> then<00:04:29.210> of<00:04:29.300> course

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
that was tough for us and then of course

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.330 
that was tough for us and then of course
Lindsey<00:04:30.050> Hardy<00:04:30.380> just<00:04:30.560> took<00:04:31.070> it<00:04:31.220> to<00:04:31.310> another

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
Lindsey Hardy just took it to another

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.130 
Lindsey Hardy just took it to another
level<00:04:31.580> it's<00:04:32.000> almost<00:04:32.240> like<00:04:32.419> she<00:04:32.570> decided<00:04:32.900> to

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
level it's almost like she decided to

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.050 
level it's almost like she decided to
take<00:04:33.770> over<00:04:33.890> the<00:04:34.100> game<00:04:34.220> put<00:04:34.430> her<00:04:34.490> head<00:04:34.640> down<00:04:34.669> say

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060

I'm<00:04:35.120> going<00:04:35.330> the<00:04:35.510> Rams<00:04:35.810> you<00:04:35.930> may<00:04:36.050> want<00:04:36.230> to<00:04:36.260> stop

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
I'm going the Rams you may want to stop

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.100 
I'm going the Rams you may want to stop
and<00:04:37.370> we<00:04:38.150> certainly<00:04:38.360> didn't<00:04:38.720> do<00:04:38.780> a<00:04:38.810> good<00:04:39.050> job

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
and we certainly didn't do a good job

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.430 
and we certainly didn't do a good job
with<00:04:39.560> them<00:04:40.070> with<00:04:40.280> that<00:04:40.430> so<00:04:40.730> Harding<00:04:41.320> and<00:04:42.320> the

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
with them with that so Harding and the

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.810 
with them with that so Harding and the
rebounds<00:04:42.890> were<00:04:43.010> really<00:04:43.220> tough<00:04:43.430> with<00:04:43.610> us<00:04:43.670> but

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
rebounds were really tough with us but

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.220 
rebounds were really tough with us but
yet<00:04:43.970> we<00:04:44.060> still<00:04:44.240> had<00:04:44.390> a<00:04:44.420> chance<00:04:44.480> to<00:04:44.840> win<00:04:44.990> but

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
yet we still had a chance to win but

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
yet we still had a chance to win but
that<00:04:45.380> thought<00:04:45.530> there<00:04:45.650> were<00:04:45.710> a<00:04:45.740> couple<00:04:45.890> of<00:04:46.100> key

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
that thought there were a couple of key

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.930 
that thought there were a couple of key
crucial<00:04:46.760> things<00:04:46.970> there<00:04:47.210> where<00:04:47.420> we<00:04:47.600> just<00:04:48.940> we

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
crucial things there where we just we

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.450 
crucial things there where we just we
didn't<00:04:50.120> do<00:04:50.210> what<00:04:50.330> we<00:04:50.420> needed<00:04:50.450> to<00:04:50.720> do<00:04:50.930> so<00:04:51.460> that's

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
didn't do what we needed to do so that's

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.650 
didn't do what we needed to do so that's
what<00:04:52.610> happened<00:04:52.880> maybe<00:04:53.060> we'll<00:04:53.240> have<00:04:53.390> a<00:04:53.420> sense

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
what happened maybe we'll have a sense

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.420 
what happened maybe we'll have a sense
of<00:04:53.750> urgency<00:04:53.840> now<00:04:54.170> put<00:04:54.740> me<00:04:54.860> in<00:04:54.920> Harding<00:04:55.250> so

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
of urgency now put me in Harding so

games<00:05:30.410> this<00:05:30.830> week<00:05:31.070> I<00:05:31.280> mean<00:05:35.410> well<00:05:36.410> you<00:05:36.860> know<00:05:36.980> I

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
games this week I mean well you know I

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.800 
games this week I mean well you know I
think<00:05:37.310> we<00:05:37.640> play<00:05:37.880> with<00:05:38.060> a<00:05:38.090> greater<00:05:38.390> sense<00:05:38.510> of

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
think we play with a greater sense of

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.630 
think we play with a greater sense of
urgency<00:05:38.990> when<00:05:39.530> we're<00:05:39.710> down<00:05:39.890> I<00:05:40.220> think<00:05:40.280> we<00:05:40.490> play

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
urgency when we're down I think we play

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.100 
urgency when we're down I think we play
with<00:05:40.790> the<00:05:40.880> greater<00:05:41.120> sense<00:05:41.420> of<00:05:41.510> urgency<00:05:41.690> when

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
with the greater sense of urgency when

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.930 
with the greater sense of urgency when
we're<00:05:42.260> crop<00:05:42.530> clawing<00:05:43.040> our<00:05:43.130> way<00:05:43.160> back<00:05:43.520> it's<00:05:43.760> one

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
we're crop clawing our way back it's one

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.730 
we're crop clawing our way back it's one
thing<00:05:44.150> to<00:05:44.210> be<00:05:44.390> the<00:05:44.510> hunter<00:05:44.840> it's<00:05:45.470> another

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
thing to be the hunter it's another

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:46.900 
thing to be the hunter it's another
thing<00:05:45.950> to<00:05:46.010> be<00:05:46.190> the<00:05:46.310> hunted<00:05:46.640> and<00:05:46.790> we're

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
thing to be the hunted and we're

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.840 
thing to be the hunted and we're
certainly<00:05:47.270> not<00:05:48.230> handling<00:05:48.800> being<00:05:49.040> in<00:05:49.490> the<00:05:49.670> lead

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:49.850 
certainly not handling being in the lead

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.690 
certainly not handling being in the lead
very<00:05:50.480> well

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:51.700 
very well

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.460 
very well
maybe<00:05:52.700> this<00:05:52.910> will<00:05:53.000> get<00:05:53.120> our<00:05:53.270> teacher<00:05:53.540> but

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
maybe this will get our teacher but

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:55.960 
maybe this will get our teacher but
we've<00:05:54.620> struggled<00:05:54.919> on<00:05:55.190> here<00:05:55.430> with<00:05:55.640> it<00:05:55.790> with

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
we've struggled on here with it with

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.880 
we've struggled on here with it with
with<00:05:56.300> rebounding<00:05:56.840> so<00:05:57.169> it<00:05:57.410> doesn't<00:05:57.740> surprise

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:57.890 
with rebounding so it doesn't surprise

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.240 
with rebounding so it doesn't surprise
me<00:05:58.100> that<00:05:58.580> in<00:05:59.510> this<00:05:59.690> situation<00:06:00.380> when<00:06:01.070> we

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
me that in this situation when we

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.530 
me that in this situation when we
weren't<00:06:01.400> shooting<00:06:01.669> really<00:06:01.970> well<00:06:02.240> I<00:06:02.360> mean

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.540 
weren't shooting really well I mean

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.330 
weren't shooting really well I mean
Brienne<00:06:02.870> shot<00:06:03.169> much<00:06:03.470> better<00:06:03.740> the<00:06:04.010> other<00:06:04.160> day

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:04.340 
Brienne shot much better the other day

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.550 
Brienne shot much better the other day
against<00:06:04.610> Washington<00:06:05.270> today<00:06:05.660> she's<00:06:06.050> what<00:06:06.350> 1

not<00:06:10.970> shooting<00:06:11.270> well<00:06:11.450> you<00:06:11.900> shouldn't<00:06:12.200> give<00:06:12.380> up
