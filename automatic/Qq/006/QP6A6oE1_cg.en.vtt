reality though is is that it's one of
the<00:01:52.860> unique<00:01:53.700> disorders<00:01:54.329> where<00:01:54.450> it's

the unique disorders where it's

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.380 
the unique disorders where it's
substantial<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.159> men<00:01:56.610> versus<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.360> other
