00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.170 
is a really cool cool helmet and it's
been<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.539> really<00:00:25.080> fun<00:00:25.199> project<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:25.920> work<00:00:26.099> on

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
been a really fun project to work on

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.080 
been a really fun project to work on
the<00:00:27.810> dissonance<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.500> ground<00:00:29.039> up<00:00:29.250> all<00:00:29.760> new

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
the dissonance and ground up all new

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.260 
the dissonance and ground up all new
full<00:00:30.449> face<00:00:30.689> helmets<00:00:31.460> when<00:00:32.460> we<00:00:32.579> talk<00:00:33.000> about

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
full face helmets when we talk about

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.670 
full face helmets when we talk about
this<00:00:33.450> then<00:00:33.719> there's<00:00:33.899> kind<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.200> there's<00:00:34.469> three

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
this then there's kind of there's three

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.700 
this then there's kind of there's three
main<00:00:34.860> things<00:00:35.100> there's<00:00:35.520> weight<00:00:36.710> ventilation

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
main things there's weight ventilation

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.819 
main things there's weight ventilation
and<00:00:38.390> safety<00:00:39.390> features<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.469> weight<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.770> the

cooling<00:01:08.530> which<00:01:09.280> is<00:01:10.170> evidenced<00:01:11.170> by<00:01:11.320> the<00:01:11.380> front

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280

cooling which is evidenced by the front
brow<00:01:12.490> vents<00:01:12.910> and<00:01:13.810> then<00:01:14.050> also<00:01:14.230> the<00:01:14.590> rear

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
brow vents and then also the rear

brow vents and then also the rear
exhaust<00:01:14.980> vents<00:01:15.490> and<00:01:16.270> what<00:01:16.600> we've<00:01:16.750> done<00:01:16.960> is

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.230 
exhaust vents and what we've done is

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.740 
exhaust vents and what we've done is
between<00:01:17.740> those<00:01:17.920> two<00:01:18.160> points<00:01:18.510> created<00:01:19.510> a

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
between those two points created a

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.780 
between those two points created a
series<00:01:20.110> of<00:01:20.140> internal<00:01:21.070> channeling<00:01:21.640> or

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
series of internal channeling or

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.240 
series of internal channeling or
recesses<00:01:22.180> that<00:01:22.510> really<00:01:22.750> help<00:01:22.960> pull<00:01:23.710> air<00:01:23.980> in

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
recesses that really help pull air in

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.770 
recesses that really help pull air in
the<00:01:24.400> front<00:01:24.670> of<00:01:24.730> the<00:01:24.790> helmet<00:01:24.940> and<00:01:25.270> then<00:01:25.360> exhaust

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
the front of the helmet and then exhaust

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.300 
the front of the helmet and then exhaust
it<00:01:25.990> out<00:01:26.110> the<00:01:26.260> back<00:01:26.470> so<00:01:26.800> it<00:01:26.920> helps<00:01:27.130> keep<00:01:27.250> the

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
it out the back so it helps keep the

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.640 
it out the back so it helps keep the
rider<00:01:27.580> cool<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.930> fact<00:01:29.140> in<00:01:29.320> some<00:01:29.350> of<00:01:29.530> the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
rider cool in fact in some of the

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.900 
rider cool in fact in some of the
testing<00:01:30.040> we've<00:01:30.190> done<00:01:30.340> with<00:01:30.490> a<00:01:30.520> lot<00:01:30.700> of<00:01:30.820> our

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
testing we've done with a lot of our

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.030 
testing we've done with a lot of our
riders<00:01:31.240> we<00:01:31.390> found<00:01:31.600> out<00:01:31.750> that<00:01:31.930> the<00:01:32.140> helmet

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
riders we found out that the helmet

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.219 
riders we found out that the helmet
ventilates<00:01:33.640> almost<00:01:34.270> too<00:01:34.479> well<00:01:34.690> and<00:01:34.960> cold

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
ventilates almost too well and cold

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:36.510 
ventilates almost too well and cold
weather<00:01:35.440> and<00:01:35.740> a<00:01:35.770> lot<00:01:35.800> of<00:01:36.010> cousins<00:01:36.190> end<00:01:36.400> up

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
weather and a lot of cousins end up

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.550 
weather and a lot of cousins end up
actually<00:01:36.700> duct<00:01:37.119> taping<00:01:37.330> closing<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.410> vents

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
actually duct taping closing the vents

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.170 
actually duct taping closing the vents
off<00:01:38.770> because<00:01:39.040> it<00:01:39.190> keeps<00:01:39.430> them<00:01:39.640> that<00:01:40.210> cool<00:01:42.180> we

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
off because it keeps them that cool we

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.810 
off because it keeps them that cool we
talk<00:01:43.360> about<00:01:43.479> safety<00:01:43.840> features<00:01:44.640> there's<00:01:45.640> a

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
talk about safety features there's a

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.180 
talk about safety features there's a
very<00:01:46.570> cool<00:01:46.750> system<00:01:47.170> that<00:01:47.380> we've<00:01:47.560> integrated

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
very cool system that we've integrated

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.310 
very cool system that we've integrated
into<00:01:48.729> dissidence<00:01:49.180> called<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:49.540> eject<00:01:49.930> safety

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
into dissidence called the eject safety

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.800 
into dissidence called the eject safety
system<00:01:50.710> but<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:51.729> eject<00:01:52.060> system<00:01:52.240> is<00:01:52.600> is

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
system but the eject system is is

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.490 
system but the eject system is is
essentially<00:01:53.350> a<00:01:54.390> an<00:01:55.390> air<00:01:55.690> bladder<00:01:55.960> that<00:01:56.259> lives

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
essentially a an air bladder that lives

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.560 
essentially a an air bladder that lives
at<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:56.740> top<00:01:57.009> of<00:01:57.220> the<00:01:57.280> helmet<00:01:57.460> in<00:01:58.119> between<00:01:58.450> the

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.749 
liner and the EPS foam and what that
does<00:02:01.660> is<00:02:01.869> it<00:02:01.990> allows<00:02:02.170> an<00:02:02.410> EMT<00:02:02.860> to<00:02:02.890> inflate<00:02:03.520> that

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
does is it allows an EMT to inflate that

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.730 
does is it allows an EMT to inflate that
bag<00:02:04.030> and<00:02:04.360> lift<00:02:04.660> the<00:02:04.780> helmet<00:02:05.110> safely<00:02:05.530> off<00:02:05.710> the
