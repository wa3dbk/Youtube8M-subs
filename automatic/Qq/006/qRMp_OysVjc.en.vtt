00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.359
 who happens people youtube condition is 

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:08.310
 I forgot where is all there endesa 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.680
 accurate and careless are original 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:16.860
 all this detail is only in these tennis 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:19.760
 are the golden mercury with rose 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.310
 and I have to explain more or less 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.910
 I told them about the last time the brands did not 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:29.180
 what are you good at and so on but if 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:33.880
 I forget to emphasize a detail but good 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.880
 let's grab the band 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:51.500
 it's about seeing what this means 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.350
 hello hot your tennis is the lowest 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.350
 when 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:12.040
 the marks and that is they are percent 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.180
 original do not worry they are original 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.180
 but there are qualities 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:34.600
 and green with this until the technicians 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:37.659
 fast this is usually I've 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.289
 seen several that is green 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.400
 and green but really should be green 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.640
 all 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.640
 and white are the originals towards 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.260
 that the big ones came first in 100% 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.630
 originals in a career the quality 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.630
 as average only of better quality 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.470
 explain how things are without singing 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.470
 so 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.970
 really location a lot 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:33.140
 attention if you buy this this 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:38.569
 quick it may be that I do not assure you anything 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:40.980
 that is white I do not think I doubt it very much 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.900
 but it can be 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.459
 now I assure you wait a little 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.549
 of examples like because the truth is not what 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.540
 I know I'm not too sure 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.540
 we will see this 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.010
 while a feeling that is 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.080
 excited about 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:03.860
 it's very good very good point 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:07.220
 from my point of view it is beautiful 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.220
 the truth 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.370
 to go looking for a while back 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.860
 So what do I come up with if this 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.460
 they understand fast is also strong me 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:25.080
 I 'm wrong it's also true but what 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:27.690
 same this must be white there are some 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.510
 fast tennis that instead of having it 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.610
 black of the tennis color code what 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.610
 they have a yellowish color 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.710
 of lower class are those that less after 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.950
 but these are the ones that are going to cost you 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:50.780
 more because they are the original floor 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.780
 originals from us 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:13.860

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.680
 presentation are small videos like 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.410
 to go plucking not to grab the 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.540
 band that more people see me because I 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.150
 What I want to give you is to understand how 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.850
 for all three I want to help is not 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.009
 also in cleaning it 6 forgot to stress 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.639
 that this one 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:33.639
 this spray 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:40.440
 and you can do this 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:43.290
 and put it in a total that you but not 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:47.690
 also do not regimen if you leave so not 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:53.040
 all white does not grab and it's a pass 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:55.290
 slight ok should not be this and that has a 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.170
 Shiny effect if you want to give good 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:01.160
