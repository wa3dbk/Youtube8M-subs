with the application of the law because
it<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.550> little<00:00:38.790> bit<00:00:39.680> down<00:00:40.680> to

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
it is a little bit down to

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.770 
it is a little bit down to
interpretation<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.969> referee<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.570> over

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
interpretation of the referee and over

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.090 
interpretation of the referee and over
linesman<00:00:43.290> on<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.960> circumstances<00:00:46.530> I

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
linesman on that and the circumstances I

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.090 
linesman on that and the circumstances I
felt<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.520> was<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.730> offside<00:00:48.649> most<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.890> people

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
felt it was the offside most of people

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.340 
felt it was the offside most of people
who<00:00:50.370> know<00:00:50.700> we're<00:00:51.239> better<00:00:51.480> when<00:00:51.809> i<00:00:51.930> do<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350

rules<00:00:52.760> agree<00:00:53.760> with<00:00:53.969> me<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:55.289> was

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
rules agree with me so it was

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.939 
rules agree with me so it was
transferred<00:00:56.399> over<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.850> split<00:00:56.910> second

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949
