I was a big pack and i felt quite

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.440 
I was a big pack and i felt quite
comfortable<00:06:04.650> and<00:06:04.950> like<00:06:05.760> I'd<00:06:05.940> completely

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
comfortable and like I'd completely

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.930

recovered<00:06:06.810> from<00:06:06.930> city<00:06:07.169> to<00:06:07.230> surf<00:06:07.530> and<00:06:07.890> I<00:06:08.100> was

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.010 
recovered from city to surf and I was
getting<00:06:09.120> a<00:06:09.180> bit<00:06:09.300> worried<00:06:09.570> that<00:06:09.690> there's<00:06:09.840> too

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
getting a bit worried that there's too

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.750 
getting a bit worried that there's too
many<00:06:10.140> in<00:06:10.320> the<00:06:10.380> park<00:06:10.590> so<00:06:10.830> thought<00:06:11.400> I'd<00:06:11.550> make<00:06:11.730> a

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
many in the park so thought I'd make a

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.730 
many in the park so thought I'd make a
bit<00:06:11.940> of<00:06:11.970> a<00:06:12.090> move<00:06:12.270> and<00:06:12.540> put<00:06:13.169> a<00:06:13.200> bit<00:06:13.350> of<00:06:13.380> a<00:06:13.470> sprint

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
bit of a move and put a bit of a sprint

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.520 
bit of a move and put a bit of a sprint
into<00:06:14.160> just<00:06:14.760> kind<00:06:15.419> of<00:06:15.540> put<00:06:15.840> a<00:06:15.870> bit<00:06:16.020> of<00:06:16.050> a<00:06:16.169> gap<00:06:16.350> on

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530 
into just kind of put a bit of a gap on

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.850 
into just kind of put a bit of a gap on
him<00:06:16.680> and<00:06:17.270> just<00:06:18.270> enough<00:06:18.600> of<00:06:18.750> a<00:06:18.870> gap<00:06:19.110> so<00:06:19.560> I<00:06:19.590> could

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
him and just enough of a gap so I could

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.250 
him and just enough of a gap so I could
just<00:06:20.010> keep<00:06:20.910> a<00:06:21.060> constant<00:06:21.300> comfortable<00:06:22.050> pace

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260 
just keep a constant comfortable pace

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.290 
just keep a constant comfortable pace
and<00:06:22.560> try<00:06:22.860> and<00:06:22.950> run<00:06:23.040> away<00:06:23.070> from<00:06:23.280> him<00:06:23.580> but<00:06:23.790> uh<00:06:23.850> I

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
and try and run away from him but uh I

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.780 
and try and run away from him but uh I
think<00:06:24.810> thought<00:06:25.230> if<00:06:25.380> I<00:06:25.560> had<00:06:26.190> have<00:06:26.310> just<00:06:26.490> slowly

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:26.790 
think thought if I had have just slowly

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.640 
think thought if I had have just slowly
picked<00:06:27.210> it<00:06:27.330> up<00:06:27.450> the<00:06:28.050> guys<00:06:28.200> would<00:06:28.380> have<00:06:28.500> just

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:28.650 
picked it up the guys would have just

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.050 
picked it up the guys would have just
latched<00:06:28.830> on<00:06:29.040> the<00:06:29.130> back<00:06:29.280> and<00:06:29.460> just<00:06:29.610> used<00:06:29.850> me<00:06:30.030> so

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 
latched on the back and just used me so

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.700 
latched on the back and just used me so
there's<00:06:30.690> a<00:06:30.750> bit<00:06:30.840> of<00:06:30.900> a<00:06:31.020> wind<00:06:31.169> too<00:06:31.380> so<00:06:31.620> they

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 
there's a bit of a wind too so they

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.640 
there's a bit of a wind too so they
would<00:06:31.830> have<00:06:31.919> drafted<00:06:32.250> off<00:06:32.400> me<00:06:32.610> and<00:06:33.470> he<00:06:34.470> has<00:06:34.620> a

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
would have drafted off me and he has a

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.260 
would have drafted off me and he has a
big<00:06:34.860> move<00:06:35.040> it<00:06:35.190> hurt<00:06:35.310> hurt<00:06:35.730> me<00:06:35.880> of<00:06:35.910> it<00:06:36.090> in<00:06:36.180> the

big move it hurt hurt me of it in the

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.390 
big move it hurt hurt me of it in the
