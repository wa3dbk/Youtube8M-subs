00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.450
 when I work on a set and I have to prepare 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.070
 my recipes for taking photographs 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.369
 the day really seems to be endless 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.809
 never but I still like to keep a 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.910
 bit of desire to cook even for 

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:29.800
 when I get home especially for i 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.200
 my kids and my husband and so 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.239
 tonight I want to make a cake with a 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.190
 bit of chocolate to pamper us all a 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.940
 bit and tell us about this beautiful 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.670
 day 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.680
 I want to prepare barry padding with 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.660
 the sour cherries will be ours 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.660
 sweet surprise at the bottom of the glass 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.150
 the cream is made from sugar eggs and a 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.800
 little bit of flour though since the 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.480
 Blacksmith cherries are gluten free though 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.220
 you have intolerance problems you can 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.500
 quietly replace the flour 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.149
 they are only 30 grams with a little 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.370
 potato starch so you will have 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:08.250
 naturally a gluten-free dessert 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.250
 serve a little milk from 100 ml 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.430
 I like to serve these pardini inside 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.609
 a small glass so you can eat 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.590
 on the table as dessert but possibly 

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:20.020
 if they advance they can even reach the 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.609
 next day as a tasty snack 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.530
 when you work the eggs you have to try to 

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:25.119
 don't make lumps and then take it 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.039
 sugar from the sides of the basin e 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.329
 take it to the center 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.329
 now I add the flour 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.600
 meanwhile the milk but in temperature 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.820
 and our cream is almost ready 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.620
 that's when it reaches this consistency 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.330
 ready 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.370
 I can start preparing 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.550
 ingredients that I will need after the 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:56.690
 sour a little icing sugar and the 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:58.670
 chocolate and fresh fruit when the 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.950
 milk quite warm but remember to 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:06.470
 do not boil it towards the end on 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:08.360
 tempera eggs the cream is preferable 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.950
 do it with a fork until this 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.310
 point of the recipe and then move on to 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.260
 whisk along the rest of the milk 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.459
 check that there are not as on 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:24.500
 background 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:27.610
 and then you have to go back to q2 now one 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.320
 whisk and tear mixed on the fire 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.840
 at least three four minutes until between 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.520
 Of course enough I like it anyway 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.390
 will serve these creams a bit of itself 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.390
 almost as if they were 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.140
 when it reaches this consistency the 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.900
 you can switch off and then cool down yes 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.910
 it will thicken a little bit more 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.390
 now it's time to put the 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.390
 chocolate 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:03:01.150
 the heat of the cream melts the 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.860
 fairy tale and voila is already ready while the 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.720
 cream cools I want to put the 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:09.580
 black cherries on the bottom of my glasses 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:11.890
 so they will be a delicious surprise if 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.540
 they can put three or even 5 a 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.540
 depending on how much you want to be greedy 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.379
 towards the hot cream 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.750
 time leaves to cool a little bit 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.000
 they must reach the temperature 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.590
 environment and then go to the fridge e 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:43.310
 in the end we can put the cream 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:46.010
 secretly mounted to whip cream 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.750
 fitted perfectly and hold it well 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.620
 cold in the refrigerator better if in one 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.620
 metal milk jug 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.879
 it's compact if I think that at school if it is 

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:02.879
 they did it by hand 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.680
 now a bit of cream a bit of syrup 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.709
 of black cherry and a pinch of sugar a 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.709
 veil 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.160
 easy and ready to taste
