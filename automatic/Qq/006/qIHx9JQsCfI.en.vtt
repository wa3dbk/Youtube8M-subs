00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
candy here it prevents tangling as much

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.700

as<00:00:51.149> possible<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:53.300> it<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.539> very<00:00:54.600> nice<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.410> guess

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
as possible and it is very nice I guess

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.099

it's<00:00:56.550> all<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.149> same<00:00:57.329> cause<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.750> headphones

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
it's all the same cause of headphones

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.229

which<00:00:58.379> makes<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.309> different<00:00:59.699> than<00:00:59.789> what<00:01:00.120> you

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
which makes it different than what you

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.990 
which makes it different than what you
would<00:01:00.359> see<00:01:00.570> with<00:01:00.660> your<00:01:00.809> beats<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.379> such

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
would see with your beats and such

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.980 
would see with your beats and such
