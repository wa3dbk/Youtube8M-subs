here<00:04:58.449> I<00:04:58.479> think<00:04:58.810> that<00:04:58.960> is<00:04:59.110> the<00:04:59.349> actual<00:04:59.800> last

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:00.009 
here I think that is the actual last

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:02.040 
here I think that is the actual last
surgery<00:05:00.460> of<00:05:00.699> operate<00:05:01.150> now<00:05:01.389> at<00:05:01.599> least<00:05:01.840> I

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
surgery of operate now at least I

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.779 
surgery of operate now at least I
believe<00:05:02.469> I<00:05:02.650> could<00:05:02.919> be<00:05:02.949> completely<00:05:03.639> and

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:03.789 
believe I could be completely and

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:05.820 
believe I could be completely and
utterly<00:05:03.879> wrong<00:05:04.360> but<00:05:04.840> I<00:05:04.870> think<00:05:05.259> this<00:05:05.560> is<00:05:05.710> the

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
utterly wrong but I think this is the

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.649 
utterly wrong but I think this is the
last<00:05:06.009> surgery<00:05:06.550> of<00:05:06.759> operate<00:05:07.180> now<00:05:07.330> if<00:05:07.479> there's

00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:07.659 
last surgery of operate now if there's

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:09.570 
last surgery of operate now if there's
