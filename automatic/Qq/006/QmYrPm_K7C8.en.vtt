00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.670
 here nasals welcome to 1 video not 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:06.649
 there was information about the call of 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.300
 duty ghosts and good as you are seeing 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.070
 this is the video of the presentation that 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.020
 did the angels in this video how 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.630
 explain a little more in detail what 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.180
 which is a reference in the theme of creating 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.640
 classes that the soldiers create squats and 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.870
 what else is this man saying now 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.460
 same that said it was going to be 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.590
 completely different when creating the 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.760
 classes we're going to have a lot more 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.920
 variety but good first thing 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.140
 comment is to create soldier to soldier 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.789
 sorry other than the class we can 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.970
 to be welded equally that we created the 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.110
 class what custom and we are totally 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.610
 We can completely create the 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.560
 soldier as you are seeing in many 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.540
 types of appearance as they say the video 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.890
 before the body are hoisting all 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.540
 encouragement we were changing the 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.030
 equipment and here we saw a 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.370
 kinematics of the created character and 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.630
 everyone else is going to have each 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.309
 one is going to have his character to say it 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.290
 somehow there can not be the 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.760
 same but come on let's do and as 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.840
 you see here the female soldiers that you 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.579
 also involve masters to have women 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.739
 soldiers that is reading over there that 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.809
 they will be completely the same as 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.579
 men so nothing like we see 30 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.170
 new weapons that they will introduce in this 

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:06.950
 new chaotic is as I said earlier 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.219
 video 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.110
 30 new weapons some are have 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:15.259
 appearance of call of duty past as 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.140
 It may be 11 but good as you see 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.360
 also comment on the gusts we have 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.299
 three modes of gusts three types like 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.729
 they were very warfare 3 the air assault helps 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.920
 and specialist as you see new class 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:31.460
 also of weapons the mark man ray fell 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.520
 they are like rifles that are going to be made 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.319
 automatic is the modern mk 14 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.880
 warfare 3 that you see how they are always 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:39.049
 all semiautomatic weapons like 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.560
 we could introduce now for example 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.330
 blank two glasses the cmr all go to 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.979
 be kind they want now as you see they are 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.689
 you can put different peepholes the 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.549
 iron peephole peephole 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.590
 red and there is also the yellow of this 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:55.009
 which is the rÃºa of the dual render scope 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.450
 sorry that as you can see it looks 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.950
 and around you are also going to see what you 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.420
 surround that will be a little blurred 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.899
 not like now that it looks totally 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.759
 black and you only see the crosshairs like this 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.209
 that these weapons can also have 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:10.970
 those those stockings the red dot without 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.860
 peephole and the dual render apart from 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.380
 customize also 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.260
 classes and so on and the soldier classes 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.040
 they have a new way of caracas to you know 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.390
 that here they went for spaces and you had 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.090
 spaces 10 spaces that you can use in 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.440
 any time as you see here then 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.660
 will be main with its accessories 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.930
 secondary fundamental accessories and a 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.700
 tactics and novelty comes in the mode in 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.520
 Regarding the advantages as you see 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.630
 up puts quad test point 50 what 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.580
 it means this 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.560
 before talking, we are going to talk about the 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.110
 advantages because as you can see all 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.270
 the advantages there is of speed 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.880
 elite equipment resistance there 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.680
 a lot of advantages each one is going to 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.600
 cost different points as you see the 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.209
 of speed costs at a point then 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.880
 there's another one that costs 23 like that until 5 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.380
 up to 5 points what does this mean? 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.690
 let's put all the classes that 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.010
 we want as long as we have those 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.320
 points as you see them now has 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.180
 four advantages and maybe here now 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.450
 same it puts other four more advantages 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.570
 and it does not put blinding however it's going to be 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.310
 a little bit like whites 2 but without 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:20.670
 However, to have many advantages 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.640
 a lot I'll start a video explaining 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.739
 the advantages each one but good as 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.380
 we said at the beginning new breeds of 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.959
 casualties there will also be 20 new 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.270
 low gusts as you see a yoke this 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.980
 is a shooter from a helicopter 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.959
 he will also see the help gusts 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.849
 as I teach in the video the dog is going to 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.440
 be quite important there is a challenge 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.660
 of the dog, by the way, is that you 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.280
 kill and the dog because even if you 're 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.410
 dead to kill like a hammer but in 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.090
 the dog here you have the dragon fire 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.830
 from a different perspective as I said 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.630
 in the video of the multiplayer trailer 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.730
 there will also be packages of 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.250
 help paisa this is a kind of 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.500
 repair like us that record is the rebounder 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.850
 that the missile throws you can direct you from 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.340
 more I do not know why it's still only been 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.170
 seen that part of time only 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.180
 pointing and as we said at the beginning 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.880
 of the video to see three types of gusts the 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.170
 of help as they were warfare mode 3 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.180
 specialist and assault on the help 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.040
 will be the grapes uvb is and others 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.139
 controls the assault urge those of 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.060
 juggernaut and all these things the 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.130
 helicopters and in specialist you could 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.539
 open the advantages you knew it will be more or 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.550
 less equal the advantages to be able 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:27.580
 definitely get a 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.900
 or not know exactly why rumors or 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.319
 I still do not know if it's confirmed that 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.879
 There are two types of modes I do not know 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:35.440
 there is still a video about 50 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:38.080
 information and others and I can extract it 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.560
 but hey it's rumored that it was those 2 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.210
 Moab are two types of low gusts 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.210
 definitive as I was in the move more 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.919
 but good apart from all this what 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.650
 will also show right now in the 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:53.349
 gameplay is going to be the squats mode 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.030
 before you could only play then with 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:58.150
 your friends Sunni to the group and others 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.340
 but in this case ticos are going to 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.039
 implement what they were going to do a way to 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.440
 game that is called squats and if not 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:08.050
 I remember badly in the squats mode I think 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.849
 It can be up to 10 players as is 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.250
 saying apart from you being soldier 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:14.620
 you can create your squash here you have this 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.139
 make the way to create the classes with 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.150
 the squats the squats points as 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:20.830
 You see they are going to give points and go to 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.599
 say unlocking things like and 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.849
 Weapons accessories cost points 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:26.830
 of squash and good with your points goes 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:28.630
 to continue spending those spending 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.770
 that you want that there are things 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.060
 that are worth more points other than worth 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.070
 less points 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.530
 and I guess the points will be given to the 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.440
 play games have not said anything yet 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.330
 but it would be the most logical and other and as 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.610
 You see finally the squash mode 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.380
 that I mentioned before right now in the 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.410
 charge ticos you can create your squash 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.389
 up to 10 players as you are watching 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.910
 can you create your soldiers there are 10 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.440
 types of soldiers or go to one for each 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.080
 prestige therefore it is assumed that 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.180
 there will be 10 prestige as you see each 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.370
 Once you are going to pass a prestige you go to 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.440
 can have a new soldier so 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.210
 every time you spend 11 a soldier who 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.820
 you will have for your squash and power 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.260
 play in with your friends and others and 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.550
 I will make a video explaining the mode of 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.110
 the squads that have enough 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.669
 news so we did not like the 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.990
 video vote it to our favorites and we 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:16.470
 in the next one and until next time 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.470
 goodbye
