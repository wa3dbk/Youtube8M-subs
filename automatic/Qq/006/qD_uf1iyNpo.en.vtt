00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.100
 We've been kids since we're 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.810
 here on the peat map we need in 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.700
 special eight thousand people 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.260
 yes sir eight thousand subscribers I want 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.030
 dry and three days and well let's go 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.590
 affect us in the game is not land of 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.239
 so you do not focus and you're going to see 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.500
 now two planes below the 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.900
 close- up base of minecraft the 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.129
 second side is going to be the field plane 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.930
 from outside I wanted to do this from 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.970
 special because I know that many of you have 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.440
 asked and why not do it and well already 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.670
 you are already seeing it I hope that what 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.220
 you can very much let's try to get to 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.230
 the 300 lakes in this video to see if 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.489
 I think if we got 300's arrived 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:02.960
 and well let's give the guys we're going to 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:05.840
 put here one also as you see and 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.049
 October 10 2 I think less I who to 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.869
 say but good as you see many I have 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:15.700
 put the pop to the god 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.610
 to 90 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.070
 I have put formal 90 because pvp much 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.329
 better with the 90 I do not know why but 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.100
 make 90 even though it looks more like 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:27.710
 go slow walking pvp very much 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.840
 better and I think it 's a 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.030
 a good technique the truth for let's 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:38.580
 sense you first here 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:41.619
 is perfect this we are here will be 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.390
 perfect now is we can win the 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.760
 we are going to try 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.619
 really remember let's give more support 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.210
 chorus because here I am giving good 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.670
 some advice that another for you to see 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.820
 How to click also you have to know 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.810
 many that it is better to go to less pop 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.810
 because it is better targeted 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.060
 but you also have to know many that 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:06.240
 if you do not play with fake numbers it's going to 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.819
 cost more basically 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.239
 and without numbers look me here if you are 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:15.959
 seeing so be here is here always 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:18.319
 I wear it like that or like that and 12 4 like I change 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.870
 directly is to say automatically 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:26.190
 faster and it will serve us to the 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.880
 mostly where good and something like that changed me 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.930
 and now you are going to see it 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.930
 there you have seen it 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.980
 pam 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:48.310
 it can be that and well then also 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:49.989
 you have to know that if for example 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.780
 lighter I think it's the only one of 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:56.690
 things that I do not use 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.819
 for further back 17 a cane I gave to the 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.430
 roulette back always never then 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:04.910
 I'm going to give to Asia with which number 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:08.560
 two I never give because I do not get it right 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.560
 with the number goes well 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.910
 let's regenerate it seems we're going 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.069
 very well of armor we have four 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.450
 diamonds and we find more let's 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.400
 do the boots because now I will do 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.230
 the sword of my hip only with two like that 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.989
 how good are we going to try it with six 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.750
 around here we go up vale we're going to go towards 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.120
 the middle guys to see what brings us 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.250
 there and good because you know I've 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.830
 most things presented as 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.930
 you must know a little bit not for the 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.720
 basic things to start being more or 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.209
 less more good the pvp that I do not 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.720
 I consider myself the best in the world but something I know 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:48.730
