 from julia and a favorite this series helps 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.850
 a lot and well basically it's not 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.190
 images of the next call of duty karate 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.200
 advanced your profile advance warfare and 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.730
 good new little things more 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.890
 little things does not seem to be that well report 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.570
 is releasing a lot of information about 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.730
 the title and the first of all that 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.650
 more will interest you is that good in the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.530
 co-founder of the gamer game 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.920
 michael country has said that the engine 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.510
 graphic will be an entirely new one though 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.370
 with that the Ticos said the same thing and 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.989
 then it ended up seeing that it was not over 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.320
 saying in the end that it was not the same 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.420
 but retouched but good according to 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.429
 they say is developed in legendary 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.870
 game that he plays now they do the the 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:53.190
 next call of duty, they say no 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.420
 that is totally new that they carry more 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.399
 of two and a half years working in the 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.690
 title and that in next generation is going 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.370
 to see the images very well indeed 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.929
 well you can see a pretty improvement 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.609
 great respect regarding the 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:04.379
 previous expensive tuttis though then 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.550
 you never know until you do not until 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.590
 do not test it until it is not a gameplay 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.860
 and the games and so on, so that topic 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.270
 we go 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.130
 leave a little apart to see what just 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.780
 that just happens but as I say 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.580
 they say do not leave the one from indra source the 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.670
 description so that later you kill this 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.620
 Lord just saying yes to no 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.330
 let's go a little bit to the history of the game 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.370
 that basically good will not take 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.530
 out in 2000 54 and it's a video 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.360
 saying digital and good as I say 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.550
 for the co-founder of the gamer game 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.040
 michael condrey has also clarified that 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.780
 good that it will be that we will have an attack on 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.340
 world scale that the planet 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.680
 will suffer a worldwide attack of 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.510
 done it calls it a 911 global and what 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.250
 good to spend a catastrophe and such and 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.860
 we will drive a soldier called 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.380
 michel and will be a kind of marine the 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.630
 Typical marine with its typical history 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.729
 that hooks and that kind of stuff to 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.259
 that the player forever to certain 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.330
 empathy about him no new gameplay 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.170
 As you know, climbing camouflage walls 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.660
 optical super strength jumps ziplines and 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.950
 others as they are saying that good in 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.060
 the developers and others that this 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.640
 game is going to be totally new not by 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.200
 say it in a way they say it's going to be 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.819
 is going to have the good things of call of 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.470
 duty but that the gameplay and other 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.970
 Well, it's going to be something different 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.150
 I really do not know what they mean 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.590
 this I guess the campaign mode already 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.170
 we've all already seen that we're going to be 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.390
 with that kind of exo suit that we 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.370
 will give superpowers we could say but 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.770
 what really interests people 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.000
 of carlotto thiago to the great majority already 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.910
 I know that a lot of people also like the 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.900
 campaign mode of these titles because it is the 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.610
 multiplayer mode in mode 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.050
 multiplayer does not yet know anything like that 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.600
 is what you want to know has not yet been 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.340
 said absolutely nothing but has 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.380
 it looks like we 're going to carry all this 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.239
 suit let's have certain certain 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.310
 things I do not know I really can not not 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.350
 I can say yes or no, but if I have 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.350
 to decide on something I think that I 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.239
 I think at least upload more walls 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.800
 quickly and others climb walls that 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.660
 before those that seemed higher 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.459
 and they could not be accessed I think that in 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.890
 this one that is going to be able I do not know not yes 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.690
 sure is a prediction that I do at 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.070
 crazy but as I say we will see to see when 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.050
 will be the first multiplayer train that 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.360
 It does not have a date yet, we 'll see more 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.430
 deeply because then all this already 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.260
 we can do a much more analysis 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.880
 big in this multiplayer mode and 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.630
 also what we have seen the 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.600
 rails and others 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.710
 the concussion or detection variable that 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.540
 it has been explained a bit we can 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.520
 change if we want to shock or 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.320
 detect the enemy a kind of 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.450
 sensor I think that this kind of thing and 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.790
 that are going to be in the multiplayer no no 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.740
 I think it's something very difficult to do or 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.020
 to put in the multi with which I think 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.520
 that this kind of thing and that we will see 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.830
 and how are you saying it's going to be a 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.540
 little different I think that the suit 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.430
 and other things you can get into 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.530
 multiplayer what I do not know if it's going to 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.210
 getting it right will not go wrong for me 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.370
 truth is that it is the typical totti case 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.500
 that I believe that either you love him or hate him and 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.930
 I see it because because I see that they want 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.610
 change everything pretty but good and 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.230
 see in my opinion the most deeply 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.000
 about what I think when I leave 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.280
 the trailer of the multiplayer logically 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.900
 because we still do not know absolutely 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.690
 nothing at all in one of the things that I 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.460
 like is that an example a former employee 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.170
 of visceral games that worked with dead 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.780
 space is working on the sound 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.520
 of the title is something pretty good dead 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.650
 space the first dead space was very very 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.030
 good and that a person this talent 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.040
 I'm there in this saga 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.079
 gives me tranquility we could say in the 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.720
 sound theme and so on is something quite 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.610
 well we could say so good nothing 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.990
 more did not leave me anything else I guess it will go 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.180
 more information coming out 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.550
 the night or tomorrow because informer 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.110
 I think it's going to get 12 full pages 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.760
 of information and so on so good 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.490
 be attentive to see if it is also something 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.900
 of mult and others and we can take something out 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.280
 clear but for now all this in mode 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.020
 story so good nothing more kids 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.740
 these grant to let's go in the next 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.740
 video will be perfect
