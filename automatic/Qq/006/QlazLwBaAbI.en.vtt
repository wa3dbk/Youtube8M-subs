00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:22.640
 before releasing the art that precisely 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.460
 this, however, that nothing can be seen 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:31.050
 however the structures will be seen to be made 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:34.500
 this future galli nail art like today 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.390
 that I belong to students but I just wanted to 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.780
 steal two minutes before everything re for 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.340
 thank all the people have seen 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.809
 32 said done 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.399
 all the people you are 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.320
 complimented comments told me 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.530
 let us continue the novice that they sought for me 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.690
 to tell me that I was good 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.559
 in short it was really a pleasure for 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.219
 I read all the comments to see tv 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:02.359
 the photo of course clearly demonstrated 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:05.360
 I hope you enjoyed this 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:07.950
 small appearance what program 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.659
 obviously I will keep you informed for how long 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.700
 it will be next time so keep going 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.210
 to follow me almost all on facebook 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:19.159
 obviously where even more direct the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.369
 contact let's say i can write it more more 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:28.619
 quickly more directly 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:30.030
 nothing exactly I hope when you get there 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.620
 I leave everything 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.330
 let me know 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.150
 all your impressions of course 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.910
 if listeners also on the program 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.070
 in general what you want 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.080
 as always, I am very pleased to read you 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:02:03.420
 when a very serious event 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:02:06.860
 See you soon, hello, right away 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.860
 like me believes this nail art 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.480
 to make it use two colors 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.080
 that I am this celestino and that is to say 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:21.960
 if more we say green water and then 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:24.600
 used with blue acrylic laid out 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.510
 just a base on all the nails 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.490
 after which on the ring finger hostesses the 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.860
 green water on other nails or state 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.140
 precisely this blue I made a 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.830
 stylized flower is the republic e 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.739
 on the others 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.510
 I realized of polka dots with the color I 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.640
 just used for annular tour policy 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:47.280
 so after having water to make 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:49.170
 this contrast to explain them precisely 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.560
 nails that are not the soul of 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.360
 inch in the sense I don't think there is 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.630
 need to explain it in fact being the 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.640
 base then you can on everything and all 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.040
 contours of the nail then on the lap 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.160
 lateral cuticles and tip therefore as if 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.920
 themselves just contouring long which it can 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.860
 after that I 'll show you e 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.930
 moralize the flower instead 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.519
 stylized let's say that too is a lot 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.989
 simple 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.989
 let's take the blue acrylic color 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.060
 then we take a panel from the tip 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:31.340
 bitter end a little long mean we say 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:34.220
 all this is we put the color 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:38.210
 acrylic unload the brush a little 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:42.200
 so the tip is finer in the end 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:44.710
 and there is enough color but not too much 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.710
 it is not there 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.860
 after which precisely or better then I already have them 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.930
 done 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.900
 I'll show you how to make them in milk 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.190
 and therefore the procedure the same 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.380
 maybe I can let you see it too 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.020
 better because I'm closer 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.300
 then we go into the cuticles 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:08.770
 so at the base of the nail, however, a little 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:11.030
 more lateral I did here is 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:17.810
 we simply put the panel down 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:20.470
 so we do it four times in 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.470
 this way 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.200
 so we made ourselves the base again 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:31.430
 but now we have to give one 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:34.460
 more floral form to which one sins 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:38.090
 let's say and then with the brush has 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:42.370
 we are simply going to lengthen them 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.370
 creating a sort of tip 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.500
 in this way it is very simple 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:05:03.270
 so we color well we complete 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:05.760
 and then stretch into the count then the 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.450
 base will be a little rounder and a little more 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:12.480
 big and then it will make you finer in fact 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:14.550
 in the final part like this now 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.570
 of course we fill in to make them more 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.570
 loads of color 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.919
 we stretch it a little even at the end 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.870
 to do precisely this 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:39.430
 tight and don't make them too separated between 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:41.199
 of them in this way after that 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.060
 let 's take the doctor the tool for 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:44.050
 do here or even a simple sense 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.229
 shooting 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.330
 let's take the small acrylic again 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:52.719
 market the tip of the deficient squeaks o 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:55.680
 of the daughter and we make polka dots alla 

00:05:52.719 --> 00:06:02.259
 base among all the little ones 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:03.879
 in this way obviously after having 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:06.099
 done this job we will put the 

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:07.870
 fixer then a transparent nail polish 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:11.169
 on all the nails to make the nail 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:13.870
 more homogeneous art more brilliant and this 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:16.659
 it is precisely the result so it is one thing 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:19.180
 really feasible for everyone is just for 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:21.340
 give you the idea when he died 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:24.250
 you want a special mail art but 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:26.729
 you don't have much time and then too 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:30.759
 a combination of colors 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:33.309
 and precisely or nail art I hope the v7 

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:34.869
 to everything that was clear enough 

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:36.520
 though I always think anyway 

00:06:34.869 --> 00:06:38.819
 really simple 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.379
 it is right as I said to give you 

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:42.879
 another idea when he sees little 

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:45.999
 inspiration 

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:48.009
 I send you a big kiss is for any 

00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:50.649
 question do you know where to find me if not 

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:53.080
 you know it leaves you all all the links of 

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:55.919
 my spaces in the info box a kiss to i 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.919
 poker naturists
