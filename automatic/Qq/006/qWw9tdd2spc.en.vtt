00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.619
 why two 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.020
 the number of customers can reduce your 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.960
 profit 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.550
 yes yes I'm not mistaken this is the case 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.560
 So 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.760
 doubling the number of customers may 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:39.710
 some cases reduce your profits 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.020
 let's look at each 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.930
 seamstresses have absolutely normal 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:48.350
 desire to get as much as possible 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.290
 profit from the business and the most obvious 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.910
 the way for many is to increase the amount 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.480
 customers is the right move 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.090
 but it is only part of the truth the matter is 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.520
 that many pigs decide to attract more 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.550
 customers by reducing the prices of their 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.300
 services and products yes so you can get 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:11.210
 many new customers especially when your 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.759
 prices with the same quality will be noticeable 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.300
 lower competitor prices but let's 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.440
 let's see what happens in this case 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.290
 consider the example of the individual 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.990
 sewing but I will try as clearly as possible 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.090
 and clearly give this principle by which 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.390
 can assess the situation and 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.280
 and in serial wider too for example you 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.950
 do individual tailoring 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.200
 uploaded 20 days a month and in person 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.660
 work with twenty clients a month 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.850
 Let in our example the average check from 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.069
 each of your customer is 1000 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.729
 rubles a month so you 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:50.060
 earn 20 thousand rubles of which 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.550
 10 thousand rubles go on monthly 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.979
 renting space electricity 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.500
 advertising equipment repair and so on 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.560
 that's the way the net profit from 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.410
 one client will be 500 rubles 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.349
 net profit per month is 10 thousand 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:09.800
 rubles and to attract more customers 

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:12.950
 you decide to reduce your expenses to 700 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.110
 rubles from one client on average then 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.740
 invest your time and money in pr 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.000
 own prices and after a while 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.760
 double the number of customers 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.890
 30 percent you lowered your 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.500
 the pricing is actually pretty 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.420
 weighty discount and with proper advertising 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.730
 you will quickly begin to increase the amount 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.310
 their customers at first glance 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.060
 everything is fine but it is only for the first 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.909
 sight 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.330
 to work 40 clients instead 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:44.239
 big 20 you need to be working already 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.120
 at the same pace 40 days a month instead 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.590
 former 20 days 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.349
 naturally so much time 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.840
 you are not there and have time to live at all 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:57.019
 customers you have to hire at least 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.170
 one assistant and that means she needs 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:03.799
 pay a salary of about 10,000 rubles to 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.500
 total monthly we have the following income 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:10.819
 40 customers multiply by 700 rubles 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:13.750
 we get 28 thousand rubles and now 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.790
 calculate your net profit at least 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.849
 approximately and that we have a total income 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:23.650
 there are 28 thousand rubles we subtract 10 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:27.530
 thousand rubles for the salary of your assistant 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:30.799
 10,000 rubles approximately wean on 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:34.940
 monthly expenses and we have left 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:37.540
 net profit of 8 thousand rubles but even 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.799
 look at a two-fold increase 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.430
 customer numbers 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:47.720
 your profit has decreased by 20 percent 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.790
 and this is without taking into account the growth of consumption 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.269
 electricity if your assistant 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.549
 works in your territory and it is still 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:59.269
 excluding your much increased 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:01.579
 loads and that is very very sad in 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:05.090
 In this case, others will reach out to you . 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:07.760
 customers will be people for whom the price 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.370
 comes to the fore so when you 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.160
 again trying to increase prices they 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.560
 most likely from you run away so how 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.380
 do the right thing like that 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.169
 still increase profits for profit 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.039
 new customer account and you can increase 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.760
 and need 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:26.710
 but it must be done correctly 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.040
 and by no means by 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:33.430
 a significant reduction in rates not for 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.140
 Dumping bill and also very important 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.940
 detail 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:40.270
 an increase in the number of clients is 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.970
 only one of many ways 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:46.450
 increase profits by the most effective 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:49.540
 of the fastest working tricks 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.750
 doubling profits I will share on November 30th 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.490

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:00.670
 come sewing business come and
