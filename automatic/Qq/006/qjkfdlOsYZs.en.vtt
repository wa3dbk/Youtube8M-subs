incorporated get to know your area and
the<00:06:11.550> methods<00:06:11.910> that<00:06:12.000> work<00:06:12.300> so<00:06:12.750> we've<00:06:12.900> got<00:06:13.050> one

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
the methods that work so we've got one

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.990 
the methods that work so we've got one
hard<00:06:13.770> shell<00:06:14.010> boat<00:06:14.220> with<00:06:14.340> us<00:06:14.460> which<00:06:14.640> gives<00:06:14.790> us<00:06:14.910> a

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
hard shell boat with us which gives us a

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000 
hard shell boat with us which gives us a
good<00:06:15.150> comparison<00:06:15.540> to<00:06:16.140> how<00:06:16.380> the<00:06:16.440> track<00:06:16.740> goes

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010 
good comparison to how the track goes

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.950 
good comparison to how the track goes
can't<00:06:17.580> carry<00:06:17.910> as<00:06:18.030> much<00:06:18.240> as<00:06:18.450> the<00:06:18.570> other<00:06:18.690> boat<00:06:18.870> of

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
can't carry as much as the other boat of

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.630 
can't carry as much as the other boat of
course<00:06:19.020> the<00:06:19.470> other<00:06:19.620> boat<00:06:19.800> is<00:06:20.040> a<00:06:20.190> very<00:06:20.460> high

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:20.640 
course the other boat is a very high

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.670 
course the other boat is a very high
capacity<00:06:21.270> hardshell<00:06:21.810> boat<00:06:22.080> so<00:06:22.320> that's<00:06:22.500> that's

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
capacity hardshell boat so that's that's

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.860 
capacity hardshell boat so that's that's
no<00:06:23.070> even<00:06:23.250> fair<00:06:23.490> to<00:06:23.640> compare<00:06:23.789> there<00:06:24.300> whereas

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
no even fair to compare there whereas

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:25.970 
no even fair to compare there whereas
with<00:06:25.020> the<00:06:25.140> track<00:06:25.410> or<00:06:25.620> definitely
