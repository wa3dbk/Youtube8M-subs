 the fields 

00:00:01.249 --> 00:00:05.029
 Châteauroux has a revenge to take against put the castelroussins were 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.230
 beaten by mass at the beginning of the season for the first match of their history 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.679
 at home first 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.679
 it gets bad in point the defense is decimated 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:17.619
 injured for a long time ppr and the mills are absent 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:19.590
 coach victor zvunka usa 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.100
 in the stands, however, we are rather complete thunderstorms from the 5th 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.649
 minute with cap 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.649
 a center in front of goal and no one to pick 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:32.770
 clears a little in panic but this press 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.490
 my ancestors in the merrous repair surface these programs get 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.940
 do not hiss 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.590
 and yet 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.100
 to a positive gesture claude brochu future said frédéric larrieu 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.860
 in any case the match continue 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.780
 a free-kick from frei de merieux 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.880
 report wrapped in the arms of damage and that he releases attention the 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.240
 threat to cut him the food to recover diakité minutes the pressure 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.840
 Messina continues free kick from castel deutsch and maybe more pebbles from 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.060

 rené-luc euros 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.740
 goals for reims and his thanks to bruno rodriguez and he must be happy 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.710
 I discarded land for a month because of an injury and that's it 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.560
 his seventh goal in the championship beautiful recovery inevitably mass is in 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.080
 confidence and dominates always 40th minute he remained heels of rodriguès pirès 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.550
 second goal short but that 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.620
 what a superb goal of the action and the second goal 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.530
 after a nice one-two with that rodriguez is the one that remains 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.740
 pressed paraguay euros 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.220
 a version here but he's standing up and not having regard 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.090
 châteauroux must react before half time 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.260
 clement the defender in front of him robert pirès and clément gets rid 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.820
 of pirates at the center instant soap recovery and it was difficult 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.789
 but at half-time Mass leads 2 to 0 against châteauroux a logical score 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.590
 but this day more than a place to circulate very well despite the cold 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.820
 paralyzing that does not encompass Lorraine in the second period to a 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.420
 shock between work and pirès is the bad news for Mass 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.520
 the exit of robert pirès the injured knee 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.899
 it's risky to a guy who returns to his place 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.560
 and during that time meshing along hurray hurray 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.769
 danny boffin attention bofa he will stand alone in front of guys 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.499
 Considerations in wooden bounces always face 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:21.009
 it is finally the defense of his wooden tower bofa had the goal of 3 to 0 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:23.579
 left foot 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.079
 a few minutes after

 uphill 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:32.079
 in the act to whiten prado blanchard but what is it 

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:35.709
 Châteauroux comes out of its bases 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.099
 with the right post on a center of two fathoms chabrot pichenette 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.359
 yesterday for traoré in front of the goal 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:45.180
 and above the former messin would have liked to score here yet it remains 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.699
 less than a quarter of an hour of play the free-kick of rodriguez esp just passes to 

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:49.069
 goal side 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.589
 ms finishes freewheeling and therefore imposes itself without trembling 2 to 0 against
