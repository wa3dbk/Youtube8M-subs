 the video is very well suited for that 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.900

 cows cost 250 milliliters 11 euros fell 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.810
 I googled the whole thing from then on

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.319
 that you know what I'm talking because 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.769
 most of which have names that sees and 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.940
 then you do not know what you are looking for 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.200
 what to look for 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.150

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.510
 I 'm still great and 5 easy 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.370
 mega hot but the fan I have to 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.860

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.180
 Do not get me and we will come to you 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.340
 next point as I said this 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.410
 traveler shampoos my favorite is like 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.660
 said Schwarzkopf or cows as red 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.239
 loyal as a third weller simply by the 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.450
 intensity and what else I want to do 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:54.590
 All this drogerie has to say silver 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:57.470
 shampoos so minimal concentrated that 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.579
 They are not so extreme this aston 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.110
 can generate 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.459
 I do not know what you did 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.540
 I have very bad with it 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.069
 experience made that is called 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.440
 Bad meadows are not wrong 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.269
 but they just do not do that 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.569
 desired effect I would like 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:14.239
 so next to my hair hair 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.720
 gently preserved in this aston too 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.910
 can 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.650
 You have to know this instead of blond hair 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.329
 is the most strained you want 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.620
 not much chemistry expend afterwards 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.380
 someone maybe visit the hairdresser 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.910
 films beaches complete set in prolog 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:30.319
 was 20 or came strem and this was 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.870
 you already a chemical process by 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.790
 filled a bit strained 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.459
 and you only want hair after that 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.700
 gently preserve this aston 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:44.000
 yes there is a perfect tint 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:47.380
 middle of bella and that means this 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.950
 payment color fresh in the usa 0 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:54.410
 stroked 80/8 which is a few silver 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.810
 In this sense, sound is almost exactly the same 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.510
 like this silver already weird as 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.450
 shampoo but as a tonic liquid that 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.680
 completely without alcohol ammonia without 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.180
 ammonia and without peroxides is and 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.739
 I have to google my costs now 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:14.510
 a jogger 75 milliliters eight euros 80 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.430
 and you can do it several times 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.920
 walls you need very little for that 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.930
 that is 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.970
 the small structures there you push 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.800
 just pure this silver league 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.440
 with liquid out she seems too 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.450
 very good and you can actually 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.340
 after washing your hair, simply in the 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.520
 give complete hair or where you are 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.380
 current want to have deliberately and read that 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.230
 then act on the desired moment 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.450
 if that as a regular complete tint 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.340
 in the darker area in the women 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.330
 for example, in salon is applied 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.620
 it is usually 20 minutes on it 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.690
 and that makes it easier again 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.570
 has tint that just ten more 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.740
 I let out gradually and 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.230
 After that you can stop it again and again 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.770
 Apply the cool it is completely hair 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:01.320
 gentle and even untreated hair 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:05.430
 sees with this educational path becomes 50 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:09.150
 percent more well-groomed gets out more 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.130
 shine more suppleness that donates 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.650
 on the one hand even more moisture than it 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.630
 really ideal advice times to 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:19.290
 except for the blond ones 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.970
 example for natural hair fans theirs 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.860
 Hair has never stomped at all 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.510
 have blighted and just like that 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.400
 a little annonce in the hair 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.900
 can also contribute 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.760
 like to make this kaff pretty easy too 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.950
 make it all the more glossy 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.490
 Moisturizing into the hair 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.980
 leave 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.890
 We had a super pleasant smell 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:43.650
 very happy also a ph value of 65 so 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:45.360
 Everything very gentle as I said and what 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.370
 there is still to say in the color 08 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.860
 exactly available at Amazon I link 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.810
 the whole thing again and silver 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.420
 shampoo worthy too because it is very 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.550
 it is very intense that you see that 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.640
 Do not apply too often just when you are 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.500
 already very very light forest or white blonde 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.680
 It may be that like the tuning 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:07.290
 suite as well as the shampoo purple 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.820
 it's best to just slip off 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.200
 normal shampoo to change the tapes 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.850
 leave out liquid 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.710
 and one more little tip you can 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:15.870
 even the tonic liquid in her normal 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.880
 Give shampoo with pure that is also quite 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.980
 Cool tip from me just such a 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.320
 small blob depending on how intense 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.920
 as it would like to have in the normal shampoo 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.110
 3 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:28.860
 Shake well and you always have one 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:31.050
 right refresh your parallel 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.330
 Mum was already easy to perform 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:36.980
 yes enough talk I hope the video 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:41.070
 really helped sorry for the camera but 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:42.810
 it is already very hard wheels and off and 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.100
 to catch a breath and to
