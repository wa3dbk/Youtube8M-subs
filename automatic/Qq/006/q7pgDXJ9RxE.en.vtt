00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.899
 there are good everyone here and networks 

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.540
 commenting and I bring you gameplay of 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.740
 modern warfare 3 and I bring you a game 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.800
 although you seem lie leads 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.750
 recorded about a month at the best and not 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.639
 I know why I had not uploaded it before 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.920
 I was too eager to comment 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.480
 but I already realized why it was 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.199
 so good is why I come to you already 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.630
 tell you and it is that practically 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.430
 let's say that the last weeks 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.570
 for quite some time let's say that 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.550
 by taking off a fashion like I 've lost 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.739
 respect, let's not say we take you out 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.809
 that you did not tell me oysters that it's not good 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.309
 a fashion and right now I feel like 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.989
 I felt better as I did not get a 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.420
 nuclear bomb the model pigs that 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.710
 when a fad ends here and I think 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.989
 that more than anything is that first 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.210
 let's say you have to go practically 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.530
 that's why you have to put on 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.800
 specialist streaks to make it 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.170
 much simpler and so on then a 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.940
 whole time you take out you do not gain anything more than 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.220
 something for your own benefit is to say 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.659
 good gourmet at best points 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.250
 doubles that I've reached the point at which 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.869
 I'm maybe even that's why 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.820
 what does not call me so much attention 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.190
 because I'm already at a level that I do not 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.649
 I believe that the prestige passes and yet 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.810
 I think we have pigs in the model 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:20.090
 like having the nuclear bomb you won 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.700
 the game directly you could go to 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.340
 a domain part 0-199 the strip 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.380
 you go and won the game you alone I think 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.570
 which is something that we say encouraged you 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.580
 but not the part of it was let's say more 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.110
 simple that is to say even if I had a 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.300
 terrible team you can get 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.470
 perfectly a nuclear bomb let's say 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.929
 that between a couple of gusts and others 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.500
 after more or less easy but without 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:44.119
 However in modern warfare 3 here is 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.380
 more complicated you can not go 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.319
 get a nuclear bomb perfectly 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.250
 or a good one in this case a love and 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:51.380
 even if you have a team 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.250
 terrible that these storms and gusts 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.130
 and gusts and gusts 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.930
 the enemies are going to hunt you however 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.100
 in the referred way as it was much more 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.560
 simple then you can win the game 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.820
 practically you alone here so good 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.820
 let's say that in quotes you have to 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.670
 have a team that we can say help you 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.110
 a little more but well I think everything 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.049
 focuses more than anything on what not 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.790
 I was telling you that it was useful in this 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.890
 point right now how to take out are 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.500
 masters to blood is too useful to be noticed 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.829
 it does not benefit you, not even 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.870
 example we had I think we did not 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.519
 He also loved the modern warfare2 era 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.930
 that had the emblems of water the 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.850
 nuclear bomb is turning that the 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.829
 people I loved not then with the 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.420
 only objective to remove waxes 10 bombs 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:34.400
 nuclear in a prestige to give you 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.510
 so they tell you the emblem the emblem 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.510
 since he turns he's going to want a bomb 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:42.560
 nuclear in a pass since the people 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.959
 when a game people have to 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.470
 be careful with this one that this one takes out 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.959
 nuclear when we first say that good 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.780
 I insist that I am at this 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:58.530
 it was much more useful right now I with a 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.629
 water, as it has lost all that 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.920
 charm for me we do not know what good 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:05.189
 if you put yourself you really have to be 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.250
 to take tÃ©lam or fancy but I do not 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:10.159
 just called attention I do not know I do not know 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.510
 what will he put in the black ops in fact 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.909
 maybe you have to miss something 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.040
 in climbing high networks in the black ops 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:19.109
 in the bank is one in fact quite in 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.999
 missing that as I tell you to say that 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.319
 put high gusts that we all have 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:23.400
 alter those who broke a streak of 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.659
 eleven 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.849
 so let's say it was pretty 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.859
 simple and yet here he asks you for more 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.889
 double not to get the streak 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:35.730
 the highest is the fashion, so no 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:37.730
 I know I see it a little I do not know but I do not 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.319
 just convinced more than anything because 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.819
 it's very too selfish not because 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.799
 many times you can get yourself the uap 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.209
 who is once a specialist and at 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.760
 only one that benefits this from shati himself 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.439
 We can not make you a specialist and it 's not 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.180
 you're going to help your team with nothing 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.980
 obviously you are going to kill the central and such 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.109
 and what but if it gets social assault 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.000
 even if it's a 130 helps the team you 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:59.940
 You put on specialist and spa 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.650
 And you, you, you alone, not then 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.830
 you put a specialist stripe to get you out 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.450
 a fashion that practically serves to 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.070
 kill four or five more and well well 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.450
 that the double points come out but the 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.280
 double points will last two or three 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.350
 minutes and arriving at the moment in which 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.720
 we are that every time you put points 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.239
 double those of the game itself 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.970
 we arrived that does not end up being so so so 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.500
 useful so since then I think that 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.120
 just tried to get me some web 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.350
 only good norel normative because 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.390
 will reject specialists because if 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.720
 salt comes out and if nothing happens either but 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.850
 otherwise I do not have that initiative that 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.530
 Before I used to hear, I'm going to get a pretty girl 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.419
 now it does not seem more to me now 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.040
 play with a weapon so you never have 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.600
 tested in the game and so on 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.000
 put on gusts that down we never go 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.770
 arranged a yoke bernat that barely 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.830
 used and things like that I do not know what 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.380
 you think, I think in this this 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.970
 moment is where the most maybe I 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.530
 It facilitates your and it helps me to 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.240
 your opinion to the best if many of 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.250
 you have never taken a love or 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.320
 have taken one or two we think super 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.750
 exciting but maybe if you 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.200
 really think that you have left giving 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.720
 one Love 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.890
 good if you sign a lama but you can 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.320
 put a comment on the play that remains 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:11.020
 super cool and that's it or only 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.570
 you can do that and as I say in the 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.940
 model pigs you served a burrada already 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.700
 that I have won games and games and 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:21.190
 parties leaving nuclear bombs in the 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.960
 that his team was terrible and day trauma 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.870
 nuclear and won the game and this had 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.400
 a lot of challenges and all that that we 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.000
 they called a lot of attention and they were 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.020
 super quoted at least is not if in 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.300
 play you but me when I play with 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.250
 my friends to that guy who's wearing this 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.690
 emblem in the game I do not know what then 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.060
 this guy has to be super good no and 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.460
 now well as I just do not know if 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:46.030
 it's me or I do not fix the emblems and things 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.250
 well I do not know I think that this is ecological 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.500
 and the truth is that I have not finished 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.240
 curdle do not understand why because 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.280
 monkeys confer I love to kill those 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.530
 good you can kill a lot but 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.870
 I do not know, no, it would not be field 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.120
 possibilities for you to be able to 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:04.270
 you drag as you want since you can 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.440
 make you a game of 100 073 streak and 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.350
 others but 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.760
 I do not know, he would not have given us a 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.010
 explanation no better if you guys 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.090
 you help and I tell you if you put your 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.150
 opinions or what seems to you 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.680
 etcetera then well let's say that some 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.750
 group to help but good as you are 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.060
 watching here the game is an authentic 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.040
 massacre that is a departure from the area 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.080
 extra the one that you put to kill to kill 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.120
 kill broken with the rifle in the area 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.520
 above and others and as I say good 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.570
 right now you have the flame so that 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.920
 it should last a minute because 

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.630
 practically ends up arriving at the game 

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.010
 in fact if you kill six you have other 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.690
 six badges out there that already 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.240
 das practically achieved if they 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:42.850
 the game so nothing is I'm going to 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.210
 do livestreaming if anyone is 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:47.560
 anybody wants to sign up because 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:51.040
 is there to see it I'm going to put it here 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.990
 down in the description the time and nothing 

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.730
 I just wanted to tell you all this 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.440
 hopefully liked the gameplay I hope 

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.750
 that you liked that you water again 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.040
 a fashion but in the channel and above all 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.530
 I am very interested in your yours 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.810
 opinion and nothing with this say 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.580
 I'm practically dismiss I have 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:08.860
 enough little things to tell you in the 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.990
 next days that I have thought and others 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.220
 but I also wanted to thank all the 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.680
 support especially in him 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:17.320
 of a thousand videos that has been the 

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.240
 most voted video the I think you are 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.740
 has exceeded has doubled the previous video 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.560

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.980
 so it may well be that there is a 

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:29.560
 part two I said that when you get to 

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.300

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.260
