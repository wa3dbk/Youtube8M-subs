00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.800 

Mendel<00:00:02.280> imagined<00:00:02.850> that<00:00:03.179> in<00:00:03.330> the<00:00:03.449> production

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
Mendel imagined that in the production

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.619 
Mendel imagined that in the production
of<00:00:04.080> a<00:00:04.170> sperm<00:00:04.529> or<00:00:04.830> an<00:00:04.859> egg<00:00:05.100> cell<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:06.060> gene<00:00:06.330> pair

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
of a sperm or an egg cell the gene pair

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.230 
of a sperm or an egg cell the gene pair
is<00:00:06.810> split<00:00:07.170> apart<00:00:07.440> with<00:00:08.160> each<00:00:08.309> gene<00:00:08.670> ending<00:00:09.120> up

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
is split apart with each gene ending up

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.220 
is split apart with each gene ending up
in<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.570> separate<00:00:10.019> germ<00:00:10.290> cell<00:00:11.990> Mendel<00:00:12.990> called

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
in a separate germ cell Mendel called

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.000 
in a separate germ cell Mendel called
this<00:00:13.410> process<00:00:13.759> segregation<00:00:15.650> he<00:00:16.650> also

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
this process segregation he also

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.650 
this process segregation he also
imagined<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.090> direction<00:00:18.420> of

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
imagined that the direction of

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.560 
imagined that the direction of
segregation<00:00:19.230> is<00:00:19.560> totally<00:00:20.160> random<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:21.330> can

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
segregation is totally random it can

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.390 
segregation is totally random it can
just<00:00:21.900> as<00:00:22.020> easily<00:00:22.050> happen<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.980> other<00:00:23.010> way

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
just as easily happen the other way

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.230 
just as easily happen the other way
around<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:24.800> for<00:00:25.800> any<00:00:25.980> particular<00:00:26.220> germ<00:00:26.880> cell

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
around so for any particular germ cell

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.630 
around so for any particular germ cell
which<00:00:27.930> one<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.439> gene<00:00:28.680> Parrott<00:00:29.130> receives

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
which one of the gene Parrott receives

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.330 
which one of the gene Parrott receives
is<00:00:29.880> totally<00:00:30.510> up<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.660> chance<00:00:31.080> like<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.980> flip<00:00:32.219> of

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
is totally up to chance like the flip of

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.850 
is totally up to chance like the flip of
a<00:00:32.430> coin

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.590 

this<00:00:37.860> became<00:00:38.309> Mendel's<00:00:38.850> first<00:00:38.969> law<00:00:39.360> of

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
this became Mendel's first law of

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.369 
this became Mendel's first law of
genetics<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.950> law<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.370> random<00:00:41.879> segregation

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.479 

this<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.530> how<00:00:46.680> Mendel<00:00:47.160> explained<00:00:47.640> his<00:00:47.850> results

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
this is how Mendel explained his results

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.700 
this is how Mendel explained his results
his<00:00:50.489> parent<00:00:50.969> plants<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.809> pea<00:00:52.020> generation

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
his parent plants the pea generation

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.670 
his parent plants the pea generation
bred<00:00:53.250> true<00:00:53.550> for<00:00:53.879> color<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:54.989> meant<00:00:55.320> they<00:00:55.500> each

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
bred true for color this meant they each

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.119 
bred true for color this meant they each
had<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> pair<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.489> matching<00:00:56.969> jeans<00:00:57.770> the<00:00:58.770> purple
