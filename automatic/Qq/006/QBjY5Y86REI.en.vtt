00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.510 
do want to note is that the top part of
case<00:03:07.720> here<00:03:07.960> is<00:03:08.050> also<00:03:08.440> shaved<00:03:08.800> down<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:09.310> allow

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
case here is also shaved down to allow

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.510 
case here is also shaved down to allow
room<00:03:09.790> for<00:03:10.120> any<00:03:10.270> larger<00:03:10.750> USB<00:03:11.140> ports<00:03:11.500> or<00:03:11.680> HDMI

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
room for any larger USB ports or HDMI

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.250 
room for any larger USB ports or HDMI
cords<00:03:12.970> that<00:03:13.360> may<00:03:13.510> be<00:03:13.570> larger<00:03:14.020> than<00:03:14.050> the

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
cords that may be larger than the

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.720 
cords that may be larger than the
thickness<00:03:14.500> of<00:03:14.710> the<00:03:14.830> MacBook<00:03:15.010> on<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.400> bottom

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
thickness of the MacBook on the bottom

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.580 
thickness of the MacBook on the bottom
part<00:03:15.910> here<00:03:16.060> so<00:03:16.120> Moshe<00:03:16.780> is<00:03:16.930> definitely<00:03:17.320> taking

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
part here so Moshe is definitely taking

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.870 
part here so Moshe is definitely taking
the<00:03:17.650> extra<00:03:17.950> length<00:03:18.130> of<00:03:18.400> ensuring<00:03:18.850> that

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
the extra length of ensuring that

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.310 
the extra length of ensuring that
everything<00:03:19.240> will<00:03:19.510> work<00:03:19.540> well<00:03:19.870> with<00:03:20.020> the<00:03:20.140> case

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
everything will work well with the case

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.620 
everything will work well with the case
and<00:03:20.650> of<00:03:21.400> course<00:03:21.430> as<00:03:21.730> you<00:03:21.880> expect<00:03:22.330> there<00:03:22.480> are

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
and of course as you expect there are

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.180 
and of course as you expect there are
three<00:03:22.900> individual<00:03:23.410> cutouts<00:03:23.680> on<00:03:23.830> both<00:03:24.040> the

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
three individual cutouts on both the

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.100 
three individual cutouts on both the
left<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:24.520> right<00:03:24.670> side<00:03:24.910> for<00:03:25.210> the<00:03:25.360> intake<00:03:25.690> vents

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
left and right side for the intake vents

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.050 
left and right side for the intake vents
on<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.320> bottom<00:03:27.100> part<00:03:27.250> of<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.400> case<00:03:27.520> the<00:03:27.880> case

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
on the bottom part of the case the case

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.120 
on the bottom part of the case the case
itself<00:03:28.360> also<00:03:28.690> features<00:03:29.230> four<00:03:29.530> built-in

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
itself also features four built-in

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.950 
itself also features four built-in
rubber<00:03:30.370> feet<00:03:30.610> I<00:03:30.790> expect<00:03:31.240> in<00:03:31.450> case<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.840> rubber

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.960 
rubber feet I expect in case the rubber

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.720 
rubber feet I expect in case the rubber
feet<00:03:32.230> here<00:03:32.440> are<00:03:32.590> actually<00:03:32.980> sitting<00:03:33.310> on<00:03:33.430> top<00:03:33.670> of

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
feet here are actually sitting on top of

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.340 
feet here are actually sitting on top of
the<00:03:33.940> cases<00:03:34.300> so<00:03:34.420> there's<00:03:34.600> no<00:03:34.780> actual<00:03:35.050> rubber

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
the cases so there's no actual rubber

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.660 
the cases so there's no actual rubber
going<00:03:35.680> through<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:36.010> case<00:03:36.190> is<00:03:36.400> actually

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
going through the case is actually

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.400 
going through the case is actually
sitting<00:03:36.880> on<00:03:37.030> top<00:03:37.240> and<00:03:37.480> therefore<00:03:38.050> it<00:03:38.140> keeps<00:03:38.290> a

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
sitting on top and therefore it keeps a

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.770 
sitting on top and therefore it keeps a
lot<00:03:38.560> more<00:03:38.740> I<00:03:38.950> guess<00:03:39.160> dust<00:03:40.060> tight<00:03:40.300> or<00:03:40.540> water

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
lot more I guess dust tight or water

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.930 
lot more I guess dust tight or water
tight<00:03:40.990> you<00:03:41.140> could<00:03:41.290> say<00:03:41.470> not<00:03:41.980> really<00:03:42.070> water<00:03:42.370> but

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
tight you could say not really water but

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.820 
tight you could say not really water but
in<00:03:43.360> addition<00:03:43.540> the<00:03:44.020> rubber<00:03:44.230> feet<00:03:44.350> are<00:03:44.530> very

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
in addition the rubber feet are very

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.710 
in addition the rubber feet are very
very<00:03:45.130> you<00:03:45.490> could<00:03:45.640> say<00:03:45.760> rubbery<00:03:46.240> so<00:03:46.420> they<00:03:46.570> do

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
very you could say rubbery so they do

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.780 
very you could say rubbery so they do
stick<00:03:47.020> well<00:03:47.260> to<00:03:47.290> a<00:03:47.470> desk<00:03:47.710> to<00:03:47.920> keep<00:03:48.070> it<00:03:48.220> in<00:03:48.310> place

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
stick well to a desk to keep it in place

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.550 
stick well to a desk to keep it in place
finally<00:03:49.390> one<00:03:49.600> big<00:03:49.840> thing<00:03:50.050> I<00:03:50.170> wanted<00:03:50.500> to
