00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
especially after the first one and ride

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.600 
especially after the first one and ride
around<00:01:33.830> when<00:01:34.130> I<00:01:34.159> was<00:01:34.250> for<00:01:35.890> my<00:01:36.890> column<00:01:37.280> was<00:01:37.399> just

terrible<00:01:38.090> and<00:01:38.299> about<00:01:38.570> 16<00:01:38.990> I<00:01:39.200> was<00:01:39.229> a<00:01:39.440> little<00:01:39.649> bit

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
terrible and about 16 I was a little bit

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.719 
terrible and about 16 I was a little bit
bummed<00:01:39.950> out<00:01:41.560> it<00:01:42.560> was<00:01:42.710> more<00:01:43.130> advantage<00:01:43.549> to<00:01:43.640> the

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
bummed out it was more advantage to the

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.539

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
that I ended up where I left because

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.119 
that I ended up where I left because
looking<00:02:10.569> back<00:02:10.629> in<00:02:10.959> stock<00:02:11.200> I<00:02:11.440> had<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.620> pretty

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
looking back in stock I had a pretty

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.089 
looking back in stock I had a pretty
much<00:02:12.370> ideal<00:02:12.730> downhill<00:02:13.330> season<00:02:13.690> but<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.950> other

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
much ideal downhill season but the other

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.339 
much ideal downhill season but the other
events<00:02:15.250> have<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.120> long<00:02:16.300> way<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.480> go<00:02:16.629> it<00:02:17.200> was

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
events have a long way to go it was

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.009 
events have a long way to go it was
tough<00:02:17.530> for<00:02:17.560> me<00:02:17.799> in<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:17.980> ski<00:02:18.840> they<00:02:19.840> were

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
tough for me in the ski they were

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.780 
tough for me in the ski they were
definitely<00:02:20.200> fair<00:02:20.769> about<00:02:21.010> it<00:02:21.280> was<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.610> most

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
definitely fair about it was the most

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.460 
definitely fair about it was the most
fear<00:02:22.060> of<00:02:22.180> disease<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:22.540> I<00:02:22.750> had<00:02:22.900> a<00:02:22.930> late<00:02:23.140> start

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
fear of disease and I had a late start

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.390 
fear of disease and I had a late start
number<00:02:23.709> and<00:02:23.890> he<00:02:23.950> had<00:02:24.099> a<00:02:24.129> ski<00:02:24.459> it<00:02:25.299> was<00:02:25.420> possible

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
number and he had a ski it was possible

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.460 
number and he had a ski it was possible
we<00:02:27.400> have

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
we have

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.230 
we have
there's<00:02:29.190> nothing<00:02:29.370> really<00:02:29.670> more<00:02:29.940> than<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.180> could

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
there's nothing really more than I could

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.170 
there's nothing really more than I could
do<00:02:30.480> and

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.520 

she<00:02:33.299> could<00:02:33.540> have<00:02:33.599> been<00:02:33.719> better<00:02:33.870> all<00:02:34.079> season

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
she could have been better all season

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.640 
she could have been better all season
long<00:02:34.650> so<00:02:35.069> you<00:02:35.250> can't<00:02:35.459> really<00:02:35.549> put<00:02:36.540> it<00:02:36.840> down<00:02:37.409> to

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
long so you can't really put it down to

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.780 
long so you can't really put it down to
the<00:02:37.769> last<00:02:37.950> race

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
the last race

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.440 
the last race
no<00:02:40.790> I'm

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.050 

Nikki<00:02:44.080> totally<00:02:44.530> step<00:02:44.739> to<00:02:44.860> that<00:02:44.980> bar

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.550 

really<00:02:50.060> what<00:02:50.240> it<00:02:50.630> takes<00:02:50.870> up<00:02:51.020> in<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.200> overall

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
really what it takes up in the overall

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.610
