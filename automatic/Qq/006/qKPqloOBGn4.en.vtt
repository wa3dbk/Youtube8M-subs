00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.640
 Today I wanted to introduce you to 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.279
 another low frequency amplifier 

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:12.229
 but after assembling such 

00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:13.679
 problem as lack 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.829
 suitable power supply 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:18.099
 it's not some kind of unusual voltage 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.529
 or beyond the power but what 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:22.639
 would require a polar supply a 

00:00:22.639 --> 00:00:24.889
 almost all factory sources 

00:00:24.889 --> 00:00:26.649
 power supply unipolar 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:28.429
 unipolar segment refers 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.699
 expensive appliances but more often 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.830
 all have large dimensions 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.470
 the best way out of this situation 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.590
 is self 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.750
 build such a source 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.500
 it is much easier than it may seem 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.160
 the benefit of the sale is wide 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.440
 assortment he became mats having 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.990
 windings 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.600
 and even among the old former consumption 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.340
 easy to find and whose concerns you can 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.840
 gain the required voltage 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.210
 the device circuit is extremely simple and 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.910
 contains two diode bridges and bases 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.420
 base shield capacitors besides 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.070
 transformers themselves 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.960
 it does not necessarily 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.030
 winding voltages were the same we 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.750
 if you need it 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.880
 It should be noted that there are several 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.710
 critical moments 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.150
 should choose power 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.580
 transformers so that each of his 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.180
 windings could give the necessary 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.320
 current 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.860
 that is, if you only need 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.790
 four opera tory every four 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.450
 windings should be 4 amber 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.050
 because they will be connected 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.450
 consistently 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.880
 the hardest condensates 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.360
 it turns out connected 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.960
 consistently studied their total 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.010
 capacity gets less and less 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.190
 And so it is not worth saving and you can 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.150
 take more containers 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.740
 not worth saving on food water bridges 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.369
 dimensions of two or networks of foam bridges 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.020
 almost the same 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.180
 Yes, and the difference in price and the minimum 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.280
 so taking stocks in ensure less on 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.690
 sin rectifier magnitude boldness 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.380
 of course devices 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.299
 also need to take care and 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:05.770
 cooling 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.149
 and finally we must not forget that 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:08.989
 what after consuming 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.789
 voltage value increase by one 

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:13.569
 a whole four tenths 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:14.609
 that is, with variable 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:17.139
 winding voltage 25 volts 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:19.179
 we even have a very capacitor 

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:21.329
 no load will be extended to act 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.189
 already at 35 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:25.559
 thatâ€™s all you need to know 

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:28.039
 to make yourself 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:30.259
 but polar power source 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:32.289
 the device shown by us is not 

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:34.019
 pretend to be skeptical 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.979
 performance as intended in 

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:36.749
 as a demonstration 

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:39.280
 marketo but quite workable 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.750
 and may well serve as a unit 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:41.870
 power amplifier
