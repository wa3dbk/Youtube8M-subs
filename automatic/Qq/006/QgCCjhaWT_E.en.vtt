00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
so let's dive right into these slides

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.859 
so let's dive right into these slides
here<00:01:53.490> two<00:01:54.490> aspects<00:01:55.000> of<00:01:55.180> slides<00:01:55.450> that<00:01:55.570> I<00:01:55.689> think

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
here two aspects of slides that I think

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.300 
here two aspects of slides that I think
are<00:01:55.990> really<00:01:56.140> important<00:01:56.650> for<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.860> round<00:01:57.070> Peak

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
are really important for the round Peak

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.520 
are really important for the round Peak
style<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:58.270> first<00:01:58.570> is<00:01:58.990> that<00:01:59.200> you're<00:01:59.350> going<00:01:59.500> to

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
style the first is that you're going to

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.740 
style the first is that you're going to
be<00:01:59.680> using<00:01:59.890> your<00:02:00.220> nails<00:02:00.580> on<00:02:00.880> your<00:02:01.060> left<00:02:01.299> hand<00:02:01.570> a

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
be using your nails on your left hand a

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.260 
be using your nails on your left hand a
lot<00:02:01.930> to<00:02:02.409> really<00:02:02.710> get<00:02:02.860> a<00:02:02.890> clear<00:02:03.130> precise<00:02:03.880> tone

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
lot to really get a clear precise tone

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.450 
lot to really get a clear precise tone
the<00:02:05.079> second<00:02:05.470> thing<00:02:05.619> that<00:02:05.650> is<00:02:05.950> a<00:02:05.979> little<00:02:06.280> bit

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
the second thing that is a little bit

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.430 
the second thing that is a little bit
different<00:02:06.850> with<00:02:07.299> the<00:02:07.420> round<00:02:07.630> peak<00:02:07.840> slides<00:02:08.140> is

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
different with the round peak slides is

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.280 
different with the round peak slides is
that<00:02:09.220> you're<00:02:09.850> really<00:02:10.119> not<00:02:10.239> sliding<00:02:10.810> from<00:02:10.989> fret

position to fret position you're

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.789 
position to fret position you're
gesturing<00:02:13.060> towards<00:02:13.690> notes<00:02:13.959> without<00:02:14.200> actually

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
gesturing towards notes without actually

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:16.470 
gesturing towards notes without actually
really<00:02:15.070> ever<00:02:15.250> getting<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.880> those<00:02:16.060> fret

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
really ever getting to those fret

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.759

in<00:04:27.180> with<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.449> idea<00:04:27.570> that<00:04:27.810> that<00:04:28.229> round<00:04:28.500> peak

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
in with the idea that that round peak

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.010 
in with the idea that that round peak
banjo<00:04:29.160> is<00:04:29.280> really<00:04:29.580> an<00:04:29.699> economical<00:04:30.419> style<00:04:30.810> of

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
banjo is really an economical style of

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.140 
banjo is really an economical style of
banjo<00:04:31.229> everything<00:04:32.160> is<00:04:32.310> deliberate<00:04:32.789> the

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
banjo everything is deliberate the

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.990 
banjo everything is deliberate the
motions<00:04:33.570> are<00:04:33.690> relatively<00:04:34.350> small<00:04:34.740> and<00:04:35.100> you

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
motions are relatively small and you

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.520 
motions are relatively small and you
don't<00:04:36.270> want<00:04:36.479> to<00:04:36.539> break<00:04:36.720> position<00:04:37.229> unless

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
don't want to break position unless

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.520 
don't want to break position unless
you're<00:04:37.919> planning<00:04:38.250> a<00:04:38.580> move<00:04:38.820> up<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.360> neck<00:04:39.530> so

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
you're planning a move up the neck so

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.610 
you're planning a move up the neck so
you<00:04:41.490> can<00:04:41.669> also<00:04:41.910> do<00:04:42.300> an<00:04:42.449> exercise<00:04:42.930> on<00:04:42.990> the<00:04:43.380> third

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
you can also do an exercise on the third

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.379 
you can also do an exercise on the third
string<00:04:43.949> starting<00:04:44.460> at<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:44.759> second<00:04:45.180> fret

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
string starting at the second fret

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.650 
string starting at the second fret
position<00:04:45.570> with<00:04:45.960> your<00:04:46.110> middle<00:04:46.320> finger<00:04:46.430> nail

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
position with your middle finger nail

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.140 
position with your middle finger nail
and<00:04:48.660> it's<00:04:49.289> the<00:04:49.500> same<00:04:49.770> it's<00:04:50.280> the<00:04:50.400> same<00:04:50.520> kind<00:04:51.090> of

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
and it's the same it's the same kind of

00:04:51.150 --> 00:05:02.999 
and it's the same it's the same kind of
exercise<00:04:51.570> I'll<00:04:51.750> do<00:04:51.870> it<00:04:51.990> slowly

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:03.009 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:05.739 

so<00:05:04.009> that<00:05:04.339> gives<00:05:04.519> you<00:05:04.669> another<00:05:04.879> idea<00:05:05.299> for<00:05:05.509> an

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:05.749 
so that gives you another idea for an

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:09.459 
so that gives you another idea for an
exercise<00:05:06.489> you<00:05:07.489> can<00:05:07.669> also<00:05:07.819> slide<00:05:08.269> down<00:05:08.629> so<00:05:09.110> it's

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:09.469 
exercise you can also slide down so it's

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:12.609 
exercise you can also slide down so it's
still<00:05:10.189> in<00:05:10.339> that<00:05:10.369> first<00:05:10.699> prep<00:05:10.989> first<00:05:11.989> position

00:05:12.609 --> 00:05:12.619 
still in that first prep first position

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:15.519 
still in that first prep first position
you<00:05:13.099> can<00:05:13.279> drag<00:05:13.729> your<00:05:14.089> nail<00:05:14.299> down<00:05:14.749> the<00:05:15.199> string

00:05:15.519 --> 00:05:15.529 
you can drag your nail down the string

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:28.869 
you can drag your nail down the string
and<00:05:16.239> slide<00:05:17.239> down<00:05:25.929> and<00:05:27.309> same<00:05:28.309> exercise<00:05:28.849> with

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:28.879 
and slide down and same exercise with

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:40.809 
and slide down and same exercise with
your<00:05:29.119> middle<00:05:29.329> finger<00:05:37.569> and<00:05:39.249> you<00:05:40.249> don't<00:05:40.489> have<00:05:40.639> to

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:40.819 
your middle finger and you don't have to

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:42.579 
your middle finger and you don't have to
just<00:05:41.089> do<00:05:41.269> slides<00:05:41.599> with<00:05:41.809> your<00:05:41.929> fingernail<00:05:42.379> I

00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:42.589 
just do slides with your fingernail I

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:43.539 
just do slides with your fingernail I
don't<00:05:42.739> know<00:05:42.799> if<00:05:42.889> there<00:05:43.009> are<00:05:43.039> other<00:05:43.159> players

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:43.549 
don't know if there are other players

00:05:43.549 --> 00:05:45.279 
don't know if there are other players
who<00:05:43.789> do<00:05:43.939> this<00:05:44.149> there<00:05:44.360> there<00:05:44.509> probably<00:05:45.139> are

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:45.289 
who do this there there probably are

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:48.100 
who do this there there probably are
because<00:05:45.439> it<00:05:45.829> makes<00:05:46.069> sense<00:05:46.339> but<00:05:46.639> I'll<00:05:47.149> act<00:05:47.479> I'll

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
because it makes sense but I'll act I'll

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.399 
because it makes sense but I'll act I'll
use<00:05:48.499> my<00:05:48.739> fingernails<00:05:49.669> to<00:05:50.329> fret<00:05:50.629> notes<00:05:50.929> when

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:51.409 
use my fingernails to fret notes when

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:53.709 
use my fingernails to fret notes when
I'm<00:05:51.529> not<00:05:51.679> sliding<00:05:51.979> to<00:05:52.669> get<00:05:52.849> a<00:05:52.879> clear<00:05:53.209> sound<00:05:53.539> it

00:05:53.709 --> 00:05:53.719 
I'm not sliding to get a clear sound it

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:54.789 
I'm not sliding to get a clear sound it
almost<00:05:53.929> sounds<00:05:54.229> like<00:05:54.259> you're<00:05:54.349> playing<00:05:54.619> a

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:54.799 
almost sounds like you're playing a

00:05:54.799 --> 00:05:56.859 
almost sounds like you're playing a
fretted<00:05:55.099> banjo<00:05:55.519> if<00:05:55.729> your<00:05:56.089> intonation<00:05:56.419> is

00:05:56.859 --> 00:05:56.869 
fretted banjo if your intonation is

00:05:56.869 --> 00:06:00.189 
fretted banjo if your intonation is
correct<00:05:57.259> so<00:05:57.889> you<00:05:57.949> can<00:05:58.489> practice<00:05:58.699> that<00:05:59.199> pretty

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 
correct so you can practice that pretty

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:02.589 
correct so you can practice that pretty
easily<00:06:00.409> just<00:06:00.649> using<00:06:01.489> the<00:06:01.610> nails<00:06:01.879> of<00:06:02.179> your<00:06:02.389> left

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:02.599 
easily just using the nails of your left

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:15.319 
easily just using the nails of your left
hand<00:06:02.719> to<00:06:02.989> fret<00:06:03.199> the<00:06:03.229> notes

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:15.329 

00:06:15.329 --> 00:06:17.429 

practice<00:06:16.329> that<00:06:16.360> till<00:06:16.719> you<00:06:16.749> get<00:06:17.019> comfortable

00:06:17.429 --> 00:06:17.439 
practice that till you get comfortable

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:19.109 
practice that till you get comfortable
doing<00:06:17.619> it<00:06:17.919> because<00:06:18.159> it's<00:06:18.339> a<00:06:18.429> nice<00:06:18.610> handy

00:06:19.109 --> 00:06:19.119 
doing it because it's a nice handy

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:20.850 
doing it because it's a nice handy
little<00:06:19.299> trick<00:06:19.569> if<00:06:19.899> you<00:06:20.139> want<00:06:20.259> to<00:06:20.499> boost<00:06:20.679> your

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
little trick if you want to boost your

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.889 
little trick if you want to boost your
clarity<00:06:21.399> and<00:06:21.549> get<00:06:21.699> some<00:06:21.849> real<00:06:22.059> precise<00:06:22.509> tones

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:22.899 
clarity and get some real precise tones

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:25.919 
clarity and get some real precise tones
but<00:06:23.139> remember<00:06:23.999> you<00:06:24.999> want<00:06:25.209> to<00:06:25.269> be<00:06:25.449> you<00:06:25.689> want<00:06:25.809> to

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:25.929 
but remember you want to be you want to

00:06:25.929 --> 00:06:27.359 
but remember you want to be you want to
make<00:06:26.079> sure<00:06:26.110> you're<00:06:26.439> in<00:06:26.559> the<00:06:26.589> right<00:06:26.709> position

00:06:27.359 --> 00:06:27.369 
make sure you're in the right position

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:30.089 
make sure you're in the right position
verify<00:06:28.329> that<00:06:28.629> your<00:06:28.899> intonation<00:06:29.409> is<00:06:29.679> correct

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:30.099 
verify that your intonation is correct

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:34.199 
verify that your intonation is correct
there<00:06:30.339> so<00:06:31.029> I<00:06:31.449> think<00:06:31.689> that's<00:06:32.169> it<00:06:33.129> on<00:06:33.369> slides<00:06:33.849> for

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:34.209 
there so I think that's it on slides for

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:37.109 
there so I think that's it on slides for
now<00:06:34.360> we'll<00:06:35.019> get<00:06:35.199> into<00:06:35.379> how<00:06:36.369> to<00:06:36.399> incorporate

00:06:37.109 --> 00:06:37.119 
now we'll get into how to incorporate

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:39.119 
now we'll get into how to incorporate
them<00:06:37.299> into<00:06:37.449> tunes<00:06:37.809> in<00:06:38.139> subsequent<00:06:38.739> lessons

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:39.129 
them into tunes in subsequent lessons

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:41.459 
them into tunes in subsequent lessons
and<00:06:39.339> and<00:06:39.459> I<00:06:40.029> think<00:06:40.329> for<00:06:40.599> the<00:06:40.719> next<00:06:40.749> time<00:06:41.259> we'll

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:41.469 
and and I think for the next time we'll

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:44.789 
and and I think for the next time we'll
deal<00:06:41.829> with<00:06:41.889> some<00:06:42.189> drop<00:06:42.429> thumb<00:06:42.759> things<00:06:43.149> and<00:06:43.799> in

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:44.799 
deal with some drop thumb things and in

00:06:44.799 --> 00:06:46.949 
deal with some drop thumb things and in
a<00:06:44.949> further<00:06:45.219> lesson<00:06:45.759> after<00:06:46.119> that<00:06:46.299> we're<00:06:46.839> going

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:46.959 
a further lesson after that we're going

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:49.769 
a further lesson after that we're going
to<00:06:47.019> look<00:06:47.169> at<00:06:47.349> claw<00:06:48.309> hammer<00:06:48.579> improvisation<00:06:49.569> in

00:06:49.769 --> 00:06:49.779 
to look at claw hammer improvisation in

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:51.449 
to look at claw hammer improvisation in
the<00:06:50.199> round<00:06:50.379> Peak<00:06:50.559> style<00:06:50.860> which<00:06:51.009> i<00:06:51.159> think<00:06:51.369> is

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:51.459 
the round Peak style which i think is

00:06:51.459 --> 00:06:53.399 
the round Peak style which i think is
the<00:06:51.579> most<00:06:51.779> important<00:06:52.779> part<00:06:52.959> of<00:06:53.079> the<00:06:53.169> style

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:53.409 
the most important part of the style

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:55.709 
the most important part of the style
it's<00:06:53.649> the<00:06:53.679> most<00:06:53.919> exciting<00:06:54.579> aspect<00:06:55.449> of<00:06:55.569> the

00:06:55.709 --> 00:06:55.719 
it's the most exciting aspect of the

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:58.409 
it's the most exciting aspect of the
style<00:06:55.959> so<00:06:56.799> until<00:06:57.579> next<00:06:57.729> time<00:06:57.879> thank<00:06:58.239> you<00:06:58.299> very

00:06:58.409 --> 00:06:58.419 
style so until next time thank you very
