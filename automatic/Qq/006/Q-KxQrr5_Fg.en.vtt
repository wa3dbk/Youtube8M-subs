direction<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.430> soft<00:02:35.760> part<00:02:36.060> the

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
direction that the soft part the

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.940 
direction that the soft part the
hooklink<00:02:36.420> originally<00:02:37.140> goes<00:02:37.350> through<00:02:37.739> the

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
hooklink originally goes through the

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.180 
hooklink originally goes through the
loop<00:02:38.100> this<00:02:39.000> again<00:02:39.480> helps<00:02:39.900> lock<00:02:40.140> into<00:02:40.650> position

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
loop this again helps lock into position

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.790 
loop this again helps lock into position
and<00:02:42.150> then<00:02:44.239> wet<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.270> knot<00:02:46.260> with<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.440> little<00:02:46.709> bit

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
and then wet the knot with a little bit

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.310 
and then wet the knot with a little bit
of<00:02:46.890> saliva<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.640> I<00:02:47.970> find<00:02:48.300> pushing<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:48.989> down<00:02:49.170> to

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
of saliva and I find pushing it down to

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.620 
of saliva and I find pushing it down to
start<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:49.830> off<00:02:49.950> just<00:02:50.280> helps<00:02:50.640> for<00:02:50.910> marking<00:02:51.360> the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
start it off just helps for marking the

00:02:51.630 --> 00:03:00.199 
start it off just helps for marking the
the<00:02:51.900> hooklink<00:02:52.080> material<00:02:58.310> stop<00:02:59.310> pulling<00:03:00.030> down

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
the hooklink material stop pulling down

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.920 
the hooklink material stop pulling down
on<00:03:00.239> one<00:03:00.569> side<00:03:01.970> and<00:03:02.970> increasing<00:03:03.569> the<00:03:03.690> tension

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
on one side and increasing the tension

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:11.509 
on one side and increasing the tension
with<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.410> other<00:03:05.660> in<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.870> same<00:03:07.110> again<00:03:10.519> and

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
with the other in the same again and

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.640 
with the other in the same again and
that's<00:03:11.700> pretty<00:03:11.910> much<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.450> really<00:03:12.810> it's<00:03:13.350> just<00:03:13.410> a

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
that's pretty much it really it's just a

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.670 
that's pretty much it really it's just a
case<00:03:13.800> of<00:03:13.860> trimming<00:03:14.400> off<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:14.550> excess<00:03:15.680> always

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
case of trimming off the excess always

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.210 
case of trimming off the excess always
leave<00:03:17.069> a<00:03:17.459> half<00:03:18.060> a<00:03:18.269> few<00:03:18.690> millimeters<00:03:19.500> of

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
leave a half a few millimeters of

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.810 
leave a half a few millimeters of
material<00:03:21.110> of<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.769> soft<00:03:23.070> part<00:03:23.459> of<00:03:23.640> the

the<00:03:26.700> other<00:03:26.820> side<00:03:27.269> the<00:03:28.140> stiff<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:28.829> part<00:03:29.130> of<00:03:29.280> the

the other side the stiff and part of the
Kombi<00:03:30.299> link<00:03:30.540> can<00:03:30.900> be<00:03:31.250> trimmed<00:03:32.250> down<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.870> little

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
Kombi link can be trimmed down a little

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.100 
Kombi link can be trimmed down a little
bit<00:03:34.049> tighter<00:03:37.010> and<00:03:38.010> there<00:03:38.790> you<00:03:38.880> go<00:03:39.090> it's<00:03:39.989> as

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
bit tighter and there you go it's as

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
bit tighter and there you go it's as
simple<00:03:40.380> as<00:03:40.650> that

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
simple as that

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.580 
simple as that
what<00:03:41.640> I<00:03:41.670> do<00:03:41.760> at<00:03:41.970> this<00:03:42.090> point<00:03:42.360> normally<00:03:42.930> would

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
what I do at this point normally would

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.340 
what I do at this point normally would
be<00:03:43.769> dry<00:03:44.070> that<00:03:44.370> part<00:03:44.670> of<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:44.970> knockdown<00:03:45.350> and

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
be dry that part of the knockdown and

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.039 
be dry that part of the knockdown and
just<00:03:46.530> wrap<00:03:46.709> a<00:03:46.739> little<00:03:47.070> bit<00:03:47.220> of<00:03:47.900> critical<00:03:48.900> mass

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
just wrap a little bit of critical mass

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.289 
just wrap a little bit of critical mass
around<00:03:49.380> it<00:03:49.739> and<00:03:49.980> you're<00:03:50.640> ready<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:50.880> go<00:03:51.120> once

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
around it and you're ready to go once

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.289 
around it and you're ready to go once
you<00:03:51.450> hook<00:03:51.540> baits<00:03:51.810> on<00:03:52.019> ever<00:03:52.530> so<00:03:52.799> simple<00:03:53.430> you<00:03:54.060> see

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
you hook baits on ever so simple you see

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.900 
you hook baits on ever so simple you see
the<00:03:54.510> difference<00:03:54.870> between<00:03:55.519> that<00:03:56.519> and<00:03:56.700> the

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
the difference between that and the

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.330 
the difference between that and the
skinned<00:03:57.209> hook<00:03:57.390> link<00:03:57.630> is<00:03:58.079> the<00:03:58.920> relative

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
skinned hook link is the relative

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.550 
skinned hook link is the relative
stiffness<00:03:59.609> between<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.510> two<00:04:00.690> materials<00:04:01.410> is

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
stiffness between the two materials is

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.599 
stiffness between the two materials is
that<00:04:01.590> much<00:04:01.950> greater

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
that much greater

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.819 
that much greater
so<00:04:03.299> the<00:04:03.450> hooking<00:04:03.750> make<00:04:03.900> an<00:04:04.140> ism<00:04:04.440> is<00:04:04.560> that

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
so the hooking make an ism is that

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.240 
so the hooking make an ism is that
little<00:04:05.100> bit<00:04:05.430> more<00:04:05.489> efficient<00:04:06.769> really<00:04:07.769> simple

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
little bit more efficient really simple

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:19.449 
little bit more efficient really simple
really<00:04:08.760> good<00:04:09.120> and<00:04:09.359> really<00:04:10.140> reliable

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.519
