00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 yes hello you love i have one today 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.520
 product recommendation for you and stands 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:14.639
 Under the motto one buys the need 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:16.230
 you always yes there you will 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.820
 surely already ask what can 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.880
 that be and i mean i can of course 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.519
 now only go out of me but I'm talking 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.130
 from lipliner I 'm honest 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.949
 always too stingy to buy which because 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.929
 which are a lot much too expensive 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.550
 So mine is for example the make 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.380
 and buy a lipstick and then the 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.820
 corresponding lipliner then 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.190
 are you almost as much money again ? 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.190
 go into the lipliner and somehow think 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.280
 I do not need you is not me 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.469
 necessary but especially if it is super bright 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.059
 are colors or when it comes to that 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.800
 Lipstick then just really 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.649
 to make something more durable 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.289
 there you stand and that's why I wanted 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.809
 Today you again the lipliner from the 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.030
 new patrice range a little closer to 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.180
 I have heart in my big yes 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.580
 live test or the first first look of the 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.350
 patrice products you already there 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.090
 bit do you tell but after 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.760
 I'll be a bit longer now 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.619
 I've already tried it 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.490
 they just recommend you again 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.970
 they really only cost a lot of money 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:23.340
 and they are really very good too 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.229
 brace up on the one with the cling 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.990
 I can not do that to you at all 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.030
 recommend because the deviates so from all 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.650
 others from the range so look 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.020
 Maybe there is a tester 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.979
 and on it with the pearl are the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.380
 just not so nice not so silky 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.820
 somehow it crumbles a bit so 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.040
 my opinion, you are welcome 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.290
 look but I hold the with the 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.729
 The others do not succeed so well 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.770
 but they are all great and that has 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.049
 different reasons for one are the 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.579
 First of all , again from wood that is 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.950
 You can not point it out like that 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.079
 like the automatic lipliner that you 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.159
 that will somehow turn that way or so 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.469
 So you can do that with one 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.280
 commercial kohl sharpener then 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:07.290
 just make them are incredible 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.379
 creamy means they are very 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.470
 paint well and you can do that as well 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.760
 wonderful to paint the whole lip 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.920
 that now, for example, today 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.830
 I wear one of these lipliners 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.480
 like a lipstick and I have that 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.000
 always like that when I mean mine 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.220
 lipstick join in something durable 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.320
 would I take a small male 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.340
 the contour and then paint the whole 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:34.400
 lip and white then on the times 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.540
 kleenex and if you then with the 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.620
 lipstick then go over it and then 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.270
 again about a clinical goes 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.610
 maybe in between powdering again 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.340
 then you have, so to speak, a first basis 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.080
 layer with the lipliner created the 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.820
 then it is crowned by the lipstick 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.320
 and if you drink coffee then or 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.330
 maybe a little is what 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.370
 then, so to speak, the first one wears 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.650
 lipstick off and only later the 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.390
 lipliner leaving the bare lip then 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.300
 only come to light when the 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.770
 hopefully she 'll be home 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.720
 really are not at all 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.250
 so it dries up, too 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.030
 often that if I just the whole 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.940
 lip with a lipliner normal then 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:13.610
 I have a feeling like I have to 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.440
 dust spit but that's just here 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.390
 not even the case and I have you 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.880
 Now, not all of them are like that 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.380
 but here is a large part 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.380
 because a lot of beautiful natural 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.510
 that would be colors , that would be 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.489
 also one of my few points of criticism 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.430
 which I have for this lipliner so me 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:33.080
 firstly, the bright red one misses 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.140
 of course here with the colors 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:39.680
 at the current trend series of the 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.459
 lipsticks and in general so just yes 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.370
 How should I say 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.049
 But it is bright red 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.370
 Classics why is there no 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:51.769
 bright red lipstick that would be 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.080
 Something where I say then I think so too 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.640
 are very many very similar shades of brown 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.070
 Good with you, of course, you have to 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.890
 can also and depending on skin tone 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.239
 really such a small nuance 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.380
 difference in brown tone a bit 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:08.830
 what to do but generally 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.840
 I would prefer if you still have one 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.490
 but a little more variety brings in 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.040
 that may be the case 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.700
 future assortment updates still 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.940
 come 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:22.570

 absolutely to heart and we switch nevertheless

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.520
 too stingy to buy darling to go 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.680
 you there like me that you then 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.140
 lipstick at the latest thinks what 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.850
 the fuck where is my lipliner or says 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.930
