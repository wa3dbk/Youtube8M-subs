gym is going to be a couple carabiners

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.350 
gym is going to be a couple carabiners
and<00:00:10.679> you<00:00:11.099> have<00:00:11.250> lots<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:11.670> choices<00:00:11.730> when<00:00:12.240> you're

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
and you have lots of choices when you're

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.820 
and you have lots of choices when you're
picking<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.690> carabiner<00:00:13.080> that<00:00:13.320> comes<00:00:13.500> in<00:00:13.679> all

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
picking a carabiner that comes in all

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.129 
picking a carabiner that comes in all
kinds<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.280> colors<00:00:14.460> shapes<00:00:14.940> sizes<00:00:15.240> they<00:00:15.960> all

kinds of colors shapes sizes they all

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.620 
kinds of colors shapes sizes they all
serve<00:00:16.350> pretty<00:00:16.770> much<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.160> same<00:00:17.340> purpose<00:00:17.820> so<00:00:18.570> to

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
serve pretty much the same purpose so to

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.720 
serve pretty much the same purpose so to
give<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.109> couple<00:00:19.380> examples<00:00:21.619> right<00:00:22.619> here<00:00:22.920> we

type of locking carabiner both serve a

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.830 
type of locking carabiner both serve a
similar<00:00:28.680> purpose<00:00:29.000> color<00:00:30.000> doesn't<00:00:30.689> really

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
similar purpose color doesn't really

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.120 
similar purpose color doesn't really
mean<00:00:31.050> anything<00:00:31.080> you're<00:00:31.619> going<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.830> see<00:00:31.949> lots

the<00:00:34.110> most<00:00:34.320> important<00:00:34.920> feature<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.460> they

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
the most important feature is that they

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.750 
the most important feature is that they
have<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.360> screw<00:00:36.750> grate<00:00:36.960> here<00:00:37.430> which<00:00:38.430> locks

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
device these carabiners here are what

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.700 
device these carabiners here are what
are<00:00:59.820> called<00:01:00.030> non-locking<00:01:00.780> carabiners<00:01:00.809> you'll

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
are called non-locking carabiners you'll

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.889 
are called non-locking carabiners you'll
notice<00:01:02.070> there's<00:01:02.340> no<00:01:02.520> screw<00:01:02.850> gate<00:01:03.030> on<00:01:03.180> them<00:01:03.359> but

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
notice there's no screw gate on them but

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.149 
notice there's no screw gate on them but
they<00:01:04.019> also<00:01:04.199> still<00:01:04.589> look<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.799> little<00:01:04.979> bit

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
they also still look a little bit

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.710 
they also still look a little bit
different<00:01:05.580> meaning<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.330> one<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.659> these

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
different meaning that one of these

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.780 
different meaning that one of these
carabiners<00:01:07.260> has<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.500> wire<00:01:07.799> gate<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.400> other<00:01:08.549> one

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
carabiners has a wire gate the other one

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.899 
carabiners has a wire gate the other one
has<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.659> straight<00:01:10.110> gate<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.590> these<00:01:11.490> types<00:01:11.790> of

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
has a straight gate and these types of

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.670 
has a straight gate and these types of
gates<00:01:12.150> serve<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> similar<00:01:12.990> purpose<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.650> have

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
gates serve a similar purpose you have

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.620 
gates serve a similar purpose you have
some<00:01:13.979> difference<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.490> functionality<00:01:15.180> as<00:01:15.360> far

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
some difference in functionality as far

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.630 
some difference in functionality as far
as<00:01:15.810> how<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.380> carabiners<00:01:16.979> feel<00:01:17.310> when<00:01:17.549> you're

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
as how the carabiners feel when you're

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.640 
as how the carabiners feel when you're
clipping<00:01:17.820> your<00:01:18.090> rope<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.540> them<00:01:18.720> but<00:01:19.229> as<00:01:19.350> far<00:01:19.560> as

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
clipping your rope to them but as far as

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.780 
clipping your rope to them but as far as
the<00:01:19.799> strength<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.340> things<00:01:20.580> like<00:01:20.729> that

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
the strength and things like that

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.420 
the strength and things like that
they're<00:01:21.390> pretty<00:01:21.570> comparable<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.830> non-locking

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
they're pretty comparable so non-locking

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.219 
they're pretty comparable so non-locking
carabiners<00:01:23.460> are<00:01:24.240> great<00:01:24.570> for<00:01:24.960> when<00:01:25.110> you're

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
carabiners are great for when you're

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.170 
carabiners are great for when you're
sport<00:01:25.680> climbing<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.250> you're<00:01:26.340> using<00:01:26.580> those<00:01:26.880> as

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
sport climbing and you're using those as

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.120 
sport climbing and you're using those as
part<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.540> what's<00:01:27.780> called<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.049> quick-draw<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:29.009> be

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
part of what's called a quick-draw to be

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.800 
part of what's called a quick-draw to be
making<00:01:29.460> your<00:01:29.549> clips<00:01:29.880> they're<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.420> little<00:01:30.630> bit

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
making your clips they're a little bit

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.499 
making your clips they're a little bit
easier<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.140> work<00:01:31.259> with<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.909> this<00:01:32.909> would<00:01:33.360> be<00:01:33.479> a

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
easier to work with so this would be a

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.240 
easier to work with so this would be a
great<00:01:33.840> example<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.799> non-locking

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
great example of a non-locking

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.530 
great example of a non-locking
carabiners<00:01:35.450> a<00:01:37.850> final<00:01:38.850> type<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.060> carabiner

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
carabiners a final type of carabiner

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.090 
carabiners a final type of carabiner
that<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.810> might<00:01:40.020> see<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.470> something<00:01:40.770> known<00:01:41.070> as

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
that you might see is something known as

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.359 
that you might see is something known as
a<00:01:41.340> quick-draw<00:01:42.619> they<00:01:43.619> look<00:01:43.799> like<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.130> and

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
a quick-draw they look like this and

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.340 
a quick-draw they look like this and
it's<00:01:44.729> basically<00:01:45.299> two<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.630> those<00:01:45.840> non-locking

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
it's basically two of those non-locking

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.649 
it's basically two of those non-locking
carabiners<00:01:46.939> connecting<00:01:47.939> what's<00:01:48.149> known<00:01:48.360> as<00:01:48.600> a

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
carabiners connecting what's known as a

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.569 
carabiners connecting what's known as a
dog<00:01:49.079> bone<00:01:49.350> that's<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.040> piece<00:01:50.220> here<00:01:50.430> in<00:01:50.520> the

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
dog bone that's the piece here in the

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.310 
dog bone that's the piece here in the
middle<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.000> these<00:01:51.509> quick<00:01:51.780> draws<00:01:52.020> are<00:01:52.229> what

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
middle and these quick draws are what

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.499 
middle and these quick draws are what
you<00:01:52.439> use<00:01:52.470> for<00:01:52.950> lead<00:01:53.340> climbing<00:01:53.700> here<00:01:54.329> in<00:01:54.420> the

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
you use for lead climbing here in the

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.600 
you use for lead climbing here in the
gym<00:01:54.720> most<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.649> time<00:01:55.860> these<00:01:56.250> are<00:01:56.280> already

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
gym most of the time these are already

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.639 
gym most of the time these are already
going<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.000> be<00:01:57.119> fixed<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.810> wall<00:01:57.990> for<00:01:58.229> you

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
going to be fixed to the wall for you

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.139 
going to be fixed to the wall for you
but<00:01:59.130> it's<00:01:59.250> still<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.490> good<00:01:59.700> thing<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.969> be<00:02:00.090> able

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
but it's still a good thing to be able

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.899 
but it's still a good thing to be able
to<00:02:00.270> identify<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.680> one<00:02:02.130> primary<00:02:02.640> use

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
to identify and it is one primary use

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.270 
to identify and it is one primary use
for<00:02:03.390> those<00:02:03.509> non-locking<00:02:03.960> carabiners<00:02:04.280> so

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
for those non-locking carabiners so

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.980 
for those non-locking carabiners so
again<00:02:05.549> these<00:02:05.729> are<00:02:05.790> quick<00:02:06.090> draws<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.659> probably

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
again these are quick draws you probably

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.240 
again these are quick draws you probably
won't<00:02:07.110> need<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.320> purchase<00:02:07.469> any<00:02:07.710> on<00:02:07.920> your<00:02:08.069> own

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
won't need to purchase any on your own

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.190 
won't need to purchase any on your own
as<00:02:08.550> most<00:02:08.940> climbing<00:02:09.270> gyms<00:02:09.450> do<00:02:09.690> provide<00:02:10.020> them

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
as most climbing gyms do provide them

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.780 
as most climbing gyms do provide them
for<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.560> but<00:02:11.009> just<00:02:11.069> so<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.400> know<00:02:11.520> what<00:02:11.670> you're

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
looking at these are both examples

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.540 
looking at these are both examples
quick-draw<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.430> used<00:02:14.760> for<00:02:14.940> lead<00:02:15.090> climbing<00:02:15.390> and

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
quick-draw is used for lead climbing and

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.470 
quick-draw is used for lead climbing and
that's<00:02:17.550> what<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:17.790> need<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.030> know<00:02:18.150> before
