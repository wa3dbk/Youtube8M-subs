you open up blender I'll reopen blender

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.330 
you open up blender I'll reopen blender
real<00:03:08.140> quick<00:03:08.350> so<00:03:08.500> you<00:03:08.530> see<00:03:08.800> what<00:03:08.950> it<00:03:08.980> looks<00:03:09.220> like

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
real quick so you see what it looks like

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.310 
real quick so you see what it looks like
when<00:03:09.520> you<00:03:09.640> open<00:03:09.670> it<00:03:10.060> that<00:03:10.360> little<00:03:10.600> black<00:03:10.959> box

when you open it that little black box

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.100 
when you open it that little black box
opens<00:03:11.860> up<00:03:12.120> it<00:03:13.120> will<00:03:13.209> come<00:03:13.390> up<00:03:13.480> with<00:03:13.660> compiled

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
say got it if it says you don't have it

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.460 
say got it if it says you don't have it
you<00:03:22.060> did<00:03:22.269> something<00:03:22.690> wrong<00:03:22.840> installing

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
you did something wrong installing

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.250 
you did something wrong installing
Python<00:03:23.920> and<00:03:24.070> I'll<00:03:24.220> explain<00:03:24.880> how<00:03:25.150> to<00:03:25.209> fix<00:03:26.080> that

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
Python and I'll explain how to fix that

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.600 
Python and I'll explain how to fix that
in<00:03:26.380> a<00:03:26.410> different<00:03:26.530> video<00:03:26.830> if<00:03:27.160> the<00:03:27.340> problem

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
in a different video if the problem

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.800 
in a different video if the problem
arises<00:03:28.560> so<00:03:29.560> you're<00:03:29.680> just<00:03:29.980> going<00:03:30.160> to<00:03:30.250> open<00:03:30.810> the

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
arises so you're just going to open the

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.000 
arises so you're just going to open the
fire<00:03:32.290> truck<00:03:32.650> I<00:03:32.800> had<00:03:32.980> open<00:03:33.340> a<00:03:33.370> minute<00:03:33.670> ago<00:03:35.010> uh

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
fire truck I had open a minute ago uh

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.780 
fire truck I had open a minute ago uh
and<00:03:37.050> it's<00:03:38.050> pretty<00:03:38.320> sized<00:03:38.739> already<00:03:39.370> but<00:03:39.640> to

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
and it's pretty sized already but to

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.300 
and it's pretty sized already but to
size<00:03:40.060> it<00:03:40.420> you<00:03:40.570> just<00:03:40.750> file<00:03:41.440> import<00:03:44.310> ror

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
size it you just file import ror

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.440 
size it you just file import ror
importer<00:03:45.940> and<00:03:47.280> that's<00:03:48.280> just<00:03:48.519> moving<00:03:49.030> that<00:03:49.209> up

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
importer and that's just moving that up

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.000 
importer and that's just moving that up
it<00:03:49.720> should<00:03:49.750> be<00:03:50.080> pretty<00:03:50.230> easy<00:03:50.350> to<00:03:50.709> figure<00:03:50.739> out

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
it should be pretty easy to figure out

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.120 
it should be pretty easy to figure out
and<00:03:51.820> you<00:03:51.970> just<00:03:52.030> got<00:03:52.299> up<00:03:52.330> at<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.410> monster<00:03:53.890> chart

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
and you just got up at the monster chart

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.310 
and you just got up at the monster chart
truck<00:03:54.400> file<00:03:54.670> wherever<00:03:55.390> you<00:03:55.630> have<00:03:55.870> it<00:03:56.110> you

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
truck file wherever you have it you

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.140 
truck file wherever you have it you
might<00:03:56.440> have<00:03:56.500> to<00:03:56.769> extract<00:03:57.190> it<00:03:57.400> from<00:03:57.430> a<00:03:57.640> zip<00:03:57.880> but

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
might have to extract it from a zip but

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.670 
might have to extract it from a zip but
since<00:03:58.360> I<00:03:58.480> don't<00:03:58.510> have<00:03:58.720> it<00:03:59.019> in<00:03:59.110> a<00:03:59.170> zip<00:03:59.380> I<00:03:59.500> don't

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
since I don't have it in a zip I don't

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.199 
since I don't have it in a zip I don't
have<00:03:59.830> to<00:04:00.010> and<00:04:00.160> it<00:04:00.250> should<00:04:00.400> just<00:04:00.489> import<00:04:01.030> the

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
have to and it should just import the

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.810 
have to and it should just import the
little<00:04:01.500> node<00:04:02.500> beam<00:04:02.830> thing<00:04:03.160> and<00:04:03.430> you<00:04:03.610> just

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
little node beam thing and you just

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.090 
little node beam thing and you just
sighs<00:04:04.090> your<00:04:04.420> mess<00:04:04.630> it<00:04:04.840> meshes<00:04:05.110> to<00:04:05.530> this<00:04:05.769> and

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
sighs your mess it meshes to this and

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.979 
sighs your mess it meshes to this and
this<00:04:06.220> is<00:04:06.280> how<00:04:06.580> wide<00:04:06.850> and<00:04:07.150> tall<00:04:07.330> the<00:04:07.540> truck<00:04:07.780> is

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
this is how wide and tall the truck is

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.920 
this is how wide and tall the truck is
really<00:04:08.230> in<00:04:08.560> game<00:04:08.830> and<00:04:09.790> you<00:04:09.910> should<00:04:10.090> have<00:04:10.299> it

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
really in game and you should have it

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.289 
really in game and you should have it
should<00:04:11.230> be<00:04:11.440> pretty<00:04:11.590> straightforward<00:04:12.299> and

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
should be pretty straightforward and

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.060 
should be pretty straightforward and
after<00:04:13.570> you're<00:04:13.660> done<00:04:13.720> with<00:04:13.840> that<00:04:14.070> you're

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
after you're done with that you're

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.210 
after you're done with that you're
pretty<00:04:15.610> much<00:04:15.640> done<00:04:16.169> sizing<00:04:17.169> lies<00:04:17.350> just<00:04:18.070> make

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
pretty much done sizing lies just make

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.940 
pretty much done sizing lies just make
sure<00:04:18.250> you<00:04:18.430> select<00:04:18.760> every<00:04:19.450> match<00:04:19.690> press<00:04:20.289> ctrl<00:04:20.770> a

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
sure you select every match press ctrl a

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.490 
sure you select every match press ctrl a
and<00:04:21.370> then<00:04:21.549> go<00:04:21.700> to<00:04:21.729> scale<00:04:22.270> and<00:04:22.660> rotation<00:04:23.140> to

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
if you don't do that you could export it

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.520

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
the size but that's just to make sure

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.470

the<00:04:59.430> texture<00:04:59.790> for<00:05:00.030> it<00:05:00.120> because<00:05:00.240> if<00:05:00.450> you<00:05:00.540> don't

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
the texture for it because if you don't

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.140 
the texture for it because if you don't
it<00:05:00.960> won't<00:05:01.200> export<00:05:01.950> that<00:05:02.220> section<00:05:02.730> if<00:05:02.850> it's<00:05:03.000> on

it won't export that section if it's on

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.909 
it won't export that section if it's on
textured<00:05:04.850> so<00:05:05.850> if<00:05:06.000> it's<00:05:06.210> all<00:05:06.590> if<00:05:07.590> it's<00:05:07.770> all
