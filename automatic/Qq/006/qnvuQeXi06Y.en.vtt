that go across because they noticed it

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.990 
that go across because they noticed it
it<00:01:22.719> broke<00:01:23.719> down<00:01:23.780> to<00:01:24.289> you<00:01:24.530> know<00:01:24.649> this<00:01:25.609> big<00:01:25.850> it

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
it broke down to you know this big it

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.020 
it broke down to you know this big it
was<00:01:26.119> very<00:01:26.359> small<00:01:26.659> so<00:01:26.960> how<00:01:27.740> many<00:01:27.920> bars<00:01:28.789> across

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
was very small so how many bars across

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.490 
was very small so how many bars across
at<00:01:29.299> the<00:01:29.390> back<00:01:29.539> is<00:01:29.659> it<00:01:29.780> go<00:01:29.899> is<00:01:30.020> it<00:01:30.170> obviously

you break everything go on them that's

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:54.940 
you break everything go on them that's
when<00:01:53.119> you<00:01:53.210> getting<00:01:53.420> it<00:01:53.509> to<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.719> short<00:01:53.990> size<00:01:54.229> if

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
when you getting it to the short size if

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.289 
when you getting it to the short size if
you<00:01:55.070> break<00:01:55.249> every<00:01:55.549> other<00:01:55.670> one<00:01:55.880> so<00:01:56.090> you<00:01:56.119> only

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
you break every other one so you only

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.929 
you break every other one so you only
break<00:01:56.479> it<00:01:56.659> twice<00:01:56.899> leaving<00:01:57.770> two<00:01:58.369> three

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
break it twice leaving two three

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:00.940 
break it twice leaving two three
sections<00:01:59.270> of<00:01:59.390> two<00:01:59.600> that's<00:02:00.409> when<00:02:00.619> you<00:02:00.740> can<00:02:00.859> put

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
sections of two that's when you can put

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.520 
sections of two that's when you can put
it<00:02:01.039> in<00:02:01.130> your<00:02:01.219> quiver<00:02:01.420> so<00:02:02.420> all<00:02:02.960> the<00:02:03.109> options<00:02:03.409> are

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.160 
it in your quiver so all the options are
there<00:02:03.619> okay<00:02:03.979> you<00:02:04.880> can<00:02:05.060> there's<00:02:05.630> two<00:02:05.780> options

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
there okay you can there's two options

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.200 
there okay you can there's two options
really<00:02:06.350> you<00:02:06.649> can<00:02:06.829> break<00:02:07.009> it<00:02:07.159> down<00:02:07.310> so<00:02:07.969> it's

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
really you can break it down so it's

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.120 
really you can break it down so it's
fits<00:02:08.660> in<00:02:08.780> your<00:02:08.930> quiver<00:02:09.110> or<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:09.680> can<00:02:09.830> break<00:02:10.010> it

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
fits in your quiver or you can break it

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.010 
fits in your quiver or you can break it
down<00:02:10.160> to<00:02:10.460> its

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
down to its

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.510 
down to its

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
about - yeah in terms of the material do

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.270 
about - yeah in terms of the material do
you<00:02:15.580> know<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:16.140> type<00:02:17.140> of<00:02:17.170> material<00:02:17.830> that<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.100> is

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
you know the type of material that it is

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.310 
you know the type of material that it is
you<00:02:18.700> know<00:02:18.820> compared<00:02:19.210> to<00:02:19.240> the<00:02:19.390> other<00:02:19.690> bvz

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
sessions it's more of an overnighter or

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.610 
sessions it's more of an overnighter or
you<00:02:54.760> know<00:02:54.880> maybe<00:02:55.060> 48<00:02:55.480> hours<00:02:55.840> as<00:02:55.990> well<00:02:56.140> someone

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
you know maybe 48 hours as well someone

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.340 
you know maybe 48 hours as well someone
that<00:02:56.920> doesn't<00:02:57.130> mind<00:02:57.460> being<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:58.750> know<00:02:58.870> in<00:02:58.990> a<00:02:59.110> in

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
that doesn't mind being you know in a in

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.380 
that doesn't mind being you know in a in
a<00:02:59.830> tight<00:03:00.070> space<00:03:00.400> because<00:03:00.850> obviously<00:03:01.000> it's

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
a tight space because obviously it's

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.680 
a tight space because obviously it's
quite<00:03:01.630> small<00:03:01.960> but<00:03:02.590> it's<00:03:02.800> for<00:03:03.220> those<00:03:03.340> type<00:03:03.640> of

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
quite small but it's for those type of

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.090 
quite small but it's for those type of
sessions<00:03:04.690> where<00:03:04.960> you<00:03:05.560> might<00:03:05.740> be<00:03:05.890> in<00:03:05.980> an

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
sessions where you might be in an

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.970 
sessions where you might be in an
enclosed<00:03:06.490> swim<00:03:07.020> weather<00:03:08.020> you<00:03:08.290> know<00:03:08.380> you<00:03:08.440> need

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
enclosed swim weather you know you need

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.760 
enclosed swim weather you know you need
to<00:03:09.130> really<00:03:09.370> get<00:03:10.060> things<00:03:10.380> compact<00:03:11.380> is<00:03:11.620> it

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
to really get things compact is it

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.860 
to really get things compact is it
obviously<00:03:12.430> suited<00:03:12.820> more<00:03:13.060> to<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:13.420> fishermen

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
obviously suited more to the fishermen

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.290 
obviously suited more to the fishermen
that<00:03:14.050> is<00:03:14.980> going<00:03:15.160> to<00:03:15.220> be<00:03:15.310> in<00:03:15.430> those<00:03:15.610> situations

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
that is going to be in those situations

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.870 
that is going to be in those situations
really<00:03:16.750> yeah<00:03:17.590> it's<00:03:17.950> a<00:03:18.010> great<00:03:18.160> comeback<00:03:18.580> maybe

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
really yeah it's a great comeback maybe

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.270 
really yeah it's a great comeback maybe
for<00:03:19.120> room<00:03:19.540> for<00:03:19.960> the<00:03:20.020> canal<00:03:20.590> fishing<00:03:21.010> you<00:03:21.160> know

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
for room for the canal fishing you know

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
you know for the urban style of angler

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.830 
you know for the urban style of angler
you've<00:03:26.320> got<00:03:27.090> people<00:03:28.090> perhaps<00:03:28.210> fishing<00:03:28.600> really

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
you've got people perhaps fishing really

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.240 
you've got people perhaps fishing really
right<00:03:29.080> not<00:03:29.290> sure<00:03:29.620> perhaps<00:03:29.770> shouldn't<00:03:30.070> be

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
right not sure perhaps shouldn't be
