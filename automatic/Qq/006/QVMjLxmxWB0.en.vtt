00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
because you're going to be able to open

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.770 
because you're going to be able to open
that<00:00:50.820> with<00:00:52.010> with<00:00:53.010> those<00:00:53.160> being<00:00:53.489> itself<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:54.210> look

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
that with with those being itself I look

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.510 
that with with those being itself I look
like<00:00:54.960> yes<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.620> gets<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.980> all<00:00:56.129> because

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
like yes to that and gets to all because

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.010 
like yes to that and gets to all because
I've<00:00:56.610> already<00:00:56.760> got<00:00:56.910> at<00:00:57.090> my<00:00:57.210> desktop<00:00:57.600> but<00:00:57.809> yeah

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
I've already got at my desktop but yeah

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.920 
I've already got at my desktop but yeah
and<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:59.100> once<00:00:59.280> we've<00:00:59.399> done<00:00:59.430> what<00:01:00.239> we<00:01:00.359> can<00:01:00.390> do<00:01:00.690> is

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
and so once we've done what we can do is

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.200 
and so once we've done what we can do is
we<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.320> actually<00:01:01.890> open<00:01:02.280> up<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.670> folder<00:01:02.820> and

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
we can actually open up the folder and

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.600 
we can actually open up the folder and
you<00:01:03.719> will<00:01:03.750> see<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.199> as<00:01:04.350> EXO<00:01:05.040> favorite<00:01:05.460> which

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
she's got a lightning bolt going through

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.210 
she's got a lightning bolt going through
their<00:01:07.080> window<00:01:07.439> here<00:01:08.060> we<00:01:09.060> can<00:01:09.210> click<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.659> and

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
their window here we can click that and

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.020 
their window here we can click that and
what<00:01:11.220> we<00:01:11.340> can<00:01:11.490> do<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.909> basically<00:01:12.659> go<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.110> edit

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
what we can do is basically go to edit

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.520 
what we can do is basically go to edit
options<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.210> there's<00:01:15.930> actually<00:01:16.290> some

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
options and there's actually some

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.530 
options and there's actually some
options<00:01:17.369> here<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:17.700> we<00:01:17.820> can<00:01:17.970> load<00:01:18.119> up<00:01:18.150> at

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
options here so we can load up at

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.649 
options here so we can load up at
startup<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.140> bigger<00:01:19.530> thing<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.970> we<00:01:21.450> can

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
startup that bigger thing and and we can

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.520 
startup that bigger thing and and we can
do<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.520> single<00:01:23.520> click<00:01:23.640> 1/3<00:01:24.390> Khatri<00:01:24.900> icon<00:01:25.259> so

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
do the single click 1/3 Khatri icon so

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.780 
do the single click 1/3 Khatri icon so
if<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.770> wanted<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.040> open<00:01:26.220> something<00:01:26.460> up<00:01:26.640> with

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
if you wanted to open something up with

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.819 
if you wanted to open something up with
a<00:01:26.909> single<00:01:27.090> click<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.659> just<00:01:28.229> click<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.439> once<00:01:28.710> in

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
a single click you just click it once in

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.399 
a single click you just click it once in
it<00:01:28.920> pop<00:01:29.159> up<00:01:29.369> as<00:01:29.880> pretty<00:01:30.240> nice<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.689> minimize

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
it pop up as pretty nice and minimize

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.710 
it pop up as pretty nice and minimize
when<00:01:32.159> foreground<00:01:32.670> activated<00:01:33.270> when<00:01:33.600> I'm

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
when foreground activated when I'm

background I'm not really sure that

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.580 
background I'm not really sure that
means<00:01:35.189> with<00:01:36.030> minimize<00:01:36.600> went<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.110> forth<00:01:37.350> don't

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
means with minimize went and forth don't

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.100 
means with minimize went and forth don't
activate<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.250> an<00:01:38.310> employer<00:01:38.689> okay<00:01:39.689> I'm<00:01:39.930> not

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
sure and click OK on that and we can

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.859 
sure and click OK on that and we can
minimize<00:01:43.710> ur<00:01:44.509> automatically<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.720> will

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
minimize ur automatically it will

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.960 
minimize ur automatically it will
disappear<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.560> won't<00:01:46.770> be<00:01:46.920> anywhere<00:01:47.220> but<00:01:47.729> yeah

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
disappear it won't be anywhere but yeah

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
disappear it won't be anywhere but yeah
it's<00:01:48.420> stopped<00:01:48.600> running

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
it's stopped running

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.780 
it's stopped running
so<00:01:49.320> what<00:01:49.530> we<00:01:49.649> can<00:01:49.799> do<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.130> minimize<00:01:50.460> things

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
so what we can do it to minimize things

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.310 
so what we can do it to minimize things
to<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.149> system<00:01:51.450> today<00:01:51.630> we<00:01:51.899> can<00:01:52.049> hold<00:01:52.259> shift

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
to the system today we can hold shift

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.649 
to the system today we can hold shift
and<00:01:52.829> press<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.220> minimize<00:01:53.520> button<00:01:53.549> as<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.540> can

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
and press the minimize button as you can

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.209 
and press the minimize button as you can
see<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.899> little<00:01:55.079> forged<00:01:55.409> icon<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:55.860> appealed

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
see a little forged icon just appealed
