everybody wanted to hear about the

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.410 
everybody wanted to hear about the
critical<00:00:10.410> masses<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:11.580> what<00:00:11.730> they<00:00:11.880> do<00:00:11.940> on<00:00:12.300> the

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
critical masses and what they do on the

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.550 
critical masses and what they do on the
term<00:00:12.660> lab<00:00:12.930> so<00:00:13.640> guess<00:00:14.640> I'll<00:00:14.850> put<00:00:15.060> them<00:00:15.180> on<00:00:15.560> the

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
term lab so guess I'll put them on the

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.800 
term lab so guess I'll put them on the
only<00:00:16.770> thing<00:00:16.980> I've<00:00:17.100> done<00:00:17.420> testing<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.600> tuning

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
only thing I've done testing and tuning

going<00:00:41.520> I'm<00:00:41.790> not<00:00:41.970> gonna<00:00:42.120> put<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.420> 80<00:00:42.630> in

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
going I'm not gonna put the 80 in

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.340 
going I'm not gonna put the 80 in
because<00:00:44.100> even<00:00:44.640> if<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.880> did<00:00:45.180> by<00:00:45.750> making<00:00:45.960> rules

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
because even if I did by making rules

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.860 
because even if I did by making rules
that<00:00:46.500> stood<00:00:46.800> me<00:00:46.950> in<00:00:46.980> like<00:00:47.219> s3<00:00:47.910> time

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
that stood me in like s3 time
