smallest part that's where you want to
put<00:01:48.290> place<00:01:48.650> your<00:01:48.860> elastic<00:01:49.490> but<00:01:50.060> you<00:01:50.210> do<00:01:50.360> want

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
put place your elastic but you do want

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.550 
put place your elastic but you do want
to<00:01:50.600> make<00:01:50.750> sure<00:01:50.810> it's<00:01:51.080> about<00:01:51.140> two<00:01:51.530> inches

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
to make sure it's about two inches

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.030 
to make sure it's about two inches
bigger<00:01:53.140> because<00:01:54.140> when<00:01:54.500> you<00:01:54.590> cut<00:01:54.770> off<00:01:54.890> the

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
bigger because when you cut off the

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.370 
bigger because when you cut off the
sides<00:01:55.220> it<00:01:55.550> will<00:01:55.640> end<00:01:55.820> up<00:01:55.909> too<00:01:56.330> tight<00:01:56.810> plus<00:01:57.170> it's

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
sides it will end up too tight plus it's

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.289 
sides it will end up too tight plus it's
going<00:01:57.560> to<00:01:57.620> have<00:01:57.740> fabric<00:01:58.190> in<00:01:58.340> it<00:01:58.370> so<00:01:58.700> you<00:01:59.150> want

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
going to have fabric in it so you want

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.200 
going to have fabric in it so you want
to<00:01:59.390> get<00:01:59.540> elastic<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:00.470> then<00:02:01.430> you<00:02:01.610> want<00:02:01.790> to<00:02:01.880> fold

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
to get elastic and then you want to fold

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.750 
to get elastic and then you want to fold
it<00:02:02.390> in<00:02:02.540> half<00:02:02.570> and

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
it in half and

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.420 
it in half and
snip<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.240> middle<00:02:05.570> because<00:02:05.960> elastic<00:02:06.590> you're

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
snip the middle because elastic you're

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.520 
snip the middle because elastic you're
going<00:02:07.580> to<00:02:07.670> use<00:02:07.910> it<00:02:08.210> and<00:02:08.630> when<00:02:08.869> you<00:02:08.990> pull<00:02:09.290> it

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
going to use it and when you pull it

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.560 
going to use it and when you pull it

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
because it's not going to be as wide as

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.930 
because it's not going to be as wide as
the<00:02:11.810> dress<00:02:12.080> but<00:02:12.890> when<00:02:13.040> you<00:02:13.130> pull<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:13.700> you

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
so mine's goes to about 11 so what I did

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.830 
so mine's goes to about 11 so what I did
was<00:02:56.120> I<00:02:56.480> just<00:02:56.780> put<00:02:57.530> my<00:02:58.370> elastic<00:02:58.940> right<00:02:59.540> there

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840

was I just put my elastic right there
now<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:00.350> way<00:03:00.680> I<00:03:00.709> do<00:03:00.860> this<00:03:01.040> is<00:03:01.550> because<00:03:02.000> elastic

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
now the way I do this is because elastic

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.860 
now the way I do this is because elastic
is<00:03:02.810> smaller<00:03:03.080> I<00:03:03.380> first<00:03:04.190> I<00:03:04.310> place<00:03:04.610> a<00:03:04.640> pin<00:03:05.090> right

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
is smaller I first I place a pin right

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.490 
is smaller I first I place a pin right
in<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.350> middle<00:03:06.590> of<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:08.780> front<00:03:09.050> part<00:03:09.200> of<00:03:09.380> the

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
in the middle of the front part of the

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.050 
in the middle of the front part of the
dress<00:03:09.739> remember<00:03:10.010> it<00:03:10.220> doesn't<00:03:10.489> have<00:03:10.580> any<00:03:10.760> shape

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
dress remember it doesn't have any shape

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.850 
dress remember it doesn't have any shape
it's<00:03:11.239> just<00:03:11.390> a<00:03:11.480> square<00:03:11.780> you're<00:03:12.440> going<00:03:12.620> to<00:03:12.680> give

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
it's just a square you're going to give

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.670 
it's just a square you're going to give
it<00:03:12.950> a<00:03:13.040> shape<00:03:13.310> so<00:03:13.940> if<00:03:14.390> you<00:03:14.720> pull<00:03:14.959> your<00:03:14.989> elastic

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.890 
it a shape so if you pull your elastic
you<00:03:15.860> will<00:03:15.980> see<00:03:16.220> it<00:03:16.820> will<00:03:17.060> scrunch<00:03:17.480> it<00:03:17.600> in<00:03:17.720> like

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
you will see it will scrunch it in like

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.350 
you will see it will scrunch it in like
that<00:03:18.110> so<00:03:18.380> what<00:03:18.890> you're<00:03:19.010> going<00:03:19.130> to<00:03:19.190> do<00:03:19.459> next<00:03:20.090> is

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
that so what you're going to do next is

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.530 
that so what you're going to do next is
I<00:03:20.510> will<00:03:20.780> place<00:03:21.140> this<00:03:21.920> corner<00:03:22.400> part<00:03:22.670> to<00:03:23.330> this

I will place this corner part to this
end<00:03:23.989> and<00:03:25.030> then<00:03:26.030> pin<00:03:26.390> it<00:03:26.540> and<00:03:26.959> then<00:03:28.030> do<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.180> same

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
end and then pin it and then do the same

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
end and then pin it and then do the same
to<00:03:30.050> the<00:03:30.170> other<00:03:30.350> end<00:03:30.650> and<00:03:32.050> then<00:03:33.050> you<00:03:33.230> want<00:03:33.410> to

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
to the other end and then you want to

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.630 
to the other end and then you want to
place<00:03:33.680> a<00:03:33.709> pin<00:03:34.100> there<00:03:35.950> so<00:03:36.950> the<00:03:37.160> next<00:03:37.400> thing<00:03:37.610> to

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
place a pin there so the next thing to
