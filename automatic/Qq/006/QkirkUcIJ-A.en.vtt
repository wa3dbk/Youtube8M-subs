00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
hey guys it's lasagna 6 7 8 i'm here

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.630 
hey guys it's lasagna 6 7 8 i'm here
today<00:00:03.210> with<00:00:03.389> my<00:00:03.720> buddy<00:00:03.959> Cory<00:00:04.319> and<00:00:04.620> his<00:00:05.130> modern

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
today with my buddy Cory and his modern

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.560 
today with my buddy Cory and his modern
Raven<00:00:06.649> we<00:00:07.649> took<00:00:07.830> out<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.429> resistors<00:00:09.240> on<00:00:09.389> this

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
Raven we took out the resistors on this

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.690 
Raven we took out the resistors on this
and<00:00:09.780> added<00:00:09.990> 11<00:00:10.200> point<00:00:10.559> 1<00:00:10.710> volt<00:00:10.920> battery<00:00:11.400> pack

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
and added 11 point 1 volt battery pack

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.860 
and added 11 point 1 volt battery pack
to<00:00:11.730> it<00:00:12.090> so<00:00:12.179> we're<00:00:12.300> just<00:00:12.330> going<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.599> see<00:00:12.780> how

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
to it so we're just going to see how

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.709 
to it so we're just going to see how
well<00:00:13.049> it<00:00:13.110> shoots<00:00:13.440> we<00:00:14.219> got<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.730> tape<00:00:15.509> measure

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
well it shoots we got the tape measure

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.570 
well it shoots we got the tape measure
here<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.260> goes<00:00:16.379> down<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.740> hallway<00:00:17.070> so<00:00:17.310> Corey

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
here that goes down the hallway so Corey

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:25.190 
here that goes down the hallway so Corey
if<00:00:17.760> you<00:00:17.789> later<00:00:18.210> up<00:00:21.140> let<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.230> go

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.200 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:42.049 

you

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.950 

let's<00:00:43.059> take<00:00:43.329> a<00:00:43.359> look<00:00:43.660> here<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:44.710> we<00:00:44.829> start<00:00:45.960> down

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
let's take a look here so we start down

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.599 
let's take a look here so we start down
the<00:00:47.199> tape<00:00:47.410> measure<00:00:47.620> will<00:00:47.920> walk<00:00:48.070> down<00:00:48.370> the

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:48.609 
the tape measure will walk down the

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:50.369 
the tape measure will walk down the
hallway<00:00:48.910> here<00:00:49.149> that<00:00:49.390> one<00:00:49.510> for<00:00:49.809> start<00:00:50.019> hit<00:00:50.230> the

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
hallway here that one for start hit the

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:51.840 
hallway here that one for start hit the
wall<00:00:50.589> so<00:00:50.829> we're<00:00:50.949> not<00:00:51.039> going<00:00:51.250> to<00:00:51.339> count<00:00:51.550> that

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
wall so we're not going to count that

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.110 
wall so we're not going to count that
one<00:00:52.769> but<00:00:53.769> as<00:00:53.949> we<00:00:54.129> approach<00:00:54.460> the<00:00:54.640> grouping<00:00:55.000> of

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
one but as we approach the grouping of

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.959 
one but as we approach the grouping of
the<00:00:55.239> darts<00:00:55.539> here<00:00:55.859> our<00:00:56.859> first<00:00:57.129> start<00:00:57.460> ends<00:00:57.699> up

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
the darts here our first start ends up

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.979 
the darts here our first start ends up
at<00:00:58.799> 14<00:00:59.799> meters<00:01:00.370> which<00:01:00.699> is<00:01:00.850> equal<00:01:01.180> to<00:01:01.210> forty<00:01:01.659> six

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
at 14 meters which is equal to forty six

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.240 
at 14 meters which is equal to forty six
feet<00:01:02.350> and<00:01:03.339> then<00:01:03.789> our<00:01:03.909> next<00:01:03.940> one<00:01:04.390> is<00:01:04.509> at<00:01:05.250> 15.2

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
feet and then our next one is at 15.2

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.649 
feet and then our next one is at 15.2
meters<00:01:06.729> which<00:01:07.119> is<00:01:07.149> equal<00:01:07.720> to<00:01:08.580> 49<00:01:09.580> feet<00:01:10.360> 10

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
meters which is equal to 49 feet 10

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:17.580 
meters which is equal to 49 feet 10
inches<00:01:12.750> 15.8<00:01:13.750> meters<00:01:14.970> 52<00:01:15.970> feet<00:01:16.530> there's<00:01:17.530> a

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
inches 15.8 meters 52 feet there's a

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.330 
inches 15.8 meters 52 feet there's a
second<00:01:17.920> over<00:01:18.100> here<00:01:18.399> coming<00:01:19.300> up<00:01:19.509> to<00:01:20.039> 57<00:01:21.039> feet

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
second over here coming up to 57 feet

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.600 
second over here coming up to 57 feet
and<00:01:22.500> then<00:01:23.500> to<00:01:24.340> over<00:01:24.729> here<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.920> fifty<00:01:27.429> nine

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
and then to over here and fifty nine

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.600 
and then to over here and fifty nine
feet<00:01:29.220> farthest<00:01:30.220> one<00:01:30.429> is<00:01:30.610> at<00:01:30.840> 19<00:01:31.840> meters

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
feet farthest one is at 19 meters

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.380 
feet farthest one is at 19 meters
actually<00:01:33.610> that's<00:01:33.729> their<00:01:33.880> second<00:01:34.210> part<00:01:34.360> of

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
actually that's their second part of

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.710 
actually that's their second part of
this<00:01:34.479> 162<00:01:35.229> beat<00:01:35.819> our<00:01:36.819> farthest<00:01:37.330> one<00:01:37.509> right

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
this 162 beat our farthest one right

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:44.249 
this 162 beat our farthest one right
here<00:01:38.399> is<00:01:39.479> at<00:01:41.039> twenty<00:01:42.039> point<00:01:42.369> 3<00:01:42.850> meters<00:01:43.259> which

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
here is at twenty point 3 meters which

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.149 
here is at twenty point 3 meters which
is<00:01:44.399> 67<00:01:45.399> feet<00:01:45.610> so<00:01:46.000> overall<00:01:46.990> a<00:01:47.380> nice<00:01:47.799> little

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
is 67 feet so overall a nice little

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.039 
is 67 feet so overall a nice little
blaster<00:01:48.700> court<00:01:49.030> if<00:01:49.119> you'd<00:01:49.299> show<00:01:49.509> this<00:01:49.689> to<00:01:49.899> us

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
blaster court if you'd show this to us

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:55.920 
blaster court if you'd show this to us
again<00:01:52.469> resistors<00:01:53.469> removed<00:01:53.979> and<00:01:54.490> 11.1<00:01:55.180> volt

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
again resistors removed and 11.1 volt

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.139 
again resistors removed and 11.1 volt
modification<00:01:56.649> done<00:01:56.829> to<00:01:57.070> it<00:01:57.219> overall<00:01:58.000> I'm

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
modification done to it overall I'm

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.029 
modification done to it overall I'm
liking<00:01:58.420> a<00:01:58.479> look<00:01:58.659> of<00:01:58.780> it<00:01:58.899> so<00:01:59.109> stay<00:01:59.350> tuned<00:01:59.590> for<00:02:00.009> a
