00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
remember when you get new motherboards

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.459 
remember when you get new motherboards
or<00:00:54.750> if<00:00:55.140> you're<00:00:55.289> getting<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:56.039> new<00:00:56.850> PC<00:00:57.270> never<00:00:57.960> use

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
or if you're getting a new PC never use

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.099 
or if you're getting a new PC never use
the<00:00:58.649> drivers<00:00:59.129> on<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.579> CD<00:00:59.910> because<00:01:00.809> they're

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
the drivers on the CD because they're

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.580 
the drivers on the CD because they're
always<00:01:01.260> out<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.559> date<00:01:04.909> yeah<00:01:06.229> one<00:01:07.229> thing<00:01:07.439> to

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
always out of date yeah one thing to

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.010 
always out of date yeah one thing to
know<00:01:07.710> if<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.040> get<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.340> motherboard<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.150> sli

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
know if you get this motherboard the sli

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.760 
know if you get this motherboard the sli
bridge<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:11.070> solid<00:01:12.110> sli<00:01:13.110> bridge<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.530> not<00:01:13.740> a

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
bridge is a solid sli bridge is not a

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.820 
bridge is a solid sli bridge is not a
flexi<00:01:14.310> one<00:01:14.490> which<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:14.970> kind<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.240> stupid<00:01:15.830> but

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
flexi one which is kind of stupid but

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.370 
flexi one which is kind of stupid but
nonetheless<00:01:19.070> here's<00:01:20.070> my<00:01:20.220> question<00:01:21.259> where<00:01:22.259> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
nonetheless here's my question where the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.410 
nonetheless here's my question where the
hell<00:01:22.560> does<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:22.799> go<00:01:24.500> it's<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:26.689> USB<00:01:27.689> 3.0<00:01:28.560> port

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
hell does this go it's a USB 3.0 port

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.910 
hell does this go it's a USB 3.0 port
it's<00:01:30.420> either<00:01:30.630> for<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.960> front<00:01:31.320> panel<00:01:31.680> or<00:01:31.890> the

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
it's either for the front panel or the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.560 
it's either for the front panel or the
back<00:01:32.670> panel<00:01:33.090> but<00:01:34.400> you<00:01:35.400> can<00:01:35.579> actually<00:01:35.970> take<00:01:36.509> the

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
back panel but you can actually take the

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.149 
back panel but you can actually take the
connector<00:01:39.570> or<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.900> header<00:01:40.619> out<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.159> then<00:01:41.880> put

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
connector or the header out and then put

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.730 
connector or the header out and then put
this<00:01:44.159> on<00:01:44.850> over<00:01:45.570> them<00:01:45.840> but<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.259> don't<00:01:46.470> know<00:01:46.560> how

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
this on over them but I don't know how

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.280 
this on over them but I don't know how
the<00:01:46.799> hell<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.369> would<00:01:48.210> actually<00:01:48.420> get<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:48.990> to

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
the hell you would actually get this to

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.230 
the hell you would actually get this to
stick<00:01:49.759> into<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.649> which<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:53.310> don't<00:01:53.850> know<00:01:53.939> if<00:01:54.090> any

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
stick into the which I don't know if any

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.670 
stick into the which I don't know if any
of<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.450> guys<00:01:54.540> actually<00:01:54.810> know<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.259> answer<00:01:55.560> to

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
so I'm gonna do a overclocking video as

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.359 
so I'm gonna do a overclocking video as
well<00:02:05.040> which<00:02:05.520> should<00:02:05.549> go<00:02:06.119> up<00:02:06.270> after<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:06.810> video

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
well which should go up after this video

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.979 
well which should go up after this video
please<00:02:08.369> excuse<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.090> cable<00:02:09.780> management

please excuse the cable management

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.830 
please excuse the cable management
because<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:10.920> was<00:02:11.099> just<00:02:11.129> chucked<00:02:11.670> in

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
because this was just chucked in

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.740 
because this was just chucked in
when<00:02:13.650> when<00:02:14.489> my<00:02:14.520> old<00:02:14.849> motherboard<00:02:15.569> was

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
when when my old motherboard was

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.770 
when when my old motherboard was
actually<00:02:16.590> in<00:02:16.980> my<00:02:17.069> case<00:02:17.430> so<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.150> didn't<00:02:18.660> have

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
actually in my case so I didn't have

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.540 
actually in my case so I didn't have
enough<00:02:19.230> time<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.680> actually<00:02:19.830> go<00:02:20.160> through<00:02:20.340> and

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
enough time to actually go through and

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.790 
enough time to actually go through and
read<00:02:20.970> cable<00:02:21.360> or<00:02:21.569> remarriage<00:02:22.260> everything<00:02:23.599> this

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
read cable or remarriage everything this

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.750 
read cable or remarriage everything this
24<00:02:25.800> pin<00:02:26.750> power<00:02:27.750> connector<00:02:27.959> is<00:02:28.769> too<00:02:29.040> fat<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.610> go

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
24 pin power connector is too fat to go

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.610 
24 pin power connector is too fat to go
behind<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.239> case<00:02:30.450> so<00:02:30.750> I<00:02:30.780> need<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.260> get<00:02:31.380> a<00:02:31.410> new

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
behind the case so I need to get a new

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.229 
behind the case so I need to get a new
case<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.480> yeah<00:02:33.480> hopefully<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.910> case<00:02:36.090> that

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
case and yeah hopefully the case that

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.589 
case and yeah hopefully the case that
I'm<00:02:36.360> getting<00:02:36.690> or<00:02:36.959> hopefully<00:02:37.380> get<00:02:37.590> is<00:02:38.599> better

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
I'm getting or hopefully get is better

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.130 
I'm getting or hopefully get is better
than<00:02:40.080> this<00:02:40.260> one<00:02:40.319> all<00:02:40.860> right<00:02:40.950> so<00:02:41.810> there's<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.870> few

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
than this one all right so there's a few

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.259 
than this one all right so there's a few
issues<00:02:43.709> with<00:02:44.129> this<00:02:44.250> motherboard<00:02:44.580> or<00:02:45.090> not

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
issues with this motherboard or not

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.110 
issues with this motherboard or not
issues<00:02:45.780> but<00:02:46.110> just<00:02:46.190> hiccups<00:02:47.190> that<00:02:47.340> I<00:02:47.519> don't

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
issues but just hiccups that I don't

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.789 
issues but just hiccups that I don't
know<00:02:48.180> whether<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.630> manufacturer<00:02:49.260> actually

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
know whether the manufacturer actually

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.620 
know whether the manufacturer actually
realizes<00:02:50.519> this<00:02:50.730> or<00:02:50.940> whether<00:02:51.150> this<00:02:51.390> was<00:02:51.450> just

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
realizes this or whether this was just

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.949 
realizes this or whether this was just
on<00:02:51.930> my<00:02:52.200> board<00:02:52.440> specifically<00:02:53.280> but<00:02:54.030> when<00:02:54.630> I

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
on my board specifically but when I

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.789 
on my board specifically but when I
booted<00:02:55.440> up<00:02:55.530> my<00:02:55.680> system<00:02:56.040> right<00:02:57.200> with<00:02:58.200> my

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
booted up my system right with my

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.180 
booted up my system right with my
graphics<00:02:59.190> card<00:02:59.250> plugged<00:02:59.819> in<00:03:00.060> so<00:03:01.040> here's<00:03:02.040> my

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
graphics card plugged in so here's my

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.470 
graphics card plugged in so here's my
graphics<00:03:02.549> card<00:03:02.610> yes<00:03:03.299> it's<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.569> reference<00:03:05.269> so<00:03:06.269> my

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
graphics card yes it's a reference so my

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.009 
graphics card yes it's a reference so my
graphics<00:03:06.810> card<00:03:06.840> was<00:03:07.170> in<00:03:07.319> yeah<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:07.680> I<00:03:09.019> plugged

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
graphics card was in yeah and I plugged

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.160 
graphics card was in yeah and I plugged
in<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.349> DVI<00:03:10.860> connector<00:03:11.459> which<00:03:11.730> is<00:03:12.170> here

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
in the DVI connector which is here

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.650 
in the DVI connector which is here
plugged<00:03:14.010> it<00:03:14.130> in<00:03:14.280> plugged<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.150> into<00:03:15.269> my<00:03:15.450> monitor

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
plugged it in plugged it into my monitor

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.599 
plugged it in plugged it into my monitor
and<00:03:16.639> nothing<00:03:17.639> happened<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:19.010> this<00:03:20.010> little

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
and nothing happened and this little

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.680 
and nothing happened and this little
dial<00:03:20.970> gave<00:03:21.480> me<00:03:21.630> an<00:03:21.720> a2<00:03:21.989> reading<00:03:23.389> now<00:03:24.389> I'll<00:03:24.540> show

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
dial gave me an a2 reading now I'll show

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.039 
dial gave me an a2 reading now I'll show
you<00:03:24.780> what<00:03:24.900> an<00:03:24.989> a2<00:03:25.200> reading<00:03:25.769> is<00:03:25.889> hold<00:03:26.130> on<00:03:27.049> okay

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
you what an a2 reading is hold on okay

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.440 
you what an a2 reading is hold on okay
guys<00:03:28.350> now<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:29.370> don't<00:03:29.519> know<00:03:29.760> whether<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.299> can

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
guys now I don't know whether you can

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.240 
guys now I don't know whether you can
see<00:03:30.780> this<00:03:30.959> I'll<00:03:31.170> try<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:31.500> make<00:03:31.590> it<00:03:31.769> easier<00:03:32.220> for

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
see this I'll try and make it easier for

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.379 
see this I'll try and make it easier for
you<00:03:34.700> I'm<00:03:35.700> gonna<00:03:35.850> have<00:03:35.940> to<00:03:36.060> do<00:03:36.150> this<00:03:36.269> the

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
you I'm gonna have to do this the

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:37.099 
you I'm gonna have to do this the
old-fashioned<00:03:36.959> way

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
old-fashioned way

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:41.629 
old-fashioned way
OOP<00:03:38.090> okay<00:03:39.090> so<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.720> fourth<00:03:40.079> one<00:03:40.200> there<00:03:40.680> is<00:03:40.980> the

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
OOP okay so the fourth one there is the

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.800 
OOP okay so the fourth one there is the
a2<00:03:42.269> reading<00:03:43.019> so<00:03:43.590> it's<00:03:43.920> right<00:03:44.190> here<00:03:44.459> a<00:03:44.670> 2<00:03:45.060> IDE

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
a2 reading so it's right here a 2 IDE

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.910 
a2 reading so it's right here a 2 IDE
detect<00:03:46.590> and<00:03:46.980> that<00:03:47.790> was<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.350> message<00:03:49.350> that<00:03:49.739> the

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
detect and that was the message that the

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.069 
detect and that was the message that the
motherboard<00:03:50.340> gave<00:03:50.609> me<00:03:50.819> every<00:03:51.180> time<00:03:51.329> I<00:03:51.389> started

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
motherboard gave me every time I started

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.979 
motherboard gave me every time I started
to<00:03:52.200> turn<00:03:52.380> on<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.739> system<00:03:53.280> with<00:03:53.600> my<00:03:54.600> graphics

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
to turn on the system with my graphics

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.150 
to turn on the system with my graphics
card<00:03:55.049> plugged<00:03:55.470> in<00:03:55.670> so<00:03:56.670> I<00:03:56.700> took<00:03:57.209> that<00:03:57.389> out<00:03:57.450> and

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
card plugged in so I took that out and

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.879 
card plugged in so I took that out and
then<00:04:00.200> found<00:04:01.200> out<00:04:01.440> that<00:04:01.500> for<00:04:01.980> some<00:04:02.010> reason<00:04:02.750> if<00:04:03.889> I

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
then found out that for some reason if I

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.580 
then found out that for some reason if I
plug<00:04:05.400> these<00:04:05.760> SATA<00:04:06.180> connectors<00:04:06.780> so<00:04:07.079> I've<00:04:07.349> got

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
plug these SATA connectors so I've got

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.520 
plug these SATA connectors so I've got
three<00:04:07.889> so<00:04:08.190> there's<00:04:08.459> one<00:04:08.700> two<00:04:09.109> so<00:04:10.109> there's<00:04:10.319> two

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
three so there's one two so there's two

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.789 
three so there's one two so there's two
here<00:04:10.859> one<00:04:11.250> here<00:04:11.519> right<00:04:11.880> if<00:04:12.660> I<00:04:12.840> plug<00:04:13.169> them<00:04:13.410> into

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
here one here right if I plug them into

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.670 
here one here right if I plug them into
here<00:04:14.639> so<00:04:14.970> both<00:04:15.359> two<00:04:15.780> will<00:04:15.989> plug<00:04:16.200> into<00:04:16.410> these

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
here so both two will plug into these

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.909 
here so both two will plug into these
SATA<00:04:17.370> connectors<00:04:17.880> then<00:04:18.450> one<00:04:18.660> was<00:04:18.840> in<00:04:18.959> here<00:04:19.229> the

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
SATA connectors then one was in here the

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.680 
SATA connectors then one was in here the
system<00:04:20.609> still<00:04:21.120> wouldn't<00:04:21.450> be<00:04:21.800> so<00:04:22.800> I<00:04:23.190> thought

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
system still wouldn't be so I thought

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.820 
system still wouldn't be so I thought
what<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.720> hell

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
what the hell

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.980 
what the hell
and<00:04:25.889> I<00:04:26.099> just<00:04:26.610> thought<00:04:27.090> for<00:04:27.150> giggles<00:04:27.720> I<00:04:27.870> would

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
and I just thought for giggles I would

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.589 
and I just thought for giggles I would
move<00:04:28.199> him<00:04:28.379> up<00:04:28.530> to<00:04:28.560> SATA<00:04:29.189> port<00:04:29.490> one<00:04:29.759> two<00:04:30.300> and

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:30.599 
move him up to SATA port one two and

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:35.330 
move him up to SATA port one two and
three<00:04:31.259> and<00:04:33.349> still<00:04:34.349> having<00:04:34.830> my<00:04:34.919> graphics<00:04:35.280> card

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
three and still having my graphics card

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.529 
three and still having my graphics card
removed<00:04:35.969> so<00:04:36.629> that<00:04:37.639> actually<00:04:38.639> worked<00:04:38.909> somehow

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:46.429 

but<00:04:42.539> before<00:04:43.110> that<00:04:43.620> actually<00:04:43.919> worked<00:04:44.460> I<00:04:45.259> had<00:04:46.259> to

00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:46.439 
but before that actually worked I had to

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:48.320 
but before that actually worked I had to
figure<00:04:46.650> out<00:04:46.770> why<00:04:47.129> the<00:04:47.189> memory<00:04:47.669> wasn't<00:04:47.849> working

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
figure out why the memory wasn't working

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.550 
figure out why the memory wasn't working
so<00:04:49.169> it<00:04:49.620> gave<00:04:50.039> me<00:04:50.189> another<00:04:51.020> code<00:04:52.020> I<00:04:52.259> think<00:04:52.469> it

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
so it gave me another code I think it

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.969 
so it gave me another code I think it
was<00:04:52.740> h2<00:04:53.430> or<00:04:53.669> something<00:04:54.090> that<00:04:54.689> said<00:04:55.020> memory

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
was h2 or something that said memory

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:57.830 
was h2 or something that said memory
insufficient<00:04:56.969> or<00:04:57.150> something<00:04:57.509> like<00:04:57.629> that

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
insufficient or something like that

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.330 
insufficient or something like that
because<00:04:57.990> I<00:04:58.110> had<00:04:58.259> it<00:04:58.379> in<00:04:58.500> a<00:04:58.949> 1<00:04:59.819> and<00:05:00.090> B<00:05:00.229> b1<00:05:01.229> so<00:05:02.009> I

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
because I had it in a 1 and B b1 so I

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.070 
because I had it in a 1 and B b1 so I
would<00:05:02.520> have<00:05:02.610> thought<00:05:02.759> that<00:05:02.909> it<00:05:03.030> would<00:05:03.120> be<00:05:03.150> a<00:05:03.509> B

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
would have thought that it would be a B

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:11.480 
would have thought that it would be a B
a<00:05:04.909> yeah<00:05:05.909> a<00:05:06.060> 1<00:05:06.509> B<00:05:06.930> 1<00:05:07.229> a<00:05:07.669> 2<00:05:08.669> B<00:05:09.270> 2<00:05:09.509> but<00:05:10.289> no<00:05:10.440> it's<00:05:10.800> a<00:05:10.979> 1

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
a yeah a 1 B 1 a 2 B 2 but no it's a 1

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:17.600 
a yeah a 1 B 1 a 2 B 2 but no it's a 1
and<00:05:12.050> a<00:05:13.050> 2<00:05:14.060> so<00:05:15.060> that<00:05:15.569> kind<00:05:16.020> of<00:05:16.460> screwed<00:05:17.460> me

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
and a 2 so that kind of screwed me

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.490 
and a 2 so that kind of screwed me
around<00:05:17.879> a<00:05:18.000> little<00:05:18.029> bit<00:05:18.300> but<00:05:18.479> after<00:05:18.750> all<00:05:19.139> this<00:05:19.259> I

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
around a little bit but after all this I

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.600 
around a little bit but after all this I
did<00:05:20.009> end<00:05:20.310> up<00:05:20.460> fixing<00:05:20.940> it<00:05:21.319> and<00:05:22.340> I'll<00:05:23.340> show<00:05:23.580> you

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
did end up fixing it and I'll show you
