00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.290
 hello get it 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.290
 the papu that the mini to whom multitude of uses 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.069
 that calendar in the oven 

00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:12.109
 to keep something cold in the refrigerator 

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:17.039
 but have you ever wondered if Cuba in a block of solid aluminum is 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.039
 transforms into a very thin sheet of aluminum foil 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.279
 the manufacture of aluminum foil involves repeatedly lowering a block 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.849
 large aluminum 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.630
 we started by melting pure aluminum ingots in a natural gas furnace 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.000
 these ingots are fundamental in alloys with five 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.240
 titanium and if the ife 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.740
 It takes between three and eight hours to melt 27,000 kilos of aluminum in 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.239
 this remelting furnace 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.239
 that works 750 degrees 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.070
 the melting temperature of aluminum is 6 160 degrees centigrade 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.760
 a portion of the aluminum they pour this little hill to take a 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.590
 sample 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.490
 the sample that solidifies in seconds will be analyzed to verify the 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.490
 contents of the prepared alloy 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.500
 this channel is used to carry aluminum from the remelting furnace 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.890
 up to the molds 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.640
 the molten aluminum circulates through a mobile channel located on the mountains 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.770
 during this stage the impurities that are going to stop 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.770
 special receptacles 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.580
 the molds cool with water to accelerate the solidification of aluminum 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.520
 molten 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.240
 once extracted from the mountain 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.850
 are ready for milling 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.170
 each ingot is huge measures 4 point four meters long one to four 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.140
 meters wide 45 centimeters thick and weighs an impressive 7 thousand 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.189
 500 kilos 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.389
 so they must be handled with cranes and placed on plates 

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:03.790
 special 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.020
 This machine eliminates three millimeters of the thickness of the ingot and with them the 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.129
 impurities to get a completely smooth finish 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.489
 the remains of the liquid used to cool the blades that scraped the 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.489
 ingot should also be eliminated 

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:27.610
 begin the numerous steps to reduce the thickness of the ingot 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.600
 the aluminum block that square term 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.600
 deadlines lamy minaya mine 

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:40.949
 the temperature in the rollers is between 455 and 540 degrees 2 

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:44.280
 a technician continuously checks the ingot pressure 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.769
 if it is too high it is lowered and the technician then adjusts the pressure 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.489
 the heat is such that the ingot runs the risk of sticking to the roller 

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:58.639
 to avoid it the whole process is cooled with a liquid that is 95% water hi-5 by 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.639
 one hundred oil 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:10.859
 the ingot that began with a thickness of 45 centimeters is being made every time 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.619
 more wine with each pass 

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:16.559
 depending on the needs the ingot will pass through the machine between 12 

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:18.739
 and 16 times 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.519
 right now my seven centimeters thick 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.519
 but it has to go down to half a centimeter 

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:34.879
 at this point the ingot measures five centimeters and little more than nine meters 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:36.369
 of length 

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:39.729
 This belt transported iron during the stages of rolling 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.439
 the ingot has already turned into a five millimeter sheet is what 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:57.060
 fine enough to go to winding where it will roll over on itself 

00:03:57.059 --> 00:04:01.019
 before being sent to cold rolling where it will be further reduced 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.019
 its thickness 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.759
 the aluminum sheet is already very fine it can be broken by the attention required to 

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:12.599
 cold rolling 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.599
 the mine will be doubled to prevent breakage 

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:21.859
 one last reduction in the laminator and the sheet will have the required thickness 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:22.919
 for the client 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.229
 To prevent the aluminum from sticking to the rollers a liquid is used 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.930
 refrigerant 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.830
 and how the edges of the sheet are slightly damaged and wrinkled 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.830
 a blade eliminates a strip one centimeter thick 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.220
 Finally the roll is cut the desired width 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.680
 and a huge ingot has produced 12 com to seven kilometers of aluminum foil
