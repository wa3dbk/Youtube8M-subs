00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
view of the as yet unfinished road let's

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.160 
view of the as yet unfinished road let's
lift<00:03:02.390> that<00:03:02.540> hatch<00:03:02.750> up<00:03:03.819> so<00:03:04.819> there's<00:03:05.480> four<00:03:05.540> exit

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
lift that hatch up so there's four exit

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.830 
lift that hatch up so there's four exit
ways<00:03:06.349> and<00:03:06.709> we're<00:03:07.370> missing<00:03:09.190> fill<00:03:10.190> that<00:03:10.340> in

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
ways and we're missing fill that in

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.300 
ways and we're missing fill that in
there

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.690 

so<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.150> top<00:03:17.330> of<00:03:17.510> this<00:03:17.690> building<00:03:18.370> also<00:03:19.370> has

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
so the top of this building also has

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.460 
so the top of this building also has
trees<00:03:20.030> as<00:03:20.270> the<00:03:20.390> same<00:03:20.569> trees<00:03:20.810> is<00:03:21.050> done<00:03:21.260> there

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
trees as the same trees is done there

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.570 
trees as the same trees is done there
and<00:03:23.470> this<00:03:24.470> is<00:03:24.620> a<00:03:24.650> water<00:03:24.890> bridge<00:03:25.190> like<00:03:25.430> that

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
and this is a water bridge like that

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.100 
and this is a water bridge like that
other<00:03:25.790> one<00:03:26.920> and<00:03:27.920> you<00:03:28.280> can<00:03:28.310> see<00:03:28.670> it<00:03:28.870> goes<00:03:29.870> right

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
other one and you can see it goes right

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.729 
other one and you can see it goes right
through<00:03:30.410> that<00:03:30.440> side<00:03:30.950> and<00:03:31.810> on<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:32.900> other<00:03:33.260> side

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
through that side and on the other side

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:39.580 
through that side and on the other side
it<00:03:34.190> goes<00:03:34.400> right<00:03:34.640> through<00:03:36.880> and<00:03:38.440> this<00:03:39.440> is

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
it goes right through and this is

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.740 
it goes right through and this is
another<00:03:39.830> building<00:03:40.430> I've<00:03:40.550> started<00:03:40.970> it's<00:03:41.450> a

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
another building I've started it's a

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.040 
another building I've started it's a
sort<00:03:42.530> of<00:03:42.560> curved<00:03:42.860> archway<00:03:43.519> thing<00:03:43.810> and<00:03:44.810> over

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
sort of curved archway thing and over

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.350 
sort of curved archway thing and over
here<00:03:45.080> is<00:03:45.410> my<00:03:45.620> water<00:03:45.950> wall<00:03:48.459> so<00:03:49.459> it<00:03:49.640> goes<00:03:50.150> right

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
here is my water wall so it goes right

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.300 
here is my water wall so it goes right
down<00:03:50.390> and<00:03:50.959> there's<00:03:51.200> just<00:03:51.470> mostly<00:03:51.830> stone<00:03:52.160> at

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
down and there's just mostly stone at

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.590 
down and there's just mostly stone at
the<00:03:52.340> bottom<00:03:52.780> has<00:03:53.780> redstone<00:03:54.380> lamps<00:03:54.709> behind<00:03:55.069> it

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
the bottom has redstone lamps behind it

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.570 
the bottom has redstone lamps behind it
and<00:03:56.600> it'll<00:03:56.810> fountains<00:03:57.650> hanging<00:03:58.220> down<00:03:58.540> and

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
and it'll fountains hanging down and

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.830 
and it'll fountains hanging down and
opposite<00:04:01.580> that<00:04:01.970> little<00:04:02.299> bridge<00:04:02.480> there

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
opposite that little bridge there

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.390 
opposite that little bridge there
there's<00:04:03.170> a<00:04:03.230> bridge<00:04:03.410> coming<00:04:03.590> up<00:04:03.799> this<00:04:03.950> side<00:04:04.160> and

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
there's a bridge coming up this side and

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.320 
there's a bridge coming up this side and
I've<00:04:04.549> extended<00:04:05.120> the<00:04:05.450> water<00:04:05.660> war<00:04:06.700> to<00:04:07.700> fold<00:04:08.180> into

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
I've extended the water war to fold into

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.280 
I've extended the water war to fold into
the<00:04:08.569> corners<00:04:08.959> and<00:04:09.170> carry<00:04:09.830> up<00:04:11.019> so<00:04:12.019> that's<00:04:12.140> the

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
the corners and carry up so that's the

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.410 
the corners and carry up so that's the
world<00:04:12.470> so<00:04:12.709> far<00:04:12.950> and<00:04:13.430> this<00:04:13.580> is<00:04:13.700> on<00:04:13.880> chunk<00:04:14.209> error

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420

world so far and this is on chunk error
if<00:04:15.080> you<00:04:15.200> don't<00:04:15.440> know<00:04:15.590> what<00:04:15.769> chunkier<00:04:16.130> is<00:04:16.340> it's

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
if you don't know what chunkier is it's

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.580 
if you don't know what chunkier is it's

which<00:04:31.640> is<00:04:31.880> quite<00:04:32.210> sizable<00:04:32.780> you're<00:04:33.500> not<00:04:33.590> going

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
which is quite sizable you're not going

to be doing any extreme adventuring but
it<00:04:35.330> certainly<00:04:35.539> enough<00:04:35.900> to<00:04:35.990> go<00:04:36.080> spelunking<00:04:36.320> and

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
it certainly enough to go spelunking and

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.360
