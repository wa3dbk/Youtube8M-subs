00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.780 

so<00:00:00.539> let's<00:00:00.719> run<00:00:00.900> through<00:00:01.260> some<00:00:01.920> terminology<00:00:02.610> of

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
so let's run through some terminology of

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.240 
so let's run through some terminology of
framing<00:00:03.480> so<00:00:04.049> the<00:00:04.410> wall<00:00:04.589> that<00:00:04.770> I've<00:00:04.920> just

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
framing so the wall that I've just

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.490 
framing so the wall that I've just
sketched<00:00:05.370> out<00:00:05.790> here<00:00:06.000> quick<00:00:06.299> is<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:06.960> little

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
sketched out here quick is a little

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.240 
sketched out here quick is a little
bearing<00:00:07.740> wall<00:00:08.389> so<00:00:09.389> I've<00:00:10.260> labeled<00:00:10.559> each<00:00:10.860> part

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
bearing wall so I've labeled each part

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.669 
bearing wall so I've labeled each part
so<00:00:11.639> down<00:00:12.059> here<00:00:12.420> you<00:00:12.630> have<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.080> bottom<00:00:13.410> plate

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
so down here you have the bottom plate

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.150 
so down here you have the bottom plate
or<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.250> sole<00:00:14.490> plate<00:00:15.500> these<00:00:16.500> are<00:00:16.740> your<00:00:16.830> studs

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
or the sole plate these are your studs

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.000 
or the sole plate these are your studs
so<00:00:17.430> these<00:00:17.580> this<00:00:17.940> would<00:00:18.119> be<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.270> stud<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:19.590> this

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
so these this would be a stud this this

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.269 
so these this would be a stud this this
all<00:00:20.250> these<00:00:20.460> right<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.029> even<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:22.199> ones<00:00:22.439> right

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
all these right and even the ones right

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.929 
all these right and even the ones right
here<00:00:23.310> on<00:00:24.859> either<00:00:25.859> side<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.490> door<00:00:26.670> we'll

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
here on either side of the door we'll

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.109 
here on either side of the door we'll
get<00:00:27.119> into<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.390> in<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> sec<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:28.939> here's<00:00:29.939> your

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
get into that in a sec so here's your

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.970 
get into that in a sec so here's your
top<00:00:30.390> plate<00:00:30.720> that's<00:00:31.019> one<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.470> sits<00:00:31.769> directly

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
top plate that's one that sits directly

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.060 
top plate that's one that sits directly
on<00:00:32.489> top<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.790> your<00:00:33.030> studs<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.660> then<00:00:34.530> your<00:00:34.739> cat

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
on top of your studs and then your cat

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.270 
on top of your studs and then your cat
plate<00:00:35.460> goes<00:00:35.760> another<00:00:36.360> layer<00:00:36.660> there<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.920> this

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
plate goes another layer there in this

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.299 
plate goes another layer there in this
scenario<00:00:38.989> the<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.860> load-bearing<00:00:41.100> wall

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
scenario the this is a load-bearing wall

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.139 
scenario the this is a load-bearing wall
the<00:00:42.149> reason<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.570> have<00:00:42.750> two<00:00:43.020> top<00:00:43.290> plates<00:00:43.649> is

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
the reason you have two top plates is

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.190 
the reason you have two top plates is
because<00:00:45.289> for<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.320> load<00:00:46.559> bearing<00:00:46.940> unless<00:00:48.200> your

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
because for a load bearing unless your

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.350 
because for a load bearing unless your
joists<00:00:49.829> or<00:00:50.160> your<00:00:50.370> trusses<00:00:50.879> lend<00:00:51.120> directly

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
joists or your trusses lend directly

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.310 
joists or your trusses lend directly
over<00:00:52.199> top<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.710> stud<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.329> need<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.510> two<00:00:55.050> top

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
over top of a stud you need the two top

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.770 
over top of a stud you need the two top
plate<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.070> other<00:00:56.190> words<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:57.239> need<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.539> two

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
plate so in other words you need the two

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.490 
plate so in other words you need the two
top<00:00:58.260> plates<00:00:58.969> in<00:00:59.969> order<00:01:00.329> for<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.570> lower<00:01:00.750> load

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
top plates in order for a lower load

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.560 
top plates in order for a lower load
bearing<00:01:01.829> wall<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.309> way<00:01:02.640> let's<00:01:03.359> say<00:01:03.539> a

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
bearing wall so that way let's say a

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.760 
bearing wall so that way let's say a
trust<00:01:03.989> lands<00:01:04.290> here<00:01:06.049> and<00:01:07.049> here<00:01:08.390> and<00:01:09.390> here<00:01:09.770> then

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
trust lands here and here and here then

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.310 
trust lands here and here and here then
it<00:01:11.010> has<00:01:11.220> enough<00:01:11.880> bearings<00:01:12.420> these<00:01:12.810> two<00:01:13.080> top

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
it has enough bearings these two top

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.050 
it has enough bearings these two top
plates<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.860> can<00:01:14.040> transfer<00:01:14.520> down<00:01:14.700> through

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
plates that can transfer down through

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.929 
plates that can transfer down through
the<00:01:15.180> studs<00:01:15.479> if<00:01:15.950> you<00:01:16.950> can<00:01:17.130> get<00:01:17.310> away<00:01:17.430> with<00:01:17.670> one

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
the studs if you can get away with one

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.260 
the studs if you can get away with one
plate<00:01:18.299> as<00:01:18.650> long<00:01:19.650> as<00:01:19.890> they<00:01:20.070> land<00:01:20.369> directly<00:01:21.000> over

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
plate as long as they land directly over

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.429 
plate as long as they land directly over
top<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:22.259> each<00:01:22.439> step<00:01:23.210> now<00:01:24.210> let's<00:01:24.960> get<00:01:25.140> into<00:01:25.320> the

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
top of each step now let's get into the

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.880 
top of each step now let's get into the
doorway<00:01:25.770> here<00:01:26.659> so<00:01:27.659> when<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.170> start<00:01:28.680> when<00:01:28.860> I

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
doorway here so when I start when I

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.730 
doorway here so when I start when I
usually<00:01:29.130> want<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.579> frame<00:01:30.360> my<00:01:30.960> doorways<00:01:31.470> I

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
usually want to frame my doorways I

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.520 
usually want to frame my doorways I
always<00:01:32.490> start<00:01:32.880> with<00:01:33.180> my<00:01:33.540> trimmers<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.350> want

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
always start with my trimmers you want

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.020 
always start with my trimmers you want
to<00:01:34.590> figure<00:01:34.860> out<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.070> lengths<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.490> length<00:01:35.820> of

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
to figure out the lengths of length of

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.880 
to figure out the lengths of length of
those<00:01:36.229> the<00:01:37.229> trimmer<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:39.079> what's<00:01:40.079> beside<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
those the trimmer is what's beside the

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.469 
those the trimmer is what's beside the
stud<00:01:42.079> then<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.350> filler<00:01:43.710> sits<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.729> top<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
stud then the filler sits on top of the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.980 
stud then the filler sits on top of the
trimmers<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.729> then<00:01:47.729> your<00:01:47.909> lintel<00:01:48.450> or<00:01:48.750> your

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
trimmers and then your lintel or your

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.910 
trimmers and then your lintel or your
header<00:01:49.399> sits<00:01:50.399> on<00:01:50.549> top<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.909> those<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.329> that

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
header sits on top of those so that

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.830 
header sits on top of those so that
basically<00:01:52.920> as<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.909> move<00:01:54.119> your<00:01:54.270> way<00:01:54.450> up<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
basically as you move your way up the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.630 
basically as you move your way up the
cripples<00:01:55.439> are<00:01:56.659> there<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:58.290> when<00:01:58.469> when<00:01:59.100> weight

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
cripples are there so when when weight

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.679 
cripples are there so when when weight
comes<00:02:00.030> down<00:02:00.180> on<00:02:00.869> top<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.170> these<00:02:02.509> pushes<00:02:03.509> down

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
comes down on top of these pushes down

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.289 
comes down on top of these pushes down
and<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.380> forces<00:02:05.070> like<00:02:05.399> puts<00:02:05.700> pressure<00:02:05.969> on<00:02:06.149> the

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
and it forces like puts pressure on the

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.229 
and it forces like puts pressure on the
header<00:02:06.799> now<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.860> header<00:02:08.160> are<00:02:08.459> designed<00:02:08.879> for

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
header now the header are designed for

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.280 
header now the header are designed for
different<00:02:09.509> lengths<00:02:10.319> openings

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
different lengths openings

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.500 
different lengths openings
it<00:02:11.439> transfers<00:02:12.099> the<00:02:12.129> weight<00:02:12.310> over<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:13.390> the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
it transfers the weight over to the

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.119 
it transfers the weight over to the
trimmers<00:02:13.870> and<00:02:14.019> down<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.409> the<00:02:14.530> floor<00:02:14.560> of<00:02:15.069> the

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
trimmers and down to the floor of the

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:20.490 
trimmers and down to the floor of the
ground<00:02:15.810> so<00:02:16.810> that's<00:02:16.930> how<00:02:17.170> loud<00:02:17.439> works<00:02:19.260> yeah<00:02:20.260> so

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
ground so that's how loud works yeah so
