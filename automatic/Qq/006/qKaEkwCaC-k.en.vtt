front of the damn lens like if this is a
win's<00:03:39.990> there's<00:03:40.319> like<00:03:40.440> numbers<00:03:40.890> that<00:03:41.160> go

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
win's there's like numbers that go

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.410 
win's there's like numbers that go
around<00:03:41.550> the<00:03:42.030> lens<00:03:42.470> like<00:03:43.470> gibberish<00:03:44.270> say<00:03:45.270> if

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
around the lens like gibberish say if

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.470 
around the lens like gibberish say if
someone<00:03:45.720> tried<00:03:45.959> to<00:03:45.990> write<00:03:46.319> out<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.620> number<00:03:46.890> pi

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
someone tried to write out the number pi

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.030 
someone tried to write out the number pi
and<00:03:48.480> they<00:03:48.630> can<00:03:48.780> only<00:03:48.900> fit<00:03:49.170> so<00:03:49.380> many<00:03:49.470> numbers<00:03:49.680> on

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
and they can only fit so many numbers on

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.220 
and they can only fit so many numbers on
the<00:03:50.190> outside<00:03:50.580> of<00:03:50.730> a<00:03:51.110> of<00:03:52.110> the<00:03:52.730> camera<00:03:53.730> lens<00:03:54.230> and

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
the outside of a of the camera lens and

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.830 
the outside of a of the camera lens and
I<00:03:55.500> guess<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:56.010> higher<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.850> amount<00:03:57.000> of<00:03:57.450> pie

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
I guess the higher the amount of pie

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.670 
I guess the higher the amount of pie
that<00:03:57.870> there<00:03:58.500> is

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.179 

I<00:04:02.769> don't<00:04:03.069> know<00:04:03.129> but<00:04:04.530> that's<00:04:05.530> what<00:04:05.680> I<00:04:05.799> want<00:04:06.010> some

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:06.189 
I don't know but that's what I want some

clarification is out of these cameras
work<00:04:09.129> and<00:04:09.730> why<00:04:09.909> are<00:04:09.969> there<00:04:10.180> numbers<00:04:10.390> and<00:04:10.810> why

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
work and why are there numbers and why

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.500 
work and why are there numbers and why
is<00:04:11.409> it<00:04:11.650> not<00:04:11.829> like<00:04:12.040> one<00:04:12.459> number<00:04:12.939> why<00:04:13.209> can't<00:04:13.450> it

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
is it not like one number why can't it

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.150 
is it not like one number why can't it
be<00:04:13.569> like<00:04:13.629> the<00:04:14.109> canon<00:04:15.099> XL<00:04:15.609> 65<00:04:16.859> but<00:04:17.859> then<00:04:18.009> the

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
be like the canon XL 65 but then the

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.210 
be like the canon XL 65 but then the
candidate<00:04:18.549> XL<00:04:18.910> 66<00:04:19.539> is<00:04:19.870> better<00:04:20.109> see<00:04:21.100> how<00:04:21.160> to

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
candidate XL 66 is better see how to

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.219 
candidate XL 66 is better see how to
understand<00:04:21.669> that<00:04:21.880> but<00:04:22.630> now<00:04:22.750> it's<00:04:22.930> got<00:04:23.080> to<00:04:23.139> be
