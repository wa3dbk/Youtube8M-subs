00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
talking about how you can make your bass

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.709 
talking about how you can make your bass
string<00:00:12.840> sound<00:00:13.170> like<00:00:13.440> new<00:00:14.269> using<00:00:15.269> this<00:00:15.389> little

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
string sound like new using this little

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.400 
string sound like new using this little
technique<00:00:16.199> that<00:00:16.500> he<00:00:16.590> does<00:00:17.539> so<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.570> thought<00:00:18.960> you

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
technique that he does so I thought you

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.560 
technique that he does so I thought you
know<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.789> wrote<00:00:20.789> about<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:21.240> on<00:00:21.300> bass<00:00:21.539> guitar

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
know I wrote about it on bass guitar

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.590 
know I wrote about it on bass guitar
rocks<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:22.619> thought<00:00:22.939> this<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.000> really<00:00:24.150> cool

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
rocks and I thought this is really cool

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.509 
rocks and I thought this is really cool
will<00:00:25.019> save<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.230> lot<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.439> money<00:00:25.560> for<00:00:25.769> four<00:00:26.400> days

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
will save a lot of money for four days

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.380 
will save a lot of money for four days
players<00:00:26.849> out<00:00:27.119> there<00:00:28.160> but<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.640> know<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:30.029> haven't

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
players out there but you know I haven't

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.450 
players out there but you know I haven't
actually<00:00:30.660> tried<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.170> myself<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:32.040> part<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.369> me

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
actually tried it myself so part of me

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.600 
actually tried it myself so part of me
is<00:00:32.579> like<00:00:33.079> thinking<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.500> know<00:00:34.649> it's<00:00:34.920> all<00:00:35.370> well

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
is like thinking you know it's all well

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.060 
is like thinking you know it's all well
and<00:00:35.640> good<00:00:35.850> until<00:00:36.140> you<00:00:37.140> actually<00:00:37.320> try<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.860> and

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
and good until you actually try it and

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.810 
and good until you actually try it and
see<00:00:38.219> if<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.399> work<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:39.829> here's<00:00:40.829> my<00:00:40.920> base<00:00:41.370> it's<00:00:41.700> a

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
see if it work so here's my base it's a

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.619 
see if it work so here's my base it's a
hymen<00:00:42.510> as<00:00:43.489> btb<00:00:45.860> 5-string<00:00:46.860> bass<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.700> got<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.539> in

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
hymen as btb 5-string bass and got it in

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.650 
hymen as btb 5-string bass and got it in
two<00:00:48.840> thousand<00:00:49.530> it's<00:00:50.280> currently<00:00:50.789> my<00:00:51.000> only<00:00:51.149> my

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
two thousand it's currently my only my

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.790 
two thousand it's currently my only my
only<00:00:51.809> base<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.289> have<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.660> basically

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
only base that I have and I basically

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.260 
only base that I have and I basically
don't<00:00:55.800> play<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.100> all<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.430> much<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:57.149> last

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
don't play it all that much in the last

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.500 
don't play it all that much in the last
time<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.660> put<00:00:58.109> strings<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:59.390> couldn't<00:01:00.390> even

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
time I put strings on it I couldn't even

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.110 
time I put strings on it I couldn't even
tell<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.109> I'm<00:01:01.289> guessing<00:01:01.800> probably<00:01:02.670> at<00:01:02.969> least

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
tell you I'm guessing probably at least

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.810 
tell you I'm guessing probably at least
about<00:01:04.939> I'm<00:01:05.939> thinking<00:01:06.270> three<00:01:06.390> year<00:01:07.159> I'm<00:01:08.159> more

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
about I'm thinking three year I'm more

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.690 
about I'm thinking three year I'm more
or<00:01:08.909> less<00:01:09.090> in<00:01:09.299> tune<00:01:09.510> but<00:01:10.250> just<00:01:11.250> what<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.520> bass

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
or less in tune but just what the bass

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:37.470 
or less in tune but just what the bass
sounds<00:01:12.330> like<00:01:12.570> with<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> dead<00:01:13.530> strings

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.240 

so<00:01:38.480> we're<00:01:38.990> going<00:01:39.080> to<00:01:39.230> test<00:01:39.500> this<00:01:39.710> out<00:01:39.890> with<00:01:40.100> the

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
so we're going to test this out with the

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.850 
so we're going to test this out with the
a<00:01:40.280> string<00:01:40.910> so<00:01:41.180> here's<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.660> sound<00:01:42.260> of<00:01:42.500> just<00:01:42.710> the

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
a string so here's the sound of just the

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:51.220 
a string so here's the sound of just the
a<00:01:42.890> string<00:01:49.570> now<00:01:50.570> we're<00:01:50.750> going<00:01:50.840> to<00:01:50.900> try<00:01:51.170> this

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
a string now we're going to try this

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.330 
a string now we're going to try this
technique<00:01:51.650> and<00:01:52.360> see<00:01:53.360> what<00:01:53.570> happens<00:01:54.190> so<00:01:55.190> I'm

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
technique and see what happens so I'm

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.130 
technique and see what happens so I'm
just<00:01:55.520> going<00:01:55.760> to<00:01:56.770> turn<00:01:57.770> down<00:01:57.800> my<00:01:58.040> volume<00:01:58.310> and

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
just going to turn down my volume and

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:06.790 
just going to turn down my volume and
then<00:02:02.979> okay<00:02:03.979> so<00:02:05.200> the<00:02:06.200> trick<00:02:06.470> is<00:02:06.500> you're

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
then okay so the trick is you're

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.850 
then okay so the trick is you're
supposed<00:02:07.010> to<00:02:07.100> be<00:02:07.250> to<00:02:07.490> your<00:02:07.640> string<00:02:08.619> cause<00:02:09.619> like

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
supposed to be to your string cause like

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.720 
supposed to be to your string cause like
slapping<00:02:11.860> okay<00:02:12.860> you<00:02:12.920> don't<00:02:13.130> have<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.370> take<00:02:13.610> it

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
slapping okay you don't have to take it

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:36.250 
slapping okay you don't have to take it
right<00:02:13.850> off<00:02:14.680> let<00:02:15.680> me<00:02:15.800> just<00:02:22.150> I<00:02:34.959> guess<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:36.140> only

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
right off let me just I guess the only

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.750 
right off let me just I guess the only
thing<00:02:36.410> you<00:02:36.590> have<00:02:36.709> to<00:02:36.769> be<00:02:36.890> careful<00:02:37.070> of<00:02:37.430> is<00:02:37.459> if

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
thing you have to be careful of is if

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.720 
thing you have to be careful of is if
your<00:02:37.910> strings<00:02:38.239> are<00:02:38.390> old<00:02:38.570> enough<00:02:39.489> you<00:02:40.489> could

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
your strings are old enough you could

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:59.830 
your strings are old enough you could
just<00:02:40.910> break<00:02:41.690> them<00:02:41.870> doing<00:02:42.230> this<00:02:58.600> he<00:02:59.600> didn't

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
just break them doing this he didn't

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.270 
just break them doing this he didn't
demonstrate<00:02:59.989> pulling<00:03:00.590> out<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:00.860> neck<00:03:01.040> like

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
demonstrate pulling out the neck like

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:21.420 
demonstrate pulling out the neck like
this<00:03:01.310> but<00:03:01.730> I<00:03:01.850> just<00:03:01.880> figure<00:03:03.160> why<00:03:04.160> not

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.810 

now<00:03:22.430> do<00:03:22.490> you<00:03:22.700> hear<00:03:22.910> any<00:03:23.090> difference<00:03:24.640> this<00:03:25.640> is

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
now do you hear any difference this is

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:32.680 
now do you hear any difference this is
the<00:03:25.940> string<00:03:26.240> that<00:03:26.330> I<00:03:26.390> get<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.720> a<00:03:26.750> string<00:03:31.690> plus

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
the string that I get the a string plus

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:50.530 
the string that I get the a string plus
ba<00:03:32.990> in<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.440> d.a<00:03:35.530> d<00:03:37.660> and<00:03:38.660> here's<00:03:39.620> p<00:03:49.060> to<00:03:50.060> my<00:03:50.240> ears

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
ba in the d.a d and here's p to my ears

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.610 
ba in the d.a d and here's p to my ears
it<00:03:50.870> does<00:03:51.140> sound<00:03:51.590> a<00:03:51.770> little<00:03:51.950> bit<00:03:52.160> brighter<00:03:53.620> I'll

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
it does sound a little bit brighter I'll

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.730 
it does sound a little bit brighter I'll
do<00:03:54.800> it<00:03:54.920> again<00:03:54.980> ok<00:03:55.970> so<00:03:56.030> I'm<00:03:56.390> going<00:03:56.510> to<00:03:56.600> do<00:03:56.780> the
