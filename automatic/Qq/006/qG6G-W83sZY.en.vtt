00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 Welcome from the best choice 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.870
 We are here to wake up and drive 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.519
 Today the super ténéré of yamaha remains 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.840
 he look at and even how the 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.840
 racetrack do thick ship their 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.420
 I have my dear ones and 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.440
 watch the super ténéré of yamaha here 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.470
 on the race track 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.180
 Of course this is a trip enduro the 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.430
 Wherever you look she likes to say this 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.320
 performance stories do not quite mean 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.630
 but not at all negative it is that way 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.910
 that the super ténéré of the whole 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.400
 traveling through that model is with the 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.520
 most miles without sores behind 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.990
 can do and helps the race tracks 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.060
 is just that way just that certain 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.700
 parameters can not keep up anymore 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.350
 with the new s 1000x he with the new one 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.600
 super adventure in front of ktm or with the 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.640
 new multi spotlight but I believe that 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.340
 It would not be her niche 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.200
 she has her she has her strengths and 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.850
 then we have the strengths here too 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.790
 I like the plug in. I am here 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.800
 long tours without a break very much 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.250
 relaxed and you drive then too 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.590
 fast 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.950
 So here I have the potential of the 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.280
 engine twin cylinder 1200 cubic centimeters 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.750
 good use of the engine 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.679
 in terms of performance, it is a dramatic one 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.630
 at the front 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.149
 Torque from the cellar pastor 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.740
 it also fits it 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.420
 has also fit the stability in the 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.240
 fast turns which surprised me 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.160
 he knows how to behave quite sedate 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.360
 Of course, the machine is in fact 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.650
 in the exchange rates 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.720
 of course you will notice the high 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.310
 weight and compared to the new ones 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.980
 over it monster one quite with 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.990
 Pull 160 ps of fuel into the city 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.940
 the top performance 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.010
 What I like about a motor is her 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.720
 makes an extremely robust impression and 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.150
 the people also confirm that a lot 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.450
 So the motorcycle is on the way 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.000
 in practice actually as enduro at 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.900
 Most with extremely rugged extremely 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.970
 comfortable 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.250
 that is your strength here at the 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.680
 performance on wachau ring she has 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.150
 but could not keep up 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.910
 the fastest device gives faster 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.490
 but she was the most comfortable and me 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.500
 say also the super purest motorcycle 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.470
 which he has been traveling for a long time 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.180
 a real worthy trip enduro for 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.810
 People stop very many kilometers 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.810
 hazards
