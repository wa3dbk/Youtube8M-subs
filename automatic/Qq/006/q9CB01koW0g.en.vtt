the one that I'm willing to spend the

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.610 
the one that I'm willing to spend the
most<00:00:11.969> money<00:00:12.090> on<00:00:12.300> because<00:00:12.509> it's<00:00:13.019> very

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
most money on because it's very

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.560 
most money on because it's very
expansive<00:00:14.130> despite<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.000> fact<00:00:15.210> that<00:00:15.299> it<00:00:15.480> was

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
expansive despite the fact that it was

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.720 
expansive despite the fact that it was
only<00:00:15.660> twelve<00:00:16.020> volumes<00:00:16.410> plus<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.070> 13<00:00:17.400> I<00:00:17.550> guess

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
only twelve volumes plus the 13 I guess

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.060 
only twelve volumes plus the 13 I guess
but<00:00:18.630> it's<00:00:18.810> very<00:00:18.930> expensive<00:00:19.289> it<00:00:19.590> asks<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.920> lot<00:00:19.980> of

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
but it's very expensive it asks a lot of

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.769 
but it's very expensive it asks a lot of
questions<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.789> there<00:00:20.910> are<00:00:21.060> debates<00:00:21.330> like

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
questions and there are debates like

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.830 
questions and there are debates like
who's<00:00:21.990> smarter<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:23.160> it's<00:00:24.119> something<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.570> I'm

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
who's smarter so it's something that I'm

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.210 
who's smarter so it's something that I'm
definitely<00:00:25.199> willing<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.470> spend<00:00:25.710> money<00:00:25.830> on<00:00:25.949> and

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
asked before should I get the Black

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.940 
asked before should I get the Black
Edition<00:02:10.530> or<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.190> regular<00:02:11.550> twelve

Edition or the regular twelve

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.260 
Edition or the regular twelve
personally<00:02:13.459> I<00:02:13.550> would<00:02:13.730> say<00:02:13.819> again<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.090> black

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
personally I would say again the black

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.390 
personally I would say again the black
edition<00:02:14.540> however<00:02:15.500> it's<00:02:15.680> all<00:02:15.830> a<00:02:16.130> matter<00:02:16.310> of

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
edition however it's all a matter of

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.559 
edition however it's all a matter of
preference<00:02:16.670> I<00:02:16.880> just<00:02:17.030> think<00:02:17.180> could<00:02:17.270> be<00:02:17.360> look

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
preference I just think could be look

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.990 
preference I just think could be look
nicer<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:20.650> they<00:02:21.650> just<00:02:21.980> overall<00:02:22.520> feel<00:02:22.790> better

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
nicer and they just overall feel better

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.900 
nicer and they just overall feel better
better<00:02:23.209> color<00:02:23.569> pages<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:25.340> it<00:02:25.430> slice<00:02:25.580> to<00:02:25.730> carry

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
better color pages and it slice to carry

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.120 
better color pages and it slice to carry
around<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.360> I<00:02:27.230> guess<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:27.739> get<00:02:27.830> one<00:02:28.010> for

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130
