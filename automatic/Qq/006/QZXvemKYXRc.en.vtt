in my video yesterday of the new g dingo

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.099 
in my video yesterday of the new g dingo
layer<00:00:13.710> that<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.429> would<00:00:15.389> be<00:00:15.570> making<00:00:15.990> a

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
layer that I would be making a

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.980 
layer that I would be making a
fire-making<00:00:16.440> guy<00:00:16.800> down<00:00:17.100> here<00:00:17.690> no<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.720> didn't

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
fire-making guy down here no I didn't

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.230 
fire-making guy down here no I didn't
really<00:00:19.109> say<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.350> but<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:20.100> said<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:20.880> would

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
really say that but I said I would

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.970 
really say that but I said I would
calculate<00:00:21.510> how<00:00:22.020> much<00:00:22.170> experience<00:00:22.350> this<00:00:22.830> is

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
calculate how much experience this is

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.540 
calculate how much experience this is
per<00:00:23.160> hour<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.670> so<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.420> did<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.980> decided<00:00:26.279> just

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
per hour and so I did and I decided just

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.519 
per hour and so I did and I decided just
to<00:00:26.609> make<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.789> video<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.420> because<00:00:28.289> it's

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
to make a video of it because it's

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.919 
to make a video of it because it's
pretty<00:00:28.800> good<00:00:28.980> down<00:00:29.130> here<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:30.179> what<00:00:30.510> did<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.720> was

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
pretty good down here so what did it was

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.290 
pretty good down here so what did it was
I<00:00:31.289> recorded<00:00:31.890> 30<00:00:32.189> minutes<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.669> doing<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.180> and

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
I recorded 30 minutes of doing it and

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.389 
I recorded 30 minutes of doing it and
then<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.140> just<00:00:34.320> times<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.739> by<00:00:34.860> two<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.130> then

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
then you just times it by two and then

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.990 
then you just times it by two and then
you<00:00:35.489> have<00:00:35.700> your<00:00:36.079> experience<00:00:37.079> per<00:00:37.200> hour<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:38.000> I

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
you have your experience per hour and I

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.209 
you have your experience per hour and I
got<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:40.309> to<00:00:41.309> be<00:00:42.680> 315<00:00:43.680> fire-making

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
got it to to be 315 fire-making

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.010 
got it to to be 315 fire-making
experience<00:00:44.820> per<00:00:44.969> hour<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.450> 30<00:00:46.610> 33<00:00:48.020> k

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
experience per hour and 30 33 k

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.100 
experience per hour and 30 33 k
woodcutting<00:00:49.649> experience<00:00:50.070> per<00:00:50.190> hour<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:51.329> this

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
woodcutting experience per hour so this

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.189 
woodcutting experience per hour so this
is<00:00:52.260> pretty<00:00:52.500> good<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.100> it's<00:00:53.760> free<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.600> you

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
is pretty good and it's free you you

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.299 
is pretty good and it's free you you
don't<00:00:55.410> really<00:00:55.680> lose<00:00:55.860> anything<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:58.129> you<00:00:59.129> get

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
don't really lose anything and you get

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.479 
don't really lose anything and you get
400<00:00:59.640> experience<00:01:00.270> /<00:01:00.449> route<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.250> like<00:01:02.250> magic

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
400 experience / route and like magic

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.320 
400 experience / route and like magic
logs<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.890> magic<00:01:04.890> logs<00:01:05.070> are<00:01:05.280> like<00:01:05.400> 350<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.210> it's

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
logs so magic logs are like 350 so it's

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.960 
logs so magic logs are like 350 so it's
better<00:01:06.540> than<00:01:06.720> magic<00:01:07.049> logs<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.500> it's<00:01:07.650> free<00:01:08.070> may

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
better than magic logs and it's free may

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.649 
better than magic logs and it's free may
not<00:01:09.150> be<00:01:09.330> as<00:01:09.450> fast<00:01:10.549> to<00:01:11.549> like<00:01:11.790> because<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.450> gotta

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
not be as fast to like because you gotta

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.320 
not be as fast to like because you gotta
cut<00:01:12.960> them<00:01:13.080> down<00:01:13.110> first<00:01:13.619> but<00:01:14.159> it's<00:01:14.640> still<00:01:14.880> fast

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
cut them down first but it's still fast

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.270 
cut them down first but it's still fast
I'm<00:01:15.689> not<00:01:15.810> sure<00:01:15.869> how<00:01:16.290> much<00:01:16.470> experience<00:01:16.650> magic

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
I'm not sure how much experience magic

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.390 
I'm not sure how much experience magic
logs<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.640> per<00:01:17.820> hour<00:01:18.000> but<00:01:18.840> i'm<00:01:19.170> pretty<00:01:20.100> sure

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
logs is per hour but i'm pretty sure

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.190 
logs is per hour but i'm pretty sure
it's<00:01:20.640> about<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.180> same<00:01:21.390> like<00:01:21.689> 300<00:01:22.080> k

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
it's about the same like 300 k

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.530 
it's about the same like 300 k
experience<00:01:22.560> hours<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:24.150> might<00:01:24.299> as<00:01:24.420> well

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
experience hours so you might as well

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.600 
experience hours so you might as well
just<00:01:24.750> go<00:01:24.930> here<00:01:25.200> because<00:01:25.530> it's<00:01:25.710> free<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.250> magic

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
just go here because it's free and magic

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.359 
just go here because it's free and magic
locks<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:26.970> kind<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.270> expensive<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:28.340> so<00:01:29.340> i

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
locks is kind of expensive and so i

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.640 
locks is kind of expensive and so i
highly<00:01:29.880> highly<00:01:30.030> recommend<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.259> go<00:01:31.409> down

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
highly highly recommend that you go down

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
here if you want to train fire making a

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.560 
here if you want to train fire making a
request<00:01:33.540> 83<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.640> it's<00:01:35.640> pretty<00:01:35.939> decent<00:01:36.479> then

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
request 83 and it's pretty decent then

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.969 
request 83 and it's pretty decent then
you<00:01:36.659> also<00:01:36.780> get<00:01:37.020> wood<00:01:37.259> cutting<00:01:37.530> experience

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
you also get wood cutting experience

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.880 
you also get wood cutting experience
just<00:01:38.790> not<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.060> much<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.570> if<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.770> have

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
just not that much and if you have

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.560 
just not that much and if you have
inferno<00:01:41.250> at<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.700> should<00:01:41.880> bring<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.210> because

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
inferno at you should bring it because

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.359 
inferno at you should bring it because
that<00:01:42.930> will<00:01:43.020> give<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.380> lot<00:01:43.619> more<00:01:43.649> fire

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
that will give you a lot more fire

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.620 
that will give you a lot more fire
making<00:01:44.579> experience<00:01:44.970> per<00:01:45.090> hour<00:01:45.210> since<00:01:45.509> it

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
making experience per hour since it

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.600 
making experience per hour since it
burns<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.200> roots<00:01:46.409> automatically<00:01:47.340> when<00:01:47.520> you

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
burns the roots automatically when you

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.969 
burns the roots automatically when you
cut<00:01:47.820> them<00:01:48.110> it<00:01:49.110> has<00:01:49.320> like<00:01:49.530> twenty<00:01:49.829> five<00:01:49.950> percent

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
cut them it has like twenty five percent

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.760 
cut them it has like twenty five percent
chance<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:51.000> burning<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.840> route<00:01:52.079> one<00:01:52.290> cut<00:01:52.530> down

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
chance of burning the route one cut down

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.410 
chance of burning the route one cut down
so<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.450> also<00:01:55.310> ring<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.430> fire<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.939> flame

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420
