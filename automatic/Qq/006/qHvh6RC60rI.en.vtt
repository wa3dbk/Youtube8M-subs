00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:15.849
 for us 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.509
 building when service is possible without 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:18.789
 help who will 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:19.600
 highlighted 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.900
 and duties but if the car is still not 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.259
 less salvation is one in all its forms 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:27.139
 by the way the combustion list is wrong 

00:00:27.139 --> 00:00:28.470
 car operation 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.979
 fun on time and let gas crashes 

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:32.640
 direct flight million 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.420
 true on the passport in the pond that 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.420
 you can not hurt the fight returned to Dublin 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.540
 if you wish would take bored a 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.090
 if not, this is the first signal 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.080
 faulty buzunov consumer 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.440
 but we can not and the last this detail 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.410
 allows you to smoothly connect the box 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.640
 engine 2000 cube shift gears 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.540
 but without it you can get to the services 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.930
 will have to work with 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:56.809
 starter 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.320
 either spartak 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.060
 ignition we study the first gear except 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.930
 that old-fashioned car will warm up before 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.230
 Sukhumi mosque another lives 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.229
 we accelerate 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.109
 throwing gas for Belarus by herself she 

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:10.410
 fails and weaknesses 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.140
 and gas again 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.700
 overclock again 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.210
 Rosaviation 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.340
 the third 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.810
 but the most important thing is to catch the moment when 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.200
 wood turnover drops crit speed 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.800
 book box shaft rotation 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.730
 it matches 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.020
 if you move the respirator again gas 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.100
 including transfer 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.740
 it's called peregazovki 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.550
 if you hadn't caught the right moment 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.020
 tons when switching services 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.770
 for this service the most important thing 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.530
 determine the cause of failure 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.680
 according to him to the residential areas at all 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.010

 highway can and other details 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.680
 clutch if clutch 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.040
 hydraulic happens that pedal 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.830
 becomes yacht dangles 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.520
 it broke one of the main cylinders 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.970
 or working if the clutch actuator 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.290
 mechanical process involved 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.420
 steel rods cages 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.370
 they can search for information and 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.750
 the car will not go if everything is under the hood 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.750
 okay you'll have an autopsy 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.939
 and then arriving by car back 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:11.610
 driven 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.970
 easier box can not remove it 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.800
 just move the cabinet 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.200
 on the clutch basket on the front drive

 will take merge mafov and remove the box 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:24.229
 look at the state of the parts the disk has become 

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:26.489
 pump and smooth it will have to replace 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.649
 most likely he, along with a basket, she 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:30.729
 burns in the place of contact with the disk with 

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:32.759
 high temperature clutch metal 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:35.069
 becomes with blue their russian if the disk 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.280
 okay and the bearings are loose hockey sticks 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.969
 change the bearing when they put 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:41.569
 grip into place follow to 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.109
 centering master if doing this with 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:46.189
 using an iba tube using a special 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:48.039
 corrections suitable diameter 

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:50.109
 if this is not done when assembling a short 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:51.779
 period if you are not standing still 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:54.099
 you can not leave efforts 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.419
 so the gearbox repair 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:58.609
 and even before starting work ask 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.879
 masters all replaced parts in 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.929
 end of repair give you this let 

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:04.849
 a small guarantee that you are not 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:06.759
 deceived and not have to pay for quite 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:09.319
 powerless spare parts ahead of their time 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.719
 and money
