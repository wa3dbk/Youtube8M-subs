00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
myself and it was in actually I think

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.190 
myself and it was in actually I think
it's<00:01:52.409> not<00:01:52.860> just<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.549> little<00:01:53.820> bit<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.240> I'm<00:01:55.049> not

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
it's not just a little bit and I'm not

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.870 
it's not just a little bit and I'm not
quite<00:01:55.710> sure<00:01:55.740> why<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.189> don't<00:01:56.549> know<00:01:56.640> if<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.790> was

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
quite sure why I don't know if it was

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.469 
quite sure why I don't know if it was
still<00:01:57.090> cold<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.920> then<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.729> didn't<00:02:00.119> stop

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
still cold and then it didn't stop

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.959 
still cold and then it didn't stop
bleeding<00:02:01.200> not<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.100> lot<00:02:02.310> for<00:02:02.520> like<00:02:02.640> little

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
bleeding not a lot for like little

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.819 
bleeding not a lot for like little
thought<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.630> would<00:02:03.780> wipe<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.229> in<00:02:04.350> in<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.680> would

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
thought I would wipe it in in it would

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.499 
thought I would wipe it in in it would
be<00:02:04.979> there's<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.490> dot<00:02:05.670> again<00:02:08.209> and<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.300> don't

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
be there's the dot again and I don't

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.790 
be there's the dot again and I don't
know<00:02:09.569> maybe<00:02:09.750> that's<00:02:09.959> normal<00:02:10.410> because<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.679> guess

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
know maybe that's normal because I guess

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.410 
know maybe that's normal because I guess
when<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:10.979> get<00:02:11.190> shots<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.849> doctor<00:02:12.239> actually

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
when I get shots the doctor actually

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.490 
when I get shots the doctor actually
puts

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
puts

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.010 
puts
a<00:02:13.530> really<00:02:13.800> tight<00:02:14.040> band<00:02:14.280> bandaid<00:02:15.240> on<00:02:15.270> it<00:02:15.420> so<00:02:15.900> it

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
a really tight band bandaid on it so it

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.160 
a really tight band bandaid on it so it
stops<00:02:16.320> bleeding<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.660> didn't<00:02:18.660> care<00:02:18.810> it

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
stops bleeding so I didn't care it

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.780 
stops bleeding so I didn't care it
