today we're going to be looking at rules

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.139 
today we're going to be looking at rules
of<00:00:01.560> powers<00:00:02.070> so<00:00:02.340> by<00:00:02.550> the<00:00:02.610> end<00:00:02.700> of<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:02.970> lesson

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
of powers so by the end of the lesson

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.150 
of powers so by the end of the lesson
every<00:00:03.899> single<00:00:04.230> one<00:00:04.319> of<00:00:04.380> you<00:00:04.620> will<00:00:04.770> know<00:00:04.920> what

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 
powers mean for whole number powers

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.850 
powers mean for whole number powers
you'll<00:00:09.240> understand<00:00:09.809> and<00:00:10.080> use<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.349> laws<00:00:10.679> of

and<00:00:12.540> you'll<00:00:12.990> be<00:00:13.110> able<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.500> use<00:00:13.740> whole<00:00:13.980> number

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
and you'll be able to use whole number

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.189 
and you'll be able to use whole number
powers<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.849> simple<00:00:15.210> cases<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.780> laws<00:00:15.990> of
