the<00:01:50.440> cousin<00:01:50.920> of<00:01:51.040> the<00:01:51.190> light<00:01:51.430> dragon<00:01:51.880> has

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
the cousin of the light dragon has

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.890 
the cousin of the light dragon has
almost<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:52.570> same<00:01:52.780> coloring<00:01:56.940> now<00:01:57.940> and<00:01:58.300> this<00:01:58.600> is

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
almost the same coloring now and this is

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:06.440 
almost the same coloring now and this is
the<00:01:59.170> adult<00:01:59.530> form

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.440 

we're<00:02:07.049> just<00:02:07.200> gonna<00:02:07.350> level<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.860> up<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.610> level<00:02:08.819> 15

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
we're just gonna level it up to level 15

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.920 
we're just gonna level it up to level 15
so<00:02:09.979> it'll<00:02:10.979> be<00:02:11.130> bigger<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:11.790> comparison<00:02:12.630> to<00:02:12.660> the

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
so it'll be bigger in comparison to the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.809 
so it'll be bigger in comparison to the
other<00:02:13.110> dragons<00:02:13.800> that<00:02:13.980> it's<00:02:14.160> flying<00:02:14.489> around

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
we're all right so that's pretty much it

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.809 
we're all right so that's pretty much it
what<00:02:22.290> you're<00:02:22.440> looking<00:02:22.680> for<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.040> 13<00:02:23.520> hours
