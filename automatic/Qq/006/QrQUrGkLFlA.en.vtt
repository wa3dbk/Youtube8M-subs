00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
to the tray there this machine when I

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.060 
to the tray there this machine when I
got<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.930> didn't<00:01:31.170> have<00:01:31.290> any<00:01:31.439> coins<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:31.950> it

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
got it it didn't have any coins in it

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.120 
got it it didn't have any coins in it
and<00:01:32.250> when<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:32.939> plugged<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.799> hopper

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
and when you plugged it in it the hopper

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.350 
and when you plugged it in it the hopper
ran<00:01:35.570> consistently<00:01:36.570> until<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.079> little<00:01:37.320> timing

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
ran consistently until a little timing

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.300 
ran consistently until a little timing
circuit<00:01:39.360> kicked<00:01:40.350> off<00:01:40.530> like<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.950> circuit

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
circuit kicked off like the circuit

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.510 
circuit kicked off like the circuit
breaker<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.729> turned<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.060> Machine<00:01:42.360> off

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
breaker and turned the Machine off

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.399 
breaker and turned the Machine off
currently<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.579> just<00:01:44.850> ran<00:01:45.780> on<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.990> line<00:01:46.200> to

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
currently I just ran on the line to

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.740 
currently I just ran on the line to
bypass<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.369> could<00:01:47.640> play<00:01:48.240> around<00:01:48.540> with

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
bypass that so I could play around with

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.149 
bypass that so I could play around with
it<00:01:49.159> I<00:01:50.159> have<00:01:50.579> gotten<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.420> where<00:01:51.600> it'll

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
it I have gotten it to where it'll

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.600 
it I have gotten it to where it'll
dispense<00:01:53.159> coins<00:01:53.720> but<00:01:54.720> unfortunately<00:01:55.610> it

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
dispense coins but unfortunately it

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.359 
dispense coins but unfortunately it
currently<00:01:57.119> will<00:01:57.479> spit<00:01:57.899> out<00:01:57.930> coins<00:01:58.409> on<00:01:58.680> things

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
currently will spit out coins on things

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.660 
currently will spit out coins on things
that<00:01:59.430> don't<00:01:59.700> appear<00:02:00.030> on<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.240> back<00:02:00.390> glass<00:02:00.719> and

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
that don't appear on the back glass and

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.889 
that don't appear on the back glass and
occasionally<00:02:02.700> I'll<00:02:02.939> get<00:02:03.210> into<00:02:03.390> what<00:02:03.780> they

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
occasionally I'll get into what they

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.940 
occasionally I'll get into what they
call<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:05.149> hopper<00:02:06.149> overrun<00:02:06.750> where<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.619> machine

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
call a hopper overrun where the machine

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.589 
call a hopper overrun where the machine
will<00:02:08.160> just<00:02:08.520> sit<00:02:08.700> there<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:08.970> spit<00:02:09.239> out<00:02:09.270> coins

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
will just sit there and spit out coins

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.630 
will just sit there and spit out coins
until<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.259> empties<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.830> hopper<00:02:11.160> which<00:02:11.430> is

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
until it empties the hopper which is

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.210 
until it empties the hopper which is
really<00:02:11.910> bad<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.090> don't<00:02:12.390> want<00:02:12.510> y'all

pretty<00:02:32.340> interesting<00:02:32.780> there's<00:02:33.780> this<00:02:33.989> deal

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
pretty interesting there's this deal

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.289 
pretty interesting there's this deal
right<00:02:34.739> here<00:02:35.040> it's<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.430> I<00:02:35.790> believe<00:02:35.970> it's<00:02:36.060> the

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
right here it's the I believe it's the

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.509 
right here it's the I believe it's the
payout<00:02:36.720> meter<00:02:37.019> if<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:37.980> come<00:02:38.160> around<00:02:38.340> the

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
payout meter if you come around the

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.509 
payout meter if you come around the
front<00:02:39.230> this<00:02:40.230> little<00:02:40.590> doodad<00:02:40.890> right<00:02:41.220> up<00:02:41.370> here

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
front this little doodad right up here

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:42.589 
front this little doodad right up here
in<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.640> corner<00:02:41.730> which<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.060> can't<00:02:42.239> see<00:02:42.299> very

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
in the corner which you can't see very

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.229 
in the corner which you can't see very
well<00:02:42.720> it'll<00:02:43.560> count<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.700> let<00:02:44.910> you<00:02:45.000> know<00:02:45.090> how

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
well it'll count and let you know how

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.600 
well it'll count and let you know how
many<00:02:45.299> games<00:02:45.660> you<00:02:45.840> won<00:02:46.049> I<00:02:46.290> guess<00:02:46.410> for<00:02:47.099> certainly

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
many games you won I guess for certainly

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.430 
many games you won I guess for certainly
the<00:02:47.790> time<00:02:47.970> then<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.239> resets<00:02:48.390> itself<00:02:48.780> so<00:02:49.200> just

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
the time then it resets itself so just

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.199 
the time then it resets itself so just
kind<00:02:49.620> of<00:02:49.650> like<00:02:49.769> lets<00:02:50.549> people<00:02:50.760> know<00:02:50.940> they're

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
kind of like lets people know they're

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.199 
kind of like lets people know they're
winning<00:02:51.450> keeps<00:02:51.930> them<00:02:52.110> playing<00:02:52.380> I<00:02:52.560> guess<00:02:53.209> you

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
winning keeps them playing I guess you

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.390 
winning keeps them playing I guess you
got<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.420> deal<00:02:54.690> over<00:02:54.870> here<00:02:55.410> which<00:02:55.920> is<00:02:56.069> probably

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
got the deal over here which is probably

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.780 
got the deal over here which is probably
where<00:02:56.579> you<00:02:56.700> press<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.180> get<00:02:57.329> a<00:02:57.739> vodka<00:02:58.739> martini<00:02:59.040> I

where you press to get a vodka martini I

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.170 
where you press to get a vodka martini I
see<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:00.150> but<00:03:00.299> press<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:01.200> get<00:03:01.349> a<00:03:01.410> vodka<00:03:01.890> martini

martini shaken not stirred when you're

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.930 
martini shaken not stirred when you're
in<00:03:04.680> Vegas<00:03:04.829> or<00:03:05.220> whatever<00:03:05.489> I<00:03:07.760> haven't<00:03:08.760> pulled

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
in Vegas or whatever I haven't pulled

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.110 
in Vegas or whatever I haven't pulled
the<00:03:09.470> reels<00:03:10.470> yet<00:03:10.739> on<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.370> back<00:03:11.579> though<00:03:11.879> there's

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
the reels yet on the back though there's

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.850 
the reels yet on the back though there's
some<00:03:12.599> metal<00:03:12.840> things<00:03:13.049> called<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.379> contact

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
some metal things called the contact

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.860 
some metal things called the contact
plates<00:03:14.250> that<00:03:14.730> I<00:03:14.790> have<00:03:15.090> heard<00:03:15.329> that<00:03:15.510> if<00:03:15.660> they're

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
plates that I have heard that if they're

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.990 
plates that I have heard that if they're
dirty<00:03:16.079> can't<00:03:16.950> affect<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.340> way<00:03:17.430> your<00:03:17.579> machine

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
dirty can't affect the way your machine

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.930 
dirty can't affect the way your machine
pays<00:03:18.239> out<00:03:18.569> so<00:03:19.380> I'm<00:03:19.470> planning<00:03:19.650> on<00:03:20.010> learning<00:03:20.730> how

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
pays out so I'm planning on learning how

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.449 
pays out so I'm planning on learning how
to<00:03:21.120> pull<00:03:21.420> that<00:03:21.630> and<00:03:21.959> clean<00:03:22.200> those<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.829> then

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
to pull that and clean those and then

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.650 
to pull that and clean those and then
recently<00:03:24.180> I<00:03:24.329> learned<00:03:24.600> there's<00:03:25.319> probably<00:03:25.920> a

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
recently I learned there's probably a

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.870 
recently I learned there's probably a
MPU<00:03:27.660> or<00:03:28.049> basically<00:03:28.680> kind<00:03:29.639> of<00:03:29.700> like<00:03:29.790> a

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
MPU or basically kind of like a

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.110 
MPU or basically kind of like a
processing<00:03:30.359> board<00:03:31.069> back<00:03:32.069> there<00:03:32.400> as<00:03:32.519> well<00:03:32.730> and

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
processing board back there as well and

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.349 
processing board back there as well and
that<00:03:33.690> could<00:03:34.650> affect<00:03:35.099> the<00:03:35.459> payout<00:03:35.970> as<00:03:36.180> well<00:03:36.329> I

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
that could affect the payout as well I

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.319 
that could affect the payout as well I
believe<00:03:36.980> but<00:03:37.980> I<00:03:38.250> was<00:03:38.400> expecting<00:03:38.670> to<00:03:38.970> see<00:03:39.150> an

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
believe but I was expecting to see an

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.420 
believe but I was expecting to see an
i/o<00:03:39.660> board<00:03:40.170> over<00:03:40.470> here<00:03:40.500> from<00:03:40.829> what<00:03:40.980> I've<00:03:41.099> read

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
i/o board over here from what I've read

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.089 
i/o board over here from what I've read
but<00:03:42.209> I'm<00:03:42.389> really<00:03:42.569> not<00:03:42.810> seeing<00:03:43.139> a<00:03:43.380> board<00:03:43.680> there

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
but I'm really not seeing a board there

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.490 
but I'm really not seeing a board there
so<00:03:44.370> I'm<00:03:44.549> not<00:03:44.579> sure<00:03:44.790> if<00:03:45.389> I'm<00:03:45.630> incorrect<00:03:45.959> about

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
so I'm not sure if I'm incorrect about

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.099 
so I'm not sure if I'm incorrect about
that<00:03:46.919> or<00:03:47.519> this<00:03:47.760> might<00:03:48.000> be<00:03:48.180> an<00:03:48.299> earlier<00:03:48.660> machine

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
that or this might be an earlier machine

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.990 
that or this might be an earlier machine
than<00:03:49.319> I<00:03:49.380> think<00:03:49.440> it<00:03:50.310> sure<00:03:50.489> looks<00:03:50.700> like<00:03:50.790> the

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
than I think it sure looks like the

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.650 
than I think it sure looks like the
e-series<00:03:51.470> board<00:03:52.470> or<00:03:52.829> the<00:03:53.069> e-series<00:03:54.000> slot<00:03:54.389> that

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
e-series board or the e-series slot that

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.550 
e-series board or the e-series slot that
i've<00:03:54.750> seen<00:03:54.959> on<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.319> front<00:03:55.500> of<00:03:55.889> the<00:03:56.099> e-series

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
i've seen on the front of the e-series

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.400 
i've seen on the front of the e-series
manual<00:03:58.560> that<00:03:59.190> i've<00:03:59.340> seen<00:03:59.549> online<00:04:00.169> up<00:04:01.169> here

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
manual that i've seen online up here

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.750 
manual that i've seen online up here
behind<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.739> glass<00:04:01.919> I'm<00:04:02.250> not<00:04:02.370> gonna<00:04:02.489> pull<00:04:02.639> it

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
behind the glass I'm not gonna pull it

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.970 
behind the glass I'm not gonna pull it
right<00:04:02.910> now<00:04:03.150> but<00:04:04.019> behind<00:04:04.410> there<00:04:04.620> you've<00:04:04.769> got<00:04:04.799> it

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
right now but behind there you've got it

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.610 
right now but behind there you've got it
like<00:04:05.220> a<00:04:05.250> fluorescent<00:04:06.209> light<00:04:06.690> which<00:04:07.230> you<00:04:07.260> take

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
like a fluorescent light which you take

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.020 
like a fluorescent light which you take
that<00:04:07.829> off<00:04:08.040> and<00:04:08.069> then<00:04:08.370> behind<00:04:08.609> there<00:04:08.849> you'll

see the bell which the Bell currently
isn't<00:04:13.440> working<00:04:13.829> on<00:04:13.919> this<00:04:14.069> machine<00:04:14.280> I'm<00:04:14.579> not

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
isn't working on this machine I'm not

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.400 
isn't working on this machine I'm not
sure<00:04:14.940> why<00:04:15.120> that<00:04:15.180> I'd<00:04:15.630> love<00:04:16.049> to<00:04:16.079> get<00:04:16.260> that

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
sure why that I'd love to get that

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.039 
sure why that I'd love to get that
working<00:04:16.620> and<00:04:16.979> off<00:04:17.970> to<00:04:18.419> the<00:04:19.430> left<00:04:20.959> there's<00:04:21.959> a

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
working and off to the left there's a

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.159 
working and off to the left there's a
step<00:04:22.950> up<00:04:23.159> unit<00:04:23.610> which<00:04:24.210> is<00:04:24.360> very<00:04:24.630> similar<00:04:25.020> to

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
step up unit which is very similar to

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.550 
step up unit which is very similar to
what<00:04:25.409> you'd<00:04:25.530> see<00:04:25.740> in<00:04:25.860> the<00:04:25.950> back

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
what you'd see in the back

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.530 
what you'd see in the back
of<00:04:26.620> a<00:04:26.770> pinball<00:04:27.490> machine<00:04:27.520> it's<00:04:28.090> like<00:04:28.240> a<00:04:28.270> big

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
of a pinball machine it's like a big

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.520 
of a pinball machine it's like a big
round<00:04:30.150> circuit<00:04:31.150> board<00:04:31.389> with<00:04:32.080> little<00:04:32.350> brass

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
round circuit board with little brass

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.909 
round circuit board with little brass
studs<00:04:32.889> all<00:04:33.160> the<00:04:33.280> way<00:04:33.370> around<00:04:33.700> and<00:04:33.940> that

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
studs all the way around and that

studs all the way around and that
step-up<00:04:35.919> unit<00:04:36.280> when<00:04:37.060> you<00:04:37.180> drop<00:04:37.389> an<00:04:37.540> extra

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.950 
step-up unit when you drop an extra
quarter<00:04:38.169> it<00:04:38.860> shifts<00:04:39.639> and<00:04:39.760> basically<00:04:40.450> changes

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
quarter it shifts and basically changes

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.370 
quarter it shifts and basically changes
your<00:04:41.200> I<00:04:41.410> guess<00:04:42.010> it<00:04:42.190> changes<00:04:42.639> the<00:04:43.380> possibility

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
your I guess it changes the possibility

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.260 
your I guess it changes the possibility
of<00:04:44.470> winning<00:04:44.620> but<00:04:45.400> I<00:04:45.490> mean<00:04:45.639> up<00:04:45.820> here<00:04:46.030> you<00:04:46.120> got

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
of winning but I mean up here you got

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.510 
of winning but I mean up here you got
the<00:04:46.630> the<00:04:47.290> payouts<00:04:47.680> different<00:04:48.160> depending<00:04:48.490> on

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
the the payouts different depending on

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.610 
the the payouts different depending on
how<00:04:48.669> many<00:04:48.790> cores<00:04:49.180> you<00:04:49.389> put<00:04:49.570> in<00:04:49.750> but<00:04:50.320> I've<00:04:50.440> also

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
how many cores you put in but I've also

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.040 
how many cores you put in but I've also
noticed<00:04:50.980> that<00:04:51.310> if<00:04:52.210> you<00:04:52.300> get<00:04:52.389> it<00:04:52.570> I<00:04:52.660> believe

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
noticed that if you get it I believe

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.610 
noticed that if you get it I believe
anyway<00:04:53.410> if<00:04:53.650> you<00:04:53.770> put<00:04:54.010> in<00:04:54.130> three<00:04:54.340> coins<00:04:55.620> then

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
anyway if you put in three coins then

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.500 
anyway if you put in three coins then
these<00:04:56.889> payouts<00:04:57.250> are<00:04:57.669> probably<00:04:58.000> in<00:04:58.180> effect

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
these payouts are probably in effect

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.020 
these payouts are probably in effect
which<00:04:58.690> seem<00:04:58.900> to<00:04:59.020> be<00:04:59.139> better<00:04:59.350> than<00:05:00.040> payouts

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
which seem to be better than payouts

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.170 
which seem to be better than payouts
over<00:05:01.360> here<00:05:01.540> with<00:05:01.720> 1/4<00:05:02.410> if<00:05:02.770> you<00:05:02.919> payout<00:05:03.190> to<00:05:03.370> 2/4

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
over here with 1/4 if you payout to 2/4

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.140 
over here with 1/4 if you payout to 2/4
right<00:05:04.690> here<00:05:05.400> and<00:05:06.400> I'm<00:05:06.550> not<00:05:06.669> sure<00:05:06.880> what<00:05:07.030> it's

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
right here and I'm not sure what it's

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.090 
right here and I'm not sure what it's
paid<00:05:07.300> out<00:05:07.450> on<00:05:07.510> because<00:05:07.960> you<00:05:08.050> got<00:05:08.200> this<00:05:08.470> you<00:05:08.979> got

and if you want me to videotape anything
to<00:05:21.010> do<00:05:21.160> with<00:05:21.190> the<00:05:21.370> machine<00:05:21.550> just<00:05:22.479> let<00:05:22.690> me<00:05:22.810> know

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
to do with the machine just let me know

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.240 
to do with the machine just let me know
and<00:05:25.650> glad<00:05:26.650> to<00:05:26.800> do<00:05:26.979> it

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
and glad to do it

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.190 
and glad to do it
I<00:05:27.280> suppose<00:05:27.639> I<00:05:27.790> can<00:05:27.940> show<00:05:28.120> you<00:05:28.180> drop<00:05:28.930> a<00:05:28.960> couple

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
I suppose I can show you drop a couple

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:35.430 
I suppose I can show you drop a couple
coins<00:05:29.590> here<00:05:33.570> few<00:05:34.570> coins<00:05:34.810> that<00:05:34.990> I<00:05:35.080> go<00:05:35.200> down<00:05:35.410> here

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
coins here few coins that I go down here

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.740 
coins here few coins that I go down here
probably<00:05:36.100> would<00:05:36.640> easily<00:05:36.850> win<00:05:37.150> every<00:05:37.450> coin<00:05:37.630> in

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
probably would easily win every coin in

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.500 
probably would easily win every coin in
this<00:05:37.870> machine<00:05:38.229> if<00:05:38.350> I<00:05:38.440> want<00:05:38.620> it<00:05:38.680> to<00:05:39.030> just<00:05:40.030> okay

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
this machine if I want it to just okay

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.020 
this machine if I want it to just okay
you<00:05:41.440> gotta<00:05:41.620> wait<00:05:41.830> for<00:05:41.860> it<00:05:42.100> to<00:05:42.190> say<00:05:42.340> now<00:05:42.520> my<00:05:42.669> coin

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
you gotta wait for it to say now my coin

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.690 
you gotta wait for it to say now my coin
accepted<00:05:43.570> and<00:05:43.780> then<00:05:44.530> you<00:05:44.710> get<00:05:44.890> rid<00:05:45.039> of<00:05:45.070> give

accepted and then you get rid of give

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:51.960 
accepted and then you get rid of give
her<00:05:45.789> a<00:05:45.850> pole<00:05:49.020> I<00:05:50.020> don't<00:05:50.950> see<00:05:51.100> anything<00:05:51.370> matching

her a pole I don't see anything matching

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.790 
her a pole I don't see anything matching
there<00:05:52.150> that<00:05:52.750> should<00:05:52.900> be<00:05:52.990> paying<00:05:53.260> out<00:05:53.410> but<00:05:53.740> I

if I can get this bad boy working the

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:19.460 
if I can get this bad boy working the
way<00:06:17.849> it's<00:06:18.000> meant<00:06:18.150> b-boy<00:06:18.900> it's<00:06:19.110> gonna<00:06:19.289> be

something and the good news I only paid
100<00:06:25.949> bucks<00:06:25.979> for<00:06:26.430> this<00:06:26.490> machine<00:06:26.729> I<00:06:27.180> think

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 
100 bucks for this machine I think

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.999 
100 bucks for this machine I think
that's<00:06:27.870> a<00:06:27.960> pretty<00:06:28.080> good<00:06:28.199> deal<00:06:28.560> and<00:06:30.830> have<00:06:31.830> lots
