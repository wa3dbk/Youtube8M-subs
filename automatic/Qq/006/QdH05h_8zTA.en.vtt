00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:14.829
 today we are testing the eos 450d this last reflection of the lowest the load 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:19.109
 In this camera, the first thing that strikes us is the huge screen that 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.340
 has 3 inches that have forced to redesign the entire keypad of the 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.519
 camera to make room for cct 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.470
 before the buttons has passed to locations 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.480
 the best ones that they had is more ergonomic 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.030
 one of them is the one of the iso passed the top 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.920
 And now we can see the value of the fact in the eyepiece 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.880
 Another of the novelties that draws attention is not that the 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.980
 memory card format to the floor one s 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.110
 the battery is also new 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.080
 It is a lighter and longer battery of the party or using the 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.080
 400 series 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.030
 also the objective is the same version that had been using in 18 55 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.050
 but this time stabilized 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.200
 most of the novelties are the 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.220
 that we are going to see now carefully 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.220
 the menu is redesigned being now more accessible 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.420
 we have six selectable scene modes in the top roulette 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.910
 in addition to four creative modes and automatic ones 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.340
 on the screen of jose quality a graph shows us the difference between 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.810
 the creative modes and the scene modes in which we can not use the format 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.580
 camps 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.380
 each menu now occupies a single screen so that all the options of the 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.380
 menu are visible and there is another 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.850
 although attitude 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.820
 this makes the tools menu is divided into three screens 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.970
 the first of them we found a new function that allows us 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.970
 configure the appearance of the screen 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.160
 counting with bodies that more delay 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.970
 one of the functions that has been modified is the cleaning of the sensor 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.970
 manual - which now makes a shot after the violence 

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:15.069
 but the most novel feature of this segment is surely the mode 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:15.809
 entity 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:19.569
 among the custom functions we find some inherited functions 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:20.759
 of the top range 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:23.429
 as the high sensitivity noise reduction 

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:26.429
 Raises of tone to the assault crosses with the automatic luminosity 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.879
 if you feel 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.909
 both parties 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:34.909
 although the attitude 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:41.299
 the most interesting part of the menu is the end in a new 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.049
 Green tab that allows you to adjust six own functions 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.110
 we will be given much more direct access to the things that suffer the most 

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:53.059
 in it we can place these genes from the menu as custom functions 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.849
 victims 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.280
 as we said at the beginning the button was passed to the top 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.430
 and now an automatic mode is included so that the camera alone dares 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.799
 although it usually contributes very high values 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.900
 another interesting novelty in this branch is the spot measurement that measures light in 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.900
 4% of the scene compared to 9% of the population 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:19.529
 Vienna May 27 

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:22.569
 also premiered an interval meter allows you to make up to ten photos 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:23.569
 followed 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.809
 When we want to use the direct vision mode we have to activate the 

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:29.809
 merger and choose a new approach acz 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.759
 if you are getting rid of the auto focus we will pass the objective manual mode and 

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.259
 we will focus by hand 

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:42.289
 next to this one 

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:45.289
 about 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:51.779
 acp 

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:55.069
 then we repeat the productivity in a fast way 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.679
 we will activate the target's autofocus again 

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:59.879
 we go with the asterisk button 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.999
 the mirror under the moment for measurements we lose the image 

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:06.249
 then we can make the contacts 

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:09.249
 although attitude 

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:16.779
 finally changes to the approach by contrast knew condition live 

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:20.589
 now we can find with an asterisk without losing sight of the scene when 

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:24.199
 we have focus in which you can see from we will hear the confirmation of 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:24.779
 other 

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:26.020
 we can shoot 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.449
 each of the modes may be appropriate at some point to do the work 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.460
 collective that is and will always be slower on how to use the traditional 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.180
 of draw
