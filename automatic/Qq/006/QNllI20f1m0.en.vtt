00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.540
 we were on board the ship sergeant 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.250
 village and they came to help with water 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.710
 with food but they were to cost 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.390
 Tuesday to perform hospital work 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.059
 we are waiting for people who are carrying 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.680
 a long time on the waiting list is 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.690
 also of course collaborating with the 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.880
 people that resulted with product injuries 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.130
 of the earthquake and they are making a 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.420
 very, very important work that was 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.850
 reported by rodrigo ugarte 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.710
 sometimes things conspire to make 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.660
 the destiny of street from a hand to 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.370
 who are having a bad time 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.739
 little alan had been almost two years 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.660
 waiting to be operated on the damages of 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.850
 remove hospital so it was impossible to 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.300
 surgery and that long wait now 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.280
 it threatened to become eternal but it does 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.080
 some days the village sergeant ship 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.600
 He sailed from Valparaíso with help 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.000
 food north that was his 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.010
 mission to deliver it and return but 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.870
 taking advantage of your hospital on board the 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.699
 Health service of Iquique and the Navy 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.680
 were coordinated to attend to 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.140
 most urgent needs of 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.960
 Iquiquenos clearly be left without 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.850
 Pavilion is very sensitive 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.470
 the offering of the soul to provide us 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.299
 their pavilions to be able to solve 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.130
 our patient clearly came as 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.409
 finger ring today the mothers of these 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.100
 neglected minors in a long list 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.259
 are very grateful to me 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.119
 it's a great relief one for safety 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.860
 of the ship in the hospital in these 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.520
 moments is not in good condition 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.550
 and another for the quickness the hope with 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.800
 the earthquake did I think it was going to be 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.930
 long about two more years waiting 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.260
 but thanks to something that if not they were 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.260
 a ship 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:49.310
 to see also 70 patients 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.500
 polytraumatized by effects of the 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.750
 earthquake and that they required surgeries 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.490
 they were airlifted to the 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.950
 vessel that throughout this end of 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.310

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.569
 operating room we have projects 27

 finish Sunday with 8 more but 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.450
 inside the ship we take for one of 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.049
 these anonymous stories of courage and 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.540
 heroism 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:25.970
 sergeant garcia is marine 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.250
 and these days the brain of the village 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.010
 on Saturday when sailing from Valparaíso 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.739
 he warned from the bay to get away as 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.599
 the fire consumed the hill where they lived 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.870
 his parents and the rest of his family 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.700
 hours later impotent he found out that 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.310
 they had lost everything 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.879
 these are other memories of my brother 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:50.060
 examine grandparents parents in what gives 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:52.190
 a lot of grief and we had to be 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.580
 with the chiles the cow of grace of 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.650
 north having our family 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:01.900
 involved in an equal attack is something 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.900
 strong but we are for that 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.890
 in the spirit and so it's not going to 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.040
 quiet today in Iquique the sun shone 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.710
 stronger than ever, stressed people 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.410
 with so much suffering and tension decided 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.170
 give your nerves a truce trying 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.140
 return to normality so broken 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.090
 these days almost three weeks 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.070

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.459
 little begins to return to the beaches 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.590
 unequivocal symptom that the Iquiqueños 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.390
 they begin to leave behind what happened in 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.680
