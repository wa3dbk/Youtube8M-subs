00:00:06.816 --> 00:00:09.786
 Here we go! Tamagotchi! 

00:00:10.316 --> 00:00:11.116
 Yah-tchi! 

00:00:15.786 --> 00:00:17.686
 The secret of Tamagotchi Town 

00:00:18.216 --> 00:00:20.986
 That was another day that ended safely. 

00:00:21.016 --> 00:00:24.216
 Yes indeed, you have all done a good job! 

00:00:24.246 --> 00:00:26.686
 Well done everyone! 

00:00:27.016 --> 00:00:32.046
 Today Mametchi passed by and I heard him say to his friends ... 

00:00:32.086 --> 00:00:33.116
 I wondered... 

00:00:33.146 --> 00:00:37.616
 Do you know what the buildings of Tamagotchi Town do at night when we are in our bed? 

00:00:38.046 --> 00:00:39.616
 I never really thought about it, but ... 

00:00:39.646 --> 00:00:42.746
 it must be lonely without anyone on the street to watch. 

00:00:43.046 --> 00:00:45.686
 They probably sleep, just like us-tchi. 

00:00:46.786 --> 00:00:48.516
 You would have thought so. 

00:00:48.686 --> 00:00:51.516
 Sleeping is so boring and would be a waste of our time. 

00:00:51.846 --> 00:00:54.046
 Should they not start? 

00:00:54.086 --> 00:00:56.016
 Yup, they can start any time. 

00:00:56.086 --> 00:00:57.746
 Hey, look, there is one! 

00:00:57.986 --> 00:01:00.216
 So delicious-tchi! 

00:01:00.286 --> 00:01:03.216
 Kuchipatchi has the same dream every night! 

00:01:03.246 --> 00:01:05.646
 Oh, look there, it's so beautiful! 

00:01:14.346 --> 00:01:18.346
 Very good, super heroine Chama-Girl! Finish it now with your Min-4 jet! 

00:01:18.816 --> 00:01:20.886
 Good idea, super scientist big brother! 

00:01:20.916 --> 00:01:25.316
 Super Chama-Girl's most powerful weapon, the Min-4 beam! 

00:01:28.346 --> 00:01:29.946
 It is so enchanting! 

00:01:29.986 --> 00:01:32.946
 She has exactly the same dream as yesterday. 

00:01:33.016 --> 00:01:36.116
 Hey? Oh, look, it's Mrs. Perfect! 

00:01:36.246 --> 00:01:39.586
 Ha-ha! Ha-ha! You are all perfect! 

00:01:46.746 --> 00:01:49.016
 Fireball and we rock! Yeah, Yeah, Yeah! 

00:01:49.286 --> 00:01:51.516
 Fireball and we rock! Yeah, Yeah, Yeah! 

00:01:51.616 --> 00:01:52.986
 Fireball and we rock ... 

00:01:53.386 --> 00:01:55.816
 Look! I think it's a new dream! 

00:01:56.486 --> 00:01:57.616
 Go! 

00:02:06.616 --> 00:02:08.146
 I'm sorry for the burden. 

00:02:08.186 --> 00:02:09.446
 No problem. 

00:02:09.486 --> 00:02:12.446
 Sweeped wipe! Sweeped wipe! Sweeped wipe! 

00:02:12.486 --> 00:02:18.016
 Curler curl! Curler curl! Curler curl! yeaaaaah! yeaaaaah! 

00:02:18.486 --> 00:02:20.686
 Everyone's beautiful dreams ... 

00:02:20.746 --> 00:02:22.446
 ... who lives in Tamagotchi Town ... 

00:02:22.586 --> 00:02:24.346
 ... are very lively ... 

00:02:25.116 --> 00:02:28.286
 ... and very nice!
