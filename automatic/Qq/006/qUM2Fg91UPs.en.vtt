it's hard like vanilla 3 right yeah
xfactor<00:01:49.720> like<00:01:49.930> one<00:01:50.470> and<00:01:50.649> two<00:01:50.800> were<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.100> more

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
xfactor like one and two were the more

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.180 
xfactor like one and two were the more
overly<00:01:52.030> used<00:01:52.270> yeah<00:01:52.630> but<00:01:53.170> now<00:01:53.290> it's<00:01:53.500> like<00:01:53.649> three

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
overly used yeah but now it's like three

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.560 
overly used yeah but now it's like three
is<00:01:54.340> like<00:01:54.550> the<00:01:54.670> ultimate<00:01:54.790> comeback<00:01:55.390> right
