00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.269 
kind of made me also want to talk about
some<00:00:27.630> news<00:00:27.869> or<00:00:28.109> some<00:00:28.230> stuff<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.529> happened<00:00:28.920> or

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
questions that you have asked and not

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.780 
questions that you have asked and not
even<00:00:31.560> introduction<00:00:32.009> has<00:00:32.099> been<00:00:32.250> uploaded<00:00:32.669> yet

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
even introduction has been uploaded yet

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.160 
even introduction has been uploaded yet
so<00:00:32.969> if<00:00:33.120> nothing<00:00:33.510> really<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.719> can<00:00:33.750> talk<00:00:34.050> about

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
so if nothing really I can talk about

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.380 
so if nothing really I can talk about
but<00:00:35.010> basically<00:00:35.130> what<00:00:35.520> can<00:00:35.670> be<00:00:35.730> said<00:00:35.910> they<00:00:36.120> have

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
but basically what can be said they have

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.139 
but basically what can be said they have
here<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.960> Kit<00:00:37.410> Kats<00:00:39.170> strawberry<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:41.120> why<00:00:42.120> I

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
here is Kit Kats strawberry and why I

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.150 
here is Kit Kats strawberry and why I
say<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:42.989> not<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.800> rare<00:00:44.010> is

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
say that this is not that rare is

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.889 
say that this is not that rare is
because<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.820> think<00:00:45.239> there<00:00:45.390> might<00:00:45.539> actually<00:00:45.600> be

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
because I think there might actually be

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.420 
because I think there might actually be
a<00:00:45.989> big<00:00:46.350> chance<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.829> can<00:00:46.920> also<00:00:47.039> get<00:00:47.250> this

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
a big chance that you can also get this

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.720 
a big chance that you can also get this
maybe<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:48.050> America<00:00:49.050> I'm<00:00:49.530> quite<00:00:50.250> sure<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.700> can

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
maybe in America I'm quite sure you can

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.770 
maybe in America I'm quite sure you can
