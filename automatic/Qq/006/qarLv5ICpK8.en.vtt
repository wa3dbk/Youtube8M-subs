00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 This is a rather old signature series 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:11.010
 the scene then series that excels at the 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.290
 how we keep the water clean 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:18.029
 how do we do that in the series series 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.490
 that is the combination of ozone and uv and 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.369
 that is built in and in the bath 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.490
 because we have two factors in the bath 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.150
 are built ensures that we are in 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.219
 synergy work together and you on this 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.600
 way the water is very easy to clean 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.210
 can hold 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.450
 they have a unique filter system 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:43.079
 because we have a separate filtration pump 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.059
 we can already have our water through the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.719
 filter 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:52.489
 that is unique and therefore becomes 100% of 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.489
 the water filtered 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:59.660
 Another advantage of our filtration pump is 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.210
 he is the silent because we 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.119
 use the filtration pump 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.790
 Do you have a silent spa and can use it 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.110
 also draw close to home than humans 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.479
 we have another advantage 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.119
 helps for some people and I don't say 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.040
 we are unique but some spas 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.320
 have it and some have spas 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.899
 it does not have this spa and it does 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.890
 this is a timer and that ensured 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:27.350
 that we can determine every minute if there 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.090
 filtering or not filtering and that 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.970
 means that we spend less in the day 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.550
 able to filter and more at night 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.390
 with day and night power that is possible 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.640
 great benefit so that you still 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.630
 has more advantage with this spa 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:47.030
 j the filtration pump that is fully oriented 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.850
 is filtering together with the 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.520
 ozonator but most important 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.789
 the uv lamp all those three things together 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.500
 ensure this bath 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.679
 really very easy to clean 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.679
 to hold
