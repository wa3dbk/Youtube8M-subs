00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.780
 to everyone today every day but hours there god 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:14.660
 we challenge we started this 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:18.410
 collaboration challenges a lot and where every 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:21.140
 month we prepare a recipe or suggestion 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.540
 on the other I suggested this to him 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.000
 first date 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:29.360
 I will prepare with is found to be limited and 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.379
 he will prepare a Roman dinner for the way 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:36.140
 exact enough to eliminate the broccoli 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:41.239
 because as far as I understood from pasta almost 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:45.620
 in this broccoli cream you leave the 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.940
 make your own meal and broccoli becomes 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.329
 a whole 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.460
 now I ask for clemency from the other of 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.149
 all palermitans and by all 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.229
 the Sicilians 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:59.210
 I will try hard to create something that 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:00.679
 remotely resemble the 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:06.610
 ours with the block the first disputes 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:09.210
 palermitana so mauro I'll beat you 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.460
 I look at my destiny 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.410
 then I tell you the ingredients inside 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.330
 to fear it was very categorical that 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.800
 the ingredients and I will be so too 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.320
 or the list of things that most has me 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.690
 said I was pasta I think I hope to 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.590
 having been decided then we have 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:29.860
 need three arts of bucatini we say 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:34.330
 a for three people and acts of bucatini a 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.070
 green-and-white broccoli not that 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.840
 romanesco I hope I have chosen 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.090
 the right one because the white one doesn't 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.470
 only this counts 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.450
 so I hope I chose that one 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:49.510
 just neither romanesco and bracco cooked in 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.090
 salt water and water must be kept 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.619
 because where we will cook the pasta then 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.260
 this very important step the 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.840
 the pack must forget it must be 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:02.020
 a very soft white onion 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.590
 whole cut small small four 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:09.310
 or five anchovy fillets a teaspoon 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.709
 of tomato paste should be 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.980
 just a little because it doesn't have to color the 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:18.790
 part that only giving a tone does not 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.010
 must be too much is not ours to the 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.980
 broccoli tomato pasta with a twist 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:28.209
 of tomato look.it and has been put 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:31.959
 in hot water for at least an hour pilots 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:36.570
 which I posted in breadcrumbs salt 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:39.970
 pepper chilli with effort 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.250
 chili would say try it 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.269
 let's start see how it goes every now and then 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:49.090
 speer cielo remind me of some of the 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.739
 delegates of me wrote mauro and not 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.260
 they were quite tall and must be done 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.610
 take onions we will help you with a 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.610
 little water to do it 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:03.870
 once all the onion is well 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:08.010
 transparent of the stews they had 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.320
 used to soften it will be evaporated to 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.310
 this point but now you were telling us to add 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:17.430
 the oil and brown the onion when 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:22.280
 the onions will be well browned or the 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:26.540
 oil tape add anchovies 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:29.690
 and let's melt ticosa 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:33.360
 maroni the secret is all here because 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:36.900
 this pasta is all very sweet elements 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.840
 the big length the finalist is 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.270
 all are not followed the secret is 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.350
 in defense, therefore, it is not necessary to be 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:50.160
 stingy on the other the anchovies contain 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.560
 very known born episode and to know 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.300
 what a condition to this thing you must 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.880
 obviously other people decided to 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:01.430
 mauro and I 'll put the picture there 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:04.440
 tiles so you will be amazed because 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.140
 the anchovies are so important in 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.450
 this dish is also tomato 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:14.760
 at this point we need to add the 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:17.790
 broccoli should be very soft on 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.160
 broccoli has picked up an influence 40 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:26.160
 minutes but now tells us that it will come too 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:28.040
 a little cooking water to this 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.010
 they created I add too 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.140
 teaspoon of tomato paste e 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.960
 we must not overdo it very much 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:39.080
 precise on this point the saffron in the 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.850
 in case I used white broccoli a 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.420
 cook this for 10 minutes 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:48.650
 so now I cover it while the boss 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:53.030
 of the kitchen place the breadcrumbs and one 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:56.270
 box with a fact oil breadcrumbs 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:59.110
 will be used as if it were a parm 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:02.270
 very typical of Sicilian cuisine 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:06.140
 plunge the bucatini should be drained to 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.070
 tooth and added directly to the pasta 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.110
 with sauce 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.960
 while we add to the rest of the 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.940
 ingredients with our cream 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.440
 I do n't have abundant chilli a 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.290
 enter then I put it a little bit hard 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:22.820
 I prefer to put it in the end 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:25.850
 tender interviews to the fried then 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:29.120
 we must add the raisins was 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:31.460
 bayern and plans and his ducats 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:36.390
 In the past it takes 13 minutes 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:40.470
 I would suggest you take it off at 9 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:41.210
 ten minutes arrive born in and 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.770
 broccoli 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.310
 obviously adding if you need water from 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.370
 cooking 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:51.540
 then you need to close the lid e 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:53.340
 let it rest for 5 months is the 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:06:02.450
 time to put the pasta of 3 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:06:04.950
 broccoli must be removed for a minute 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:07.770
 and then let it stay with the lid 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:10.740
 for other 5 and then see you in 5 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:20.420
 finally we maintain with a bit of 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:20.420
 breadcrumbs we roast serve 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:36.150
 a goal of fever and another bit of 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:36.150
 bread crumbs 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.820
 then obviously the breadcrumbs lesson 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:44.789
 Sicilian had put at the table how 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.789
 it was parmesan and a drizzle of oil 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:53.580
 here is the challenge pasta goes with 

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:54.629
 branko eliminated them from palermo with 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.069
 pride 

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:58.979
 I recommend you do it because it has a 

00:06:56.069 --> 00:07:01.469
 I look fantastic so if you do n't 

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:03.659
 have you ever tried it and nothing 

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:06.479
 I wait for the recipe of mauro that will be 

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:07.560
 a Roman recipe and I know which one but not 

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:10.199
 I tell you 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.969
 and any suggestion advice 

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:14.310
 criticism of course you know I can 

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:16.080
 write a comment below you can 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:21.270

 Hello
