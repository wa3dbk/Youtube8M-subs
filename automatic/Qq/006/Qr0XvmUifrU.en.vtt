00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:37.249 
played in front of 50,000 people in the

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:39.639 
played in front of 50,000 people in the
Philippines<00:01:37.429> arena<00:01:38.359> stadium<00:01:38.719> it<00:01:39.350> looks<00:01:39.530> like

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
Philippines arena stadium it looks like

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.130 
Philippines arena stadium it looks like
that's<00:01:39.770> probably<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:40.549> stadium<00:01:40.969> that<00:01:41.869> where

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
that's probably the stadium that where

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.679 
that's probably the stadium that where
he<00:01:42.439> will<00:01:42.649> most<00:01:43.009> likely<00:01:43.369> have<00:01:43.759> his<00:01:44.030> last<00:01:44.329> fight

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
he will most likely have his last fight

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.050 
he will most likely have his last fight
I<00:01:44.960> think<00:01:45.799> it<00:01:45.890> would<00:01:46.039> be<00:01:46.310> in<00:01:46.429> that<00:01:46.549> stadium

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
I think it would be in that stadium

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.580 
I think it would be in that stadium
because<00:01:47.270> that's<00:01:47.479> day<00:01:47.630> we<00:01:47.810> can<00:01:47.960> put<00:01:48.200> in<00:01:48.319> a<00:01:48.409> hell

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
because that's day we can put in a hell

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.129 
because that's day we can put in a hell
lot<00:01:48.740> of<00:01:48.829> people<00:01:49.100> so<00:01:49.369> if<00:01:49.819> it's<00:01:50.689> going<00:01:50.869> to<00:01:50.929> be<00:01:51.049> in

00:01:51.129 --> 00:01:51.139 
lot of people so if it's going to be in

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:52.690 
lot of people so if it's going to be in
any<00:01:51.289> Stadium<00:01:51.649> over<00:01:52.009> in<00:01:52.100> the<00:01:52.189> Philippines<00:01:52.579> or

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
any Stadium over in the Philippines or

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
episodes next week it's going to be like

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.610 
episodes next week it's going to be like
under<00:04:59.570> the<00:04:59.690> lights<00:04:59.930> or<00:05:00.110> something<00:05:00.290> like<00:05:00.560> that

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
under the lights or something like that

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.990 
under the lights or something like that
I<00:05:00.800> honestly<00:05:01.190> don't<00:05:01.310> know<00:05:01.430> what<00:05:01.550> that<00:05:01.670> is<00:05:01.700> I

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
I honestly don't know what that is I

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
I honestly don't know what that is I
thought<00:05:02.450> it<00:05:02.510> would<00:05:02.600> just<00:05:02.780> be<00:05:02.990> like

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
thought it would just be like

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.420 
thought it would just be like
highlighting<00:05:03.650> the<00:05:03.770> weaknesses<00:05:04.250> and

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
highlighting the weaknesses and

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.800 
highlighting the weaknesses and
strengths<00:05:04.820> of<00:05:04.880> each<00:05:05.030> fighter<00:05:05.330> but<00:05:05.570> it<00:05:05.660> looks

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
strengths of each fighter but it looks

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.150 
strengths of each fighter but it looks
like<00:05:05.870> they're<00:05:06.080> going<00:05:06.200> to<00:05:06.260> do<00:05:06.410> more<00:05:06.680> of<00:05:06.800> it<00:05:06.920> like

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
like they're going to do more of it like

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.860 
like they're going to do more of it like
