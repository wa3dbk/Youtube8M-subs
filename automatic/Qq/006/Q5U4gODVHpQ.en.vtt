00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.250 
Chris Ashton's tackle I think was a
turning<00:07:05.760> point<00:07:05.790> in<00:07:06.030> the<00:07:06.090> match<00:07:06.240> his<00:07:06.780> tackle

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:07.260 
turning point in the match his tackle

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.720 
turning point in the match his tackle
early<00:07:07.590> on<00:07:07.710> which<00:07:07.890> made<00:07:08.130> the<00:07:08.250> try<00:07:08.430> for<00:07:08.610> two

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:08.730 
early on which made the try for two

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:10.670 
early on which made the try for two
lanky<00:07:09.150> could<00:07:09.870> have<00:07:09.990> set<00:07:10.200> the<00:07:10.290> game<00:07:10.470> on<00:07:10.620> a

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 
lanky could have set the game on a

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.080 
lanky could have set the game on a
different<00:07:11.100> tract<00:07:11.400> had<00:07:11.550> he<00:07:11.610> not<00:07:11.790> made<00:07:12.060> that

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:12.090 
different tract had he not made that

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:13.550 
different tract had he not made that
decision<00:07:12.510> but<00:07:12.720> I<00:07:12.810> think<00:07:12.990> this<00:07:13.050> England<00:07:13.380> side

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:13.560 
decision but I think this England side

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.230 
decision but I think this England side
has<00:07:13.800> made<00:07:13.980> massive<00:07:14.280> strides<00:07:14.730> towards

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.240 
has made massive strides towards

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.960 
has made massive strides towards
creating<00:07:15.810> a<00:07:16.080> nation<00:07:16.560> of<00:07:16.890> proud<00:07:17.370> rugby

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:17.970 
creating a nation of proud rugby

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.700 
creating a nation of proud rugby

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:32.590 
think the England side theoretically I

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.380 
think the England side theoretically I
think<00:07:32.920> could<00:07:33.070> win<00:07:33.250> this<00:07:33.400> by<00:07:33.580> 10<00:07:33.850> points<00:07:34.030> I
