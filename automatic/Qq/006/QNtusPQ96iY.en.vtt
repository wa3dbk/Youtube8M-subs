00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 there are good of all kids since a 5 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.700
 and good guys, I bring you another review of 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.170
 a server for minecraft 1.75 and good 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.440
 guys, it's a pretty server 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.560
 complete here on this side are the 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.280
 rules and those things here explains to you that 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.480
 you can get coins 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.340
 doing yes in the pvp part 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.580
 You can get coins that you can 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.400
 exchange for little things and well it is 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.050
 pretty good the server has sky 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.550
 block destroy the nexus games the 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:41.079
 hungry 'pvp towers and tve projectors 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.629
 that is not what I suppose and it will be pvp 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.289
 but well then, although it is 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:49.750
 pretty well it has not given me anything of the 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.089
 I have taken another compass novelty nothing of 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:56.850
 it 's pretty good the only thing that fails 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:59.609
 I could not here is the little things about him 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.550
 followed what has what I would put 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.379
 is 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.720
 that players could hide 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.130
 because for example now there is not much 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.369
 people but there are times that there are very many 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.550
 people and this peta and if I'm 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:16.310
 recording whatever it is because it looks looks bad 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:20.330
 no, but well, it's pretty good in 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.000
 the server I do not know I like the games 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.830
 the eyes of hunger are 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.830
 I like this pretty 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.990
 Yes, well, here I leave the video in the 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.990
 server ip I'll leave it 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:44.820
 it was called the cookies this nobody is 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.679
 good that I leave here the 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.190
 server in the description so that you 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.180
 pass 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.180
 and little more 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.540
 If I put more I think it has been all 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.280
 clear if you have any questions or suggestions 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.830
 or your opinion leaves for the 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.850
 comments and see you in the next 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.500
 video if what I say if you want me to do 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.980
 a video of something anything 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.140
 leave me in the comments and 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.750
 I will try to do it whenever I can 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.820
 because sometimes you ask me for things that are not 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.670
 I have time I do not have the means to 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:21.000
 do it and neither is plan you know 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.000
 take out do not stay there uo but if any 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.640
 little thing you do not know or whatever it is 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.100
 so I'll try to do it so nothing 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.770
 dismissal here a hug to all what 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.770
