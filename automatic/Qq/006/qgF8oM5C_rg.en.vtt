00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.259
 the president just a few days ago became fix 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.330
 made steffen hofmann 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:12.450
 three-year contract 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.670
 also here is discussed on the internet in 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.320
 various forums and so it fits 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.970
 Now I'll ask you this question 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.130
 then also ask 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.289
 Nevertheless, a question three-year contract 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.500
 for steffen hofmann why one 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:30.330
 three-year contract 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:33.899
 I have the steffen hofmann with us 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:37.440
 he also deserves a special position 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.660
 in my opinion not only the heart 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.360
 the Team 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:47.360
 he is a very outstanding 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:50.010
 personality with a high character 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:54.329
 an exemplary personality of ours 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.840
 Vereine and I assume that 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.570
 even with his date loose sports life 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.799
 that we ultimately manage 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.810
 is for our club for the next 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.490
 three years to be very important 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.549
 or me the holiday clarity synonymous 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.909
 emphasize that the 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:18.030
 contract negotiations with him in one 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:24.689
 outrageous way of playing 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:27.000
 that we have with the basis of the 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.430
 we went out to a you on 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.470
 have concluded the contract 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.880
 are 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.000
 we have hofmann with the steffen 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.920
 met but for two hours 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.320
 scheduled for his two hours 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.270
 sat together 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.630
 but the contract negotiations in five 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.049
 minutes done 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:50.140
 she speaks of fairness from his 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:52.630
 Side also for affection to this 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.990
 Verein and I appreciate this man 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.729
 tremendous 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.340
 I would like to ask this question now 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.679
 connect the mail from gerhard 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.869
 Jungmann he says why does that make rapid 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.170
 for years not a substitute for 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.880
 to hire Steffen Hofmann 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.470
 further stated that the 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.239
 team for about two years 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.180
 not further developed 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.700
 they must also see that there is 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.790
 good games here and there but that is too 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.190
 little what they say 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.160
 at least we have mine 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.160
 philosophy has never been for a replacement 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.160
 looked after for hoffmann 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:36.400
 because for me steffen hofmann is safe 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.900
 The contract does not extend a fixed one 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.310
 part of the team was her 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.470
 however, players are the ones who need him 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.549
 complete 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:52.239
 whether the optimal choice is made here 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:55.769
 was I would not say 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:59.230
 because there are certainly different 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:03.519
 But the fact that 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.930
 We are not the best at the last games 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.010
 football have shown that at all 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.569
 no question and I am the same 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.150
 affected like everyone else 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.799
 Here is his reputation for expression 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:20.810
 but I would like to say 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:22.999
 that it's something almost malicious 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.750
 assumption is when you say it has 

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:29.599
 nothing was done later 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.709
 shakes one is we have in 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.269
 last year the second 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.980
 I already know table space 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.079
 I will also become a Rapid Vienna champion 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.120
 become a master 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:39.969
 but the second table place was 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.040
 remarkable 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:44.030
 we are in the europaliga 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.609
 qualified 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:50.719
 we are the only Austrian 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:54.609
 club in the qualification phase 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:58.699
 who came into the group stage and 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:04:00.469
 there is perhaps that I stress 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:01.730
 do not speak doubled stress that 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:04.969
 you have to do the reverse 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.169
 the target does not pull us fast 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:09.829
 to qualify more for the europacup 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:12.799
 that would be crazy but you have to 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.989
 take note that the path of the peter 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:18.489
 he shook off the responsible 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:22.190
 The association is supported with namely 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.789
 young players with a lot of players 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:29.900
 coming from their own offspring 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:34.430
 to develop a new something here that 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:38.360
 the way to go is the problem 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:41.780
 it is unfortunately that some of us 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.639
 not to the young ones 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.919
 young key players need around 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.810
 also to be guided injured 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:52.000
 have failed or in a crisis of form 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:54.680
 We drove ourselves so we are currently 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.099
 in the situation in which we are 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.930
 but basically it has to be said 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:01.940
 not developed I believe that 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.639
 is really a wrong interpretation 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.349
 I always think that many 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:09.500
 e-mails he answers personally 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:12.440
 as I said wearily snapshot the 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.960
 At the moment , the emotional assessment 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:18.090
 assess mountain moment 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:20.289
 Let's see right but we rate the 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.169
 team and also the performance of 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:23.979
 primary operations at the end which is then seasonally 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.919
 the fairer 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:29.590
 then that is correct and then it is 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:31.150
 also the point where you then the one 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.710
 or other change as well 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.440
 can 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:38.250
 they 're in right after the wac play 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:42.069
 a microphone said to the question 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.930
 coach discussion no topic they have 

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:45.970
 also said there you have to talk about it 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.210
 think about her at the moment 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:52.449
 attitude to the question I have 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:56.500
 not so answered but on the 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:59.830
 question what is the consequence of anticipating 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:04.020
 so you say it all then think about it 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:06.820
 just in the variety of opinions 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.409
 of personalities goes to the 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.120
 possibility to have in print media too 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:12.310
 write that is interpreted 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.210
 so that you can be during my time 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.159
 used to live long 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:18.900
 so interpret me authentically 

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:22.449
 Again, you have to say everything 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.400
 check all must check 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:29.169
 but I do not say at all 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:32.469
 to tell her that Peter SchÃ¶ttel than 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:33.849
 trainer of the sc rapid not just one 

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:36.659
 but also the trust of 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:36.659
 presidium enjoys
