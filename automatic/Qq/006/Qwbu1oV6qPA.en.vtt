00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.499 
where I want it before basically
installing<00:02:08.140> this<00:02:08.259> ring<00:02:08.530> now<00:02:09.310> you<00:02:09.940> don't<00:02:10.239> have

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
installing this ring now you don't have

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.839 
installing this ring now you don't have
to<00:02:10.750> take<00:02:10.929> apart<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.680> front<00:02:12.099> plastic<00:02:12.340> piece

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
to take apart the front plastic piece

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.789 
to take apart the front plastic piece
with<00:02:13.299> the<00:02:13.420> black<00:02:13.629> the<00:02:13.870> back<00:02:14.019> plastic<00:02:14.260> piece<00:02:14.650> to

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
with the black the back plastic piece to

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:17.630 
with the black the back plastic piece to
get<00:02:14.920> these<00:02:15.040> in<00:02:15.189> there<00:02:15.340> what<00:02:15.849> you<00:02:16.030> do<00:02:16.180> is<00:02:16.420> since

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
get these in there what you do is since

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
get these in there what you do is since
well<00:02:18.640> I<00:02:18.790> mean<00:02:18.970> you<00:02:19.090> can<00:02:19.210> start<00:02:19.420> with<00:02:19.569> the

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
well I mean you can start with the

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.170 
well I mean you can start with the
center<00:02:19.870> ring<00:02:20.020> which<00:02:20.200> what<00:02:20.440> I<00:02:20.470> usually<00:02:20.770> do

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
center ring which what I usually do

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.330 
center ring which what I usually do
because<00:02:22.180> it's<00:02:22.450> easier<00:02:22.720> for<00:02:22.750> me<00:02:23.160> basically<00:02:24.160> you

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
because it's easier for me basically you

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.090 
because it's easier for me basically you
work<00:02:25.300> it<00:02:25.480> in<00:02:25.569> there<00:02:25.690> so<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:29.110> can<00:02:29.260> also<00:02:29.380> you<00:02:29.590> use

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
work it in there so you can also you use

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.420 
work it in there so you can also you use
the<00:02:30.510> angles<00:02:31.510> of<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.690> thing<00:02:32.250> no<00:02:33.250> I'm<00:02:33.340> not

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
the angles of the thing no I'm not

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.500 
the angles of the thing no I'm not
making<00:02:33.670> much<00:02:33.790> sense<00:02:33.820> here<00:02:34.180> but<00:02:34.300> you<00:02:34.360> basically

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
making much sense here but you basically

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.250 
making much sense here but you basically
turn<00:02:34.930> it<00:02:35.080> so<00:02:35.320> it<00:02:35.440> fits<00:02:35.590> in<00:02:35.770> there<00:02:35.920> so<00:02:36.990> and<00:02:37.990> I

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
turn it so it fits in there so and I

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.330 
turn it so it fits in there so and I
wish<00:02:38.410> I<00:02:38.530> had<00:02:38.620> a<00:02:38.650> better<00:02:38.740> mount<00:02:39.070> for<00:02:39.250> this

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
wish I had a better mount for this

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.030 
wish I had a better mount for this
camera<00:02:42.450> but<00:02:43.450> essentially<00:02:44.110> just<00:02:44.350> snap<00:02:44.709> saying

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
camera but essentially just snap saying

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.130 
camera but essentially just snap saying
they're<00:02:45.160> actually<00:02:45.459> really<00:02:45.820> well<00:02:45.940> built<00:02:46.209> or<00:02:47.080> if

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
they're actually really well built or if

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.050 
they're actually really well built or if
you<00:02:47.260> buy<00:02:47.380> the<00:02:47.440> really<00:02:47.890> really<00:02:48.430> crappy<00:02:48.640> ones<00:02:48.970> I

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
you buy the really really crappy ones I

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.410 
you buy the really really crappy ones I
heard<00:02:49.239> they<00:02:49.360> don't<00:02:49.480> fit<00:02:49.810> as<00:02:50.020> well<00:02:51.360> but<00:02:54.420> yeah

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
heard they don't fit as well but yeah

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.130 
heard they don't fit as well but yeah
once<00:02:55.780> they're<00:02:56.620> in<00:02:56.860> there<00:02:57.010> they're<00:02:57.040> really<00:02:57.400> in

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
once they're in there they're really in

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.240 
once they're in there they're really in
so<00:02:59.140> that's<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.500> first<00:02:59.769> one<00:02:59.980> I<00:03:01.950> think<00:03:02.950> you<00:03:03.100> look

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
so that's the first one I think you look

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.509 
so that's the first one I think you look
pretty<00:03:03.340> nice<00:03:03.610> makes<00:03:04.420> it<00:03:04.540> look<00:03:04.630> a<00:03:04.660> little<00:03:04.750> newer

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
pretty nice makes it look a little newer

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.860 
pretty nice makes it look a little newer
alright<00:03:06.519> so<00:03:06.970> I'll<00:03:07.060> go<00:03:07.209> and<00:03:07.330> do<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.510> other<00:03:07.540> two

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
alright so I'll go and do the other two

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:16.760 
alright so I'll go and do the other two
and<00:03:08.230> show<00:03:08.830> you<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:09.040> reassembly

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.830
