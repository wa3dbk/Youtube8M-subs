00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.069 
I've a look on one I think the rate is
probably<00:01:53.430> two<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.820> half<00:01:54.000> percent<00:01:54.270> this

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
probably two and a half percent this

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.929 
probably two and a half percent this
would<00:01:55.350> make<00:01:55.530> sense<00:01:55.829> if<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.280> had<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.549> way<00:01:56.790> of

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
would make sense if you had a way of

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.149 
would make sense if you had a way of
getting<00:01:57.090> Randy<00:01:57.570> Orton<00:01:57.899> easily<00:01:58.469> for<00:01:59.009> this

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
getting Randy Orton easily for this

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.359 
getting Randy Orton easily for this
amount<00:01:59.460> six<00:02:00.060> hundred<00:02:00.420> thousand<00:02:01.020> that's<00:02:01.560> nuts

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
amount six hundred thousand that's nuts

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.600 
amount six hundred thousand that's nuts
I<00:02:02.399> mean<00:02:03.149> it's<00:02:03.869> just<00:02:03.990> ridiculous<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:05.100> don't<00:02:05.399> know

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
I mean it's just ridiculous I don't know

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.730 
I mean it's just ridiculous I don't know
why<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:05.969> would<00:02:06.149> be<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.540> then<00:02:06.899> lastly<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
why that would be and then lastly the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.410
