 this week I will talk about the galaxy note 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:16.400
 2 as it is now I do not know was how it was 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.789
 premiered and its characteristics run 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.949
 online 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:24.720
 we will see the most important ones and also 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:28.350
 some details without more let's go to this 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.050
 good for martín the screen 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:34.980
 and samsung took great pains to overcome his 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.460
 5.3 amoled screen this time does not bring 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.820
 a 5.5-inch diagonal screen 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:45.690
 with a resolution of 280 280 x 720 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.250
 super amoled personally is not me 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.990
 wait 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.970
 a little more resolution because I already 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.630
 these heights can already perfectly 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.460
 take out a cell phone with full hd screen 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:59.580
 but good things of life we ​​will have 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.250
 what to expect good connects with the 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.600
 little screen that is spent want to imagine 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:11.799
 that is not discreet 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:14.880
 his mediation of 85% 51 1 x 9.4 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:18.320
 millimeters with a weight of 180 grams 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.700
 control and achieve something so big 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.610
 good battery 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.539
 samsung I take advantage of putting on the body 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.460
 galaxy step not a 3100 battery 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:32.640
 milliamps to power your screen 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:37.520
 4g connectivity its four cores of 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:40.720
 1.6 already hertz and its 2 gb of ram 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:45.160
 and with respect to internal memory 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:48.130
 will come out versions of 16 32 and 64 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.800
 gigas with microsd card slot 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.400
 included the connectivity of this equipment 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:58.890
 is lte or is it 4 people counting from a 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:02.060
 In addition to direct wifi bluetooth 4.0 gps 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:06.350
 usb 2.0 host 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:09.410
 m hl nfc as not 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.030
 As a photo camera you have a camera 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.030
 8 megapixels with a resolution 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.890
 with a resolution of 1080 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.430
 and I've stuck with flash led autofocus 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.140
 in addition to the backlit sensor 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.659
 identical to that of the secondary camera but 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.269
 in this case the resolution is 12 only 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:37.290
 1.9 pixels and the main camera is 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.290
 able to record videos at 1080p 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:46.340
 in this samsung terminal that is going to have 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.530
 android 4.0 4.1 and the living with many 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:55.010
 applications for your pointer creates a 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:58.170
 Improved 2.0 pointer and good comes goes to 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.060
 reach the market with 4.1 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.890
 samsung has confirmed different 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.020
 applications specially designed for 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.520
 take advantage of the big screen of your 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:10.040
 phone as well as the pointer 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.960
 that they have redesigned it as I was saying 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.760
 do it more like catching the longest 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.710
 hardness 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.140
 cotillo 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.570
 good among the applications include 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.560
 serviu with the one who goes with the one who is 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:27.440
 you're going to place the spin so it's called the 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.770
 view on a mail document for 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:34.300
 have a preview of it that's 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.300
 the textually mind that come out 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.780
 to be able to open applications like a 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.300
 know in any area of ​​the screen is 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.330
 another of the extra attractions that the 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.490
 galaxy not autos the gestures are also 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.200
 important in the galaxy the by means 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.670
 of the quick command application that 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.360
 allows you to quickly activate 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.610
 most applications the user uses with 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.690
 the s see just by pressing the button is 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:02.180
 event and moving the pointer up 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.250
 then to see a little window from 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.510
 where to access activities that we will have 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.400
 could be customized before 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.700
 of the new applications I would like 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.819
 highlight the visual idea call there 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.709
 be 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.570
 bergós the text movements and a 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:21.579
 post that allows you to add illustration and 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.579
 handwritten text in the s 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.620
 well there is also another application that 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.180
 I read this 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.850
 there is another application that I was reading 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:38.440
 now and that allows you the same as in 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:38.440
 the in the galaxy s3 when they call you 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.780
 not when you get a text message you 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.460
 send a text message I had six 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.610
 months of texts about the cell phone 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:52.180
 heard and the cell phone calls the shot good 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:54.550
 more or less in the same then 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.340
 well it also brings quite other 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.080
 I personally would love things 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.880
 be able to play the space in that terminal 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.050
 but I find it just as it does very 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.039
 expensive 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:08.410
 well the galaxy without cars will reach the 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:10.930
 markets as of October and I said to 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.080
 markets not to chile because to chile 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.889
 will come for nothing 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.169
 like all 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:18.240
 good will come in white and 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.580
 gray and 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:24.210
 and as you will have seen the image it looks like 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.680
 much much much stress even 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.880
 I know that I will iguanas that are going to put 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.880
 in the comments but 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:37.430
 a picture of those three great couples 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:40.730
 they are equal for something and good to get 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.370
 in a lot of operator is real but still 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:46.430
 It has no price defined equal 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:50.120
 dearly what I think what I 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:53.200
 I think you 're going to like it, it's going to be 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.200
 at least one 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:06:00.250
 700 dollars 700 dollars about 500 thousand 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.250
 Chilean pesos 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.590
 obviously this is going to go to shit 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.950
 goran all in revenge 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:10.470
 well with that pretty much like a 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:13.190
 small review something small a 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:16.130
 bit 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:20.390
 to this great world and the other week 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:24.380
 when they make the appearance exclusively 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:29.360
 from iphone 5 I'm going to see it I'll see 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:30.590
 which can the presentation 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.420
 can draw the general ideas that 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.810
 has the iphone 5 that present it on 12 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:38.600
 September and I'll do a review 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.700
 and in October the mini review is coming 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.220
 ipad 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:45.220
 and well with that I hope you have 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.390

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:51.229
