to make a giant gummy lego man so so
easy<00:00:11.639> really<00:00:12.480> cool<00:00:12.780> let's<00:00:13.679> go<00:00:24.680> now<00:00:25.680> get<00:00:25.830> a

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
easy really cool let's go now get a

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.130 
easy really cool let's go now get a
large<00:00:26.130> mixing<00:00:26.730> bowl<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:27.119> can<00:00:27.390> also<00:00:27.599> do<00:00:27.960> this

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
large mixing bowl you can also do this

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.250 
large mixing bowl you can also do this
over<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.560> stove<00:00:29.029> but<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.359> think<00:00:30.900> this<00:00:31.019> way<00:00:31.230> is

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
over the stove but I think this way is

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.500 
over the stove but I think this way is
just<00:00:31.500> bit<00:00:31.740> easier<00:00:32.160> quicker<00:00:33.800> get<00:00:34.800> about<00:00:35.510> 340

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
just bit easier quicker get about 340

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.090 
just bit easier quicker get about 340
grams<00:00:36.540> or<00:00:37.140> 1<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.040> third<00:00:38.670> cups<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.680> jelly<00:00:40.680> or

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
grams or 1 and third cups of jelly or

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.170 
grams or 1 and third cups of jelly or
jello<00:00:41.340> jelly<00:00:42.180> crystals<00:00:42.649> I'm<00:00:43.649> using<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.430> blue

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
jello jelly crystals I'm using a blue

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.639 
jello jelly crystals I'm using a blue
color<00:00:46.110> because<00:00:46.550> unlike<00:00:47.550> blue<00:00:48.350> you<00:00:49.350> want<00:00:49.559> to

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
color because unlike blue you want to

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.670 
color because unlike blue you want to
also<00:00:49.829> add<00:00:50.660> depending<00:00:51.660> on<00:00:51.750> how<00:00:51.899> gummy<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.469> want
