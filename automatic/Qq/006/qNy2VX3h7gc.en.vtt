hey guys it's Mike again I got a request
to<00:00:02.159> show<00:00:02.340> the<00:00:02.720> Motorola<00:00:03.720> GP<00:00:04.140> 380<00:00:04.879> this<00:00:05.879> radio

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
to show the Motorola GP 380 this radio

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.230 
to show the Motorola GP 380 this radio
was<00:00:06.450> imported<00:00:07.109> from<00:00:07.140> Europe<00:00:07.470> I<00:00:07.770> got<00:00:08.730> it<00:00:08.940> from

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
was imported from Europe I got it from

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.780 
was imported from Europe I got it from
somebody<00:00:09.660> in<00:00:09.750> California<00:00:10.349> who<00:00:10.670> imported<00:00:11.670> it

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
somebody in California who imported it

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.980 
somebody in California who imported it
from<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.679> it<00:00:13.679> has<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.889> full<00:00:14.429> DTMF<00:00:15.299> keypad<00:00:15.780> it

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
from and it has a full DTMF keypad it

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.380 
from and it has a full DTMF keypad it
has<00:00:16.139> five<00:00:16.470> tone<00:00:16.770> signaling<00:00:17.340> as<00:00:17.430> well<00:00:17.609> DTMF

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
has five tone signaling as well DTMF

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.689 
has five tone signaling as well DTMF
mode<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:19.289> has<00:00:19.320> an<00:00:19.650> emergency<00:00:20.189> button<00:00:20.400> that

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
mode it has an emergency button that

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.040 
mode it has an emergency button that
actually<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.180> have<00:00:21.420> set<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.869> put<00:00:22.230> companding<00:00:22.740> on

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
actually I have set to put companding on

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.109 
actually I have set to put companding on
so<00:00:25.050> I'm<00:00:25.439> not<00:00:25.619> sure<00:00:25.800> what<00:00:26.010> companding<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.730> it's

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
so I'm not sure what companding is it's

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.210 
so I'm not sure what companding is it's
supposed<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.930> reduce<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.439> static<00:00:28.710> between

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
supposed to reduce the static between

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.769 
supposed to reduce the static between
transmissions<00:00:29.849> but<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.240> doesn't<00:00:30.480> really<00:00:30.570> work

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
transmissions but it doesn't really work

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.260 
transmissions but it doesn't really work
that<00:00:30.840> well

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.890 

it's<00:00:33.900> military<00:00:34.770> standard<00:00:35.310> it<00:00:35.490> I<00:00:35.730> think<00:00:36.690> it

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:36.900 
it's military standard it I think it

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.230 
it's military standard it I think it
meets<00:00:37.650> military<00:00:38.580> spec<00:00:38.970> CD<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.630> E<00:00:40.250> has<00:00:41.250> 280

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:42.240 
meets military spec CD and E has 280

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.830 
meets military spec CD and E has 280
channels<00:00:42.720> I<00:00:42.810> think<00:00:43.020> or<00:00:43.140> 250<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:43.920> don't<00:00:44.100> know

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
channels I think or 250 I don't know

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.230 
channels I think or 250 I don't know
right<00:00:45.840> now<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.050> don't<00:00:46.710> really<00:00:47.100> have<00:00:47.880> that<00:00:48.120> many

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:48.240 
right now I don't really have that many

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.550 
right now I don't really have that many
child's<00:00:49.130> programs<00:00:50.130> into<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:51.230> yeah<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.260> also

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:52.560 
child's programs into it yeah I also

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.520 
child's programs into it yeah I also
don't<00:00:52.830> have<00:00:52.950> the<00:00:53.130> five<00:00:53.400> tone<00:00:53.700> signaling<00:00:54.530> setup

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
don't have the five tone signaling setup

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.140 
don't have the five tone signaling setup
on<00:00:55.740> it<00:00:55.890> because<00:00:56.130> I<00:00:56.400> actually<00:00:56.550> can't<00:00:56.910> figure

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
on it because I actually can't figure

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.910 
on it because I actually can't figure
out<00:00:57.330> how<00:00:57.720> at<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.080> moment<00:00:58.500> because<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.770> haven't

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
out how at the moment because I haven't

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.790 
out how at the moment because I haven't
played<00:00:59.460> around<00:00:59.790> with<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.080> the<00:01:01.080> only<00:01:01.230> problem<00:01:01.710> I

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
played around with it the only problem I

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.530 
played around with it the only problem I
have<00:01:01.980> with<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.280> radio<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.940> after<00:01:03.510> I

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
have with this radio is that after I

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.570 
have with this radio is that after I
tried<00:01:03.930> programming<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.740> fiber<00:01:04.980> so<00:01:05.490> it

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
tried programming the fiber so it

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.880 
tried programming the fiber so it
actually<00:01:06.000> freezes<00:01:06.750> up<00:01:06.930> every<00:01:07.200> time<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.410> turn<00:01:07.740> it

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
actually freezes up every time I turn it

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.670 
actually freezes up every time I turn it
on<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.690> let<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.960> sit<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.290> charge<00:01:10.500> of

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
on so I have to let it sit in charge of

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.890 
on so I have to let it sit in charge of
verbs<00:01:10.890> sometimes<00:01:11.760> two<00:01:12.210> minutes<00:01:12.540> two

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
verbs sometimes two minutes two

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.950 
verbs sometimes two minutes two
sometimes<00:01:13.850> five<00:01:14.850> hours<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.510> actually<00:01:15.840> to

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
sometimes five hours that actually to

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.160 
sometimes five hours that actually to
let<00:01:16.050> it<00:01:16.200> unfreeze<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.390> so<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.420> just<00:01:18.690> keep<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.020> on

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
let it unfreeze and so I just keep it on

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.810 
let it unfreeze and so I just keep it on
all<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.470> time<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.710> mean<00:01:20.010> that's<00:01:20.490> really<00:01:20.729> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
all the time I mean that's really the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.760 
all the time I mean that's really the
only<00:01:20.970> problem<00:01:21.540> what's<00:01:22.260> nice<00:01:22.410> about<00:01:22.440> this

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
only problem what's nice about this

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.680 
only problem what's nice about this
radio<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.460> does<00:01:23.580> have<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:24.630> does<00:01:24.690> scan

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
radio is that it does have it does scan

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.730 
radio is that it does have it does scan
it<00:01:27.690> has<00:01:29.300> it<00:01:30.300> has<00:01:30.330> whisper<00:01:30.930> mode<00:01:31.080> so<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.380> if

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
it has it has whisper mode so that if

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.410 
it has it has whisper mode so that if
you're<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.490> police<00:01:32.760> officer<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.300> you're

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
you're a police officer and you're

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.730 
you're a police officer and you're
undercover<00:01:33.860> you<00:01:34.860> can

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.440 

you<00:01:39.220> can<00:01:39.369> set<00:01:39.549> it<00:01:39.640> to<00:01:39.670> whisper<00:01:40.000> mode<00:01:40.119> so<00:01:40.299> all

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
you can set it to whisper mode so all

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.539 
you can set it to whisper mode so all
you<00:01:40.570> have<00:01:40.659> to<00:01:40.720> do<00:01:40.840> is<00:01:40.960> whisper<00:01:41.409> and<00:01:41.710> the

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
you have to do is whisper and the

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.300 
you have to do is whisper and the
microphone<00:01:43.030> will<00:01:43.540> actually<00:01:43.960> pick<00:01:44.829> up<00:01:45.040> your

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
microphone will actually pick up your

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.090 
microphone will actually pick up your
whispering<00:01:45.759> better<00:01:46.360> than<00:01:46.899> it<00:01:47.350> would<00:01:47.649> if<00:01:47.890> it

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
whispering better than it would if it

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.969 
whispering better than it would if it
was<00:01:48.220> in<00:01:48.399> normal<00:01:48.909> mode<00:01:49.030> so<00:01:49.630> long<00:01:49.899> it<00:01:50.200> has<00:01:50.350> DTMF

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
was in normal mode so long it has DTMF

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.469 
was in normal mode so long it has DTMF
mode<00:01:51.250> so<00:01:51.460> if<00:01:51.520> you<00:01:51.610> have<00:01:51.700> a<00:01:51.759> telephone<00:01:52.119> patch

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
mode so if you have a telephone patch

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.300 
mode so if you have a telephone patch
you<00:01:53.200> could<00:01:53.320> actually<00:01:53.470> make<00:01:53.740> a<00:01:53.799> call<00:01:54.100> on<00:01:54.130> the

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
you could actually make a call on the

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.620 
you could actually make a call on the
radio<00:01:54.340> and<00:01:54.640> what's<00:01:54.789> cool<00:01:55.000> about<00:01:55.030> it<00:01:55.330> is<00:01:55.450> let's

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
radio and what's cool about it is let's

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:03.779 
radio and what's cool about it is let's
see<00:01:55.840> if<00:01:56.080> I<00:01:56.200> dialed<00:01:56.500> my<00:01:57.360> cell<00:01:58.360> phone<00:01:58.570> number<00:02:02.789> and

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
see if I dialed my cell phone number and

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:05.850 
see if I dialed my cell phone number and
I<00:02:04.000> hit<00:02:04.210> thing<00:02:04.600> it<00:02:04.750> actually<00:02:04.899> has<00:02:05.229> a<00:02:05.259> call<00:02:05.590> time

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
I hit thing it actually has a call time

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.009
