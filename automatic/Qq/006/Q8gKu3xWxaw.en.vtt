00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:02.949 

so<00:00:01.079> we've<00:00:01.199> got<00:00:01.380> two<00:00:01.650> different<00:00:01.770> kinds<00:00:02.159> of

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:02.959 
so we've got two different kinds of

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:06.829 
so we've got two different kinds of
fiber<00:00:03.959> here<00:00:04.650> we've<00:00:05.220> got<00:00:05.430> a<00:00:05.839> chopped-up

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
fiber here we've got a chopped-up

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.339 
fiber here we've got a chopped-up
matting<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:07.680> then<00:00:08.220> like<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.460> fabric<00:00:09.290> okay<00:00:10.290> so

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
matting and then like a fabric okay so

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.009 
matting and then like a fabric okay so
these<00:00:10.650> are<00:00:10.860> they<00:00:11.309> both<00:00:11.660> accomplish<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.840> same

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
these are they both accomplish the same

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.709 
these are they both accomplish the same
thing<00:00:13.380> they<00:00:13.889> make<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.370> they<00:00:15.059> make<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.360> resin

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
thing they make it they make the resin

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.510 
thing they make it they make the resin
more<00:00:15.929> rigid<00:00:16.410> but<00:00:16.949> obviously<00:00:17.310> they're<00:00:17.490> very

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
more rigid but obviously they're very

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.980 
more rigid but obviously they're very
different<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.150> there's<00:00:18.270> advantages<00:00:18.630> and

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
different and there's advantages and

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.290 
different and there's advantages and
disadvantages<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.920> both<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.820> long<00:00:20.970> story

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
disadvantages to both the long story

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.109 
disadvantages to both the long story
short<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:22.020> like<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.830> use<00:00:22.949> this<00:00:23.220> stuff<00:00:23.490> when

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
short is I like to use this stuff when

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.839 
short is I like to use this stuff when
I'm<00:00:24.240> covering<00:00:24.720> like<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.900> large<00:00:25.260> flat<00:00:25.890> area<00:00:26.430> or

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
I'm covering like a large flat area or

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.839 
I'm covering like a large flat area or
like<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.210> large<00:00:27.980> slightly<00:00:28.980> curved<00:00:29.369> area

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
like a large slightly curved area

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.569 
like a large slightly curved area
without<00:00:30.660> much<00:00:30.900> detail<00:00:31.189> because<00:00:32.189> what<00:00:32.340> tends

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
without much detail because what tends

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.250 
without much detail because what tends
to<00:00:32.669> happen<00:00:32.759> with<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.570> when<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.230> gets

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
to happen with this is when it gets

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.410 
to happen with this is when it gets
pinched<00:00:34.920> up<00:00:35.100> like<00:00:35.280> if<00:00:35.430> you're<00:00:35.550> trying<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.910> get

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
pinched up like if you're trying to get

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.110 
pinched up like if you're trying to get
into<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.750> tiny<00:00:37.140> detail<00:00:37.739> you'll<00:00:38.489> end<00:00:38.730> up<00:00:38.850> with<00:00:39.059> a

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
into a tiny detail you'll end up with a

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.510 
into a tiny detail you'll end up with a
weird<00:00:39.480> kind<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.870> bunching<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.710> air<00:00:41.070> bubbles

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
weird kind of bunching and air bubbles

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.200 
weird kind of bunching and air bubbles
so<00:00:42.260> the<00:00:43.260> contrary<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.280> stuff<00:00:44.610> which<00:00:45.180> is

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
so the contrary is this stuff which is

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.610 
so the contrary is this stuff which is
great<00:00:45.510> because<00:00:45.750> what<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.050> can<00:00:46.079> do<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.410> as

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
great because what you can do is as

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.830 
great because what you can do is as
you're<00:00:46.860> putting<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.340> into<00:00:47.520> your<00:00:47.700> form<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.660> can

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
you're putting it into your form you can

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.979 
you're putting it into your form you can
pull<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.260> apart<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.950> make<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:50.969> fit<00:00:51.180> into<00:00:51.449> all

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
pull it apart and make it fit into all

00:00:51.989 --> 00:01:02.689 
pull it apart and make it fit into all
kinds<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.469> complex<00:00:52.949> shapes<00:01:00.350> west<00:01:01.350> systems<00:01:02.070> one

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
kinds of complex shapes west systems one

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.310 
kinds of complex shapes west systems one
of<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.910> things<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.420> really<00:01:03.690> like<00:01:03.840> about<00:01:03.870> this

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
of the things I really like about this

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.730 
of the things I really like about this
resin<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.460> pump<00:01:05.960> tells<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.140> how<00:01:07.320> much<00:01:07.500> to

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
resin is the pump tells you how much to

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.600 
resin is the pump tells you how much to
mix<00:01:07.979> by<00:01:08.570> so<00:01:09.570> one<00:01:09.840> squirt<00:01:10.260> from<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.680> pump<00:01:10.950> plus

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
mix by so one squirt from this pump plus

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.670 
mix by so one squirt from this pump plus
one<00:01:11.880> squared<00:01:12.299> from<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.689> pump<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.229> you've

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
one squared from this pump and you've

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.550 
one squared from this pump and you've
got<00:01:13.890> your<00:01:14.100> proper<00:01:14.760> amounts<00:01:15.380> knowing<00:01:16.380> what<00:01:16.530> I

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
got your proper amounts knowing what I

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:34.820 
got your proper amounts knowing what I
know<00:01:16.680> about<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.100> stuff<00:01:17.159> I'll<00:01:17.490> do<00:01:17.670> two<00:01:17.880> pumps

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.410 

I'm<00:01:35.830> going<00:01:36.010> to<00:01:36.070> use<00:01:36.160> my<00:01:36.310> painter<00:01:36.790> again<00:01:37.120> we're

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
I'm going to use my painter again we're

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.030 
I'm going to use my painter again we're
going<00:01:37.570> to<00:01:37.630> stir<00:01:37.840> it<00:01:37.960> up<00:01:38.050> the<00:01:38.440> color<00:01:38.740> actually

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
going to stir it up the color actually

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.890 
going to stir it up the color actually
changed<00:01:39.640> a<00:01:39.729> little<00:01:39.940> bit<00:01:40.150> it<00:01:40.300> turns<00:01:40.570> a<00:01:40.690> little

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
changed a little bit it turns a little

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.510 
changed a little bit it turns a little
bit<00:01:40.990> of<00:01:41.080> a<00:01:41.170> darker<00:01:41.590> amber<00:01:43.740> okay<00:01:44.740> so<00:01:45.040> the<00:01:45.400> only

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
bit of a darker amber okay so the only

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.900 
bit of a darker amber okay so the only
real<00:01:45.820> note<00:01:46.150> I<00:01:46.330> have<00:01:46.570> on<00:01:46.750> technique<00:01:47.320> for<00:01:47.650> this

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
real note I have on technique for this

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.109 
real note I have on technique for this
and<00:01:49.619> I've<00:01:50.619> noticed<00:01:50.920> that<00:01:51.130> laying<00:01:51.490> fiberglass

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
and I've noticed that laying fiberglass

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.930 
and I've noticed that laying fiberglass
tends<00:01:52.479> to<00:01:52.660> be<00:01:52.750> a<00:01:52.780> very<00:01:53.490> individualistic<00:01:54.490> thing

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
tends to be a very individualistic thing

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.120 
tends to be a very individualistic thing
people<00:01:55.300> do<00:01:55.420> it<00:01:55.510> differently<00:01:55.900> what<00:01:56.650> I<00:01:56.680> like<00:01:56.979> to

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
people do it differently what I like to

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.650 
people do it differently what I like to
do<00:01:57.250> is<00:01:57.430> brush<00:01:57.790> in<00:01:58.060> a<00:01:58.360> coat<00:01:59.020> of<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.500> resin<00:02:00.250> first

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
do is brush in a coat of the resin first

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.290 
do is brush in a coat of the resin first
then<00:02:01.660> I<00:02:01.990> put<00:02:02.350> fiber<00:02:02.680> in<00:02:02.950> then<00:02:03.520> I<00:02:03.670> Pat<00:02:04.030> it<00:02:04.180> all

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
then I put fiber in then I Pat it all

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.210 
then I put fiber in then I Pat it all
down<00:02:04.479> with<00:02:04.720> another<00:02:04.990> coat<00:02:05.259> so<00:02:05.860> I'll<00:02:05.950> start

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
down with another coat so I'll start

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:13.800 
down with another coat so I'll start
with<00:02:06.280> a<00:02:06.759> little<00:02:07.540> coat<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:09.369> resin<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:13.540> just

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
with a little coat of resin that just

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.790 
with a little coat of resin that just
popped<00:02:14.170> in<00:02:14.320> there<00:02:14.500> get<00:02:14.800> it<00:02:14.890> up<00:02:14.980> in<00:02:15.160> there<00:02:15.340> like

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
popped in there get it up in there like

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.690 
popped in there get it up in there like
that<00:02:18.420> okay<00:02:19.420> so<00:02:19.450> there's<00:02:19.959> a<00:02:20.110> nice<00:02:20.530> thick<00:02:21.100> wet

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
that okay so there's a nice thick wet

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.600 
that okay so there's a nice thick wet
coat<00:02:22.770> of<00:02:23.770> resin<00:02:24.430> on<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.700> inside<00:02:25.330> and<00:02:25.830> now<00:02:26.830> for

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
coat of resin on the inside and now for

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.390 
coat of resin on the inside and now for
this<00:02:27.760> particular<00:02:28.300> one<00:02:28.420> I'm<00:02:28.690> going<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:28.900> go<00:02:29.050> with

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
this particular one I'm going to go with

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.460 
this particular one I'm going to go with
the<00:02:30.400> chop<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:31.090> what<00:02:31.299> I<00:02:31.330> like<00:02:31.600> to<00:02:31.750> do<00:02:31.870> is<00:02:32.080> I<00:02:32.200> pull

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
the chop and what I like to do is I pull

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.620 
the chop and what I like to do is I pull
it<00:02:32.560> apart<00:02:32.620> a<00:02:32.920> little<00:02:32.950> bit<00:02:33.370> just<00:02:34.120> to<00:02:34.209> break<00:02:34.480> up

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
it apart a little bit just to break up

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.509 
it apart a little bit just to break up
the<00:02:34.780> edges<00:02:35.110> make<00:02:35.320> it<00:02:35.440> a<00:02:35.500> little<00:02:35.709> more<00:02:35.920> flexible

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
the edges make it a little more flexible

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.130 
the edges make it a little more flexible
because<00:02:36.850> we've<00:02:36.970> got<00:02:37.090> a<00:02:37.120> lot<00:02:37.269> of<00:02:37.299> curves<00:02:37.810> and

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
because we've got a lot of curves and

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.699 
because we've got a lot of curves and
detail<00:02:39.070> inside<00:02:39.760> so<00:02:40.690> this<00:02:40.840> will<00:02:40.900> need<00:02:41.230> to<00:02:41.380> shape

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
detail inside so this will need to shape

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:48.840 
detail inside so this will need to shape
too<00:02:42.959> okay<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:46.530> we<00:02:47.530> want<00:02:47.769> it<00:02:47.890> up<00:02:48.100> over<00:02:48.370> the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
too okay and we want it up over the

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:55.460 
too okay and we want it up over the
edges<00:02:49.269> so<00:02:49.480> I'll<00:02:49.540> put<00:02:49.780> this<00:02:49.930> first<00:02:50.230> piece<00:02:50.620> in

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:02.910 

you'll<00:02:56.470> see<00:02:56.820> there<00:02:57.820> you'll<00:02:58.209> see<00:02:59.760> you'll<00:03:00.760> think

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
you'll see there you'll see you'll think

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.280 
you'll see there you'll see you'll think
okay<00:03:03.920> now<00:03:04.250> we<00:03:04.310> repeat<00:03:04.760> that<00:03:04.990> fill<00:03:05.990> the<00:03:06.140> whole

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
okay now we repeat that fill the whole

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.580 
okay now we repeat that fill the whole
thing<00:03:06.320> up<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:06.770> overlapping<00:03:07.490> edges<00:03:08.090> is<00:03:08.270> good

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.850 

and<00:03:12.590> they<00:03:12.710> get<00:03:12.920> in<00:03:13.100> the<00:03:13.250> little<00:03:13.430> wee<00:03:13.730> bits<00:03:14.860> so

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
and they get in the little wee bits so

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.930 
and they get in the little wee bits so
you<00:03:15.920> can<00:03:16.070> see<00:03:16.220> how<00:03:16.370> I'm<00:03:16.460> kind<00:03:16.730> of<00:03:16.760> like

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
you can see how I'm kind of like

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.910 
you can see how I'm kind of like
depending<00:03:17.690> on<00:03:17.780> where<00:03:18.080> I'm<00:03:18.230> putting<00:03:18.500> it

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
depending on where I'm putting it

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.650 
depending on where I'm putting it
will<00:03:19.130> sort<00:03:19.370> of<00:03:19.460> dictate<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:20.030> size<00:03:20.300> of<00:03:20.570> the

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
will sort of dictate the size of the

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.200 
will sort of dictate the size of the
strip<00:03:20.900> I<00:03:21.050> use<00:03:21.290> and<00:03:21.620> this<00:03:22.580> stuff<00:03:22.790> like<00:03:22.940> I've<00:03:23.090> got

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
strip I use and this stuff like I've got

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:24.130 
strip I use and this stuff like I've got
a<00:03:23.240> big<00:03:23.390> strip<00:03:23.690> here

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
a big strip here

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.890 
a big strip here
I'll<00:03:24.230> just<00:03:24.520> see<00:03:25.520> I'm<00:03:25.700> crazy<00:03:26.060> man<00:03:26.510> see<00:03:26.750> how<00:03:26.840> I

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
I'll just see I'm crazy man see how I

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.270 
I'll just see I'm crazy man see how I
did<00:03:27.110> that<00:03:27.230> you<00:03:27.650> crazy

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
did that you crazy

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.370 
did that you crazy
it's<00:03:28.460> wild<00:03:29.000> crazy<00:03:29.330> with<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.720> fiberglass<00:03:30.080> it's

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
it's wild crazy with the fiberglass it's

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.440 
it's wild crazy with the fiberglass it's
a<00:03:30.470> madhouse<00:03:30.740> in<00:03:30.950> here<00:03:31.250> that's<00:03:32.180> some<00:03:32.330> pretty

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
a madhouse in here that's some pretty

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.540 
a madhouse in here that's some pretty
good<00:03:32.570> coverage<00:03:35.410> so<00:03:36.410> I'm<00:03:36.680> going<00:03:36.830> to<00:03:36.860> go<00:03:37.070> in<00:03:37.250> with

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
good coverage so I'm going to go in with

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.940 
good coverage so I'm going to go in with
the<00:03:37.730> resin<00:03:38.120> again<00:03:38.360> what<00:03:39.290> you'll<00:03:39.410> see<00:03:39.770> how<00:03:39.890> the

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
the resin again what you'll see how the

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.070 
the resin again what you'll see how the
fiber<00:03:40.340> sort<00:03:40.880> of<00:03:40.970> disappears<00:03:41.450> you<00:03:41.930> don't

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
fiber sort of disappears you don't

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.110 
fiber sort of disappears you don't
really<00:03:42.170> see<00:03:42.380> white<00:03:42.620> that's<00:03:43.550> what<00:03:43.790> you<00:03:43.910> want

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
really see white that's what you want

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.860 
really see white that's what you want
everywhere<00:03:44.720> you<00:03:44.930> don't<00:03:45.080> want<00:03:45.320> to<00:03:45.410> see<00:03:45.560> fibers

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
everywhere you don't want to see fibers

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.360 
everywhere you don't want to see fibers
the<00:03:47.870> great<00:03:48.080> thing<00:03:48.290> is<00:03:48.440> if<00:03:48.650> we<00:03:48.740> run<00:03:48.980> out<00:03:49.190> of

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
the great thing is if we run out of

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.860 
the great thing is if we run out of
resin<00:03:49.730> I<00:03:49.850> can<00:03:50.060> just<00:03:50.240> mix<00:03:50.390> more<00:03:52.630> don't<00:03:53.630> need<00:03:53.780> to

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
resin I can just mix more don't need to

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.790 
resin I can just mix more don't need to
be<00:03:54.020> super<00:03:55.150> thrifty<00:03:56.150> how<00:03:56.840> many<00:03:56.990> layers<00:03:57.650> of

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
be super thrifty how many layers of

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.820 
be super thrifty how many layers of
fibers<00:03:58.370> you<00:03:58.490> see<00:03:58.670> us<00:03:59.170> that<00:04:00.170> is<00:04:00.470> a<00:04:00.500> great

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
fibers you see us that is a great

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.950 
fibers you see us that is a great
question<00:04:01.070> I<00:04:01.520> think<00:04:02.150> for<00:04:02.330> something<00:04:02.630> like<00:04:02.780> this

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
question I think for something like this

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.890 
question I think for something like this
one<00:04:03.200> layer<00:04:03.410> should<00:04:03.650> be<00:04:03.710> plenty<00:04:04.720> one<00:04:05.720> of<00:04:05.840> the

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
one layer should be plenty one of the

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.330 
one layer should be plenty one of the
things<00:04:06.050> I've<00:04:06.200> mentioned<00:04:06.650> in<00:04:06.739> the<00:04:06.770> past<00:04:07.070> about

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
things I've mentioned in the past about

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.400 
things I've mentioned in the past about
these<00:04:07.580> particular<00:04:08.239> pieces<00:04:08.420> is<00:04:08.870> they're<00:04:09.260> not

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
these particular pieces is they're not

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.190 
these particular pieces is they're not
load-bearing<00:04:10.090> or<00:04:11.090> interlocking<00:04:11.900> like<00:04:12.080> you

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
load-bearing or interlocking like you

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.990 
load-bearing or interlocking like you
don't<00:04:12.380> really<00:04:12.590> need<00:04:12.890> any<00:04:12.950> strength<00:04:13.520> all<00:04:13.760> they

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
don't really need any strength all they

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.190 
don't really need any strength all they
really<00:04:14.209> need<00:04:14.360> to<00:04:14.450> do<00:04:14.570> is<00:04:14.660> maintain<00:04:14.810> their

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
really need to do is maintain their

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.990 
really need to do is maintain their
shape<00:04:15.230> these<00:04:16.160> aren't<00:04:16.459> intended<00:04:16.730> as

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
shape these aren't intended as

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.430 
shape these aren't intended as
structural<00:04:17.630> pieces<00:04:17.959> they're<00:04:18.140> purely

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
structural pieces they're purely

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:25.070 
structural pieces they're purely
decorative

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:38.950 

okay

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.020 

this<00:04:39.590> is<00:04:39.740> the<00:04:39.830> one<00:04:39.979> I<00:04:40.009> just<00:04:40.100> finished<00:04:40.729> you<00:04:40.940> can

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
this is the one I just finished you can

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.700 
this is the one I just finished you can
see<00:04:41.240> there's<00:04:41.449> really<00:04:41.479> no<00:04:41.810> white<00:04:42.050> parts<00:04:42.530> and

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
see there's really no white parts and

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.930 
see there's really no white parts and
that's<00:04:42.770> when<00:04:43.039> you<00:04:43.130> know<00:04:43.250> it's<00:04:43.460> bubbling<00:04:43.789> up

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
that's when you know it's bubbling up

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.990 
that's when you know it's bubbling up
from<00:04:44.120> one<00:04:45.110> of<00:04:45.229> the<00:04:45.289> details<00:04:45.650> underneath<00:04:46.000> looks

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
from one of the details underneath looks

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.950 
from one of the details underneath looks
pretty<00:04:47.270> good<00:04:49.030> hope<00:04:50.030> there<00:04:50.330> is<00:04:50.449> a<00:04:50.479> little<00:04:50.780> bit

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
pretty good hope there is a little bit

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.920 
pretty good hope there is a little bit
right<00:04:51.199> there<00:04:51.789> so<00:04:52.789> what<00:04:52.940> I<00:04:53.000> can<00:04:53.090> do<00:04:53.419> is<00:04:53.660> dab<00:04:53.900> that

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
right there so what I can do is dab that

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.010 
right there so what I can do is dab that
down<00:04:54.470> a<00:04:54.500> little<00:04:54.680> bit<00:04:54.919> with<00:04:55.160> a<00:04:55.250> brush<00:04:55.520> we<00:04:56.020> put

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
down a little bit with a brush we put

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.710 
down a little bit with a brush we put
foot<00:04:57.199> foot<00:04:57.410> foot<00:05:00.580> done<00:05:01.580> with<00:05:01.729> this<00:05:01.849> one<00:05:02.090> now<00:05:02.660> we

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
foot foot foot done with this one now we

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.460 
foot foot foot done with this one now we
just<00:05:02.900> got<00:05:03.050> to<00:05:03.169> go<00:05:03.229> finish<00:05:03.530> the<00:05:03.650> restaurant

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
just got to go finish the restaurant

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.689 
just got to go finish the restaurant
it's<00:05:06.470> been<00:05:06.620> a<00:05:06.650> couple<00:05:06.830> hours<00:05:07.009> now<00:05:07.340> and<00:05:07.490> this<00:05:07.550> is

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:07.699 
it's been a couple hours now and this is

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:09.850 
it's been a couple hours now and this is
feeling<00:05:08.000> pretty<00:05:08.300> rigid<00:05:08.599> this<00:05:09.169> particular

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
feeling pretty rigid this particular

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.379 
feeling pretty rigid this particular
resin<00:05:10.220> usually<00:05:10.520> needs<00:05:10.699> to<00:05:10.729> overnight<00:05:11.030> to

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
resin usually needs to overnight to

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:13.150 
resin usually needs to overnight to
fully<00:05:11.660> cure<00:05:12.020> but<00:05:12.410> I<00:05:12.440> think<00:05:12.710> we're<00:05:12.830> at<00:05:12.889> a<00:05:12.919> point

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
fully cure but I think we're at a point

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.409 
fully cure but I think we're at a point
now<00:05:13.280> where<00:05:13.400> we<00:05:13.550> can<00:05:13.580> pull<00:05:13.910> it<00:05:13.970> out<00:05:14.000> just<00:05:14.090> take<00:05:14.360> a

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
now where we can pull it out just take a

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:30.370 
now where we can pull it out just take a
look<00:05:14.599> at<00:05:14.750> it<00:05:14.840> so<00:05:14.960> let's<00:05:15.020> do<00:05:15.410> that

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.950 

there's<00:05:31.040> no<00:05:31.250> real<00:05:31.520> approved<00:05:32.120> technique<00:05:32.750> for

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
there's no real approved technique for

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.400 
there's no real approved technique for
doing<00:05:33.110> this<00:05:33.350> I<00:05:33.560> just<00:05:33.590> like<00:05:33.890> to<00:05:34.010> take<00:05:34.220> my<00:05:34.370> time

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
doing this I just like to take my time

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:53.830 
doing this I just like to take my time
go<00:05:36.410> around<00:05:36.530> the<00:05:36.740> edges<00:05:37.070> first

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:00.409 

hmm<00:05:54.650> not<00:05:55.220> bad

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:02.549 

so<00:06:01.419> here<00:06:01.599> we<00:06:01.659> are<00:06:01.689> with<00:06:01.959> the<00:06:02.049> final<00:06:02.349> product

00:06:02.549 --> 00:06:02.559 
so here we are with the final product

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:04.349 
so here we are with the final product
it's<00:06:02.919> pretty<00:06:03.339> darn<00:06:03.549> good<00:06:03.759> with<00:06:03.909> a<00:06:03.969> couple

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:04.359 
it's pretty darn good with a couple

00:06:04.359 --> 00:06:06.419 
it's pretty darn good with a couple
little<00:06:04.659> flaws<00:06:04.929> but<00:06:05.679> nothing<00:06:06.009> you<00:06:06.099> wouldn't

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:06.429 
little flaws but nothing you wouldn't

00:06:06.429 --> 00:06:08.219 
little flaws but nothing you wouldn't
expect<00:06:06.639> from<00:06:06.909> a<00:06:07.149> project<00:06:07.389> like<00:06:07.719> this<00:06:07.779> let<00:06:08.199> me

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:08.229 
expect from a project like this let me

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:10.439 
expect from a project like this let me
show<00:06:08.319> you<00:06:08.559> over<00:06:08.799> here<00:06:08.979> this<00:06:09.909> is<00:06:10.029> where<00:06:10.179> I<00:06:10.209> brush

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:10.449 
show you over here this is where I brush

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:11.879 
show you over here this is where I brush
the<00:06:10.599> baby<00:06:10.779> powder<00:06:10.989> just<00:06:11.229> a<00:06:11.349> little<00:06:11.589> too<00:06:11.709> deep

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:11.889 
the baby powder just a little too deep

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:13.499 
the baby powder just a little too deep
in<00:06:12.039> the<00:06:12.129> mold<00:06:12.309> when<00:06:12.459> you<00:06:12.549> clear<00:06:12.789> it<00:06:12.879> out<00:06:12.969> you

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:13.509 
in the mold when you clear it out you

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:15.539 
in the mold when you clear it out you
can<00:06:13.689> see<00:06:13.719> it's<00:06:14.019> a<00:06:14.229> I<00:06:14.499> didn't<00:06:15.069> get<00:06:15.219> any<00:06:15.399> on

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:15.549 
can see it's a I didn't get any on

00:06:15.549 --> 00:06:17.159 
can see it's a I didn't get any on
Jellico<00:06:16.449> it<00:06:16.509> up<00:06:16.629> in<00:06:16.749> there<00:06:16.869> and<00:06:16.989> there's<00:06:17.109> a

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:17.169 
Jellico it up in there and there's a

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:19.049 
Jellico it up in there and there's a
couple<00:06:17.199> little<00:06:17.709> bubbles<00:06:18.009> down<00:06:18.219> here<00:06:18.519> but

00:06:19.049 --> 00:06:19.059 
couple little bubbles down here but

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:21.029 
couple little bubbles down here but
again<00:06:19.149> to<00:06:19.479> be<00:06:19.569> expected<00:06:20.139> for<00:06:20.349> for<00:06:20.709> something

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 
again to be expected for for something

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:23.249 
again to be expected for for something
of<00:06:21.129> this<00:06:21.249> complexity<00:06:21.879> overall<00:06:22.839> though<00:06:23.019> you

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:23.259 
of this complexity overall though you

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:24.929 
of this complexity overall though you
can<00:06:23.409> see<00:06:23.589> we<00:06:23.709> captured<00:06:24.129> the<00:06:24.219> detail<00:06:24.579> pretty

00:06:24.929 --> 00:06:24.939 
can see we captured the detail pretty

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:27.689 
can see we captured the detail pretty
darn<00:06:25.089> well<00:06:25.179> I<00:06:25.509> am<00:06:25.719> quite<00:06:26.079> happy<00:06:26.529> with<00:06:27.519> this

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 
pull we still obviously need to clean up
