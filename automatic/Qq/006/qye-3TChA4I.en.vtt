00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.540
 hours of the morning 7 you can 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.610
 fix on the internet how is your schedule with 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.439
 regarding the east schedule of the cdt as 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.939
 it corresponds not so as not to be playing 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.270
 when maybe the event did not start 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.979
 when the event has already finished the same 24 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.600
 but not only are we going to have this 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.909
 community mission on this occasion 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.799
 also part of the news mentions that 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.240
 from now until the date of 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.789
 debate launch fix what we're going to 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.289
 have new let's say rewards like 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.509
 battle gold packs missions 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.579
 extra community besides these badges 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.500
 thematized with what it is to pacify the 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.360
 exclusive wallpapers and a lot 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.189
 but as I already tell you the most 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.229
 important even for now and until 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.630
 we get one of these new missions 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.000
 community is to get in these three 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.920
 days 2000 million points playing the 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.720
 Russian game mode assault and for that 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.060
 we have the tortilla server squad 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.130
 I'll be leaving it down in what 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.239
 is the section of the description can 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.409
 enter there we will be trying 

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:53.909
 play with the tortilla boys 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.640
 squadron I do not put them in any 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.439
 let's say kind of progress of 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.700
 commitment but they're probably going to 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.380
 be taking a walk around here and but 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.539
 already and I will also be trying 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.920
 enter some days to record something of 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.179
 gameplay to be playing with you 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.149
 they are going to see people from the community 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:11.670
 pactÃ¡ndose a return and as I tell them 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.989
 2000 million points among all men 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.430
 I calculate that we can achieve it 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.560
 unlock a new map that we did not see 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.150
 previously in battery jalan and a 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.720
 new game mode that is very similar 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.390
 to Russian 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.250
 what is the version of rus but in base 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.020
 fiscal where the truth would be very 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.910
 thankful if we can unlock it is 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.920
 probably what mainly goes 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.020
 to play in that game although not yet 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.370
 we know everything and today while 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.080
 this video is coming out 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.390
 the new news about 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.860
 all the new modes and maps that will 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.750
 have to ratify it once 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.820
 leave the full game on March 17 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.200
 but as always I hope that there 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.030

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.430
 server play that we can record 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.960
 some games together and one more time 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.640
