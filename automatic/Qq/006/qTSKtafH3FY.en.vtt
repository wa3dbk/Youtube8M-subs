00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
then we're going to take a regular

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.350 
then we're going to take a regular
cookie<00:00:50.100> sheet<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.460> cover<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.210> with<00:00:51.270> aluminum

foil<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.710> where<00:00:52.890> we'll<00:00:53.070> put<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.579> hot

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
foil this is where we'll put the hot

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.139 
foil this is where we'll put the hot
fire<00:00:54.840> starter<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.649> cool<00:00:55.829> off<00:00:56.070> for<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:56.879> next

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
fire starter to cool off for this next

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.060 
fire starter to cool off for this next
step<00:00:57.480> which<00:00:57.750> consists<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.469> melting<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> wax

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
step which consists of melting the wax

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.029 
step which consists of melting the wax
and<00:00:59.640> dipping<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.660> cloth<00:01:00.870> into<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.440> I'd

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
and dipping the cloth into it I'd

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.670 
and dipping the cloth into it I'd
suggest<00:01:02.489> going<00:01:02.670> outside<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:04.080> really<00:01:04.439> don't

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
suggest going outside you really don't

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.980 
suggest going outside you really don't
want<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.979> spill<00:01:05.250> molten<00:01:06.000> wax<00:01:06.180> anywhere<00:01:06.840> it

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
want to spill molten wax anywhere it

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.890 
want to spill molten wax anywhere it
makes<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.380> tremendous<00:01:07.650> mess<00:01:08.540> you<00:01:09.540> don't<00:01:09.720> want

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
makes a tremendous mess you don't want

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.899 
makes a tremendous mess you don't want
to<00:01:09.990> use<00:01:10.170> too<00:01:10.439> high<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.890> heat<00:01:11.130> just<00:01:11.520> really

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
to use too high of a heat just really

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.480 
to use too high of a heat just really
enough<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.450> kind<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.020> reach<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.490> melting

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
enough to kind of reach the melting

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.749 
enough to kind of reach the melting
point<00:01:15.020> this<00:01:16.020> wax<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.560> completely<00:01:17.130> melted<00:01:17.369> now

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
point this wax is completely melted now

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.640 
point this wax is completely melted now
and<00:01:18.030> it's<00:01:18.119> starting<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.600> smoke<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.409> means

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
and it's starting to smoke so that means

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.190 
and it's starting to smoke so that means
it's<00:01:19.860> really<00:01:20.340> really<00:01:20.640> hot<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.479> next<00:01:21.810> step<00:01:21.990> is

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
it's really really hot the next step is

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.740 
it's really really hot the next step is
very<00:01:22.740> important<00:01:23.490> shut<00:01:24.210> off<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.720> heat<00:01:26.750> with

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
very important shut off the heat with

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.050 
very important shut off the heat with
the<00:01:27.930> heat<00:01:28.110> shut<00:01:28.380> off<00:01:28.560> I'm<00:01:29.400> going<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.700> throw<00:01:29.909> in

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.210 
I'll keep doing this until the wax cools
down<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:03.990> little<00:02:04.200> bit<00:02:04.380> then<00:02:04.560> I'll<00:02:04.680> reheat<00:02:05.160> it

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
down a little bit then I'll reheat it

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.850 
down a little bit then I'll reheat it
again<00:02:05.580> but<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.630> want<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.900> wax<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.410> be<00:02:07.500> really

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
again but you want to wax to be really

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.700 
again but you want to wax to be really
hot<00:02:08.100> so<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.210> it<00:02:09.330> infuses<00:02:09.869> everything<00:02:10.410> even

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
hot so that it infuses everything even

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.710 
hot so that it infuses everything even
these<00:02:10.800> little<00:02:11.130> bitty<00:02:11.310> threads<00:02:12.210> off<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.600> end

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
these little bitty threads off the end

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.710 
these little bitty threads off the end
will<00:02:12.930> light<00:02:13.110> really<00:02:13.440> well<00:02:14.150> it<00:02:15.150> doesn't<00:02:15.690> matter

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
will light really well it doesn't matter

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.180 
will light really well it doesn't matter
how<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.170> put<00:02:16.320> them<00:02:16.650> on<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:16.860> cookie<00:02:17.010> sheet

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
how you put them on the cookie sheet

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.470 
how you put them on the cookie sheet
just<00:02:17.700> stack<00:02:18.210> them<00:02:18.240> so<00:02:18.540> they<00:02:18.660> dry<00:02:20.300> so<00:02:21.300> here's

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
just stack them so they dry so here's

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.880 
just stack them so they dry so here's
what<00:02:21.600> our<00:02:21.630> batch<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:22.080> fire<00:02:22.290> starter<00:02:22.680> looks

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
what our batch of fire starter looks

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.290 
what our batch of fire starter looks
like<00:02:23.070> let's<00:02:23.820> see<00:02:24.000> if<00:02:24.090> it<00:02:24.240> works<00:02:25.880> this<00:02:26.880> piece<00:02:27.120> is

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
like let's see if it works this piece is

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.880 
like let's see if it works this piece is
pretty<00:02:27.540> frayed<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.050> it<00:02:28.170> should<00:02:28.410> light<00:02:28.620> pretty

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
pretty frayed so it should light pretty

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.780 
pretty frayed so it should light pretty
well<00:02:29.660> going<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:30.720> rip<00:02:30.870> off<00:02:31.050> a<00:02:31.080> piece<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.790> let's
