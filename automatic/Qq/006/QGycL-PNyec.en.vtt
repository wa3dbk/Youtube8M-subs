00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
gotten we're gonna cheat this style

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.419 
gotten we're gonna cheat this style
because<00:00:27.359> typically<00:00:27.990> it's<00:00:28.199> always<00:00:28.650> curled<00:00:29.220> up

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
because typically it's always curled up

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.279 
because typically it's always curled up
but<00:00:29.910> since<00:00:30.090> her<00:00:30.179> hair<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.510> really<00:00:30.660> long<00:00:31.080> it's

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
but since her hair is really long it's

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.380 
but since her hair is really long it's
gonna<00:00:31.380> take<00:00:31.500> forever<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.130> curl<00:00:32.279> all<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.790> so
