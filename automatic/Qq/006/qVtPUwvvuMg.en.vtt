00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 I'm okay with you, we're here. 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.790
 once again page forgiveness as 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.710
 Congress shell notice we like 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:22.529
 We have the video today, it 's the things that 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:23.880
 Everyone says they've heard the license to 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.070
 you fill out a form that the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:38.730
 last is this is always I'm with 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:41.190
 pencil in my hand and everything I do since 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.840
 then the average of the times the answer does not 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.840
 You pay me, it can be like this. 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.710
 The shot came to tell me that you stayed there. 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.260
 here I can leave the drawing but not 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:04.970
 I'm a teacher to teach nothing. 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:06.229
 I can see the biggest of the year in 60 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.270
 neighborhoods 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.440
 I can even teach you to draw more 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.509
 problem is that sometimes you teach 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.400
 people in the area closing their bag million 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:15.880
 from years in which you were button with 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.880
 edson 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:28.290
 The friend you draw on the computer in the 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.299
 Her role in drawing 2d made it there not 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:39.750
 Can I have a drink, not the two? 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:40.680
 at the same time when the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.689
 to draw 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.390
 after the question is quiet when you 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.770
 started to start drawing since I 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.539
 I understand people I was still 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:57.840
 with me when I was a baby alone. 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:02:00.679
 was on paper but also because 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.679
 you from zero 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:13.730
 the purpose of which you amputate that 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.590
 I would ask a designer's question 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.940
 You deserve what's this shit never 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.590
 I bought it say over 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.590
 maybe when I can small, etc 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:39.770
 How did you effect and train and left? 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:41.570
 yes sometimes it is nakagawa and even today in 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.520
 malta there is a gas br 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.620
 This is another cold question in the hand because 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.450
 for you did with yours in my case ever 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.640
 made easy course with the commitments of 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.170
 mangala from pt second but it was actually 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.120
 another friend was more teacher 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.040
 We 're having a chat with them. 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.110

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.000
 twins in the next video is not 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.610
 promotion will last another two weeks 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.650
 fight on the page as the edict offers 21 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.450
 to enter the free channel and there 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.910
 You 're not competing against the sensational 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.190
 reward last Sunday 28 in some 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.030
 skeptical since 2005 so that's it 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.030
 staff until the next
