00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
aesthetics and obviously you can see I

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.940 
aesthetics and obviously you can see I
wear<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.570> lot<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.809> prints<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.469> lot<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.649> color

wear a lot of prints and a lot of color

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.020 
wear a lot of prints and a lot of color
and<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.370> try<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.670> just<00:00:36.600> kind<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.590> express<00:00:38.070> myself

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
and I try to just kind of express myself

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.540 
and I try to just kind of express myself
through<00:00:39.840> fashion<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:40.980> it's<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.309> little<00:00:41.430> bit

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
through fashion so it's a little bit

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.000 
through fashion so it's a little bit
quirky

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.090 

I<00:00:45.719> think<00:00:46.719> that<00:00:46.989> in<00:00:47.140> terms<00:00:47.170> of<00:00:47.500> whether<00:00:47.739> you

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
I think that in terms of whether you

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.619 
I think that in terms of whether you
know<00:00:48.219> layering<00:00:48.519> is<00:00:48.850> always<00:00:49.120> important<00:00:49.539> but

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
know layering is always important but

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:51.299 
know layering is always important but
there's<00:00:49.809> a<00:00:49.870> few<00:00:50.079> key<00:00:50.289> pieces<00:00:50.530> that<00:00:50.920> I<00:00:50.949> always

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
there's a few key pieces that I always

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.119 
there's a few key pieces that I always
try<00:00:51.579> to<00:00:51.609> bring<00:00:52.359> with<00:00:52.510> me<00:00:52.539> just<00:00:53.109> in<00:00:53.199> case<00:00:53.260> the

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
try to bring with me just in case the

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.040 
try to bring with me just in case the
weather<00:00:54.280> is<00:00:54.609> crazy<00:00:55.120> because<00:00:55.329> obviously<00:00:55.570> from

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
weather is crazy because obviously from

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.750 
weather is crazy because obviously from
day<00:00:56.229> to<00:00:56.289> day<00:00:56.379> it's<00:00:56.620> constantly<00:00:57.100> changing<00:00:57.190> here
