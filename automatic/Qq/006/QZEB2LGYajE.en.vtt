00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
it's such a long long season so every

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.760 
it's such a long long season so every
year<00:01:28.930> you<00:01:28.990> try<00:01:29.290> and<00:01:29.500> modify<00:01:30.460> how<00:01:31.650> early<00:01:32.650> you

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770

start<00:01:33.009> and<00:01:33.280> how<00:01:33.430> much<00:01:33.579> training<00:01:33.820> you<00:01:34.000> do<00:01:34.240> so

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
start and how much training you do so

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:36.480 
start and how much training you do so
that<00:01:35.229> you<00:01:35.320> still<00:01:35.590> have<00:01:35.650> energy<00:01:36.100> by<00:01:36.220> the<00:01:36.280> time

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
that you still have energy by the time

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.789

you<00:01:36.579> get<00:01:36.700> to<00:01:36.759> the<00:01:36.909> first<00:01:37.150> race<00:01:37.360> and<00:01:37.630> you<00:01:38.530> feel

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
you get to the first race and you feel

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.069

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
so I mean I've been doing it twice a day

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.620 
so I mean I've been doing it twice a day
six<00:01:43.960> days<00:01:44.020> a<00:01:44.140> week<00:01:44.229> and<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:45.700> feel<00:01:45.970> fantastic

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
six days a week and I feel fantastic

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.510 
six days a week and I feel fantastic
especially<00:01:47.170> as<00:01:47.259> I<00:01:47.350> was<00:01:47.470> in<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.619> mountains<00:01:48.009> now

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
especially as I was in the mountains now

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.270 
especially as I was in the mountains now
come<00:01:48.790> down<00:01:48.990> down<00:01:49.990> back<00:01:50.290> to<00:01:50.500> kind<00:01:50.860> of<00:01:50.950> sea<00:01:51.130> level

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
come down down back to kind of sea level

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.609 
come down down back to kind of sea level
it's<00:01:52.240> so<00:01:52.689> much<00:01:52.840> easier<00:01:52.869> to<00:01:53.229> breathe<00:01:53.380> down<00:01:53.560> here

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
it's so much easier to breathe down here

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.499 
it's so much easier to breathe down here

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
to be racing him within this year and I

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.420 
to be racing him within this year and I
think<00:02:50.170> that's<00:02:50.380> obviously<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.770> target<00:02:51.220> for

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
think that's obviously the target for

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.030 
think that's obviously the target for
yourself<00:02:52.030> in<00:02:52.180> Mercedes<00:02:52.600> I<00:02:52.810> think<00:02:53.440> just<00:02:53.680> take

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
yourself in Mercedes I think just take

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.560 
yourself in Mercedes I think just take
it<00:02:54.160> one<00:02:54.310> step<00:02:54.340> at<00:02:54.580> a<00:02:54.730> time<00:02:54.760> you<00:02:54.970> know<00:02:55.180> we<00:02:55.360> got<00:02:55.480> to
