00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.929
 here we have a respect this spectrum represents a television signal 

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:13.279
 to make it 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:18.900
 we see the mind two carriers a carrier that is modulated in attitude 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.980
 g efe on the left side 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.730
 and another that will be mounted between countries is the carrier of April 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:27.080
 g 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.750
 these hundred carrier things on a television channel that occupied a width 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.760
 of band 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.270
 personally blind between 12 today 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.269
 Your carrier dedicated to my nation 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:40.160
 color un 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.330
 we are going to accept lessons these signs 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.850
 in this case the measure 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.900
 the frequency of the video carrier 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.620
 in this case we see that the mark to the farc train marks me 657 points 23 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.660
 medals 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.620
 this is a brand that this one 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.950
 what can be improved by using a meter some annexes of 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.270
 spectrum bring an integrated counter 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.420
 that in this case I'm going to change the brand type abused frequency counter 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.230
 p I admit it then the signal on a bit slower the sweep why then 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.260
 is doing a frequency calculation 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.410
 i in theory should be 657 points 25 merchants 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.050
 this case the attendance of seven points 24 9 2 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:27.810
 the race 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.730
 this one 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.820
 in prison 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.480
 we can also enable the difference hello this brand 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.550
 ee ponce ee the marks later we put delta 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.580
 i the automatic environment that of its autistic spectrum detecting the 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.020
 next vico that would be the signal 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.600
 April and the difference between the video and audio signal 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.520
 as mythical fifth to four points 53 tolls 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.590
 in theory then this four points and with internal benz mercedes 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.899
 consist of video 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:04.670
 and the region 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.440
 now yes percent we want to modulate these signals we can do it 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.519
 in that aspect can world modulate audio from the amdc 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:19.139
 and in this case they are not helped in the preparation of this map to identify the 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.049
 signal 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.079
 the one we have this month aspect do not have the integrated voice many do not 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:27.169
 they have because it is from him the motion is a 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:31.579
 is a device that generates a lot of electromagnetic noise, so many times 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:32.409
 they put 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:33.519
 out 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.219
 some headphones or with the speakers in this case 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:37.429
 is it other 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:40.429
 We are going to put the standard mark 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:45.159
 we select percent and next peak 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.289
 in the brand 

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:49.609
 and it takes me to the carrier of 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.039
 for Baptist 

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:54.039
 We make a demonstration of faith 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.289
 you may have to adjust the frequency of the brand slightly 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:04.889
 so that it is clearly stated 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.869
 and here we are correctly the frequencies of 

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:10.829
 percent of adrián boots 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:11.790
 this accident 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.180
 6 62 points 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.180
 66 and state yon alavés 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:21.999
 this will not be the head of list in the general 

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:25.369
 the three accused to pay the debt of the companies 

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:26.809
 that's 

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:28.649
 if not 

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:33.170
 g now that he was expectant in the ability to select efe 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.999
 the percent channels 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:37.149
 telling him that canada we want to see 

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:38.589
 p enda 

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:41.869
 in the presented setting so the steps are 

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:43.479
 the portal bank 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:47.719
 percent in some injuries by television channel then he asks me 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:50.759
 what kind are state television 

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:54.709
 in the two of us we are on the border with the United States they are lent 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.779
 we use the standard of the united states to the air 

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:00.279
 then we select that band 

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:05.469
 and then it tells me that we are on the channel ugarteche efe on channel 45 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:09.059
 we can see other channels for example ee 

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:13.429
 we are going to change channel + to chile we want to see channel 32 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:19.379
 and here we will see in channel percent and italy 

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:24.020
 the digital channel will continue in the analog channel because the use of the spectrum of 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.479
 more efficient way 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:30.050
 that is to say that in the three bridges it is transmitting therefore high definition 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.059
 and digital audio information in several languages 

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:39.349
 and then this one in this case that is very particular we are in contrast 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:42.879
 existing digital channels with analog channels 

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:45.360
 the right part in its analog channel 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.710
 and in the center skin in its digital channel 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.520
 and another that we can do is for example let's change frequency 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.749
 let's see another channel 

00:04:54.749 --> 00:05:00.389
 this is a totally digital channel dsb some its carrier a very weak channel 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.409
 from the right 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:03.699
 It was bad 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:08.100
 I hope that as you can see, you have highlighted this spectrum William Hague 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.550
 the head of the art 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.259
 porsche psalmist rent the television series because apparently the area 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:14.490
 child's head by 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.199
 of the first time 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:20.809
 that the experts arrive before there is a lot of noise that filters out of other 

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:25.440
 signs this is not that well then fluid also that comes from the 

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:26.219
 space 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:29.009
 and what this can commit 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.009
 that his accomplices is an environment 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.150
 I have already shared that video and audio signals are transmitted 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:41.460
 of cellular ee that harmonic third parties dating 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.229
 they are affected sometimes and a lot of noise is generated 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:47.569
 same device that is generating a certain level 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:50.650
 that you can also see the lack of naptas aspect 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:51.220
 thank you
