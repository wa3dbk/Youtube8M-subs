00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.080
 he comes to greet all his friends how 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.340
 are you going I hope you go very 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.130
 very well today we end up 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.470
 for new mode test for a 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.320
 machine that is rather nice and 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.220
 not even bad at all it's about the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.210
 jaguar class 960 so you are 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.750
 many presented declared gouardo 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:36.059
 1960-1980 of the 860 that you represent 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.670
 we know if it has nothing to do 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.550
 it's different there are options 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.620
 who are not bad at all I can you 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.480
 show that so she is equipped so 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.180
 it is a pack obviously to extract 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.460
 who is equipped so the pack is equipped 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.399
 years old blades no longer dare this anymore 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.840
 chopped off 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:01:05.400
 so kemper so the 360 plus so I can 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:13.229
 show you that so that's so so the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:18.000
 jaguar class 960 that goes at a speed 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:20.070
 maximum of 40 km hour and that costs 320 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.939
 400 thousand euros pretty much 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:29.130
 corner and the cut is here so the 360 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.450
 more than he does not put the length 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.880
 in any case I have to do around 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.070
 of 7 neutral obviously if you 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.960
 want another cup class bath 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.040
 do not hesitate to download them from 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.750
 other machines because it 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.189
 machines with for example 1,980 that I have 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.120
 already presented there was a broken cup 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:52.920
 with an orbis class 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:54.660
 blood so if you want to have a 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.160
 cut breaks with this march victim n 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.110
 feel free to take it 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.340
 so level outside it is rather 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.480
 not bad done especially of the ariege 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.520
 really very very beautiful 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:07.290
 a pretty pretty machine not of 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.680
 outside but also from the inside 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.540
 go into the cua and look at a small 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.580
 little when I go forward and that when I 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.790
 backward bnl the breaths joystick that 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.440
 move here so it's pretty good 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.240
 the anti a little mobile there so that's 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.480
 rather well done so you press 19 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.590
 time on everything is there the machine starts 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:31.440
 so she rather pretty pretty so 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:34.970
 but beacons are functional and the 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.970
 options displayed right away 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.260
 so I'm going off except cutting 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.080
 so the options that comes is when 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.390
 you press the key 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.810
 slash point comma crossing points of the 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.240
 point you have the two tons of 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.790
 small crusher there that works the kop 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.489
 gmg to extinguish a little more realism 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.470
 if I press I do not even touch 2 1 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:02.040
 you said me ottan rights or shares 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:05.220
 of warning and they will not even be able to 3 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.850
 the touch as many points you have the 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.570
 button 5 for the headlights of the nozzle 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.570
 shale trumps for big jobs 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.270
 auxerre cited for the name breakdown or 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.790
 otherwise you have the touch so the action 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:28.240
 functional so the key to for 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:30.790
 strip off the muse and he touch that is 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.950
 really very nice it touches 5 of the 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.959
 normal keyboard to lengthen the lawn 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.400
 so that's really nice so in 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:40.110
 function of your cutter bar you 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:45.220
 can lengthen the nozzle it's just 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:47.770
 super good so we find to me 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.160
 I love it so it's the options of the 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.290
 machine 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:55.080
 now we will go directly month 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.080
 per year if he is with so I unfold it 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.519
 and I accelerate the reaper 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.049
 so obviously he also desisted 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.950
 inside I forgot to tell you 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:17.400
 that if you can raise and abc the 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:20.160
 flying there you also have cameras 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.970
 so that's just super nice toga 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.710
 so these are the cameras available on 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.740
 a machine so there you can open 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.669
 his doors facing the native could open 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.190
 the door here 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:35.900
 you can open the little seat here 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.900
 so that's done it's nice too 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:43.099
 otherwise but I think I have everything 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:43.099
 frankly this part is super nice 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.810
 in addition with the camera he knows that the 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.550
 nozzle so that's great like that does not 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.550
 could only drive inside 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.430
 since you have the camera with the 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.860
 log so you know not to pay to 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:02.150
 So the sound side also set 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:04.760
 it's not bad either listened calmly 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:09.170
 I love him you open there and we will 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:12.950
 so of course we are the cut 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:17.720
 fully functional cutting bar 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:19.730
 I have a little bit too so with that 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.170
 do a little effect like that so that 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.650
 it's the cutterbar that does that our 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:26.180
 rooms 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:29.510
 if you put it orbis 902 the jaguar case 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.740
 bay would you be bound to tell each other 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.289
 football parent 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.599
 it will do another effect you see well 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:39.150
 that it oscillates very very well I have not 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:44.490
 too deadly - but fossil very very 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:45.419
 well what we see full of sight so that 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.880
 it's pretty good 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:49.560
 so that's so if you liked the 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:53.840
 video do not hesitate to put a small 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.840
