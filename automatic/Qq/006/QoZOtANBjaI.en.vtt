and let's go ahead and jump in

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.710 
and let's go ahead and jump in
everything<00:00:23.490> already<00:00:24.150> so<00:00:24.300> I'm<00:00:24.390> just<00:00:24.570> going<00:00:24.689> to

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
everything already so I'm just going to

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.630 
everything already so I'm just going to
start<00:00:24.990> off<00:00:25.080> by<00:00:25.109> making<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.619> hand<00:00:25.920> scrub<00:00:26.220> first

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
start off by making the hand scrub first

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.029 
start off by making the hand scrub first
and<00:00:27.000> I'm<00:00:27.180> just<00:00:27.390> going<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.630> put<00:00:27.869> two<00:00:28.500> spoonfuls

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
and I'm just going to put two spoonfuls

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.070 
and I'm just going to put two spoonfuls
of<00:00:29.460> sugar<00:00:29.519> into<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.240> bowl<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.720> these

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
of sugar into a bowl and these

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.630 
of sugar into a bowl and these
measurements<00:00:31.619> don't<00:00:31.769> have<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.130> be<00:00:32.250> exact

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
measurements don't have to be exact

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.150 
measurements don't have to be exact
that's<00:00:32.850> probably<00:00:33.329> about<00:00:33.630> two<00:00:34.260> tablespoons

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
that's probably about two tablespoons

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.459 
that's probably about two tablespoons
then<00:00:35.700> I'm<00:00:36.000> going<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.300> add<00:00:36.450> in<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.840> little<00:00:37.050> bit<00:00:37.320> of

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
then I'm going to add in a little bit of

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.979 
then I'm going to add in a little bit of
olive<00:00:37.860> oil<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.550> again<00:00:38.640> these<00:00:39.420> measurements

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
olive oil and again these measurements

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.780 
olive oil and again these measurements
don't<00:00:40.200> have<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.469> be<00:00:40.590> exact<00:00:40.980> just<00:00:41.100> kind<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.520> eye

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
don't have to be exact just kind of eye

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.700 
don't have to be exact just kind of eye
it<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.390> then<00:00:42.899> just<00:00:43.110> mix<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.410> all<00:00:43.530> together

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
it and then just mix it all together

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.729 
it and then just mix it all together
until<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.670> are<00:00:44.850> left<00:00:45.059> with<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.600> thick<00:00:46.079> liquidy

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
until you are left with a thick liquidy

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.100 
until you are left with a thick liquidy
consistency<00:00:46.789> like<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.719> don't<00:00:48.840> want<00:00:49.020> it

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
consistency like this you don't want it

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.020 
consistency like this you don't want it
to<00:00:49.230> be<00:00:49.350> too<00:00:49.590> runny<00:00:49.890> but<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.460> don't<00:00:50.640> want<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.910> to

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
to be too runny but you don't want it to

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.150 
to be too runny but you don't want it to
be<00:00:51.120> too<00:00:51.360> thick<00:00:51.719> either<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.469> I've<00:00:52.739> set<00:00:53.039> the

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
be too thick either so I've set the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.680 
be too thick either so I've set the
scrub<00:00:53.399> aside<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.969> I'll<00:00:54.180> come<00:00:54.360> back<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.539> that

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
scrub aside and I'll come back to that

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.020

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
cream cooling off a bit now towards the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.020 
cream cooling off a bit now towards the
end<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.619> soaking<00:01:31.950> process<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.520> like<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.820> rub

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
end of the soaking process I like to rub

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.179 
end of the soaking process I like to rub
the<00:01:33.180> cream<00:01:33.479> into<00:01:33.720> both<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.320> my<00:01:34.439> hands<00:01:34.710> just

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
the cream into both of my hands just

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.069 
the cream into both of my hands just
because<00:01:35.460> it's<00:01:35.640> really<00:01:36.060> moisturizing<00:01:36.420> and

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
because it's really moisturizing and

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.109 
because it's really moisturizing and
that's<00:01:37.530> why<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:37.740> recommend<00:01:38.430> using<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.880> heavy

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
that's why I recommend using a heavy

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.499 
that's why I recommend using a heavy
cream<00:01:39.570> or<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.930> whole<00:01:40.500> milk<00:01:40.860> as<00:01:41.070> opposed<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.820> 2%

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
cream or a whole milk as opposed to a 2%

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.020 
cream or a whole milk as opposed to a 2%
milk<00:01:42.689> because<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.740> fat<00:01:43.979> content<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.700> higher

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
milk because the fat content is higher

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.429 
milk because the fat content is higher
which<00:01:45.360> means<00:01:45.630> it's<00:01:45.780> going<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.020> be<00:01:46.170> very

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
which means it's going to be very

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.260 
which means it's going to be very
moisturizing<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.670> now<00:01:47.790> I'm<00:01:47.909> just<00:01:48.030> going<00:01:48.180> to

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
moisturizing so now I'm just going to

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.719 
moisturizing so now I'm just going to
wipe<00:01:48.479> off<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.899> cream<00:01:49.229> with<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.799> warm<00:01:50.159> washcloth

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
wipe off the cream with a warm washcloth

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.969 
wipe off the cream with a warm washcloth
okay<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.600> now<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:51.869> have<00:01:51.990> two<00:01:52.380> separate<00:01:52.770> pieces

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
okay so now I have two separate pieces

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.399 
okay so now I have two separate pieces
