00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.870
 Hello, this video lesson will be 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:10.260
 is dedicated to 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:11.940
 By the way py and its various breakdowns 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.949
 there is such a technique 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:25.410
 navigators grand prix so say where 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:27.560
 Chinese motor industry here I have on this 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.059
 week there was such a problem that 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:44.460
 gnawed here's a tooth on the snoring wiki and 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:48.890
 loosened tuk covers how 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:53.370
 it turns out that the ratchet climbs out and 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.969
 crescent specifically out of the door crescent 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.670
 nearly 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:05.430
 gnaws all the arcs on it two three old 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:08.270
 the black pique all the teeth with a bite on it 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.270
 all bottom too 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.829
 that's what i did that me change the trail 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.039
 vik well 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:21.600
 For 1 cover, then a century good here 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:25.049
 cracked I took these ordinary candles 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.649
 the car picked out these here 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.649
 rings 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:43.350
 therefore took these rings so leave planted 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.350
 under this one thing came out as two goals 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.650
 then we take this whole thing twist 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.410
 see here the court turns out this 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.110
 cyclamen it is closer 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.640
 crocodile vetch and recipient that ratchet 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:03.530
 clings faster and and 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.530
 and it was not given to those broken teeth 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:12.320
 further we take here everything we grease with grease 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.320
 all teeth 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.989
 Well, we catch the cover itself 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.440
 so I grabbed the lid 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.830
 we are trying to actually start 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.050
