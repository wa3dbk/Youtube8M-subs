 ridiculous for a much Centrixx 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.850
 really should have him running quickly 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.860

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.940
 now at full decent but this is our new one 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.289
 team and that looks a lot 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.539
 more attractive to two more 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.730
 web servers and we can also do with a 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.750
 mechanic cord always start the root 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.870

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.750
 do this why you buy such players 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.130
 keep 0 chemistry with each other as almost 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.080

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.020

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.740
 match and then yes then I will 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.370
 just three thirty minutes later is allowed 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.350
 by 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.530
 can neat to the keeper one then here one 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.729
 strange boys sit down 38 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.190
 yards 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.530
 around such a corner wonderful free kick that 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.140
 the four against zero and no way here the 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.850
 well by again jan he comes out and you 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.600

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.630

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.460

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.800
 everything in the pan go through too 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.119
 to the six zero with nian and on this 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.170
 moment this man went his own profession and too 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.090
 make what I am such a waste of you 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.050
 time I don't understand why 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.550
 someone does that 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.290
 but well I don't want anything for it 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.690
 because his keeper 's own pinnacle 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.670
 I don't count tree 4 but 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.420

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.630
 Harry and yes I just do a trick and 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.670
 then very simple and it is but the 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.050
 Pantyhose for this violation which I do 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.700
 can understand because mackeeper temple 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.560
 just take them feet and take in the clint 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.540
 dempsey in the good language that comes up 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.040
 a one but then he draws here with 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.320
 more obedient searchers music there 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.209
 I take the penalty with which jericho 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.590
 and may go much perfect choice here 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.500
 shooting but also comes way 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.640
 here and this is empty and sweaty grandma oh what 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.560
 was that feyenoord plays from him to the 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.390
 line very good paul check and comes on 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.170
 here to just take it through rivoli 4 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.760
 a 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.280
 and then yes here this stab me up close 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.320
 the lab is fucking good at it 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.890
 Lockers said but then so mounier 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.299

 yes another box I started one too 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.500
 very simple and i think beauty 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.480
 lies in either goal but 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.630
 here again jerry hall who scores 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.670

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.110
 daily used to not think but 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.640
 four goals from and that is pretty good sometimes 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.170
 one and that now also draws or offers it 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.880
 apart from a real trilobite difference 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.350
 Patrick and victory is the solid 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.190
