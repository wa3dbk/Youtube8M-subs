00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
just air axis in one direction and we

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.420 
just air axis in one direction and we
did<00:00:37.690> use<00:00:38.690> of<00:00:38.870> a<00:00:39.050> superman<00:00:39.860> review<00:00:40.010> of<00:00:40.250> last

that pull-up ought to get me travel and
I<00:00:55.430> change<00:00:55.730> my<00:00:55.940> axis<00:00:56.390> you<00:00:56.510> can<00:00:56.570> see<00:00:56.809> us<00:00:56.960> putting

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200
