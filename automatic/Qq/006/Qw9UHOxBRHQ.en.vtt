00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.940
 and then other good people today we go 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.400
 show you how to make a chapisco 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.340
 the blinking complaint puts it on the wall of 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.090
 masonry is not enough to give the groove 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.400
 necessary for the plaster 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.300
 definitive overpass 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.160
 You here is fast and show you 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.480
 we as if the mass dough has to 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.050
 be three for one 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.780
 the fourth by an ego there four of sand the 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.730
 instrument is very strong not even letting 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.640
 much water there in the mass or the more 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.930
 more water will wash the cement and 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.350
 This is our opinion that we are 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.750
 starting to make a buck and do not have 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.270
 no personal secret has even the machines 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.739
 who do this work in the market but 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.629
 That old story is when you 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.309
 have enough resources to buy 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.010
 a machine 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.979
 obviously we have to go there by the way 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.920
 that is to take the spoon of 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.450
 same bricklayer and the 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.119
 tab with the same hand 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.970
 this is already a millenarian work 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.360
 say so right being done there 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.170
 hundreds of years ago not exaggerating much 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.710
 Is not it 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:27.150
 but I work the dough well neither 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.610
 pasty there is as I said do not let too much 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.060
 water on top every time you go 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.880
 the mass in the planter lyon in the cart is 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.710
 You're in a good mood even though it's 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.470
 so that the cement does not get washed 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.720
 use the sand only to play on the wall 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.930
 without the cement because everything will fall 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:50.189
 new and as I said this is the pisco tea that 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.740
 we make sense to later come the 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.890
 final plaster over because 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.009
 usually ceramic brick or other type 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.320
 Young country skirt is smooth 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.500
 although the lady out on 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.619
 brick but it is still smooth and can 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.739
 cause the plaster to fall in the future. 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.940
 do not have the pisco tea is the 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:16.630
 give the kidney 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.850
 the people there for the plaster do not even fall 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.860
 as I would say to you before there as 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.190
 they are telling you before there is not 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.680
 mystery always has that little secret right? 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.190
 also has a little secret there's roughcast 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.870
 what is this part of the hand there is everything 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.280
 a way of throwing dough on the wall 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.600
 because if you play in a way 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.880
 different 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.240
 obviously the mass will fall all over the 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.810
 show or will be very tangled in 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.060
 wall there and that is not our intention 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.260
 our intention is to make a pisco tea 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.290
 pretty curly 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.210
 the more curly better and in the case 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.220
 then look what I'm doing 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.740
 later on the video was good to see 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.920
 a pisco tea that we call chapisco 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.380
 definitive because definitive because it 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.360
 be a chapisco that will be permanently 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.890
 on the wall to be painted there 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.020
 quickly to you I'm showing 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.190
 oh what the brick 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:14.410
 He has a juice there deep then the 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.660
 what happens when you make a hat 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.850
 typical surface that's all there just gave 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.620
 goodbye, will you see the plaster over 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.640
 Then, it's okay, no taboo. 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.550
 really pretty 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.730
 but if you want to make a pisco tea is 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.500
 to finish as they say before 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.140
 what comes the culture upstairs to be alone 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.940
 roughcast yet the Father 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.760
 have to make two three hands to 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.640
 try to fill all the grooves 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.290
 of the brick to not stay 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.070
 those rules very appearing later 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:48.820
 in the definitive painting is a brother's hand 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:52.300
 3 hand out of chapecÃ³ but also strong 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:55.810
 for you, for the streets of the brick 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.390
 others have other types 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.730
 this game out there is that massive brick 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.070
 and some drilled bricks that do not have 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.350
 this break and then stay much longer 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.269
 simple to fill the wall for a 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.730
 final floor tea 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:12.310
 That's the case, I'll tell you again 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.640
 Our wall will then serve as 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.370
 painted then I screw it going to be 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.019
 definitive I think it gave it to you - 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.260
 to see how you do it does not have 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.210
 mystery has a few secrets but you 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.800
 even at home you can try and I 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.270
 I'm sure you'll get a home. 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.270
 Rafael, I went
