manager Makino Inc and bill you gotta
show<00:00:11.910> me<00:00:11.969> something<00:00:12.509> in<00:00:12.599> this<00:00:12.840> PS<00:00:13.590> 95<00:00:14.040> machine

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
show me something in this PS 95 machine

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.049 
show me something in this PS 95 machine
tell<00:00:14.580> me<00:00:14.670> about<00:00:14.759> it

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
tell me about it

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.019 
tell me about it
PS<00:00:15.750> 95<00:00:16.289> this<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.890> latest<00:00:17.250> production

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
PS 95 this is the latest production

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.480 
PS 95 this is the latest production
oriented<00:00:18.690> vertical<00:00:19.140> from<00:00:19.320> Makino<00:00:19.680> we<00:00:20.220> think

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
oriented vertical from Makino we think

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.820 
oriented vertical from Makino we think
we're<00:00:20.670> changing<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.300> paradigm<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.830> vertical

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
we're changing the paradigm of vertical

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.859 
we're changing the paradigm of vertical
machining<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.820> unique<00:00:24.180> features<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:24.660> this

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
machining the unique features of this

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.929 
machining the unique features of this
machine<00:00:25.320> obviously<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.099> spindle<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.699> one<00:00:26.849> of

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
machine obviously the spindle is one of

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.730 
machine obviously the spindle is one of
the<00:00:27.029> key<00:00:27.180> features<00:00:27.630> because<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.349> has<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> very

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
the key features because it has a very

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.240 
the key features because it has a very
unique<00:00:28.859> blend<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.670> power<00:00:30.289> speed<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.470> torque

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
unique blend of power speed and torque

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.799 
unique blend of power speed and torque
it's<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.180> 33<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.840> half<00:00:34.940> horsepower<00:00:35.940> spindles

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
it's a 33 and a half horsepower spindles

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.660 
it's a 33 and a half horsepower spindles
so<00:00:36.989> there's<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.260> lot<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.530> power<00:00:37.770> there<00:00:37.920> the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
so there's a lot of power there the

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.700 
so there's a lot of power there the
torques<00:00:39.059> 130<00:00:39.719> foot-pounds<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.350> torque

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
torques 130 foot-pounds of torque

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.060 
torques 130 foot-pounds of torque
so<00:00:40.920> it's<00:00:41.070> very<00:00:41.280> torquey<00:00:41.670> for<00:00:42.090> very<00:00:42.629> tough<00:00:43.070> hard

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
so it's very torquey for very tough hard

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.799 
so it's very torquey for very tough hard
metal<00:00:44.370> application<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.329> not<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.600> big<00:00:45.750> a

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
metal application this is not that big a

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.240 
metal application this is not that big a
machine<00:00:46.110> for<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.379> kind<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.620> bow<00:00:46.739> it's<00:00:47.010> it's

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
machine for that kind of bow it's it's

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.389 
machine for that kind of bow it's it's
