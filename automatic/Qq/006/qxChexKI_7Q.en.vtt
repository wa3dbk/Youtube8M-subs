00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
into smaller bits let's do this it's

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.220 
into smaller bits let's do this it's
mostly<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.640> single<00:00:44.640> stroke<00:00:44.850> roll<00:00:45.079> but<00:00:46.079> then

mostly a single stroke roll but then

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.520 
mostly a single stroke roll but then
that's<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:47.329> sixteenth<00:00:48.329> note<00:00:48.420> section<00:00:49.050> I'm<00:00:49.289> an

eighth note section so I'll just break
it<00:00:51.750> down<00:00:51.899> by<00:00:52.379> C<00:00:57.649> so<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.219> eighth<00:00:59.430> note

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
it down by C so that is the eighth note

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.599 
it down by C so that is the eighth note
section<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.989> can<00:01:01.140> think<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.829> terms<00:01:02.309> of

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
section you can think of it in terms of

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:11.710 
section you can think of it in terms of
triplets<00:01:03.830> as<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:05.100> groups<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.729> three<00:01:06.380> so<00:01:07.850> three

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.770 

they<00:01:12.720> accent<00:01:13.260> on<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.560> first<00:01:13.830> move<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.939> switch

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
they accent on the first move and switch

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.200 
they accent on the first move and switch
it<00:01:15.960> up<00:01:16.170> accent<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:16.920> these<00:01:17.130> notes<00:01:17.369> on<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:18.000> left

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
it up accent on these notes on the left

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.890 
it up accent on these notes on the left
hand<00:01:18.390> also<00:01:18.600> writes<00:01:19.229> left<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.400> order<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.450> it

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
hand also writes left in the order so it

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:32.870 
hand also writes left in the order so it
goes<00:01:22.110> like<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:30.920> it's<00:01:31.920> one<00:01:32.130> two<00:01:32.159> three<00:01:32.640> one

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
goes like this so it's one two three one

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.080 
goes like this so it's one two three one
two<00:01:32.909> three<00:01:33.090> one<00:01:33.450> two<00:01:33.659> three<00:01:33.869> one<00:01:34.200> two<00:01:34.530> three

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
two three one two three one two three

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.319 
two three one two three one two three
then<00:01:36.090> has<00:01:37.049> two<00:01:37.229> linked<00:01:38.220> together<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.119> makes

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
then has two linked together so it makes

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.750 
then has two linked together so it makes
a<00:01:39.570> full<00:01:39.960> single<00:01:40.350> stroke<00:01:40.799> roll<00:01:41.570> thing

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
a full single stroke roll thing

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.370

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
stuffs at the first part then we have

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.990 
stuffs at the first part then we have
the<00:01:48.530> sixteenth<00:01:48.950> note<00:01:49.220> section<00:01:49.670> as<00:01:50.590> five<00:01:51.590> notes

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
the sixteenth note section as five notes

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.870 
the sixteenth note section as five notes
just<00:01:53.000> five<00:01:53.210> minutes

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:07.170 

I<00:01:58.420> sent<00:01:59.420> the<00:01:59.540> last<00:01:59.780> night<00:02:00.020> so<00:02:01.010> one<00:02:01.340> two<00:02:01.520> three
