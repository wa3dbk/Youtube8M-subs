00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
the shore so we're changing our strategy

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.240 
the shore so we're changing our strategy
we'll<00:02:26.720> move<00:02:26.959> up<00:02:27.200> here<00:02:27.440> we're<00:02:27.980> gonna<00:02:28.070> try

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
fishing on the shore now we're switching

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.960 
fishing on the shore now we're switching
a<00:02:29.990> little<00:02:30.200> bit<00:02:30.350> it's<00:02:30.860> dark<00:02:31.190> we're<00:02:31.760> switching

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
a little bit it's dark we're switching

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.970 
a little bit it's dark we're switching
to<00:02:32.209> all<00:02:32.420> black<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:33.500> we're<00:02:33.620> gonna<00:02:33.709> move<00:02:33.950> right

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
up on the shore and fish shallow right

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.720 
up on the shore and fish shallow right
hopefully<00:02:36.739> we<00:02:36.980> get<00:02:37.220> something<00:02:37.459> here<00:02:37.610> in<00:02:37.670> the

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
hopefully we get something here in the

00:02:37.730 --> 00:03:33.440 
hopefully we get something here in the
next<00:02:37.910> two<00:02:38.060> minutes

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:43.339 

that's<00:03:34.450> a<00:03:34.630> nice<00:03:34.900> one<00:03:35.380> yeah<00:03:38.880> and<00:03:39.880> a<00:03:40.030> girl<00:03:40.300> huh

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:50.970 

well<00:03:44.349> I've<00:03:45.190> tried<00:03:46.800> one<00:03:47.800> two<00:03:48.250> three<00:03:49.560> four<00:03:50.560> five

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
well I've tried one two three four five

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.559 
well I've tried one two three four five
rods<00:03:51.459> now<00:03:53.069> and<00:03:54.069> what<00:03:54.970> I<00:03:55.000> came<00:03:55.330> to<00:03:55.480> the

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
rods now and what I came to the

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.300 
rods now and what I came to the
conclusion<00:03:55.750> was<00:03:56.440> that<00:03:56.680> they<00:03:56.799> were<00:03:56.860> up<00:03:57.069> there

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
conclusion was that they were up there

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.410 
conclusion was that they were up there
chasing<00:03:57.640> bait<00:03:58.120> fish<00:03:58.480> probably<00:03:58.840> bluegill

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
chasing bait fish probably bluegill

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.660 
chasing bait fish probably bluegill

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
something right up on the shore so what

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.990 
something right up on the shore so what
I<00:04:03.700> did<00:04:03.819> was<00:04:04.120> switched<00:04:04.450> up<00:04:04.720> and<00:04:04.930> I<00:04:04.989> went<00:04:05.200> to<00:04:05.380> a

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
I did was switched up and I went to a

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.690 
I did was switched up and I went to a
weightless<00:04:07.000> bait<00:04:07.450> a<00:04:07.480> Cinco<00:04:08.260> and<00:04:11.489> flopped<00:04:12.489> out

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
weightless bait a Cinco and flopped out

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.280 
weightless bait a Cinco and flopped out
here<00:04:12.970> on<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.180> deck<00:04:13.420> this<00:04:13.660> is<00:04:13.720> what<00:04:13.989> it<00:04:14.080> looks

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
here on the deck this is what it looks

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.870 
here on the deck this is what it looks
like<00:04:14.500> and<00:04:15.269> so<00:04:16.269> again<00:04:16.660> he<00:04:17.250> took<00:04:18.250> that<00:04:18.459> in<00:04:18.729> he

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
like and so again he took that in he

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.569 
like and so again he took that in he
thought<00:04:19.090> it<00:04:19.209> was<00:04:19.299> a<00:04:19.329> bait<00:04:19.630> fish<00:04:20.340> we<00:04:21.340> were<00:04:21.459> just

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
thought it was a bait fish we were just

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:22.950 
thought it was a bait fish we were just
sitting<00:04:21.820> here<00:04:22.030> and<00:04:22.090> right<00:04:22.360> off<00:04:22.510> the<00:04:22.630> point

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
sitting here and right off the point

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.770 
sitting here and right off the point
again<00:04:23.700> probably<00:04:24.700> up<00:04:24.820> in<00:04:24.940> about<00:04:25.180> 10<00:04:25.450> feet<00:04:25.660> of

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
again probably up in about 10 feet of

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.150 
again probably up in about 10 feet of
water<00:04:25.810> I'm<00:04:26.140> gonna<00:04:26.229> put<00:04:26.470> him<00:04:26.650> in<00:04:26.680> alive<00:04:26.979> well

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
water I'm gonna put him in alive well

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.560 
water I'm gonna put him in alive well
we're<00:04:27.310> gonna<00:04:27.400> throw<00:04:27.669> it<00:04:27.729> try<00:04:27.940> to<00:04:28.000> catch<00:04:28.180> Helen

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
we're gonna throw it try to catch Helen

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.159 
we're gonna throw it try to catch Helen
he<00:04:29.970> figured<00:04:30.970> out<00:04:31.090> what's<00:04:31.300> gonna<00:04:31.510> take<00:04:32.140> a

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
he figured out what's gonna take a

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:33.420 
he figured out what's gonna take a
little<00:04:32.289> while<00:04:32.500> we've<00:04:32.740> been<00:04:32.860> here<00:04:33.010> for<00:04:33.160> maybe

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
little while we've been here for maybe

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.330 
little while we've been here for maybe
an<00:04:33.580> hour<00:04:33.700> so<00:04:34.090> but<00:04:35.010> sometimes<00:04:36.010> that's<00:04:36.130> what<00:04:36.280> you

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
an hour so but sometimes that's what you

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.219 
an hour so but sometimes that's what you
got<00:04:36.550> to<00:04:36.580> do<00:04:36.700> it's<00:04:36.850> process<00:04:37.300> of<00:04:37.450> elimination<00:04:37.840> so

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
got to do it's process of elimination so

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.230 
got to do it's process of elimination so
