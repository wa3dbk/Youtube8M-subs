video I'll put a link in that in the

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.830 
video I'll put a link in that in the
description<00:04:17.280> below<00:04:17.400> as<00:04:17.669> well<00:04:17.789> they<00:04:18.419> might<00:04:18.690> be

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
description below as well they might be

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.949 
description below as well they might be
even<00:04:18.989> having<00:04:19.470> a<00:04:20.060> Ultron<00:04:21.060> that<00:04:21.299> can<00:04:21.479> swap

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
even having a Ultron that can swap

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.670 
even having a Ultron that can swap
between<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.620> prime<00:04:22.979> and<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.940> ultimate

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.770 
between the prime and the ultimate
Ultron<00:04:26.120> interchangeable<00:04:27.120> parts<00:04:27.300> something

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
Ultron interchangeable parts something

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:28.390 
Ultron interchangeable parts something
like<00:04:27.930> that

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
like that

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.129 
like that
but<00:04:28.550> not<00:04:29.210> finalized<00:04:29.660> a<00:04:29.780> it's<00:04:29.900> just<00:04:30.050> the

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
but not finalized a it's just the

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.090 
but not finalized a it's just the
prototype<00:04:30.490> so<00:04:31.490> King<00:04:31.970> arts<00:04:32.270> do<00:04:32.949> something<00:04:33.949> that

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
prototype so King arts do something that

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.960 
prototype so King arts do something that
I<00:04:34.130> found<00:04:34.430> quite<00:04:34.610> unique<00:04:35.090> they<00:04:35.690> do<00:04:36.490> 40%<00:04:37.490> die

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
I found quite unique they do 40% die

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.659 
I found quite unique they do 40% die
casts<00:04:38.509> some<00:04:39.080> of<00:04:39.259> them<00:04:39.470> like<00:04:39.830> the<00:04:39.949> mock<00:04:40.130> 40<00:04:40.490> to

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
casts some of them like the mock 40 to

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.180 
casts some of them like the mock 40 to
go<00:04:40.910> out<00:04:41.000> to<00:04:41.150> 70<00:04:41.750> percent<00:04:41.900> die<00:04:42.289> cast<00:04:42.590> so

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
go out to 70 percent die cast so

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.590 
go out to 70 percent die cast so
collectors<00:04:43.669> out<00:04:43.759> there<00:04:43.820> who<00:04:44.120> are<00:04:44.180> looking<00:04:44.300> for
