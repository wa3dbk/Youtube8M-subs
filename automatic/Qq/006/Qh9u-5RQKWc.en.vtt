00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.460 
made this experiment that thing there I
don't<00:02:39.239> know<00:02:39.299> what<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:39.599> is<00:02:39.750> either

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
don't know what that is either

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.910 
don't know what that is either
same<00:02:40.769> same<00:02:41.370> deal<00:02:41.640> no<00:02:42.440> no<00:02:43.440> idea<00:02:43.530> what<00:02:43.739> that<00:02:43.769> is

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
same same deal no no idea what that is

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.309 
same same deal no no idea what that is
either

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
either

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.619 
either
but<00:02:46.319> we<00:02:47.010> have<00:02:47.129> some<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.760> bunch<00:02:48.329> of<00:02:48.450> things

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
but we have some a bunch of things

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:53.990 
but we have some a bunch of things
growing<00:02:48.989> in<00:02:49.200> here<00:02:51.890> also<00:02:52.890> there<00:02:53.069> also<00:02:53.099> I<00:02:53.489> have

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
growing in here also there also I have

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.800 
growing in here also there also I have
found<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:55.459> snail<00:02:56.459> that<00:02:56.489> I<00:02:56.940> picked<00:02:57.299> up<00:02:57.480> what<00:02:57.690> the

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
found a snail that I picked up what the

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.619 
found a snail that I picked up what the
dirt<00:02:58.079> that<00:02:58.410> I<00:02:58.470> put<00:02:58.799> in<00:02:59.069> here<00:02:59.310> the<00:03:00.030> first<00:03:00.329> time<00:03:00.599> I

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
dirt that I put in here the first time I

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.920 
dirt that I put in here the first time I
did<00:03:00.930> this<00:03:01.110> experiment<00:03:01.730> but<00:03:02.730> I<00:03:02.940> do<00:03:03.000> not<00:03:03.569> know

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
did this experiment but I do not know

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.699 
did this experiment but I do not know
where<00:03:04.170> this<00:03:04.350> snail<00:03:04.769> is<00:03:05.069> right<00:03:05.370> now<00:03:05.870> but<00:03:06.870> I'll

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
where this snail is right now but I'll

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:08.900 
where this snail is right now but I'll
try<00:03:08.040> to<00:03:08.069> find<00:03:08.310> it

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
try to find it

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:16.099 
try to find it
we<00:03:09.780> still<00:03:10.079> have<00:03:10.230> condensation<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:14.720> glass<00:03:15.720> so

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
we still have condensation the glass so

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.160 
we still have condensation the glass so
I<00:03:17.239> thought<00:03:18.239> that<00:03:18.420> it<00:03:18.510> might<00:03:18.540> be<00:03:18.900> pretty

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
I thought that it might be pretty

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.920 
I thought that it might be pretty
interesting<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:19.920> update<00:03:20.819> you<00:03:20.970> guys<00:03:21.000> on<00:03:21.209> if
