00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.789

 it's a show 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.590
 Botafogo is going 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.140
 A while before coming here to dial 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.630
 is to supply the city of Rio Niterói with 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.190
 food and this demanded that the city 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.330
 progress to account for everything coming out 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.460
 how was this arrival of the train to 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.380
 city is actually the most beautiful 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.680
 of everything that was not a mayor one 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.630
 governor who brought the city 30 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.760
 was the group of people from the 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.660
 a city that had the need to bring 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.970
 a train 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.890
 then within this sector is the force 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.220
 really of all 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.020
 locals who pick up a train that 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.820
 I was going to the city and from that train 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.070
 who had this great process 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.680
 mainly from the part of the fish that 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.020
 was one of the first of the place since 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.990
 that time of the 2 x 1 that I already commented 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.360
 of the time of the Jesuits and as far as 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.479
 orange banana affecting the coats of 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.280
 maricá that exactly is for one of more 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.410
 progress of maricá that the 'mark' 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.470
 began to be known through this 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.910
 export that she made that is for another 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.830
 city is the train was great 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.869
 importance for them in fact we 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.660
 we have an allegory that will represent 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.369
 precisely this not only a training but 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.369
 the union of all who want a city 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.200
 thank you 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.200
 the option 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.500
 you gave a very romantic look there 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.660
 to help with maysa as a guiding 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.270
 will close this whole story is in the 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.520
 truth as the driver wire face 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.680
 it starts with an isa is when it takes 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.450
 an American piano that the opening of 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.750
 school when she meets in Maricá 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.630
 and she begins to have it's will that in 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.090
 research in conjunction with a 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.370
 together with a Roberto will be long 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.860
 we had access to jayme monjardim 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.080
 that the son of maysa and he left well 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.880
 Of course for people who can not talk about 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.920
 maricá without mentioning countries that do not 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.870
 Can you talk about maysa without speaking about maricá? 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.820
 and then he began to tell all 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.800
 trajectory the feeling that his mother 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.050
 had the city and it was precisely in this 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.910
 first moment that is what begins 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.340
 head our wire conductor that when she 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.250
 takes a piano and this takes this wire goes 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.500
 passing her gaze around the pt by 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.660
 Marica told to arrive at last 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.300
 moment of our sector that is called 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.430
 Marica was unhappy than normal and that 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.950
 people close the last moment of maysa 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.950
 which is in the 70's a very look 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.739
 more psychedelic of the time than 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.560
 when it exists at this time of year 70 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:05.130
 that hip movement of the 70s that 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.290
 that captain movement that why all 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.600
 people start leaving the city 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.600
 great to seek inner peace 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.570
 indoors or indoors is more 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.540
 of course also with in the interior is in the 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.630
 That's it. 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.520
 important part of the city and offers 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.890
 maysa's attention 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.709
 in this last moment of it a look is 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.410
 about the whole city that she left 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.000
 I miss nothing here is in the 70's 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.100
 That's why we finished 60 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.739
 the happiest moment of maysa in life 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.750
 her and had not better for us to 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.760
 close within that time she lived 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:50.400
 which was what it is in the 70's 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:50.400
 is the vision of local beauty 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:58.069
 helping the entire community of the Great River 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.540
 we can expect from this school 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.209
 2014 carnival 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.879
 Look what the great river can expect ecu 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.980
 and how can I also expect 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.659
 components of the great river and the 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.200
 that twist on the great river 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:15.440
 Such a feeling of happiness is 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.289
 affection and confidence in what is 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.989
 being produced here is from the 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:23.750
 our shed of fantasies not only 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.250
 also the direction part of carnival the 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.400
 rehearsals with everything I think the great 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.400
 The river comes with a new coat of 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.199
 This is the way to present the carnival, right? 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.510
 I was just talking to 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:38.720
 some people is totally the plot 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:41.600
 cultural for many in the beginning 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.000
 became if it was said that the plot a 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.010
 small theme mark what you have to say 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.199
 Maricá looks at how much cultural 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.210
 We think it 's to show for the 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:52.070
 people on the rita grande avenue following 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.110
 I think coming back with this line of 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.120
 part is to show the culture to the 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.180
 people this is important is you 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:02.419
 identify what the public wants to see 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.880
 that the school feels good you know that 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.560
 this movement, the school believes 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.320
 I'm believing the opportunity for 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.620
 great rita giving of making a great 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.620
 carnival
