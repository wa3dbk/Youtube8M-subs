00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
harmonic a little bit get a little pinch

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:27.530 
harmonic a little bit get a little pinch
harmonic<00:03:18.930> in<00:03:19.079> this<00:03:19.500> life<00:03:24.019> and<00:03:26.540> that's

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
harmonic in this life and that's

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.920 
harmonic in this life and that's
basically<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.409> beginning<00:03:28.560> now<00:03:29.400> I<00:03:29.730> think<00:03:30.510> the

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
basically the beginning now I think the

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:38.449 
basically the beginning now I think the
verse<00:03:31.140> goes<00:03:31.170> like<00:03:31.799> this<00:03:32.120> you're<00:03:33.120> gonna<00:03:37.459> and

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
verse goes like this you're gonna and

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:39.890 
verse goes like this you're gonna and
then<00:03:38.519> you're<00:03:38.640> gonna<00:03:38.760> hold<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.239> G<00:03:39.420> chord<00:03:39.780> and

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
then you're gonna hold the G chord and

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:47.119 
then you're gonna hold the G chord and
you're<00:03:40.049> gonna<00:03:40.170> come<00:03:40.470> in<00:03:40.709> to<00:03:41.220> that<00:03:41.400> chord<00:03:46.129> the

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
you're gonna come in to that chord the

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.089 
you're gonna come in to that chord the
bottom<00:03:47.489> strings<00:03:48.480> without<00:03:48.720> holdin<00:03:49.379> without

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
bottom strings without holdin without
