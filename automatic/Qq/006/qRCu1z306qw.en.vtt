oh<00:00:05.350> you<00:00:06.350> do<00:00:06.590> I<00:00:06.830> was<00:00:07.700> just<00:00:08.149> thawing<00:00:08.780> out<00:00:08.900> some

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.320 
oh you do I was just thawing out some

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.449 
oh you do I was just thawing out some
breast<00:00:09.680> milk<00:00:09.830> for<00:00:10.580> my<00:00:11.240> son<00:00:11.540> annulus<00:00:12.200> lunch<00:00:12.500> to

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:13.459 
breast milk for my son annulus lunch to

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:16.150 
breast milk for my son annulus lunch to
prepare<00:00:13.789> with<00:00:13.940> his<00:00:14.119> lunch<00:00:14.299> and<00:00:14.690> so<00:00:15.350> I<00:00:15.619> figured

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
prepare with his lunch and so I figured

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.740 
prepare with his lunch and so I figured
that<00:00:16.309> I<00:00:16.340> would<00:00:16.520> do<00:00:16.850> a<00:00:16.880> video<00:00:17.330> on<00:00:19.420> breast<00:00:20.420> milk

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
that I would do a video on breast milk

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.410 
that I would do a video on breast milk
storage<00:00:21.050> I<00:00:21.470> guess<00:00:21.890> and<00:00:22.220> how<00:00:22.880> I<00:00:22.910> went<00:00:23.270> about

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420
