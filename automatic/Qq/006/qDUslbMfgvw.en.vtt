on that side in terms of the performance

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.350 
on that side in terms of the performance
results<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:53.610> now<00:01:53.790> we're<00:01:53.970> working<00:01:54.119> on

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
results and so now we're working on

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.789 
results and so now we're working on
getting<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.689> final<00:01:54.930> aircraft<00:01:55.350> performance

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
getting the final aircraft performance

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.550 
getting the final aircraft performance
so<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.040> stay<00:01:56.430> tuned<00:01:56.700> on<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.030> side<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.719> have<00:01:58.439> to
