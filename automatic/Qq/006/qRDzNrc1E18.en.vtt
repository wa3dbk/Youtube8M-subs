00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
real quickly first thing I learned was

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.240 
real quickly first thing I learned was
don't<00:01:31.610> use<00:01:32.610> these<00:01:33.150> disposable<00:01:33.450> razors<00:01:34.250> yeah

don't use these disposable razors yeah

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.980 
don't use these disposable razors yeah
they<00:01:35.310> cut<00:01:35.640> real<00:01:35.880> close<00:01:36.210> but<00:01:36.600> as<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.780> said<00:01:36.930> before

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
they cut real close but as I said before

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.319 
they cut real close but as I said before
that's<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.590> main<00:01:37.860> issue<00:01:38.130> our<00:01:38.790> hair<00:01:39.060> grows

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
that's the main issue our hair grows

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.120 
that's the main issue our hair grows
differently<00:01:39.630> if<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.259> have<00:01:40.409> straight<00:01:40.710> hair

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
differently if you have straight hair

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.460 
differently if you have straight hair
that<00:01:41.310> grows<00:01:41.700> straight<00:01:42.090> then<00:01:42.420> you're<00:01:42.570> fine<00:01:42.840> but

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
that grows straight then you're fine but

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.039 
that grows straight then you're fine but
if<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.890> have<00:01:43.920> curly<00:01:44.399> hair<00:01:44.430> like<00:01:44.610> me<00:01:45.049> that's

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
if you have curly hair like me that's

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.289 
if you have curly hair like me that's

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
this right here is pretty good for

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.030 
this right here is pretty good for
trimming<00:02:14.520> it<00:02:14.850> is<00:02:15.030> pretty<00:02:15.300> close<00:02:15.600> um<00:02:15.990> I<00:02:16.890> never

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
trimming it is pretty close um I never

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.240 
trimming it is pretty close um I never
had<00:02:17.640> any<00:02:17.820> irritation<00:02:18.810> any<00:02:19.230> razor<00:02:19.530> bumps<00:02:20.100> I

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
had any irritation any razor bumps I

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.680 
had any irritation any razor bumps I
just<00:02:20.430> make<00:02:20.550> sure<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:20.820> our<00:02:20.970> oil<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.330> before<00:02:21.660> I

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
just make sure that our oil it before I

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.540 
just make sure that our oil it before I
use<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.650> of<00:02:22.770> course<00:02:22.950> you<00:02:23.070> have<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.310> clean

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.750 
use it and of course you have to clean
it<00:02:23.580> so<00:02:23.940> this<00:02:24.090> is<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.270> g-man<00:02:25.040> series<00:02:26.040> electric

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.430 
it so this is the g-man series electric
trimmer<00:02:27.360> I<00:02:27.600> think<00:02:28.410> cost<00:02:28.590> about<00:02:28.740> $20<00:02:29.580> um<00:02:30.440> you

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
trimmer I think cost about $20 um you

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.460 
trimmer I think cost about $20 um you
always<00:02:31.530> shave<00:02:31.890> against<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.960> grain<00:02:33.960> of<00:02:34.440> your

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
always shave against the grain of your

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.210 
always shave against the grain of your
hair<00:02:34.910> so<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:35.940> stays<00:02:36.540> nicely<00:02:36.840> on<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:37.710> so<00:02:38.010> you<00:02:38.100> can

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
hair so it stays nicely on so so you can

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.130

get<00:02:38.370> as<00:02:38.550> close<00:02:38.700> as<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:38.970> need<00:02:39.240> to<00:02:39.390> be<00:02:39.840> going

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
get as close as you need to be going

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.630 
get as close as you need to be going

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
again you cut against the grain of the

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.160 
again you cut against the grain of the
skin<00:03:49.890> um<00:03:50.250> it<00:03:50.880> cuts<00:03:51.060> close<00:03:51.270> but<00:03:51.450> not<00:03:51.600> too<00:03:51.870> close

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
skin um it cuts close but not too close

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.860 
skin um it cuts close but not too close
um<00:03:52.470> I<00:03:52.709> think<00:03:52.770> it<00:03:52.980> cuts<00:03:53.580> about<00:03:53.820> like<00:03:54.030> up<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.720> like

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
um I think it cuts about like up to like

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.010 
um I think it cuts about like up to like
a<00:03:54.900> quarter<00:03:55.380> of<00:03:55.410> an<00:03:55.680> inch<00:03:55.830> on<00:03:56.250> my<00:03:57.090> pan<00:03:57.330> so<00:03:57.720> it's

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
a quarter of an inch on my pan so it's

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.120 
a quarter of an inch on my pan so it's
still<00:03:58.170> a<00:03:58.200> little<00:03:58.230> bit<00:03:58.410> of<00:03:58.560> hair<00:03:58.680> sticking<00:03:58.890> out

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
still a little bit of hair sticking out

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.320 
still a little bit of hair sticking out
but<00:03:59.340> it's<00:03:59.459> so<00:03:59.640> close<00:04:00.000> that<00:04:00.120> you<00:04:00.359> really<00:04:00.690> can't

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330
