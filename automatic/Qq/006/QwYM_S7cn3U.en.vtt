00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 a word of time to see the america 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.480
 against the Atlantean many 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.770
 fans the colts to the aztec stadium 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.540
 and the eagles in a match 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.910
 controversial with many errors 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.839
 Arbítrales where if you can not talk 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.760
 of a help to the eagles as such 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.590
 because they also hurt us with a 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:27.539
 couple of penalties out there but they end up 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:29.130
 winning 1-0 they are very nervous 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.040
 when they arrive in america 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.640
 this play at the end incredible as not 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.290
 the ball went to the atlante because today the 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.079
 raises rather said had in saint's 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.489
 back said it much more if atlantean 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.879
 won could not deserve it in parts and 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.980
 half more it 's sad to see that suddenly 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.899
 for example they harm the atlante with the 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.449
 out of place that is in good 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.680
 position that ends the play in goal and 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.750
 it seems that the televisions have 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.399
 that justify and they start to say that 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.190
 there are criminals on him aaiún with everything 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.900
 respect they start to gallons for me it 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.510
 they start to jalonear the two 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.670
 and then if it is at the defender's hand 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.130
 about him aaiún but can not know the 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.469
 referee 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.630
 how many pounds of pressure is 

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:13.909
 exercising on the arm in the camera 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:19.460
 they take you puts you in the privacy of the 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:21.170
 played and it is seen that if the withdrawal is not 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.170
 allows you the expression but on camera 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.539
 normal but the referee does not see it 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.049
 they are manipulating it is very complicated to think 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:32.600
 that is criminal that is a knife to the 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.670
 Atlante this with that play from outside the 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.170
 place the truth deserved much more the 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.170
 atlante a match 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:43.099
 well, what is out of place, the outside 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:44.990
 from place out place in that opening what 

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:48.259
 which is contrasting in the first time 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.459
 King gives a brazen red nudge and not what 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.750
 there is and then I admonish you see it and in the 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:55.849
 first time almost to finish a 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.890
 kick of king untimely on the pampa 

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:59.240
 rosemary that the referee did not want 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.679
 admonish because he had two the 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.049
 midnight did not do it in the second 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:06.739
 time comes that of layún that you comment and 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:08.989
 the play well the out of place that the 

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:12.369
 mark nothing ahead and then there is 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.369
 one hand from pp 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:19.280
 and also scared that ours 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.870
 his two arms hit him and then he hit him 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.590
 in the chest and then already nervous about 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.590
 land 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.510
 I did not see what he stuck in his chest 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.510
 if he saw that 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:50.049
 and so it is falling 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.290
 it can be confusion 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.099
 the pull of the fast is confusing what 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:05.719
 how the chepe is shot according to interpreters 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.609
 it can be confusing I understand you 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:09.889
 they say it's not a natural movement it's not 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:11.419
 gp and the falling leaves and obviously 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:13.609
 he wants to stretch his head and carry the 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:15.680
 arms here ok to what what is not 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:16.760
 confusing what is not confusing is what the 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.370
 out of place 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.510
 now ok the referee was wrong but not 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.180
 has the television station that is 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.310
 justifying does not have to draw 50 times 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.870
 about him aaiún to justify him 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:33.889
 place is what is rude but this 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.930
 directive is the part with all due respect 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:37.969
 I saw an Atlantean who deserved much more 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.330
 because the first time young when 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:44.290
 still when still 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:46.390
 America was reduced to ten men that is 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.850
 even before the blood merger I think 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.540
 that atlante had more arrival was and 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.650
 had more the ball played found 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:59.140
 found a little more play to what 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:00.970
 it was the team that in America is 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.450
 different the america has 23 and the 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.450
 citizens 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.900
 on two occasions with two penalties that 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.880
 they were not wasted with chivas 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.160
 today wastes three points back to the 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:19.140
 double post posts and others are three 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.140
 but also the party 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.990
 I'm going to ask you what happens with 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.090
 sangüesa que lobos that was 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.860
 domesticated did not tell us he said and the 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.770
 first play strip is yellow too 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.330
 of the second look speaking I do not know if 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.630
 pérez durán provoked it after knowing what 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.630
 He says 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.090
 run to another side 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:02.460
 because I'm just insulted the referee 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.460
 but it was provoked but 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:16.620
 I am not justifying if the referee 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.620
 flexible and nothing happens 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:27.580
 if he is well expelled 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:28.840
 or under which the referee was going with 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.720
 I want to expel him to see what he says 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.440
 that looking for him was pushing him towards that 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.990
 situation 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.660
 and that the referees not knowing that 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.220
 I answered that the arbitrators do not understand 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.080
 that are not the protagonists and that the 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.080
 that are hot and those that are 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.910
 right they have right or more right by 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:51.300
 the logical situation of the party to be 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:51.300
 hottest with them 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.610
 flatly in the others in what 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.990
 out of place the other than what 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.930
 the pains could have been having been 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.880
 but that terrible provocation and the other 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.680
 you do not have to justify if you were wrong 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.500
 the meeting was wrong it does not matter if it's 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.990
 from the television station another television station this 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.280
 equal to equal dyland the packaging of 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.050
 america personally atlante not what 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.940
 has and so it is so that america suppose 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.740
 nothing the truth is that it was not that this the 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.140
 Atlante probably at the beginning of 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.820
 season today was a match where if you 

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.310
 you can put or you know you can lose 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.670
 We do not go to the Aztec stadium with the voices 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.670
 of the protagonists 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:39.330
 and it was suffered quite expensive 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:42.180
 We lost a good king 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.349
 but after all, it 's a triumph and 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.419
 value the delivery to the players not 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:48.389
 playing with ten at this level is very 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:51.289
 the team could be difficult to overcome 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:54.460
 Adversity will surely be the 

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:56.919
 play of the comment of the week 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:59.319
 there will be many conclusions but I 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:00.490
 arbitration I will not say anything or 

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:02.940
 when it's my turn to please or when it's my turn 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:06.090
 against him they needed him then 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:08.710
 you will only have many 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:11.200
 a lot to analyze about that play 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.490
 if they provoked it they provoked it or if it was 

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.250
 lack was not a fault or if it was yellow 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:17.700
 because then you have to be calm 

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:21.400
 and to think that the team won we went 

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:22.080
 for many passages far superior to 

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.150
 America 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:28.930
 being 11 against 11 and then 11 against 

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:31.750
 10 I think we did not deserve to lose as 

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:34.150
 minimum we deserved the draw but the 

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:36.130
 football is resolved with goals and we 

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.930
 we could not turn it into the elbow 

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.100
 I hope that the directive of the 

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.230
 transition I'm insisting that 

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:43.330
 they show the video by trade and they 

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:44.980
 can suspend the player for the 

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.570
 aggression that I was and good after 

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:49.000
 of the referee the referee added a referee 

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:50.350
 online I think you did not see it in that 

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.770
 moment 

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:55.660
 by the way dad finished with his finger 

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:58.270
 like the sneakers a party of the forms 

00:07:55.660 --> 00:08:01.800
 who took advantage of the professional 

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:01.800
 my respects but
