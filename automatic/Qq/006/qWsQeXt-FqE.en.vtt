 The impact is basically aimed at the bottom of the craft, but actually 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:05.269
 The many cases do not become completely the bottom of which is slightly above 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:09.890

 The market is equally strong in the sky, 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:12.690

 This is the first time Shin Ramyun and House Parkers and too 4 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:42.180

 Steak &amp; - &amp; Push Also like Point Push 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:57.810
 At the same time, 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:59.380
 It is good to have a feeling that the racket is moving forward, 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:05.230
 Can be push 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:05.800

 Old, who has tried to backhand push-push phrase dominion in this way now almost 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:29.560
 It's just like nine minutes without a minute. 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:33.130
 In 100 species as it is, it opens up like that. 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:36.130
 Bonjuk not to give opponents to attack him 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:42.190
 Because you have to give it short in front of the net 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:47.080
 This way, you can not stay in the same position . 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:49.180
 For as close as possible to pray in the propulsion state also went close in the other 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.690
 Into the Fee 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:57.250
 As far as I can get here. 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:06:01.150
 Four tafs. Lightly two. I'm a fly. I can not do anything. 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:04.090
 As fast as possible 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:08.800
 Next to the note , 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:15.580
 Ahninyamyeo see it change a little now when the chance to be the first to be attacked 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:19.060
 So in this way it is old old-fashioned way Ceramics 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:21.780
 In this way, just like digging, 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:26.639
 This newly built 4 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:31.590
 Sack take place one foot forward in entering basic posture that can 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:33.240
 At the same time, pushing the shoulder slightly forward is a shake hand backhand push action 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:37.680

 It is another method by exercise . 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:57.360
 Keep your right shoulder low when you are in the water, 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:02.610
 And 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:05.100
 When the yellow side is moderately dying, the racket is held relatively firmly at impact , 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:09.840
 It gave me stability. 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:12.240
 02 Do not hit the bottom part from bottom to top on 2 towers. 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:17.040
 We have to push. 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:21.720
 While it is speaking so stable because they are relatively easy techniques Fossey also 

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.870
 The rotation is strong, so you can push it down to a suitable position. 

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.980
 You must
