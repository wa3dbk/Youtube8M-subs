00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.309 
second off i remember Sakurai saying
that<00:04:12.090> there<00:04:12.180> were<00:04:12.239> going<00:04:12.360> to<00:04:12.420> be<00:04:12.510> no<00:04:12.690> clones<00:04:13.049> in

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
that there were going to be no clones in

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.589 
that there were going to be no clones in
brawl<00:04:13.620> and<00:04:13.970> everybody<00:04:14.970> kind<00:04:15.150> of<00:04:15.299> attached

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
brawl and everybody kind of attached

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.270 
brawl and everybody kind of attached
themselves<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:16.199> that<00:04:16.470> and<00:04:16.650> then<00:04:16.829> when<00:04:16.859> people

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
themselves to that and then when people

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.699 
themselves to that and then when people
came<00:04:17.400> out<00:04:17.579> with<00:04:17.729> ness<00:04:18.000> and<00:04:18.180> Lucas<00:04:18.709> people

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
came out with ness and Lucas people

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.229 
came out with ness and Lucas people
thought<00:04:19.919> that<00:04:19.979> they<00:04:20.280> were<00:04:20.340> way<00:04:20.729> too<00:04:20.760> similar

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
thought that they were way too similar

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.510 
thought that they were way too similar
if<00:04:21.780> you<00:04:22.109> have<00:04:22.320> both<00:04:22.530> mutants<00:04:23.100> in<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.310> game<00:04:23.490> I

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
if you have both mutants in the game I

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.070 
if you have both mutants in the game I
hope<00:04:23.910> that<00:04:24.060> they<00:04:24.210> don't<00:04:24.330> function<00:04:24.539> like<00:04:24.870> that

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
hope that they don't function like that

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.800 
hope that they don't function like that
yeah<00:04:25.949> most<00:04:26.340> likely<00:04:26.460> if<00:04:26.970> they<00:04:27.150> do<00:04:27.210> put<00:04:27.630> both

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
yeah most likely if they do put both

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.689 
yeah most likely if they do put both
Mewtwo's<00:04:28.199> in<00:04:28.410> it<00:04:28.650> would<00:04:28.800> work<00:04:28.949> best<00:04:29.250> as<00:04:29.460> one

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
Mewtwo's in it would work best as one

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.939 
Mewtwo's in it would work best as one
being<00:04:29.910> more<00:04:30.120> power<00:04:30.360> based<00:04:30.690> slower<00:04:31.470> character

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
being more power based slower character

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:33.710 
being more power based slower character
and<00:04:32.100> one<00:04:32.250> being<00:04:32.460> a<00:04:32.699> weaker<00:04:33.060> speed<00:04:33.479> based

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
and one being a weaker speed based

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.140 
and one being a weaker speed based
character<00:04:34.229> so<00:04:34.500> kind<00:04:34.680> of<00:04:34.740> like<00:04:34.830> a<00:04:34.889> fox<00:04:35.190> wolf<00:04:35.610> or

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
character so kind of like a fox wolf or

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.029 
character so kind of like a fox wolf or
a<00:04:36.180> cap<00:04:36.510> and<00:04:36.539> Falcon<00:04:36.840> can<00:04:37.260> enjoy<00:04:37.470> that's<00:04:37.830> much

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 
a cap and Falcon can enjoy that's much

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.909 
a cap and Falcon can enjoy that's much
better<00:04:38.250> that's<00:04:38.639> for<00:04:38.789> the<00:04:38.850> melee<00:04:39.120> heads<00:04:39.919> with
