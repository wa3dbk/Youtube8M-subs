00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.300 

so<00:00:00.420> this<00:00:00.570> is<00:00:00.659> our<00:00:00.750> most<00:00:00.930> basic<00:00:01.310> singing

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
so this is our most basic singing

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.579 
so this is our most basic singing
exercise<00:00:02.760> I'm<00:00:03.510> going<00:00:03.570> to<00:00:03.840> do<00:00:04.350> it<00:00:04.440> with<00:00:04.560> a

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
exercise I'm going to do it with a

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.680 
exercise I'm going to do it with a
guitar<00:00:04.740> although<00:00:05.580> I<00:00:05.609> think<00:00:05.819> that<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.390> guitar

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
guitar although I think that the guitar

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.600 
guitar although I think that the guitar
or<00:00:06.960> piano<00:00:06.990> will<00:00:07.500> suffice

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
or piano will suffice

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.060 
or piano will suffice
and<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.210> reason<00:00:09.540> for<00:00:09.570> doing<00:00:10.320> your<00:00:10.679> vocal

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
and the reason for doing your vocal

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.740 
and the reason for doing your vocal
exercise<00:00:11.429> with<00:00:11.700> another<00:00:11.969> instrument<00:00:12.450> is<00:00:12.540> just

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
exercise with another instrument is just

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.620 
exercise with another instrument is just
to<00:00:13.530> kind<00:00:13.799> of<00:00:13.920> give<00:00:14.580> yourself<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.910> reference<00:00:15.360> and

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
to kind of give yourself a reference and

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.000 
to kind of give yourself a reference and
stay<00:00:16.350> in<00:00:16.410> tune<00:00:17.720> and<00:00:18.720> practice<00:00:19.350> singing<00:00:19.800> in

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
stay in tune and practice singing in

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.920 
stay in tune and practice singing in
tune<00:00:20.189> another<00:00:20.939> reason<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:21.180> practice<00:00:21.570> singing

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
tune another reason you practice singing

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.779 
tune another reason you practice singing
is<00:00:22.080> not<00:00:22.439> necessarily<00:00:22.949> for<00:00:23.189> being<00:00:23.340> in<00:00:23.430> tune<00:00:23.580> but

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
is not necessarily for being in tune but

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.939 
is not necessarily for being in tune but
to<00:00:23.910> have<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.330> good<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.840> good<00:00:25.109> tone<00:00:27.199> so<00:00:28.199> you're

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
to have a good a good tone so you're

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.529 
to have a good a good tone so you're
thinking<00:00:29.490> about<00:00:29.580> pitch<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.300> you're<00:00:30.449> thinking

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
thinking about pitch and you're thinking

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.319 
thinking about pitch and you're thinking
about<00:00:30.720> tone<00:00:31.140> when<00:00:32.070> you're<00:00:32.219> doing<00:00:32.610> these<00:00:32.730> vocal

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
about tone when you're doing these vocal

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.030 
about tone when you're doing these vocal
exercises

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
exercises

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.100 
exercises
there's<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:36.420> we're<00:00:36.690> going<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.870> start<00:00:37.020> out

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
there's the we're going to start out

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.380 
there's the we're going to start out
using<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.469> vowel<00:00:37.950> sound<00:00:38.250> boom<00:00:38.520> we're<00:00:39.360> going

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
using the vowel sound boom we're going

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.450 
using the vowel sound boom we're going
to<00:00:39.510> start<00:00:39.690> at<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.809> G<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.770> basically<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.160> idea

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
to start at the G and basically the idea

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.880 
to start at the G and basically the idea
is<00:00:41.550> we're<00:00:41.790> going<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.379> try<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.530> take<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.800> as

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
is we're going to try and take it as

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.799 
is we're going to try and take it as
high<00:00:44.040> as<00:00:44.100> we<00:00:44.309> can<00:00:44.430> get<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.730> when<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.570> get<00:00:45.660> to

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
high as we can get it when you get to

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.060 
high as we can get it when you get to
the<00:00:45.899> top<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.260> your<00:00:46.289> range<00:00:46.530> that's<00:00:46.860> when<00:00:46.980> you

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
the top of your range that's when you

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.100 
the top of your range that's when you
really<00:00:47.250> start<00:00:47.340> exercising<00:00:48.210> your<00:00:48.420> your<00:00:48.899> voice

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
really start exercising your your voice

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.020 
really start exercising your your voice
and<00:00:49.559> if<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.160> can<00:00:50.280> increase<00:00:50.489> your<00:00:50.789> range

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
and if you can increase your range

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.340 
and if you can increase your range
you're<00:00:51.390> actually<00:00:51.660> increasing<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:52.079> strength

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
you're actually increasing the strength

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.260 
you're actually increasing the strength
of<00:00:52.530> your<00:00:52.590> voice<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.219> eventually<00:00:54.090> and

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
of your voice and eventually and

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.670 
of your voice and eventually and
ultimately<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.930> makes<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.260> into<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.500> better

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
ultimately it makes you into a better

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.510 
ultimately it makes you into a better
singer<00:00:56.480> so<00:00:57.859> I'm<00:00:58.859> going<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.070> cruise<00:00:59.250> up<00:00:59.430> the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
singer so I'm going to cruise up the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.579 
singer so I'm going to cruise up the
scale<00:00:59.730> now<00:01:00.109> playing<00:01:01.280> domi<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.690> mido<00:01:03.690> three

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
scale now playing domi so mido three

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.539 
scale now playing domi so mido three
times<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.189> then<00:01:05.280> moving<00:01:05.489> up<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.850> half-step

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
times and then moving up a half-step

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:20.450 
times and then moving up a half-step
don't<00:01:08.549> be<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:09.030> mean<00:01:09.240> okay

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.400 

and<00:01:21.460> you<00:01:21.700> want<00:01:21.880> to<00:01:21.940> be<00:01:22.180> sure<00:01:22.390> that<00:01:22.720> your<00:01:23.170> voices
