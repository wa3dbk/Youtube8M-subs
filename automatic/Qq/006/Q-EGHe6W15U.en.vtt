I'm very confident that this particular
rescue<00:00:04.049> plan<00:00:04.290> it<00:00:04.920> doesn't<00:00:05.279> matter<00:00:05.430> how<00:00:06.420> much

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:06.649 
rescue plan it doesn't matter how much

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
confident that's a tough one personally

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.450 
confident that's a tough one personally
it<00:01:07.140> doesn't<00:01:07.200> matter<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.740> that's<00:01:07.950> easy<00:01:08.189> on<00:01:08.430> a

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
it doesn't matter that that's easy on a

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.899 
it doesn't matter that that's easy on a
trader

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
trader

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.340 
trader
I<00:01:09.090> don't<00:01:09.540> really<00:01:09.689> care<00:01:09.900> about<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.110> kind<00:01:10.260> of

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
I don't really care about that kind of

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.980 
I don't really care about that kind of
stuff<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.799> go<00:01:11.430> with<00:01:11.580> what<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.850> if<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.750> see<00:01:12.930> an

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
stuff I go with what the if I see an

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.450 
stuff I go with what the if I see an
opportunity<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.439> make<00:01:13.500> money<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:13.920> go<00:01:14.189> with<00:01:14.310> that

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
opportunity to make money I go with that

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.960 
opportunity to make money I go with that
so<00:01:15.210> for<00:01:16.049> most<00:01:16.200> traders<00:01:16.560> it's<00:01:16.979> not<00:01:17.100> about<00:01:17.340> is

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
so for most traders it's not about is

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.940 
so for most traders it's not about is
that<00:01:18.420> we<00:01:18.540> don't<00:01:18.630> really<00:01:18.810> care<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.200> much<00:01:19.650> how

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.499 
dreaming of this one for three years I
had<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> confession<00:01:31.799> which<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.430> go<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.299> bed

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509

every night a dream of another recession
a<00:01:35.280> dream<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.759> another<00:01:35.880> moment<00:01:36.000> like<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:36.479> why

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
a dream of another moment like this why

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.469 
a dream of another moment like this why
because<00:01:37.140> people<00:01:37.920> don't<00:01:38.610> seem<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.820> maybe

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
because people don't seem to maybe

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.560 
because people don't seem to maybe
remember<00:01:39.900> but<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:41.070> 30s<00:01:41.490> depression<00:01:42.030> the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
remember but the 30s depression the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.870 
remember but the 30s depression the
depression<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.200> 30s<00:01:43.610> wasn't<00:01:44.610> just<00:01:44.759> about

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
depression in the 30s wasn't just about

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.090 
depression in the 30s wasn't just about
a<00:01:45.030> market<00:01:45.479> crash<00:01:45.689> there<00:01:46.590> were<00:01:46.710> some<00:01:46.920> people

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
a market crash there were some people

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.649 
a market crash there were some people
who<00:01:47.250> were<00:01:47.399> prepared<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:48.030> make<00:01:48.299> money<00:01:48.479> from

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
who were prepared to make money from

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.230 
who were prepared to make money from
that<00:01:48.869> crash<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:50.009> think<00:01:50.610> anybody<00:01:50.820> can<00:01:51.119> do

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
that crash and I think anybody can do

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.999 
that crash and I think anybody can do
that<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.630> isn't<00:01:52.020> just<00:01:52.229> for<00:01:52.320> some<00:01:52.500> people<00:01:52.829> in

than 12 months my prediction is that

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:20.869 
than 12 months my prediction is that
savings<00:03:19.349> of<00:03:19.560> millions<00:03:20.220> of<00:03:20.459> people<00:03:20.549> is<00:03:20.759> going

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
savings of millions of people is going

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:24.469 
savings of millions of people is going
to<00:03:20.939> vanish<00:03:21.349> and<00:03:22.349> it's<00:03:22.590> just<00:03:22.829> the<00:03:22.919> beginning<00:03:23.479> so

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:24.479 
to vanish and it's just the beginning so

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:28.819 
to vanish and it's just the beginning so
I<00:03:24.930> would<00:03:25.680> say<00:03:25.859> be<00:03:26.509> prepared<00:03:27.509> and<00:03:27.780> act<00:03:28.290> now<00:03:28.560> the

I would say be prepared and act now the

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.409 
I would say be prepared and act now the
biggest<00:03:29.040> risk<00:03:29.370> people<00:03:29.639> can<00:03:29.909> take<00:03:30.030> right<00:03:30.269> now
