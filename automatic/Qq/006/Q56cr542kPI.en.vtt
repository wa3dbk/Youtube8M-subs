00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.790
 hello everyone here is a new video 

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:05.890
 in this video I will show you the 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.420
 reproduction of this nail art where there 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.490
 they are exactly roses 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.780
 the application of a blue and single color 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.670
 of rhinestones 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.230
 I really hope you like my idea e 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.889
 however follow the tutorial in the 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.889
 detail 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.080
 first let's take a base 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.570
 we apply it on all nails a 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.950
 single colors the base serves to ensure that the 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.990
 next color do not penetrate 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.520
 in the nail staining the and have 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.740
 different functions so there is the base 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.460
 strengthening the active smoothing base 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.170
 growth 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.610
 in short, different functions depending on the 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.170
 your need 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.880
 once the dry base we take 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.890
 our blue rose we go to single color 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.570
 on all the nails of the very states 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.790
 very thin because so much we will give two 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.290
 past she was careful not to touch the 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.150
 skin if you touch it is not a problem 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.100
 why take or pen correct 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.290
 enamel or a little bit of cotton 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.660
 however soaked in solvent and clean 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.270
 precisely where you have soiled you cover well 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.190
 side and the tip leave well that 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.170
 dry the glaze in one pass all 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.670
 another we have the second pass e 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.360
 we wait at least a quarter of an hour before 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.360
 that you dry completely 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.440
 now we learn the necessary to do the 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.470
 our decoration what we need a glass 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.750
 full of water from the foil i 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.180
 our acrylic colors over a brush 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.640
 a punta a 0 that we will always use e 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.710
 only for acrylic colors never for the 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.540
 glazes what we do we put ours 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.590
 white acrylic color on the paper 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.330
 tinfoil 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.369
 take some water and put it on 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.830
 always on the tinfoil area 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.390
 we begin to mix it because the color 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.970
 must be diluted enough to 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.039
 decorate how it must be diluted and must 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.899
 be diluted that visually does not have to 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:52.850
 be too transparent if not is 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.560
 diluted and too much is not good 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.320
 the color doesn't have to be very long 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.750
 full bodied hard because it means that it is 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.270
 diluted the practice with little experience 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.920
 you will be able to use them well the important thing is 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.710
 that you will also notice why 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.019
 making a thin line ass need 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.420
 being able to do the whole line without it 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.950
 never the color stops if the color 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.050
 it stops, it means that it is not 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.580
 sufficiently diluted 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.410
 we mix together as I told you 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.690
 point the two colors when it's ready 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.040
 take our panel the brush 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.400
 and with natural bristles 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.760
 you can buy it where anyway 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.250
 favorite 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.380
 the important thing that you use it as vi 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.880
 I said before just for the acrylic for i 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.190
 acrylic colors because otherwise it will go to 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.840
 ruin what we did take the 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.480
 brush we drink color a 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.310
 sufficiency we begin to decorate with them 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.739
 the rose is the first pass and makes the 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.660
 central pistil and we do it as a 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.400
 a kind of quotation mark when 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.549
 draw you have to hold the brush 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.290
 always well vertical and the elbow well 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.489
 leaning against the table for not having 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.430
 tremors 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.440
 once the central quotation mark is made 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.380
 let's make the first petal and how to do it yes 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.390
 part with the vertical straight brush yes 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.459
 it tilts slightly so it is also used 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.220
 a little belly of the brush to create 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.410
 that lateral arch and then put it back 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.840
 the straight brush I hope so much that 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.910
 from my explanation and from the video yes 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.769
 still able to understand but 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.049
 fortunately, however, you also have the 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.670
 pictures of the photo sex tutorial 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.709
 in the work 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.040
 once made however petals ne 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.630
 I do three and they are made where they remain 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.940
 the open space ie there is a comma 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.890
 quote there is an open space you create 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.020
 the petal the petal is created another 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.900
 part space is thus created depending on 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.910
 of your need the various petals 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.040
 now we move still leaves something 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.750
 you have to do parties and hit and with the 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.580
 vertical brush 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.430
 then slowly draw the house of 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.709
 leaf on one side and then the arch 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.910
 on the other side to join them as 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.319
 you are just seeing from the image i 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.180
 air-dry acrylic colors 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.120
 so you simply have to wait 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.100
 that this dry to embellish it a little 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.230
 let's take our spot potter than not 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.480
 it's something like the pin you used 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.640
 up to now and we do here and there gods 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.739
 dots precisely to embellish the whole 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.660
 as I told you the color he says 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.250
 air dry then dry 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.930
 also very fast and we don't have to 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.370
 wait a lot 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.639
 the important thing that obviously before 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.430
 fix everything with the top coat look for 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.289
 look good that it is very dry bandages 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.690
 they're going to ruin all the decor 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.479
 as you can see I did this note 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.260
 this decoration on the ring finger the average in 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:33.539
 contrast between them that yes 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.830
 they look at the two roses between them and for 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.720
 regarding the number of red from 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.330
 do usually are odd so I have 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.890
 one beyond this picture you are seeing 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.419
 how to clean the 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.760
 brush then you have to put the 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:48.120
 brush in the water clean the tip well 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.250
 upside down a little piece of paper like 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.780
 you are seeing why there must not be 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.940
 absolutely more acrylic color in the 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.410
 brush if it won't dry out and you have to 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.720
 go and throw it so I recommend it 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.729
 cleaning really very important 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.039
 to make it beautiful, others do everything 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.870
 take some top coat it 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:06.140
 positioned in a corner take it 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.400
 strasse simply apply it over 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.380
 we are waiting for everything to come out well 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.210
 and let 's pass our fixer for 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.180
 fix the nail art and make it last longer 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.160
 long the nail polish fix the sides well e 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.450
 the tip because they are the ones who do 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.450
 detach more easily 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.560
 this is my final idea I hope so much 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.110
 that you enjoyed the nail art there is 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.610
 liked and the next a big kiss 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.610
 all but hello
