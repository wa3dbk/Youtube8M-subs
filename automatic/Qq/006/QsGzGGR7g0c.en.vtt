00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
said we've got about 11 inch stretch on

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.090 
said we've got about 11 inch stretch on
this<00:03:01.900> puppy

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.170 

I'll<00:03:06.100> zoom<00:03:06.520> out<00:03:06.700> again<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.210> see<00:03:07.480> if<00:03:07.840> we<00:03:07.960> can

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
I'll zoom out again and see if we can

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.780 
I'll zoom out again and see if we can
get<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.209> better<00:03:10.390> idea<00:03:14.160> now<00:03:15.160> you<00:03:15.220> do<00:03:15.520> lose<00:03:15.760> a

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
get a better idea now you do lose a

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.390 
get a better idea now you do lose a
little<00:03:16.120> bit<00:03:16.480> of<00:03:16.570> your<00:03:16.810> handling<00:03:17.290> with<00:03:18.130> a<00:03:18.160> big

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
little bit of your handling with a big

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.930 
little bit of your handling with a big
fat<00:03:18.610> tire<00:03:18.910> like<00:03:19.180> this<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.780> flat<00:03:20.020> tire<00:03:20.820> but<00:03:21.820> if

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
fat tire like this the flat tire but if

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.570 
fat tire like this the flat tire but if
you<00:03:22.030> go<00:03:22.180> to<00:03:22.239> that<00:03:22.450> round<00:03:22.720> one<00:03:23.190> like<00:03:24.190> I<00:03:24.340> showed

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
you go to that round one like I showed

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.320 
you go to that round one like I showed
you<00:03:24.910> up<00:03:25.209> there<00:03:25.739> then<00:03:26.820> obviously<00:03:27.820> you<00:03:28.150> don't

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
you up there then obviously you don't

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:36.199 
you up there then obviously you don't
lose<00:03:28.570> the<00:03:28.720> handling<00:03:29.110> there

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.809

and<00:04:59.340> cool<00:05:00.500> we<00:05:01.500> also<00:05:01.710> have<00:05:01.979> a<00:05:02.010> custom<00:05:02.490> header

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
and cool we also have a custom header

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.879 
and cool we also have a custom header
built<00:05:03.090> it's<00:05:03.720> not<00:05:03.900> on<00:05:04.020> this<00:05:04.139> particular<00:05:04.320> bike

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
built it's not on this particular bike

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.930 
built it's not on this particular bike
which<00:05:05.220> accommodates<00:05:06.000> a<00:05:06.349> regular<00:05:07.349> muffler<00:05:07.940> we

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
which accommodates a regular muffler we

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.440 
which accommodates a regular muffler we
do<00:05:09.060> it<00:05:09.150> in<00:05:09.240> a<00:05:09.270> carbon<00:05:09.630> fiber<00:05:09.900> or<00:05:10.080> stainless<00:05:11.450> the

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
do it in a carbon fiber or stainless the

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.930 
do it in a carbon fiber or stainless the
header<00:05:13.139> part<00:05:13.349> has<00:05:13.590> to<00:05:13.620> be<00:05:14.010> custom-built

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
header part has to be custom-built

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.300 
header part has to be custom-built
it<00:05:15.120> has<00:05:15.240> to<00:05:15.389> come<00:05:15.599> up<00:05:15.630> and<00:05:15.960> pass<00:05:16.200> the<00:05:16.860> rear

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
it has to come up and pass the rear

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.240 
it has to come up and pass the rear
wheel<00:05:17.610> obviously<00:05:18.590> so<00:05:19.590> that's<00:05:19.620> something<00:05:20.010> we

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
wheel obviously so that's something we

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.140 
wheel obviously so that's something we
have<00:05:20.280> as<00:05:20.639> well<00:05:21.800> this<00:05:22.800> motor<00:05:23.099> swap<00:05:23.430> mount<00:05:23.729> for<00:05:24.120> a

have as well this motor swap mount for a

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.339 
have as well this motor swap mount for a
50<00:05:24.720> cc<00:05:25.320> -<00:05:25.770> 150<00:05:26.460> CC<00:05:27.000> swap<00:05:27.330> we<00:05:27.539> do<00:05:27.660> it<00:05:27.750> in<00:05:27.840> effect<00:05:27.960> I

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:28.349
