00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.520 
one solid piece like itself is on a
ball-joint<00:01:56.009> but<00:01:56.460> none<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.700> these<00:01:56.790> pieces<00:01:57.060> move

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
ball-joint but none of these pieces move

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.020 
ball-joint but none of these pieces move
so<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.590> wrote<00:01:58.829> this<00:01:59.009> rotate<00:01:59.549> this<00:01:59.700> all<00:01:59.909> the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
so you wrote this rotate this all the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.200 
so you wrote this rotate this all the
way<00:02:00.060> up<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.509> there's<00:02:01.290> no<00:02:01.439> real<00:02:01.680> clear<00:02:02.040> peg<00:02:02.399> for

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
way up and there's no real clear peg for

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.080 
way up and there's no real clear peg for
it<00:02:03.530> but<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.619> plastic<00:02:05.040> does<00:02:05.219> kind<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.520> contour

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
it but the plastic does kind of contour

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.710 
it but the plastic does kind of contour
around<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:07.110> sides<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.590> his<00:02:07.710> arms<00:02:08.330> so<00:02:09.330> that's

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
around the sides of his arms so that's

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.309 
around the sides of his arms so that's
pretty<00:02:09.869> much<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.080> best<00:02:10.349> you're<00:02:10.530> going<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.709> get

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
pretty much the best you're going to get

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.589 
pretty much the best you're going to get

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
mode now his heads don't come up very

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.219 
mode now his heads don't come up very
high<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:15.250> back<00:03:15.459> you're<00:03:16.180> kind<00:03:16.569> of<00:03:16.629> prevents<00:03:17.019> it

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:17.229 
high the back you're kind of prevents it

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:21.110 
high the back you're kind of prevents it
from<00:03:17.439> going<00:03:17.530> any<00:03:17.889> higher<00:03:19.319> so<00:03:20.319> he<00:03:20.620> kind<00:03:20.919> of

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
from going any higher so he kind of

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.629 
from going any higher so he kind of
looks<00:03:22.120> more<00:03:22.329> like<00:03:22.479> he's<00:03:23.220> sniffing<00:03:24.220> out<00:03:24.340> prey

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
looks more like he's sniffing out prey

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.229 
looks more like he's sniffing out prey
hunched<00:03:25.629> over<00:03:26.340> then<00:03:27.340> you<00:03:27.759> can<00:03:27.879> really<00:03:28.060> get

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
hunched over then you can really get

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:29.759 
hunched over then you can really get
them<00:03:28.359> you<00:03:29.049> can't<00:03:29.259> really<00:03:29.349> get<00:03:29.500> them<00:03:29.620> any

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
them you can't really get them any

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.729 
them you can't really get them any
higher<00:03:30.959> but<00:03:31.959> because<00:03:32.379> they're<00:03:32.530> on<00:03:32.620> different

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
higher but because they're on different

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.170 
higher but because they're on different
joints<00:03:33.099> you<00:03:33.340> know<00:03:33.459> you<00:03:33.519> can<00:03:33.879> have<00:03:34.060> them

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
joints you know you can have them

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.240 
joints you know you can have them
looking<00:03:34.419> at<00:03:34.540> multiple<00:03:34.659> directions<00:03:35.169> which<00:03:36.099> is

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
looking at multiple directions which is

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.080 
looking at multiple directions which is
pretty<00:03:36.400> cool<00:03:36.609> and<00:03:36.759> of<00:03:36.970> itself<00:03:38.699> so<00:03:39.699> one<00:03:39.849> is<00:03:39.970> own

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
pretty cool and of itself so one is own

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.429 
pretty cool and of itself so one is own
i<00:03:40.209> mean<00:03:40.389> like<00:03:40.569> he<00:03:40.689> goes<00:03:40.870> from<00:03:40.989> a<00:03:41.109> fairly

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:41.439 
i mean like he goes from a fairly

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:43.379 
i mean like he goes from a fairly
reasonable<00:03:41.919> rowbottom<00:03:42.430> to<00:03:42.549> a<00:03:42.609> pretty<00:03:43.060> cool

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
reasonable rowbottom to a pretty cool

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:47.069 
reasonable rowbottom to a pretty cool
beast<00:03:43.720> mode<00:03:43.959> which<00:03:44.620> i<00:03:44.769> really<00:03:44.949> like<00:03:46.079> his

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
beast mode which i really like his

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.719 
beast mode which i really like his
weapon<00:03:47.470> you<00:03:48.370> can<00:03:48.549> store<00:03:48.849> it<00:03:48.939> he's<00:03:49.540> got<00:03:49.720> a<00:03:50.729> he's

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:51.729

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.819 
got a slot in his butt so he can have a
giant<00:03:56.319> hammer<00:03:56.620> but<00:03:58.349> which<00:03:59.349> looks<00:03:59.590> a<00:03:59.680> little

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
giant hammer but which looks a little

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.460 
giant hammer but which looks a little
bit<00:04:00.009> strange

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
bit strange

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.730 
bit strange
you<00:04:02.370> can<00:04:02.490> lay<00:04:02.610> it<00:04:02.730> on<00:04:02.850> its<00:04:02.880> side<00:04:03.120> but<00:04:04.110> again<00:04:04.620> you

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
you can lay it on its side but again you

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.290 
you can lay it on its side but again you
don't<00:04:04.830> get<00:04:05.010> much<00:04:05.130> clearance<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.700> best<00:04:05.940> way

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
don't get much clearance the best way

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.060 
don't get much clearance the best way
