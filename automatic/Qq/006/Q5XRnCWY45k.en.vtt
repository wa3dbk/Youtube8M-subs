00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
easily and I was in the struggle camp I

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.969 
easily and I was in the struggle camp I
was<00:01:30.060> just<00:01:30.270> kind<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.509> what<00:01:30.900> are<00:01:31.170> we<00:01:31.320> doing<00:01:31.799> like

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
what is this and so I felt kind of left

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.810 
what is this and so I felt kind of left
behind<00:01:34.560> because<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.189> always<00:01:35.340> had<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.610> work

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
behind because it I always had to work

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.640 
behind because it I always had to work
like<00:01:36.240> extra<00:01:36.780> super<00:01:37.110> hard<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.439> try<00:01:37.619> and

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
like extra super hard to try and

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.649 
like extra super hard to try and
understand<00:01:38.159> something<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.790> understood<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.509> but

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
understand something I understood it but

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.630 
understand something I understood it but
I<00:01:39.720> didn't<00:01:40.079> understand<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.189> but<00:01:41.400> for<00:01:41.610> some

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
I didn't understand it but for some

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.460 
I didn't understand it but for some
reason<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.150> was<00:01:42.299> just<00:01:42.329> not<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.140> way<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.259> my

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
reason it was just not the way that my

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.760 
reason it was just not the way that my
brain<00:01:43.619> took<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:45.090> was<00:01:45.270> just

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
brain took it in and it was just

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.499 
brain took it in and it was just
dramatic<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.070> just<00:01:47.670> genuinely<00:01:47.939> used<00:01:48.390> to

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
dramatic I just genuinely used to

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.840 
dramatic I just genuinely used to
believe<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:49.110> just<00:01:49.229> was<00:01:49.799> not<00:01:50.009> good<00:01:50.430> at<00:01:50.610> math

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
believe that I just was not good at math

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.359 
believe that I just was not good at math
math<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.570> such<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.780> gross<00:01:52.170> swear<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.770> actually

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
math is such a gross swear it actually

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.399

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
that's one my hatred of math started I

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.490 
that's one my hatred of math started I
wanted<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:11.940> badly<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.510> be<00:02:12.810> so<00:02:13.110> good<00:02:13.380> at

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
I was worried that people wouldn't think

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.040 
I was worried that people wouldn't think
that<00:02:17.610> I<00:02:17.640> was<00:02:17.819> good<00:02:18.030> enough<00:02:18.060> or<00:02:18.569> smart<00:02:18.750> enough

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
that I was good enough or smart enough

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.820 
that I was good enough or smart enough
or<00:02:20.120> type<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.360> enough<00:02:21.390> it's<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.440> self-fulfilling

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.800 
or type a enough it's a self-fulfilling
prophecy<00:02:23.130> because<00:02:23.819> when<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.239> really<00:02:24.569> just

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
prophecy because when you really just

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.000 
prophecy because when you really just
don't<00:02:25.050> think<00:02:25.380> you're<00:02:25.500> good<00:02:25.680> at<00:02:25.769> something

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
don't think you're good at something

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.070 
don't think you're good at something
then<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.750> don't<00:02:27.750> try<00:02:27.989> as<00:02:28.200> hard<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:30.080> you

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
then you don't try as hard and you you

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.710 
then you don't try as hard and you you
just<00:02:31.140> start<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.370> believe<00:02:32.549> what<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.120> say<00:02:33.150> even

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
just start to believe what you say even

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.020 
just start to believe what you say even
if<00:02:33.930> it's<00:02:34.049> not<00:02:34.170> true<00:02:34.410> I<00:02:34.650> don't<00:02:35.400> like<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.790> idea

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
if it's not true I don't like the idea

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.280 
if it's not true I don't like the idea
that<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.239> have<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.420> choose<00:02:36.720> like<00:02:36.900> either<00:02:37.140> you

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
that you have to choose like either you

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.630 
that you have to choose like either you
have<00:02:37.410> this<00:02:37.560> type<00:02:37.769> of<00:02:37.920> brain<00:02:38.130> and<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.519> are

any<00:02:41.160> math<00:02:41.640> or<00:02:41.910> science<00:02:42.150> sometimes<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:43.049> have<00:02:43.500> to

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
any math or science sometimes I have to

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.229 
any math or science sometimes I have to
fit<00:02:43.830> into<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.040> box<00:02:44.340> that<00:02:44.580> I<00:02:44.640> just<00:02:44.849> don't<00:02:45.150> know

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
fit into a box that I just don't know

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.650 
fit into a box that I just don't know
how<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.450> fit<00:02:45.690> into<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.230> I<00:02:46.290> don't<00:02:46.319> know<00:02:46.620> why<00:02:46.890> or

how to fit into and I don't know why or

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.000 
how to fit into and I don't know why or
your<00:02:48.660> other<00:02:48.870> choice<00:02:49.200> is<00:02:49.440> you<00:02:49.560> can<00:02:49.680> be<00:02:49.769> super

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
your other choice is you can be super

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.860 
your other choice is you can be super
smart<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.579> very<00:02:50.670> academic<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.540> know<00:02:51.690> math

smart and very academic and know math

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.420 
smart and very academic and know math
and<00:02:52.019> science<00:02:52.290> but<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:52.470> have<00:02:52.620> no<00:02:52.799> creative

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
from what I can tell I try to think of

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.620 
from what I can tell I try to think of
what<00:02:58.890> I<00:02:58.920> do<00:02:59.099> know<00:02:59.579> instead<00:03:00.030> of<00:03:00.090> what<00:03:00.299> I<00:03:00.329> don't

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
what I do know instead of what I don't

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.150 
what I do know instead of what I don't
know<00:03:00.780> because<00:03:01.049> I<00:03:01.079> think<00:03:01.230> if<00:03:01.769> you<00:03:01.920> think<00:03:02.040> about

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
know because I think if you think about

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.110 
know because I think if you think about
what<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.370> don't<00:03:02.519> know<00:03:02.700> you're<00:03:02.850> just<00:03:02.880> gonna

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
have a daughter that had a love for math

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.699
