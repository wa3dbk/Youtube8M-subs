00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
instead of octopus but for some reason

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.479

the<00:00:51.600> takoyaki<00:00:52.199> restaurants<00:00:52.890> just<00:00:52.920> don't<00:00:53.309> do

the takoyaki restaurants just don't do
it<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.789> guess<00:00:53.940> it's<00:00:54.149> just<00:00:54.239> their<00:00:54.539> tradition<00:00:54.930> or

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
it I guess it's just their tradition or

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.139 
it I guess it's just their tradition or
something<00:00:55.110> but<00:00:55.590> they<00:00:55.710> just<00:00:55.829> don't<00:00:56.100> give<00:00:57.059> you

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
any other option so they'll be

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.500
