if you're familiar with them but they

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.830 
if you're familiar with them but they
make<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.659> very<00:01:37.079> very<00:01:37.829> good<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.549> easy<00:01:39.030> mounting

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
make a very very good and easy mounting

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.660 
make a very very good and easy mounting
system<00:01:40.229> for<00:01:40.439> belts<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.890> it's<00:01:41.009> quick<00:01:41.220> on<00:01:41.369> quick

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
system for belts and it's quick on quick

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.760 
system for belts and it's quick on quick
off<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.150> what<00:01:42.689> i<00:01:42.720> would<00:01:42.990> do<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.320> instead<00:01:43.619> of

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
off and what i would do is instead of

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.010 
off and what i would do is instead of
just<00:01:43.920> tearing<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.909> loop<00:01:45.270> up<00:01:45.540> cutting<00:01:45.869> the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
just tearing this loop up cutting the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.510 
just tearing this loop up cutting the
loop<00:01:46.170> up<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.619> just<00:01:46.710> making<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.189> basically

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
loop up and just making it basically

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.609 
loop up and just making it basically
trash<00:01:47.909> i<00:01:48.240> would<00:01:48.630> just<00:01:48.750> get<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.930> drill<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.290> drill

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
trash i would just get a drill and drill

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.080 
trash i would just get a drill and drill
out<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.890> rivets<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.790> know<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:50.970> can

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
out the rivets and you know you can

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.670 
out the rivets and you know you can
apply<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.810> anything<00:01:52.079> else<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.649> just

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
apply this to anything else you just

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.920 
apply this to anything else you just
take<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.340> idea<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.850> run<00:01:54.119> with<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.390> but<00:01:54.899> i

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
take this idea and run with it but i

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.600 
take this idea and run with it but i
would<00:01:55.140> drive<00:01:55.350> out<00:01:55.470> drill<00:01:55.950> out<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.100> rivets

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
would drive out drill out the rivets

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.999 
would drive out drill out the rivets
throw<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.299> in<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.570> little<00:01:57.750> tote<00:01:58.140> or<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.469> tub<00:01:58.799> with

sudden you have a nice neat professional

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.260 
sudden you have a nice neat professional
little<00:02:08.160> loop<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.489> can<00:02:08.550> put<00:02:08.910> on<00:02:09.000> something

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
little loop you can put on something

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.780 
little loop you can put on something
else<00:02:09.569> or<00:02:09.959> just<00:02:10.289> reattach<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.520> same

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
else or just reattach it to the same

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.030 
else or just reattach it to the same
sheath<00:02:12.150> but<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:12.840> would<00:02:13.110> take<00:02:13.349> this<00:02:13.590> off

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
sheath but I would take this off

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.770 
sheath but I would take this off
and<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.670> would<00:02:14.849> put<00:02:15.060> one<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.269> those<00:02:15.360> double

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
and I would put one of those double

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.839 
and I would put one of those double
keepers<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.439> has<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.799> four<00:02:17.040> snaps<00:02:17.370> instead

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
keepers that has the four snaps instead

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.330 
keepers that has the four snaps instead
of<00:02:17.969> just<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.239> two<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.719> I<00:02:19.170> would<00:02:19.379> just<00:02:19.530> see<00:02:20.189> how

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
of just the two and I would just see how

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.280 
of just the two and I would just see how
that<00:02:20.579> goes<00:02:20.609> and<00:02:20.879> hopefully<00:02:21.569> it<00:02:21.870> being<00:02:22.170> the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
that goes and hopefully it being the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.990 
that goes and hopefully it being the
double<00:02:22.620> keeper<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.189> would<00:02:23.340> hold<00:02:23.549> the<00:02:23.790> weight

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
double keeper it would hold the weight

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.559 
double keeper it would hold the weight
and<00:02:24.950> also<00:02:25.950> with<00:02:26.549> that<00:02:26.849> because<00:02:27.030> it's<00:02:27.269> a<00:02:27.359> long

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
and also with that because it's a long

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.330 
and also with that because it's a long
blade<00:02:27.900> it's<00:02:28.140> going<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.349> travel<00:02:28.590> far<00:02:28.980> down<00:02:29.189> your

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
blade it's going to travel far down your

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.819 
blade it's going to travel far down your
leg<00:02:29.579> where<00:02:30.120> if<00:02:30.269> you<00:02:30.420> use<00:02:30.629> to<00:02:30.810> keep<00:02:31.049> her<00:02:31.260> instead

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
leg where if you use to keep her instead

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:33.380 
leg where if you use to keep her instead
of<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:32.099> mounting<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.670> top<00:02:32.939> of<00:02:32.970> your<00:02:33.120> belt

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
of it mounting to the top of your belt

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.330 
of it mounting to the top of your belt
here<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:34.140> would<00:02:34.319> come<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.739> here<00:02:35.010> so<00:02:35.189> it

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
here it would come to here so it

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.309 
here it would come to here so it
actually<00:02:35.519> raise<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.269> up<00:02:36.359> a<00:02:36.510> little<00:02:36.659> bit<00:02:36.930> kind

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
actually raise it up a little bit kind

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.020 
actually raise it up a little bit kind
of<00:02:37.439> like<00:02:37.590> a<00:02:37.620> high-riding<00:02:38.159> holster<00:02:38.819> for<00:02:38.970> a
