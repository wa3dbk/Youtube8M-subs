put two cables together so you can see
the<00:00:40.930> right<00:00:41.200> twist<00:00:41.500> and<00:00:41.890> the<00:00:42.130> left<00:00:42.340> twist<00:00:43.080> and

the right twist and the left twist and
I've<00:00:44.680> put<00:00:44.890> a<00:00:44.920> couple<00:00:44.980> of<00:00:45.250> stitches<00:00:45.370> between<00:00:45.820> it

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
I've put a couple of stitches between it

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.290 
I've put a couple of stitches between it
now<00:00:46.630> the<00:00:46.690> other<00:00:47.020> thing<00:00:47.410> you<00:00:47.710> need<00:00:47.830> to

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
now the other thing you need to

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.340 
now the other thing you need to
understand<00:00:49.300> too<00:00:49.540> is<00:00:49.690> that<00:00:49.810> as<00:00:50.020> you're<00:00:50.230> doing

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
understand too is that as you're doing

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.780 
understand too is that as you're doing
your<00:00:50.530> cables

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
your cables

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.910 
your cables
you<00:00:52.120> could<00:00:52.330> have<00:00:52.570> a<00:00:52.840> four<00:00:53.170> stitch<00:00:53.470> a<00:00:53.680> six

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
you could have a four stitch a six

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.680 
you could have a four stitch a six
stitch<00:00:54.390> 810<00:00:55.390> stitch<00:00:55.900> cable<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:57.610> don't<00:00:58.450> like

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
stitch 810 stitch cable I don't like

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.420 
stitch 810 stitch cable I don't like
going<00:00:58.840> over<00:00:59.140> ten<00:00:59.470> stitches<00:00:59.740> for<00:01:00.070> a<00:01:00.100> cable

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
going over ten stitches for a cable

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.920 
going over ten stitches for a cable
because<00:01:00.730> it<00:01:00.850> makes<00:01:01.000> it<00:01:01.120> very<00:01:01.240> difficult<00:01:01.570> to

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
because it makes it very difficult to

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.049 
because it makes it very difficult to
try<00:01:02.290> to<00:01:02.350> maneuver<00:01:02.770> them<00:01:03.070> and<00:01:03.250> twist<00:01:03.550> them<00:01:03.790> and

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
try to maneuver them and twist them and

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.469 
try to maneuver them and twist them and
keep<00:01:04.839> them<00:01:05.019> laying<00:01:05.290> flat<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.820> your

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
keep them laying flat so your

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.039 
keep them laying flat so your
abbreviation<00:01:08.400> or<00:01:09.400> on<00:01:10.270> your<00:01:10.390> patterns<00:01:10.869> are

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
abbreviation or on your patterns are

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:16.050 
abbreviation or on your patterns are
usually<00:01:11.560> listed<00:01:11.770> as<00:01:12.220> a<00:01:12.549> C<00:01:12.939> for<00:01:13.600> F<00:01:14.850> which<00:01:15.850> would

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
usually listed as a C for F which would

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.350 
usually listed as a C for F which would
mean<00:01:16.240> cable<00:01:17.110> for<00:01:17.500> stitches<00:01:18.040> to<00:01:18.490> the<00:01:18.520> front<00:01:18.909> or

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
mean cable for stitches to the front or

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.510 
mean cable for stitches to the front or
a<00:01:19.530> C<00:01:20.530> for<00:01:21.510> B<00:01:22.510> which<00:01:23.229> would<00:01:23.380> be<00:01:23.560> cable<00:01:24.190> for

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
a C for B which would be cable for

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.170 
a C for B which would be cable for
stitches<00:01:25.000> to<00:01:25.360> the<00:01:25.390> back<00:01:25.659> now<00:01:26.320> your<00:01:26.890> rike<00:01:27.220> cable

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
stitches to the back now your rike cable

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.750 
stitches to the back now your rike cable
would<00:01:28.450> go<00:01:28.690> to<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:29.020> back<00:01:29.260> so<00:01:30.100> that<00:01:30.130> means<00:01:30.520> as

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
would go to the back so that means as

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.610 
would go to the back so that means as
I'm<00:01:30.940> using<00:01:31.150> my<00:01:31.299> cable<00:01:31.780> hook<00:01:31.960> I<00:01:32.140> would<00:01:32.350> drop<00:01:32.560> my

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
I'm using my cable hook I would drop my

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.560 
I'm using my cable hook I would drop my
stitches<00:01:33.250> to<00:01:33.520> the<00:01:33.610> back<00:01:33.820> and<00:01:34.150> it<00:01:34.240> would<00:01:34.360> twist

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
stitches to the back and it would twist

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.070 
stitches to the back and it would twist
to<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:34.840> right

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
to the right

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.560 
to the right
and<00:01:35.350> if<00:01:35.860> I<00:01:36.010> want<00:01:36.280> it<00:01:36.430> to<00:01:36.549> twist<00:01:36.790> to<00:01:37.000> the<00:01:37.090> left<00:01:37.120> I

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
and if I want it to twist to the left I

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.270 
and if I want it to twist to the left I
would<00:01:37.720> drop<00:01:37.930> my<00:01:37.990> stitches<00:01:38.620> on<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:38.890> cable

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
would drop my stitches on the cable

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.960 
would drop my stitches on the cable
needle<00:01:39.400> to<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.180> front<00:01:40.450> now<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:42.520> other<00:01:42.700> thing

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
needle to the front now the other thing

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.670 
needle to the front now the other thing
too<00:01:43.150> is<00:01:43.180> the<00:01:43.420> number<00:01:43.690> of<00:01:43.869> rows<00:01:44.140> that<00:01:44.170> you<00:01:44.470> have

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
too is the number of rows that you have

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.920 
too is the number of rows that you have
between<00:01:44.950> your<00:01:45.159> cables<00:01:45.610> here<00:01:46.180> I<00:01:46.360> have<00:01:46.600> this<00:01:46.780> as

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
between your cables here I have this as

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.770 
between your cables here I have this as
a<00:01:46.960> four<00:01:47.260> stitch<00:01:47.500> cable<00:01:48.010> so<00:01:49.000> we're<00:01:49.299> working<00:01:49.450> it

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
a four stitch cable so we're working it

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.350 
a four stitch cable so we're working it
on<00:01:49.960> four<00:01:50.290> stitches<00:01:50.530> and<00:01:50.920> I've<00:01:51.369> used<00:01:51.700> four<00:01:52.060> rows

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
on four stitches and I've used four rows

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.789 
on four stitches and I've used four rows
so<00:01:52.630> you<00:01:52.720> can<00:01:52.900> see<00:01:53.110> here<00:01:53.350> that<00:01:53.440> we<00:01:53.560> have<00:01:53.590> a

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
so you can see here that we have a

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.310 
so you can see here that we have a
little<00:01:54.070> tighter<00:01:54.400> cable<00:01:54.939> and<00:01:55.119> then<00:01:55.810> as<00:01:55.960> I<00:01:56.110> moved

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
little tighter cable and then as I moved

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.219 
little tighter cable and then as I moved
up<00:01:56.470> I've<00:01:56.680> got<00:01:56.860> the<00:01:56.979> same<00:01:57.189> stitches<00:01:57.549> here<00:01:58.060> and

what I have done on this one I've
increased<00:02:00.970> and<00:02:01.330> put<00:02:01.510> six<00:02:01.869> stitches<00:02:02.500> so<00:02:03.040> I've

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
increased and put six stitches so I've

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.250 
increased and put six stitches so I've
added<00:02:03.280> one<00:02:03.640> extra<00:02:03.670> so<00:02:04.570> we've<00:02:04.720> got<00:02:04.900> a<00:02:04.930> six

going right and left and that is done
over<00:02:35.349> like<00:02:35.709> I<00:02:35.859> say<00:02:36.069> eight<00:02:36.310> stitches<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:37.120> I<00:02:38.049> use

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
over like I say eight stitches and I use

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.949 
over like I say eight stitches and I use
ten<00:02:39.159> rows<00:02:39.459> so<00:02:40.060> when<00:02:40.239> you're<00:02:40.390> doing<00:02:40.510> this<00:02:40.780> a
