actually<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.160> lot<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.420> talks<00:00:22.170> about<00:00:22.529> it

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
actually a lot of the talks about it

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.830 
actually a lot of the talks about it
were<00:00:22.769> initially<00:00:23.070> in<00:00:23.400> new<00:00:24.180> york<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.600> i<00:00:24.630> thought

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
were initially in new york and i thought

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.349 
were initially in new york and i thought
about<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.170> for<00:00:25.199> many<00:00:25.439> years<00:00:25.849> but<00:00:26.849> i<00:00:26.910> ended<00:00:27.119> up

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
about it for many years but i ended up

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.019 
about it for many years but i ended up
dating<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.349> Spanish<00:00:28.740> woman<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.310> when<00:00:29.609> we<00:00:29.789> lived

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
dating a Spanish woman and when we lived

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.420 
dating a Spanish woman and when we lived
all<00:00:30.390> over<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.840> world<00:00:30.960> for<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.529> number<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.340> years

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
all over the world for a number of years

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.930 
all over the world for a number of years
so<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:32.850> ran<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.450> from<00:00:34.130> everywhere<00:00:35.130> essentially

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
so I ran it from everywhere essentially

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.840 
so I ran it from everywhere essentially
so<00:00:36.450> like<00:00:36.989> an<00:00:37.140> online<00:00:37.649> software<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.340> anyone

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
so like an online software that anyone

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.110 
so like an online software that anyone
can<00:00:38.940> login<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.480> from<00:00:39.989> from<00:00:40.290> anywhere<00:00:40.700> was<00:00:41.700> was

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
can login to from from anywhere was was

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.920 
can login to from from anywhere was was
critical<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.820> we<00:00:44.820> built<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.180> virtual<00:00:45.690> team

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
critical and we built a virtual team

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.740 
critical and we built a virtual team
literally<00:00:46.620> all<00:00:46.860> over<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.430> world<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.629> to

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
literally all over the world to the to

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.529 
literally all over the world to the to
the<00:00:48.780> point<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.170> even<00:00:49.530> now<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.370> haven't<00:00:51.090> met<00:00:51.270> at

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
the point that even now I haven't met at

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.799 
the point that even now I haven't met at
least<00:00:51.840> half<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.559> people<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.190> person<00:00:53.809> yet

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
least half of the people in person yet

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.600 
least half of the people in person yet
have<00:00:55.020> quite<00:00:55.440> deep<00:00:55.649> relationships<00:00:56.280> with<00:00:56.460> them

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
have quite deep relationships with them

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.020 
have quite deep relationships with them
so<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.660> internet<00:00:57.870> was<00:00:58.140> was<00:00:59.030> absolutely

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
so the internet was was absolutely

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.060 
so the internet was was absolutely
critical<00:01:00.480> otherwise<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.230> would<00:01:01.680> have<00:01:01.710> had<00:01:01.920> to

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
critical otherwise I would have had to

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.219 
critical otherwise I would have had to
stay<00:01:02.280> here<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.699> we<00:01:03.660> also<00:01:03.780> never<00:01:03.930> had<00:01:04.170> an

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
stay here and we also never had an

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.120 
stay here and we also never had an
office<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:09.170> well<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.229> think<00:01:10.290> it's<00:01:10.920> been<00:01:11.100> a

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
office so well I think it's been a

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.289 
office so well I think it's been a
really<00:01:11.880> radical<00:01:12.450> change<00:01:12.960> its<00:01:13.170> moved<00:01:13.409> from

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
really radical change its moved from

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.420 
really radical change its moved from
needing<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.479> live<00:01:15.869> in<00:01:16.020> one<00:01:16.200> place<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:17.100> and

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
needing to live in one place and and

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.090 
needing to live in one place and and
work<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:18.060> an<00:01:18.180> office<00:01:18.390> where<00:01:18.960> we're<00:01:19.380> with<00:01:19.680> all

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
work in an office where we're with all

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.670 
work in an office where we're with all
of<00:01:20.220> your<00:01:20.369> colleagues<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:21.630> really<00:01:22.259> be<00:01:22.439> able<00:01:22.470> to

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
of your colleagues to really be able to

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.700 
of your colleagues to really be able to
live<00:01:22.860> anywhere<00:01:23.790> around<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.869> world<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.259> work

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
live anywhere around the world and work

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.520 
live anywhere around the world and work
very<00:01:25.950> easily<00:01:26.580> with<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.750> virtual<00:01:28.140> team<00:01:28.380> of

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
very easily with the virtual team of

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.710 
very easily with the virtual team of
people<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:29.159> it's<00:01:29.520> it's<00:01:29.820> transformed<00:01:30.509> it's

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
people so it's it's transformed it's

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.620 
people so it's it's transformed it's
made<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.140> lot<00:01:31.350> less<00:01:31.890> expensive<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.790> it's<00:01:33.509> a

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
made a lot less expensive and it's a

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.289 
made a lot less expensive and it's a
it's<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.320> made<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.310> lot<00:01:35.430> more<00:01:35.490> interesting<00:01:35.909> I

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
it's a made it a lot more interesting I

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.530 
it's a made it a lot more interesting I
think<00:01:36.600> people<00:01:36.720> are<00:01:36.900> realizing<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:38.270> they<00:01:39.270> can

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
think people are realizing that they can

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.850 
think people are realizing that they can
move<00:01:40.200> around<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.950> enjoy<00:01:42.560> they're<00:01:43.560> able<00:01:43.710> to

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
move around and enjoy they're able to

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.630 
move around and enjoy they're able to
work<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.670> work<00:01:45.540> remotely<00:01:45.930> often<00:01:46.649> earning

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
work and work remotely often earning

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.080 
work and work remotely often earning
Western<00:01:48.119> wages<00:01:48.659> or<00:01:49.250> earning<00:01:50.250> high<00:01:50.399> wages<00:01:50.700> and

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
Western wages or earning high wages and

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.280 
Western wages or earning high wages and
paying<00:01:51.600> having<00:01:52.020> low<00:01:52.170> low<00:01:52.500> expenses<00:01:53.070> or<00:01:54.290> moving

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
paying having low low expenses or moving

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.679 
paying having low low expenses or moving
from<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.590> winter<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.250> summer<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.939> so

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
from the winter to the summer and so

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.810 
from the winter to the summer and so
there<00:01:58.079> are<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.380> lot<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.530> advantages<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.460> also

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
there are a lot of advantages to it also

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.719 
there are a lot of advantages to it also
to<00:01:59.939> sort<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.180> get<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.780> getting<00:02:01.079> away<00:02:01.700> so<00:02:02.700> I

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
to sort of get it getting away so I

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.190 
to sort of get it getting away so I
think<00:02:02.850> digital<00:02:03.270> nomads<00:02:03.659> are<00:02:03.750> just<00:02:03.930> people<00:02:04.049> who

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
think digital nomads are just people who

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.679 
think digital nomads are just people who
take<00:02:04.380> advantage<00:02:04.439> of<00:02:05.159> digital<00:02:05.549> technology<00:02:05.759> in

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
take advantage of digital technology in

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.609 
take advantage of digital technology in
order<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.759> continue<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:09.000> do<00:02:09.119> their<00:02:09.270> work<00:02:09.619> but

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
order to continue to do their work but

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.070 
order to continue to do their work but
in<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.830> location<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.489> might<00:02:11.819> be<00:02:12.000> better<00:02:12.180> for

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
in the location that might be better for

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.860 
in the location that might be better for
financial<00:02:13.800> reasons<00:02:14.190> or<00:02:14.520> temperature<00:02:15.420> reasons

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
financial reasons or temperature reasons

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.350 
financial reasons or temperature reasons
or<00:02:16.200> maybe<00:02:17.040> they're<00:02:17.220> just<00:02:17.310> spending<00:02:17.640> time<00:02:17.670> with

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
or maybe they're just spending time with

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.710 
or maybe they're just spending time with
family<00:02:18.540> or<00:02:18.840> friends<00:02:23.270> well<00:02:24.270> I<00:02:24.300> think<00:02:24.420> they're

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
family or friends well I think they're

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.680 
family or friends well I think they're
probably<00:02:24.870> two<00:02:25.320> big<00:02:26.250> areas<00:02:26.520> that<00:02:26.910> it's<00:02:27.000> changed

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
probably two big areas that it's changed

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
probably two big areas that it's changed
one<00:02:27.960> is<00:02:28.200> just<00:02:28.410> on<00:02:29.370> demand<00:02:29.820> software<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:31.260> sort

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
one is just on demand software so sort

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.010 
one is just on demand software so sort
of<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.860> google<00:02:32.580> docs<00:02:32.820> etc<00:02:33.150> of<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.660> world<00:02:33.840> i

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
of the google docs etc of the world i

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.420 
of the google docs etc of the world i
think<00:02:34.230> that<00:02:34.410> like<00:02:34.440> was<00:02:34.770> computing<00:02:35.280> in<00:02:35.340> the

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
think that like was computing in the

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.600 
think that like was computing in the
cloud<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:35.940> i<00:02:36.690> love<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.440> I<00:02:37.590> think<00:02:37.980> it's<00:02:38.130> I<00:02:38.370> think

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
cloud I i love it I think it's I think

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.980 
cloud I i love it I think it's I think
it's<00:02:38.850> amazing<00:02:39.630> that<00:02:39.930> I've<00:02:40.970> installed

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
it's amazing that I've installed

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.320 
it's amazing that I've installed
reinstalled<00:02:42.990> uninstalled<00:02:43.950> way<00:02:44.940> too<00:02:45.000> much

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
reinstalled uninstalled way too much

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.320 
reinstalled uninstalled way too much
software<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.110> so<00:02:46.800> I<00:02:47.160> really<00:02:48.030> love<00:02:48.210> the

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
software and so I really love the

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.110 
software and so I really love the
simplicity<00:02:48.480> of<00:02:48.990> cloud<00:02:49.950> cloud<00:02:50.370> computing<00:02:50.970> and

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
simplicity of cloud cloud computing and

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.710 
simplicity of cloud cloud computing and
Google<00:02:52.020> Docs<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.280> gmail<00:02:54.240> and<00:02:54.600> any

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
sort of sort of online software that I

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.890 
sort of sort of online software that I
don't<00:02:56.850> have<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:57.030> install<00:02:57.270> on<00:02:57.390> my<00:02:57.420> computer

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
don't have to install on my computer

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.810 
don't have to install on my computer
that<00:02:57.930> I<00:02:58.050> can<00:02:58.170> access<00:02:58.560> from<00:02:58.740> anywhere<00:02:59.130> around

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
that I can access from anywhere around

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.180 
that I can access from anywhere around
the<00:03:00.420> world<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.930> say<00:03:01.500> that's<00:03:01.709> a<00:03:01.830> big<00:03:01.980> one<00:03:02.100> the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
the world I say that's a big one the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.949 
the world I say that's a big one the
other<00:03:02.310> one<00:03:02.370> that's<00:03:03.060> really<00:03:03.330> changed<00:03:03.630> is

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
other one that's really changed is

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.470 
other one that's really changed is
communication<00:03:04.680> so<00:03:05.600> skype<00:03:07.940> skype<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.180> big

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
communication so skype skype is a big

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.620 
communication so skype skype is a big
one<00:03:09.660> both<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.740> other<00:03:11.220> just<00:03:11.630> instant

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
one both and other just instant

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.390 
one both and other just instant
messaging<00:03:12.990> platforms<00:03:13.920> i<00:03:14.070> think<00:03:14.250> that's

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
messaging platforms i think that's

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.570 
messaging platforms i think that's
really<00:03:14.580> huge<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.030> voice<00:03:15.660> over<00:03:15.870> IP<00:03:16.220> and<00:03:17.220> and

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
really huge and voice over IP and and

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.009 
really huge and voice over IP and and
video<00:03:19.010> that's<00:03:20.010> really<00:03:20.450> transform<00:03:21.450> things<00:03:21.720> may

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
video that's really transform things may

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.570 
video that's really transform things may
it's<00:03:22.200> made<00:03:22.380> it<00:03:22.470> very<00:03:22.739> easy<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:23.340> inexpensive

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
it's made it very easy and inexpensive

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.509 
it's made it very easy and inexpensive
to<00:03:24.269> communicate<00:03:24.840> with<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.380> big<00:03:25.950> team<00:03:26.220> from

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
to communicate with the big team from

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.850 
to communicate with the big team from
around<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.910> world<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.300> so<00:03:27.480> I'd<00:03:28.380> say<00:03:28.560> that's<00:03:28.680> a

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
around the world and so I'd say that's a

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.620 
around the world and so I'd say that's a
really<00:03:29.130> that's<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:29.459> really<00:03:29.670> big<00:03:29.850> one<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:30.239> then

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
really that's a really big one and then

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.430 
really that's a really big one and then
mobile<00:03:30.989> phones<00:03:31.260> that<00:03:32.250> do<00:03:32.880> email<00:03:33.600> and<00:03:34.019> instant

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
mobile phones that do email and instant

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.430 
mobile phones that do email and instant
messaging<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.670> all<00:03:36.180> that<00:03:36.420> also<00:03:37.050> really

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
messaging and and all that also really

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.140 
messaging and and all that also really
transform<00:03:38.160> things<00:03:38.400> they<00:03:38.610> made<00:03:38.820> it<00:03:38.940> so<00:03:39.120> that

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
transform things they made it so that

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.630 
transform things they made it so that
you<00:03:39.330> can<00:03:39.540> get<00:03:40.380> away<00:03:40.530> with<00:03:40.950> having<00:03:41.100> this<00:03:41.340> tiny

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
you can get away with having this tiny

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.190 
you can get away with having this tiny
little<00:03:41.760> thing<00:03:42.030> in<00:03:42.120> your<00:03:42.209> pocket<00:03:42.360> for<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.019> most

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
little thing in your pocket for the most

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:50.930 
little thing in your pocket for the most
part<00:03:43.459> which<00:03:44.459> is<00:03:44.610> great<00:03:49.459> well<00:03:50.459> I<00:03:50.489> think<00:03:50.610> one<00:03:50.910> of

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
part which is great well I think one of

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.610 
part which is great well I think one of
the<00:03:51.060> great<00:03:51.300> things<00:03:51.330> about<00:03:51.780> it<00:03:51.989> is<00:03:52.200> you<00:03:52.410> don't

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
the great things about it is you don't

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.590 
the great things about it is you don't
get<00:03:53.190> sidetracked<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:54.180> in<00:03:54.810> I<00:03:56.300> think<00:03:57.300> it's<00:03:57.390> hard

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
get sidetracked and in I think it's hard

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.390 
get sidetracked and in I think it's hard
not<00:03:57.810> to<00:03:58.019> get<00:03:58.080> sidetracked<00:03:58.350> into<00:03:58.739> are<00:03:59.220> they

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
not to get sidetracked into are they

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.580 
not to get sidetracked into are they
male<00:03:59.820> or<00:03:59.850> they<00:04:00.209> female<00:04:00.690> are<00:04:00.840> they<00:04:00.959> young<00:04:01.230> are

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
male or they female are they young are

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.370 
male or they female are they young are
they<00:04:01.709> old<00:04:02.250> what<00:04:02.910> are<00:04:03.000> they<00:04:03.090> like<00:04:03.300> in<00:04:03.690> person<00:04:03.959> so
