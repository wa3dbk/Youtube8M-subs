00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
the second big difference is that the

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.080 
the second big difference is that the
game<00:02:58.420> plays<00:02:58.690> from<00:02:59.020> a<00:02:59.110> different<00:02:59.440> perspective

behind<00:03:08.140> you<00:03:08.640> this<00:03:09.640> wouldn't<00:03:09.970> be<00:03:10.120> such<00:03:10.300> a<00:03:10.360> big

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
behind you this wouldn't be such a big

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.360 
behind you this wouldn't be such a big
deal<00:03:10.660> but<00:03:11.200> for<00:03:11.440> some<00:03:11.650> reason<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.100> players

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
deal but for some reason the players

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.060 
deal but for some reason the players
seem<00:03:12.670> to<00:03:12.820> be<00:03:12.940> too<00:03:13.210> large<00:03:13.540> for<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.960> court<00:03:14.290> this

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
seem to be too large for the court this

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.560 
seem to be too large for the court this
makes<00:03:15.310> getting<00:03:15.580> to<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:15.910> end<00:03:16.060> of<00:03:16.210> the<00:03:16.300> court

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
makes getting to the end of the court

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.930 
makes getting to the end of the court
and<00:03:16.750> scoring<00:03:17.230> take<00:03:17.470> like<00:03:17.680> two<00:03:18.010> seconds<00:03:18.580> tops

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
and scoring take like two seconds tops

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.120 
and scoring take like two seconds tops
and<00:03:19.270> that's<00:03:19.840> really<00:03:20.200> where<00:03:20.470> this<00:03:20.590> game<00:03:20.860> falls

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
and that's really where this game falls

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.550 
and that's really where this game falls
apart<00:03:21.520> even<00:03:22.270> on<00:03:22.660> easy<00:03:22.990> it's<00:03:23.350> almost

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
apart even on easy it's almost

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.010 
apart even on easy it's almost
impossible<00:03:23.860> to<00:03:24.580> play<00:03:24.730> defense<00:03:24.970> because<00:03:25.900> they

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
impossible to play defense because they

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.980 
impossible to play defense because they
just<00:03:26.320> get<00:03:26.500> to<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.710> basket<00:03:26.890> so<00:03:27.280> quickly<00:03:27.760> and

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
just get to the basket so quickly and

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.020 
just get to the basket so quickly and
even<00:03:28.990> if<00:03:29.080> you<00:03:29.200> do<00:03:29.440> stop<00:03:29.710> them<00:03:29.950> since<00:03:30.640> it's<00:03:30.820> five

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
even if you do stop them since it's five

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.120 
even if you do stop them since it's five
on<00:03:31.210> five<00:03:31.420> they<00:03:31.660> have<00:03:31.840> four<00:03:32.260> other<00:03:32.530> teammates

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
on five they have four other teammates

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.280 
on five they have four other teammates
to<00:03:33.310> pass<00:03:33.490> to<00:03:33.790> who<00:03:34.270> are<00:03:34.390> all<00:03:34.600> less<00:03:34.960> than<00:03:34.990> a

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
to pass to who are all less than a

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.220 
to pass to who are all less than a
second<00:03:35.710> away<00:03:35.770> from<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:36.190> basket<00:03:36.340> too<00:03:36.790> I<00:03:37.230> think

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
second away from the basket too I think

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.710 
second away from the basket too I think
NBA<00:03:38.650> Jam<00:03:39.010> saw<00:03:39.340> these<00:03:39.580> problems<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.240> address

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
NBA Jam saw these problems and address

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.630 
NBA Jam saw these problems and address
them<00:03:40.960> while<00:03:41.350> this<00:03:41.530> game<00:03:41.770> simply<00:03:42.130> lived<00:03:42.430> with

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
them while this game simply lived with

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.880 
them while this game simply lived with
them<00:03:42.820> and<00:03:43.060> in<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:43.600> end<00:03:43.780> that<00:03:44.110> just<00:03:44.380> makes<00:03:44.590> slam

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
them and in the end that just makes slam

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.550 
them and in the end that just makes slam
and<00:03:45.040> jam<00:03:45.100> 95<00:03:45.820> a<00:03:46.060> mediocre<00:03:46.570> basketball<00:03:47.320> game

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
and jam 95 a mediocre basketball game

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
few times and like NBA jam it has some

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.450 
few times and like NBA jam it has some
awesome<00:03:52.960> codes<00:03:53.440> that<00:03:53.680> let<00:03:53.890> you<00:03:54.010> do<00:03:54.160> crazy

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
stuff like dunk from the three-point

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.440 
stuff like dunk from the three-point
line<00:03:56.410> or<00:03:56.890> make<00:03:57.340> your<00:03:57.490> players<00:03:57.760> tiny<00:03:58.120> on<00:03:58.330> the

court which by the way actually makes

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.820 
court which by the way actually makes
the<00:04:00.820> game<00:04:00.940> much<00:04:01.150> more<00:04:01.210> playable<00:04:01.810> but<00:04:02.620> in<00:04:02.740> the

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
the game much more playable but in the

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.440 
the game much more playable but in the
end<00:04:02.980> you're<00:04:03.190> probably<00:04:03.550> better<00:04:03.940> off<00:04:04.090> sticking

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
end you're probably better off sticking

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.380 
end you're probably better off sticking
