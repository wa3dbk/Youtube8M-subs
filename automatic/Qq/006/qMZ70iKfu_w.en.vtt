00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello guys welcome to the same channel and 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.259
 yes I am not a cupcake and today 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.089
 I'll show you how to make some 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.429
 pots made with material from 

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:19.619
 recycling let's see what materials 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:23.670
 we are going to need the materials that 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:27.460
 let's use are a grate like this 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.460
 this you can get in places in 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.650
 where they sell fruit or stuff like that and you 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.400
 can give very low cost to me 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:38.559
 It cost five pesos each or even you 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.670
 you can give them away so it's very easy 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.379
 of getting and we can reuse the 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.780
 driving to you can paint each of 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:49.980
 the bars of the color of your preference and 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.980
 choose white color 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.310
 another material that we are going to use is 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:01.650
 plastic as well as this 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.650
 if you can observe 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.470
 I'm thick material is not weak and what 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.020
 better is that it is super cheap you can 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.790
 get in craft stores or 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.980
 Fabric stores or all materials 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.650
 that we are going to need is land for 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.290
 pots 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.240
 and finally we're going to need some 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.760
 plants in this part you have to be 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.250
 careful and take into account where 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.350
 from your house you want to place your pots 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.960
 I bought these little ones 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.720
 I bought two different ones to place them in 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.030
 our pots but they are very delicate 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.450
 then it just gives them air and they fly 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:43.720
 little flowers and I'm going to use this one that is 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.060
 more resistant to cold air in the sun 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.040
 the rain of all those things and good 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.799
 those are all the materials so it's 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.560
 let's see how you do the first thing 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.960
 we will do it will be cut 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.770
 a piece like this five fingers more 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.140
 big measure of our base here 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.700
 we can see that being five fingers more 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.590
 big 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.080
 the following pieces are going to do 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.830
 exactly tailored or good 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.830
 approximate 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:20.680
 we must have a piece for each side 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.480
 another very important material that I get 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.840
 forgot to mention and I would say that it is 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.069
 the most important is a stapler 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.530
 industrial as well as this 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.500
 this will help us to paste our 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.080
 plastic 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.480
 in this grate once we have 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:42.590
 our five pieces how are you 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:46.299
 we must have one for base 2 in 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:50.520
 these measures and other 2 in these measures 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:54.270
 let's take our base lining 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:57.360
 and the pretty side we're going to put it towards 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.980
 outside and the one on the side that has hairline or 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.800
 I do not know how to make the video we're going to 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.300
 put on the inside we're going to accommodate it from 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.300
 so that we stay like this 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:15.549
 and ready we have the base list here 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.790
 we can do some drilling for 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:21.510
 so the water can run and it does not 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.510
 stay stagnant 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:28.680
 now I'm going to take this rectangle and 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.010
 the same way I'm going to put it in this 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.010
 part 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.570
 and we are going to repeat this procedure with 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.360
 all sides until it is 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:48.570
 completely covered 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:53.150
 we should be staying more or less like this and 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.150
 well I finished and it was like that 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.319
 if this happens to you, nothing happens 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.330
 and good once having in list 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.650
 our flowerpot 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.650
 let's take our land 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:16.079
 and we're going to empty them here to find out 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:19.500
 how much land are necessary 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.690
 and cover very well our 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.650
 so that our parents 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.650
 time 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.569
 once being in this good way 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.749
 let's open a space 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:37.749
 i 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:46.680
 let's try not to touch the root to 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.750
 prevent our plant from getting stressed if 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.050
 you think we need more land we must 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.150
 add a little more 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.300
 and we already drive remember always 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:59.860
 after a transplant they must water very 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.860
 well your plant 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.450
 and well, that was all for the day of 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.930
 today they liked it very much today 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:11.690
 this idea do not forget to subscribe to leave 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.790
 your comments score and above all not 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.160
 miss the following many videos 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.740
 thanks for watching the video and for being part 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.150
 of my twins I love them so much 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.150
 we see in the following bye
