more<00:01:18.729> important<00:01:19.150> role<00:01:19.330> than<00:01:19.390> just<00:01:19.720> being<00:01:19.930> the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
more important role than just being the

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.750

he may be done but I think he still is
Lee<00:02:30.220> is<00:02:30.400> also<00:02:30.430> training<00:02:31.180> under<00:02:31.300> master<00:02:31.690> again

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
Lee is also training under master again

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.840 
Lee is also training under master again
suited<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.350> if<00:02:32.440> he<00:02:32.530> is<00:02:32.739> still<00:02:33.430> training<00:02:33.640> on

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
suited and if he is still training on

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.040 
suited and if he is still training on
your<00:02:33.940> mastery<00:02:34.270> and<00:02:34.420> said<00:02:34.569> then<00:02:34.750> he<00:02:34.870> will<00:02:34.989> be

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
training with Kyrie and I think it'd be

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.430 
training with Kyrie and I think it'd be
kind<00:02:36.730> of<00:02:36.760> interesting<00:02:37.239> to<00:02:37.660> see<00:02:37.810> Kyrie<00:02:38.080> train

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
kind of interesting to see Kyrie train

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.809 
kind of interesting to see Kyrie train
with<00:02:38.650> Lee<00:02:39.280> that<00:02:40.180> make<00:02:40.330> for<00:02:40.569> some<00:02:40.720> interesting

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
with Lee that make for some interesting

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.190 
with Lee that make for some interesting
bonding<00:02:42.819> connection<00:02:43.569> something<00:02:43.870> like<00:02:44.020> that

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
bonding connection something like that

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.260 
bonding connection something like that
maybe<00:02:44.800> Lee<00:02:45.190> would<00:02:45.489> be<00:02:45.610> like<00:02:45.760> oh<00:02:45.940> you<00:02:45.970> know<00:02:46.120> you

Renault she on this that would make no
sense<00:02:52.120> so<00:02:52.420> maybe<00:02:52.989> he<00:02:53.140> wouldn't<00:02:53.350> say<00:02:53.560> that<00:02:53.709> but

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890

Kenny<00:03:17.200> Marc<00:03:17.380> to<00:03:17.560> like<00:03:17.830> like<00:03:18.190> that<00:03:18.370> amazing<00:03:18.790> and

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
Kenny Marc to like like that amazing and

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.920 
Kenny Marc to like like that amazing and
I<00:03:20.079> think<00:03:21.070> she<00:03:21.190> will<00:03:21.310> be<00:03:21.519> the<00:03:22.030> seventh<00:03:22.510> guardian

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
I think she will be the seventh guardian

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.810 
I think she will be the seventh guardian
of<00:03:23.049> light<00:03:23.079> or<00:03:23.739> at<00:03:23.920> least<00:03:24.070> the<00:03:24.160> last<00:03:24.190> person<00:03:24.730> in

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
of light or at least the last person in

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.979 
of light or at least the last person in
during<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.090> seven<00:03:25.360> Guardians<00:03:25.720> of<00:03:25.840> light

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
during the seven Guardians of light

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.259 
during the seven Guardians of light
mostly<00:03:26.890> for<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.070> fact<00:03:27.280> that<00:03:27.370> I<00:03:27.489> feel<00:03:27.790> like<00:03:27.850> Lee

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
mostly for the fact that I feel like Lee

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.120 
mostly for the fact that I feel like Lee
is<00:03:28.510> gonna<00:03:28.720> take<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:28.989> place<00:03:29.170> of<00:03:29.200> Tara<00:03:29.560> and<00:03:29.829> I

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
is gonna take the place of Tara and I

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.530 
is gonna take the place of Tara and I
says<00:03:30.310> multiple<00:03:30.610> times<00:03:30.790> I<00:03:30.940> would<00:03:31.060> love<00:03:31.239> Tara<00:03:31.450> to

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
says multiple times I would love Tara to

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.729 
says multiple times I would love Tara to
be<00:03:31.630> the<00:03:31.720> guardians<00:03:32.019> of<00:03:32.079> light<00:03:32.260> but<00:03:32.440> I<00:03:32.470> don't

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
be the guardians of light but I don't

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:33.840 
be the guardians of light but I don't
think<00:03:32.920> it's<00:03:33.010> been<00:03:33.100> possible<00:03:33.459> this<00:03:33.549> point<00:03:33.790> in

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
think it's been possible this point in

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.580 
think it's been possible this point in
time<00:03:34.000> yet<00:03:34.209> I<00:03:34.390> think<00:03:34.870> he<00:03:35.019> will<00:03:35.140> have<00:03:35.230> to<00:03:35.410> fight

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
time yet I think he will have to fight

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.190 
time yet I think he will have to fight
on<00:03:35.739> the<00:03:35.829> side<00:03:35.860> of<00:03:36.130> darkness<00:03:36.519> until<00:03:37.049> you<00:03:38.049> know

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
on the side of darkness until you know

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.840 
on the side of darkness until you know
they<00:03:38.410> can<00:03:38.590> win<00:03:38.769> the<00:03:38.920> fight<00:03:39.100> and<00:03:39.130> then<00:03:39.340> somehow

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
they can win the fight and then somehow

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.509 
they can win the fight and then somehow
save<00:03:40.150> Tara<00:03:40.480> so<00:03:41.470> I<00:03:41.500> don't<00:03:41.769> think<00:03:41.980> Tara<00:03:42.220> will<00:03:42.400> be

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
save Tara so I don't think Tara will be

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.849 
save Tara so I don't think Tara will be
a<00:03:42.730> guardian<00:03:43.299> of<00:03:43.450> light<00:03:43.480> sadly<00:03:44.079> but<00:03:44.410> I<00:03:44.500> do<00:03:44.590> think

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
a guardian of light sadly but I do think

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.710 
a guardian of light sadly but I do think
Lee<00:03:45.160> will<00:03:45.370> take<00:03:45.579> his<00:03:45.700> place<00:03:45.730> and<00:03:46.180> be<00:03:46.269> the<00:03:46.390> sixth

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
Lee will take his place and be the sixth

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.330 
Lee will take his place and be the sixth
guardian<00:03:47.230> of<00:03:47.320> light<00:03:47.350> and<00:03:47.650> then<00:03:47.739> Kyrie<00:03:48.160> will

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
guardian of light and then Kyrie will

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.690 
guardian of light and then Kyrie will
take<00:03:48.549> the<00:03:48.670> last<00:03:48.910> role<00:03:49.209> and<00:03:49.390> be<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.630> seventh

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
take the last role and be the seventh

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.240 
take the last role and be the seventh
now<00:03:51.700> kairi's<00:03:52.359> role<00:03:52.720> as<00:03:53.019> a<00:03:53.769> guardian<00:03:54.070> of<00:03:54.160> light

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
now kairi's role as a guardian of light

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.009 
now kairi's role as a guardian of light
I<00:03:54.400> think<00:03:54.760> is<00:03:54.850> gonna<00:03:55.030> make<00:03:55.180> her<00:03:55.390> very<00:03:55.540> important

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
I think is gonna make her very important

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.390 
I think is gonna make her very important
that's<00:03:56.170> the<00:03:56.260> thing<00:03:56.410> I<00:03:56.500> think<00:03:56.530> make<00:03:56.859> makes

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
that's the thing I think make makes

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.039 
that's the thing I think make makes
Kyrie<00:03:57.700> very<00:03:58.000> important<00:03:58.420> in<00:03:58.510> Kingdom<00:03:58.750> Hearts<00:03:58.840> 3

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
Kyrie very important in Kingdom Hearts 3

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.150 
Kyrie very important in Kingdom Hearts 3
so<00:03:59.109> she's<00:03:59.380> gonna<00:03:59.500> be<00:03:59.560> a<00:03:59.650> guardian<00:04:00.040> of<00:04:00.100> light

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
so she's gonna be a guardian of light

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.370 
so she's gonna be a guardian of light
she<00:04:00.910> has<00:04:01.299> the<00:04:01.510> responsibility<00:04:02.140> of<00:04:02.170> protecting

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
she has the responsibility of protecting

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.800 
she has the responsibility of protecting
the<00:04:02.950> guard<00:04:03.250> the<00:04:03.609> the<00:04:04.000> realm<00:04:04.239> of<00:04:04.420> light<00:04:04.630> and

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
the guard the the realm of light and

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.050 
the guard the the realm of light and
being<00:04:05.290> a<00:04:05.440> guardian<00:04:05.769> of<00:04:06.040> the<00:04:06.250> light<00:04:06.400> just<00:04:06.910> like

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
being a guardian of the light just like

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.569 
being a guardian of the light just like
sora<00:04:07.390> riku<00:04:07.959> you<00:04:08.440> know<00:04:08.560> everybody<00:04:09.370> that

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
sora riku you know everybody that

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.160 
sora riku you know everybody that
everybody<00:04:10.120> else<00:04:10.420> is<00:04:10.540> part<00:04:10.720> of<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:10.870> gardens<00:04:11.109> of

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
everybody else is part of the gardens of

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.930 
everybody else is part of the gardens of
light<00:04:11.350> she<00:04:11.590> has<00:04:11.769> the<00:04:11.950> same<00:04:12.160> responsibility

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
light she has the same responsibility

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.819 
light she has the same responsibility
and<00:04:13.120> I<00:04:13.510> do<00:04:13.570> think<00:04:13.959> that<00:04:14.019> because<00:04:14.410> if<00:04:14.650> she<00:04:14.799> is

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
and I do think that because if she is

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:16.259 
and I do think that because if she is
going<00:04:15.070> to<00:04:15.130> be<00:04:15.220> Garden<00:04:15.459> to<00:04:15.519> play<00:04:15.670> we<00:04:15.970> will<00:04:16.090> most

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
going to be Garden to play we will most

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.340 
going to be Garden to play we will most
likely<00:04:16.359> get<00:04:16.660> to<00:04:16.780> go<00:04:16.900> through<00:04:16.930> the<00:04:17.140> world

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
likely get to go through the world

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.430 
likely get to go through the world
playing<00:04:18.130> as<00:04:18.370> her

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
playing as her

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.560 
playing as her
and<00:04:20.370> doing<00:04:20.580> stuff<00:04:20.910> I<00:04:21.000> think<00:04:21.060> that<00:04:21.420> we'll

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
and doing stuff I think that we'll

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.030 
and doing stuff I think that we'll
definitely<00:04:21.750> be<00:04:22.050> able<00:04:22.080> to<00:04:22.230> go<00:04:22.410> around<00:04:22.560> and<00:04:22.920> do

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
definitely be able to go around and do

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.860 
definitely be able to go around and do
some<00:04:23.250> more<00:04:23.430> things<00:04:23.730> with<00:04:23.910> Kyrie<00:04:24.150> and<00:04:24.420> actually

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
some more things with Kyrie and actually

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.360 
some more things with Kyrie and actually
get<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.050> tester<00:04:25.440> out<00:04:25.560> and<00:04:25.710> play<00:04:26.010> with<00:04:26.160> her

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
get the tester out and play with her

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.610 
get the tester out and play with her
that<00:04:27.210> sounds<00:04:27.330> wrong<00:04:27.540> play<00:04:27.990> with<00:04:28.140> her<00:04:28.230> as<00:04:28.350> you

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
that sounds wrong play with her as you

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.350 
that sounds wrong play with her as you
know<00:04:28.740> as<00:04:29.070> she<00:04:29.100> progresses<00:04:29.670> in<00:04:29.940> her<00:04:30.060> training

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
know as she progresses in her training

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.580 
know as she progresses in her training
maybe<00:04:30.600> we'll<00:04:30.780> get<00:04:30.870> to<00:04:30.960> play<00:04:31.140> with<00:04:31.290> her<00:04:31.380> during

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
maybe we'll get to play with her during

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.710 
maybe we'll get to play with her during
her<00:04:31.740> training<00:04:32.100> and<00:04:32.460> this<00:04:32.880> sounds<00:04:33.150> so<00:04:33.360> wrong<00:04:33.570> in

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
her training and this sounds so wrong in

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.820 
her training and this sounds so wrong in
so<00:04:33.750> many<00:04:33.900> ways<00:04:34.080> but<00:04:34.260> maybe<00:04:34.440> we'll<00:04:34.530> get<00:04:34.590> to<00:04:34.680> play

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
so many ways but maybe we'll get to play

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:35.990 
so many ways but maybe we'll get to play
with<00:04:34.920> kairi's<00:04:35.250> character<00:04:35.610> during<00:04:35.820> her

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
with kairi's character during her

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.260 
with kairi's character during her
training<00:04:36.240> or<00:04:36.750> maybe<00:04:37.080> we'll<00:04:37.290> get<00:04:37.470> to<00:04:37.650> play<00:04:38.270> with

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
training or maybe we'll get to play with

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.120 
training or maybe we'll get to play with
Perry's<00:04:39.690> character<00:04:40.230> as<00:04:40.680> we're<00:04:40.890> going<00:04:41.010> through

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
Perry's character as we're going through

the worlds I don't know I think it'd be
kind<00:04:42.570> of<00:04:42.630> cool<00:04:42.780> and<00:04:42.960> like<00:04:43.050> do<00:04:43.170> some<00:04:43.350> sparring

him<00:04:53.340> actually<00:04:53.730> training<00:04:54.030> him<00:04:54.240> you<00:04:54.330> don't<00:04:54.420> know

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
him actually training him you don't know

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.970 
him actually training him you don't know
it's<00:04:54.720> Dan<00:04:54.870> I've<00:04:55.050> never<00:04:55.290> actually<00:04:55.470> seen<00:04:55.650> yet

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
it's Dan I've never actually seen yet

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.950 
it's Dan I've never actually seen yet
said<00:04:56.220> we've<00:04:56.790> not<00:04:57.000> even<00:04:57.180> actually<00:04:57.630> never<00:04:57.780> seen

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
said we've not even actually never seen

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.870 
said we've not even actually never seen
yet<00:04:58.200> said<00:04:58.440> like<00:04:59.100> do<00:04:59.250> any<00:04:59.430> training<00:04:59.640> in<00:04:59.760> general

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
yet said like do any training in general

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.310 
yet said like do any training in general
we've<00:05:00.180> never<00:05:00.300> seen<00:05:00.450> him<00:05:00.570> train<00:05:00.720> any<00:05:00.930> character

we've never seen him train any character

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
we've never seen him train any character
so<00:05:01.440> I<00:05:01.500> think<00:05:01.650> it'd<00:05:01.710> be<00:05:01.740> kind<00:05:01.920> of<00:05:01.950> interesting

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
so I think it'd be kind of interesting

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.160 
so I think it'd be kind of interesting
Mei<00:05:02.460> would<00:05:02.580> you<00:05:02.640> like<00:05:02.760> a<00:05:02.790> sparring<00:05:03.300> fight<00:05:03.540> some

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
Mei would you like a sparring fight some

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.510 
Mei would you like a sparring fight some
type<00:05:04.320> of<00:05:04.350> little<00:05:04.530> minigame<00:05:04.830> stuff<00:05:05.190> like<00:05:05.340> that

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
type of little minigame stuff like that

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.490 
type of little minigame stuff like that
but<00:05:05.940> I<00:05:06.000> definitely<00:05:06.210> think<00:05:06.450> kairi's<00:05:06.990> role<00:05:07.230> in

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
but I definitely think kairi's role in

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.560 
but I definitely think kairi's role in
chemistry<00:05:08.160> as<00:05:08.250> a<00:05:08.340> garden<00:05:08.670> of<00:05:08.700> light<00:05:08.940> is<00:05:09.120> going

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
chemistry as a garden of light is going

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.210 
chemistry as a garden of light is going
to<00:05:09.660> happen<00:05:10.050> and<00:05:10.230> I<00:05:10.530> think<00:05:10.560> Kyra's<00:05:10.980> role<00:05:11.160> in

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
to happen and I think Kyra's role in

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.590 
to happen and I think Kyra's role in
general<00:05:11.460> is<00:05:11.640> gonna<00:05:11.790> be<00:05:11.910> big<00:05:12.120> what<00:05:12.330> do<00:05:12.390> you<00:05:12.450> last

general is gonna be big what do you last

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.120 
general is gonna be big what do you last
thing<00:05:12.720> about<00:05:12.900> carries<00:05:13.260> role<00:05:13.440> in<00:05:13.590> qumar<00:05:13.860> three

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
thing about carries role in qumar three
