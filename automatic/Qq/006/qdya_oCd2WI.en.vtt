you're<00:01:54.440> wearing<00:01:54.590> a<00:01:54.710> helmet<00:01:54.860> which<00:01:55.190> is<00:01:55.340> gonna

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
you're wearing a helmet which is gonna

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.010 
you're wearing a helmet which is gonna
be<00:01:55.640> pushing<00:01:55.909> it<00:01:56.000> down<00:01:56.150> ever<00:01:56.360> so<00:01:56.509> slightly<00:01:56.750> and

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
be pushing it down ever so slightly and

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.480 
be pushing it down ever so slightly and
so<00:01:57.530> you're<00:01:57.619> gonna<00:01:57.710> be<00:01:57.830> able<00:01:57.950> to<00:01:58.040> breathe<00:01:58.250> fully

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
so you're gonna be able to breathe fully

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.370 
so you're gonna be able to breathe fully
and<00:01:58.970> nice<00:01:59.690> and<00:01:59.869> easily

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
and nice and easily

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.109 
and nice and easily
we've<00:02:00.950> tried<00:02:01.130> these<00:02:01.340> with<00:02:01.520> several<00:02:01.759> helmets

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
we've tried these with several helmets

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.820 
we've tried these with several helmets
and<00:02:02.720> despite<00:02:03.140> them<00:02:03.290> being<00:02:03.320> quite<00:02:03.619> large

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
and despite them being quite large

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.190 
and despite them being quite large
they've<00:02:04.580> been<00:02:04.729> designed<00:02:04.850> to<00:02:05.600> be<00:02:05.840> compatible

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
they've been designed to be compatible

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.889 
they've been designed to be compatible
with<00:02:06.470> most<00:02:07.130> major<00:02:07.490> how<00:02:07.729> many<00:02:07.880> brands<00:02:08.209> we

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
with most major how many brands we

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.479 
with most major how many brands we
didn't<00:02:09.080> have<00:02:09.170> probably<00:02:09.590> been<00:02:09.890> enormous<00:02:10.130> we

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
didn't have probably been enormous we

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.610 
didn't have probably been enormous we
tried<00:02:10.759> this<00:02:10.880> with<00:02:11.350> so<00:02:12.350> it's<00:02:13.250> gonna<00:02:13.400> be
