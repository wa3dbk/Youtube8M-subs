00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
do something oh right there just realize

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.280 
do something oh right there just realize
it's<00:03:01.910> probably<00:03:01.940> all<00:03:02.330> traps<00:03:02.750> they'll<00:03:03.019> go<00:03:03.140> right

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
it's probably all traps they'll go right

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.780 
it's probably all traps they'll go right
there<00:03:05.110> if<00:03:06.110> my<00:03:06.500> wall<00:03:07.010> breakers<00:03:07.370> won't<00:03:07.580> blow

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:39.729 
don't have to wait again but yeah so
this<00:03:38.299> is<00:03:38.360> what<00:03:38.630> they're<00:03:38.810> like<00:03:38.989> see<00:03:39.410> that's<00:03:39.590> a

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
this is what they're like see that's a

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.319 
this is what they're like see that's a
pretty<00:03:40.070> high<00:03:40.340> level<00:03:40.370> mortar<00:03:40.970> and<00:03:41.060> they<00:03:41.180> can

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
pretty high level mortar and they can

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.960 
pretty high level mortar and they can
take<00:03:41.480> that<00:03:41.690> out<00:03:41.870> pretty<00:03:42.110> quick<00:03:42.790> even<00:03:43.790> though

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
take that out pretty quick even though

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.330 
take that out pretty quick even though
and<00:03:44.299> there's<00:03:44.480> only<00:03:44.570> the<00:03:44.780> like<00:03:45.079> five<00:03:45.920> or<00:03:46.160> so

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
and there's only the like five or so

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.819 
and there's only the like five or so
left<00:03:46.610> so<00:03:47.540> they<00:03:48.049> don't<00:03:48.260> look<00:03:48.440> like<00:03:48.560> they<00:03:48.709> have

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
left so they don't look like they have

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.530 
left so they don't look like they have
too<00:03:49.130> much<00:03:49.310> more<00:03:49.579> health<00:03:49.790> in<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.060> level<00:03:50.329> five

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
too much more health in the level five

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.590 
too much more health in the level five
but<00:03:50.810> they<00:03:50.930> definitely<00:03:51.230> have<00:03:51.790> way<00:03:52.790> more<00:03:52.820> damage

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
but they definitely have way more damage

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.490 
but they definitely have way more damage
and<00:03:53.989> as<00:03:54.739> you<00:03:55.010> see<00:03:55.190> here<00:03:55.549> ten<00:03:56.019> without<00:03:57.019> a<00:03:57.049> healer

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
and as you see here ten without a healer

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.710 
and as you see here ten without a healer
basically<00:03:58.160> took<00:03:58.370> out<00:03:58.549> this<00:03:58.760> whole<00:03:58.970> chimp<00:03:59.450> in

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
basically took out this whole chimp in

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.550 
basically took out this whole chimp in
armor<00:04:00.290> so<00:04:01.299> though<00:04:02.299> all<00:04:02.660> the<00:04:02.870> cannons<00:04:03.260> are<00:04:03.350> gone

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
armor so though all the cannons are gone

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.069 
armor so though all the cannons are gone
and<00:04:03.940> yeah<00:04:04.940> they<00:04:05.090> probably<00:04:05.239> basically<00:04:05.900> could
