00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:13.300 

whoo

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:13.310 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.570 

one<00:00:14.310> through<00:00:14.520> four<00:00:14.760> are<00:00:15.170> customizable<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.580> I

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
one through four are customizable and I

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.700 
one through four are customizable and I
usually<00:00:17.910> start<00:00:18.480> out<00:00:18.630> with<00:00:18.840> two<00:00:19.110> because<00:00:19.500> it

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
usually start out with two because it

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.230 
usually start out with two because it
shows<00:00:19.860> the<00:00:20.010> temperatures<00:00:20.490> temperatures<00:00:20.970> were

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
shows the temperatures temperatures were

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.050 
shows the temperatures temperatures were
like<00:00:21.420> really<00:00:21.720> important<00:00:22.460> to<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.580> cars<00:00:23.790> you

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
like really important to the cars you

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.940 
like really important to the cars you
know<00:00:24.270> maintenance<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.230> just<00:00:25.560> safety<00:00:25.890> of

know maintenance and just safety of

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.590 
know maintenance and just safety of
running<00:00:26.190> the<00:00:26.279> carhartt<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:27.150> don't<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.420> run<00:00:27.570> a

running the carhartt you don't to run a

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.520 
running the carhartt you don't to run a
car<00:00:27.840> really<00:00:28.050> hard<00:00:28.290> when<00:00:28.529> it's<00:00:29.000> when<00:00:30.000> it's<00:00:30.030> a

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
what it's really cold or whatever so

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.500 
what it's really cold or whatever so
normally<00:00:34.770> when<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:34.950> started<00:00:35.250> up<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.910> bring<00:00:36.330> it<00:00:36.420> up

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
normally when I started up I bring it up

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.510 
normally when I started up I bring it up
here<00:00:36.840> it's<00:00:37.470> showing<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:38.040> engine

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
that their transmission temperature is

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.060 
that their transmission temperature is
really<00:00:48.780> important<00:00:49.199> that's<00:00:49.440> right<00:00:49.739> down<00:00:49.920> there

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
really important that's right down there

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.399 
really important that's right down there
in<00:00:50.159> the<00:00:50.220> center<00:00:50.460> before<00:00:51.449> we<00:00:51.900> really<00:00:52.290> get

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.409 
in the center before we really get

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:53.990 
in the center before we really get
started<00:00:52.620> out<00:00:52.800> there<00:00:52.949> oh<00:00:52.979> I'll<00:00:53.309> get<00:00:53.729> it<00:00:53.850> up<00:00:53.970> to

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
started out there oh I'll get it up to

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.920 
started out there oh I'll get it up to
120<00:00:54.750> at<00:00:54.989> least<00:00:55.729> 130<00:00:56.729> hopefully<00:00:57.180> higher<00:00:57.720> than

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
120 at least 130 hopefully higher than

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.509 
120 at least 130 hopefully higher than
that<00:00:58.909> the<00:01:00.530> this<00:01:01.530> screen<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.129> where<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.400> normally

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
that the this screen is where I normally

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.930 
that the this screen is where I normally
drive<00:01:02.909> with<00:01:03.150> it<00:01:03.330> shows<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.870> engine<00:01:04.379> boost

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
drive with it shows the engine boost

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.110 
drive with it shows the engine boost
pressure<00:01:05.940> level<00:01:06.830> lateral<00:01:07.830> G<00:01:08.010> forces<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:09.080> and

pressure level lateral G forces and and

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.610 
pressure level lateral G forces and and
transmission<00:01:12.140> temperature<00:01:13.140> which<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.470> guess

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
transmission temperature which I guess

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.960 
transmission temperature which I guess
that<00:01:13.770> was<00:01:13.830> one<00:01:13.890> important<00:01:14.400> one<00:01:14.610> through<00:01:14.790> four

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
that was one important one through four

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.600 
that was one important one through four
are<00:01:15.420> customizable<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.799> one<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.039> customized

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
are customizable this one I customized

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.459 
are customizable this one I customized
to<00:01:17.759> show<00:01:17.909> geez<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.869> right<00:01:18.990> now<00:01:19.140> it's<00:01:19.320> showing

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:19.469 
to show geez and right now it's showing

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:22.069 
to show geez and right now it's showing
positive<00:01:20.100> G<00:01:20.250> because<00:01:20.610> I'm<00:01:21.060> holding<00:01:21.270> brakes<00:01:21.659> on

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079 
positive G because I'm holding brakes on

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:24.679 
positive G because I'm holding brakes on
a<00:01:22.110> helmet<00:01:22.530> ok<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.310> it's<00:01:23.640> showing<00:01:24.060> positive<00:01:24.509> G

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
a helmet ok so it's showing positive G

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.990 
a helmet ok so it's showing positive G
but<00:01:24.930> if<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.350> were<00:01:25.469> to<00:01:25.560> let<00:01:25.680> go<00:01:25.860> then<00:01:26.159> we<00:01:26.490> go<00:01:26.670> under

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
but if I were to let go then we go under

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.920 
but if I were to let go then we go under
you<00:01:27.270> know<00:01:27.360> closer<00:01:27.990> geez

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
you know closer geez

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.340 
you know closer geez
so<00:01:29.470> this<00:01:29.590> is<00:01:29.710> a<00:01:29.770> very<00:01:29.920> technical<00:01:30.250> ride

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
so this is a very technical ride

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.790 
so this is a very technical ride
everything<00:01:32.350> has<00:01:32.620> been<00:01:34.050> predetermined<00:01:35.050> and

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
everything has been predetermined and

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.120 
everything has been predetermined and
got<00:01:36.610> up<00:01:36.790> yeah<00:01:37.270> I'm<00:01:38.260> gonna<00:01:38.410> set<00:01:38.620> this<00:01:38.710> up<00:01:38.890> so<00:01:38.980> you

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
got up yeah I'm gonna set this up so you

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.530 
got up yeah I'm gonna set this up so you
can<00:01:39.280> see<00:01:39.310> when<00:01:39.580> we<00:01:39.670> go<00:01:39.820> like<00:01:40.090> you<00:01:40.210> see<00:01:40.420> I'm

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
can see when we go like you see I'm

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.690 
can see when we go like you see I'm
holding<00:01:40.900> the<00:01:40.990> brakes<00:01:41.260> right<00:01:41.470> there<00:01:41.680> as<00:01:42.250> I<00:01:42.520> like

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
holding the brakes right there as I like

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.570 
holding the brakes right there as I like
going<00:01:42.820> put<00:01:43.270> it<00:01:43.360> on<00:01:43.510> again<00:01:43.540> you<00:01:43.960> can<00:01:44.080> see<00:01:44.260> that

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
going put it on again you can see that

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.010 
going put it on again you can see that

was<00:01:55.390> when<00:01:55.570> I<00:01:55.600> was<00:01:55.720> just<00:01:55.900> letting<00:01:56.080> go<00:01:56.290> just<00:01:56.530> now

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
was when I was just letting go just now

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.260 
was when I was just letting go just now
so<00:01:57.310> this<00:01:57.400> is<00:01:57.430> a<00:01:57.550> history<00:01:57.880> you<00:01:57.970> can<00:01:58.090> get<00:01:58.240> a

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
so this is a history you can get a

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.000 
so this is a history you can get a
history<00:01:58.600> of<00:01:58.630> yeah<00:01:58.930> it<00:01:59.200> tribe<00:01:59.470> is<00:01:59.680> showing

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
history of yeah it tribe is showing

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.980 
history of yeah it tribe is showing
history<00:02:00.400> turns<00:02:01.030> term<00:02:01.330> we<00:02:01.540> will<00:02:01.690> see<00:02:01.810> that

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
history turns term we will see that

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.050 
history turns term we will see that
their<00:02:02.200> gear<00:02:03.100> position<00:02:03.310> what<00:02:03.820> gear<00:02:04.030> were

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
their gear position what gear were

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.020 
their gear position what gear were
currently<00:02:04.509> in<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:06.130> now<00:02:06.250> we're<00:02:06.430> in<00:02:06.520> first<00:02:06.670> gear

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
currently in so now we're in first gear
