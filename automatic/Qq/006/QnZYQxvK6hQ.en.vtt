00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.789 
not help that much
and<00:01:18.450> these<00:01:18.720> are<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:19.020> something<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.470> start

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
and these are just something to start

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.320 
and these are just something to start
thinking<00:01:20.130> about<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.610> if<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.060> can<00:01:21.180> get<00:01:21.299> a

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
thinking about and if you can get a

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.940 
thinking about and if you can get a
little<00:01:21.479> bit<00:01:21.630> less<00:01:21.780> angry<00:01:22.140> about<00:01:22.350> losing<00:01:22.860> to

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
little bit less angry about losing to

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.350 
little bit less angry about losing to
him<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.250> if<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.820> can<00:01:23.909> just<00:01:24.060> realize<00:01:24.330> that

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
him and if you can just realize that

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.330 
him and if you can just realize that
you're<00:01:24.689> not<00:01:24.780> just<00:01:25.500> getting<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.799> win<00:01:25.979> just<00:01:26.009> from

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
you're not just getting a win just from

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.460 
you're not just getting a win just from
being<00:01:26.520> alive<00:01:26.850> pretty<00:01:27.150> much<00:01:27.299> then<00:01:27.810> it'll<00:01:28.229> kind

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
being alive pretty much then it'll kind

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.170 
being alive pretty much then it'll kind
of<00:01:28.560> get<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.979> right<00:01:29.100> mindset<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.939> next

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
of get you in the right mindset the next

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.340 
of get you in the right mindset the next
thing<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.600> should<00:01:30.689> look<00:01:30.930> at<00:01:31.110> what

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
thing is that you should look at what

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.350 
thing is that you should look at what
they<00:01:31.619> are<00:01:31.829> doing<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.220> improve<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.670> lot<00:01:32.909> faster

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
they are doing to improve a lot faster

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.390 
they are doing to improve a lot faster
than<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.659> for<00:01:34.229> example<00:01:34.710> there's<00:01:35.130> some<00:01:35.189> people

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
than you for example there's some people

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.740 
than you for example there's some people
that<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.670> know<00:01:35.759> some<00:01:36.210> friends<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.600> have

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
that I know some friends that I have

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.289 
that I know some friends that I have
that<00:01:36.960> do<00:01:37.439> try<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.710> improve<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.070> little<00:01:38.159> bit<00:01:38.310> but

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
that do try to improve a little bit but

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.580 
that do try to improve a little bit but
they<00:01:39.509> really<00:01:39.750> don't<00:01:39.900> put<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.170> as<00:01:40.350> much<00:01:40.530> effort

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
they really don't put in as much effort

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.230 
they really don't put in as much effort
they<00:01:41.009> don't<00:01:41.159> go<00:01:41.250> on<00:01:41.369> websites<00:01:41.850> like<00:01:41.909> anthers

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
they don't go on websites like anthers

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.460 
they don't go on websites like anthers
ladder<00:01:42.420> they<00:01:42.659> don't<00:01:42.810> do<00:01:42.899> tournaments<00:01:43.290> stuff

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
ladder they don't do tournaments stuff

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.960 
ladder they don't do tournaments stuff
like<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.920> they<00:01:44.399> just<00:01:44.549> aren't<00:01:44.729> improving

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
like that and they just aren't improving

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.149 
like that and they just aren't improving
quite<00:01:45.390> as<00:01:45.509> fast<00:01:45.750> as<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.079> have<00:01:46.259> been<00:01:46.380> or<00:01:46.590> I've

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
quite as fast as I have been or I've

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.710 
quite as fast as I have been or I've
seen<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.430> lot<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.700> examples<00:01:47.939> online<00:01:48.240> people

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
seen a lot of examples online people

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.030 
seen a lot of examples online people
just<00:01:49.079> really<00:01:49.290> aren't<00:01:49.439> improving<00:01:49.649> as<00:01:49.860> fast

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
just really aren't improving as fast

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.929 
just really aren't improving as fast
because<00:01:50.220> they<00:01:50.280> aren't<00:01:50.399> putting<00:01:50.670> in<00:01:50.790> the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
because they aren't putting in the

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.399 
because they aren't putting in the
effort<00:01:51.090> if<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.810> really<00:01:51.990> want<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.200> be<00:01:52.290> better

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
effort if you really want to be better

do do very often and try to see how you

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:57.409 
do do very often and try to see how you
could<00:03:55.470> capitalize<00:03:55.739> for<00:03:56.489> example<00:03:56.879> if<00:03:57.060> you<00:03:57.209> see

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
could capitalize for example if you see

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.390 
could capitalize for example if you see
a<00:03:57.449> Lucas<00:03:58.109> player<00:03:58.319> that<00:03:58.560> always<00:03:58.829> goes<00:03:59.009> for<00:03:59.159> side

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
a Lucas player that always goes for side

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.179 
a Lucas player that always goes for side
B<00:03:59.609> and<00:03:59.819> your<00:04:00.629> example<00:04:01.049> playing<00:04:01.469> pretty<00:04:02.069> much

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:02.189 
B and your example playing pretty much

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:03.949 
B and your example playing pretty much
any<00:04:02.370> character<00:04:02.699> in<00:04:02.759> the<00:04:02.819> game<00:04:03.030> you<00:04:03.540> could<00:04:03.689> just

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
any character in the game you could just

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.959 
any character in the game you could just
easily<00:04:04.199> shield<00:04:04.680> this<00:04:04.859> quite<00:04:05.370> easily<00:04:05.549> and<00:04:05.879> then

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:05.969 
easily shield this quite easily and then

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:07.789 
easily shield this quite easily and then
run<00:04:06.150> up<00:04:06.269> for<00:04:06.509> easy<00:04:06.750> quick<00:04:07.109> punish<00:04:07.409> especially

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
run up for easy quick punish especially

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.559 
run up for easy quick punish especially
if<00:04:07.919> you're<00:04:08.040> someone<00:04:08.280> like<00:04:08.310> Sheik<00:04:08.609> but<00:04:09.299> if<00:04:09.449> you

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
if you're someone like Sheik but if you

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:10.729 
if you're someone like Sheik but if you
don't<00:04:09.780> catch<00:04:09.959> on<00:04:10.049> to<00:04:10.169> this<00:04:10.289> they'll<00:04:10.560> be<00:04:10.680> able

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
don't catch on to this they'll be able

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:11.990 
don't catch on to this they'll be able
to<00:04:10.829> just<00:04:11.039> hit<00:04:11.129> you<00:04:11.189> with<00:04:11.280> a<00:04:11.310> lot<00:04:11.489> of<00:04:11.579> side<00:04:11.729> beats

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
to just hit you with a lot of side beats

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.789 
to just hit you with a lot of side beats
so<00:04:12.479> they're<00:04:12.599> really<00:04:12.719> easily<00:04:13.049> can<00:04:13.469> durable

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
so they're really easily can durable

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.949 
so they're really easily can durable
like<00:04:14.129> strategy<00:04:14.549> that<00:04:14.729> lucas<00:04:14.969> does<00:04:15.120> a<00:04:15.150> lot<00:04:15.329> but

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
like strategy that lucas does a lot but

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.569 
like strategy that lucas does a lot but
you<00:04:16.259> can<00:04:16.409> just<00:04:16.500> counter<00:04:16.859> it<00:04:16.949> but<00:04:17.400> if<00:04:17.489> you

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
you can just counter it but if you

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:18.680 
you can just counter it but if you
really<00:04:17.699> are<00:04:17.909> paying<00:04:18.060> attention<00:04:18.449> you<00:04:18.539> probably

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
really are paying attention you probably

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:19.969 
really are paying attention you probably
won't<00:04:18.989> think<00:04:19.049> to<00:04:19.229> counter<00:04:19.469> so<00:04:19.650> really<00:04:19.889> you

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
won't think to counter so really you

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.259 
won't think to counter so really you
just<00:04:20.070> have<00:04:20.159> to<00:04:20.310> be<00:04:20.430> in<00:04:20.519> your<00:04:20.549> head<00:04:20.789> it<00:04:20.969> to<00:04:21.120> get

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
just have to be in your head it to get

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.300 
just have to be in your head it to get
in<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:21.449> game<00:04:21.659> to<00:04:22.109> try<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.380> get<00:04:22.529> the<00:04:22.620> reads<00:04:22.830> and

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
in the game to try to get the reads and

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.339 
in the game to try to get the reads and
you<00:04:23.400> just<00:04:23.699> try<00:04:23.909> to<00:04:24.029> have<00:04:24.300> to<00:04:24.449> think<00:04:24.750> about<00:04:25.110> what

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
you just try to have to think about what

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:26.840 
you just try to have to think about what
they're<00:04:25.529> going<00:04:25.710> to<00:04:25.830> do

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
they're going to do

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.910 
they're going to do
and<00:04:26.940> that's<00:04:27.300> really<00:04:27.480> where<00:04:27.780> be<00:04:27.960> winning<00:04:28.650> comes

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
and that's really where be winning comes

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.410 
and that's really where be winning comes
in<00:04:29.100> to<00:04:29.550> try<00:04:29.670> to<00:04:29.760> think<00:04:29.910> what<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.120> opponent's

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420
