00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.119
 but also help the customer to get 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.039
 view of the door installation process 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:23.160
 method b the most common way 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.369
 installation it is recommended for openings with 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.029
 thick walls without plaster from 160 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.310
 millimeters 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.260
 optimal technological gap on 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.200
 perimeter with this method of installation 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.270
 is 10 millimeters for each 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.870
 sides that serves the most 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.520
 quality plastering openings 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.270
 other installation methods are possible 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.789
 the doors 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.309
 way a is considered the most sustainable

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.079
 mounted on mounting plates 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.180
 fully recessed into the optimal area 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.460
 technological gap around the perimeter 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.189
 with this method of installation is 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.070
 also 10 millimeters for each side 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:15.119
 at the same time fluctuations of a gap from 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.820
 5 to 15 millimeters mixed method 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.549
 involves the installation of doors with different 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.000

 door frame and agreed with 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.220
 the customer on the example of the door ds3 at 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.710
 we will demonstrate how to install b1 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.409
 in the panel house where required first 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.990
 remove the old front door do

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.240
 before transporting the door 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:55.090
 it is packed into a corrugated cardboard and into packaging 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.820
 all necessary hardware is embedded 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.789
 before starting the installation door 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.340
 unpacked and the customer is satisfied in 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.179
 the fact that there are no external doors 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.450
 damage 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:10.090
 then the canvas is separated from the box and 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.060
 rises to the floor which will be 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.910

 retracts completely to the bearing wall 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:58.590
 after that the walls are aligned by 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.519
 level and expand on the door leaf 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.180

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.780
 for installed in this model door 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.510
 transferred to the customer in sealed form 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.790
 in his presence the packaging opened 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.049
 afraid cylinder is installed and 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.030
 check its performance 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:27.340
 operability of the suvaldny mechanism 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.409
 checked by working key upon completion 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.530
 installation secret lever mechanism 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:35.099
 will be recoded and then the customer 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.500
 can use new keys

 gaps adjoining the leaf in the door 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:28.750
 boxes match bolts and on 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:31.520
 the lugs are welded to the pins with 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.250
 side in the lock area 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.800
 after that, you need to make sure again 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.770
 in the coincidence of bolts with holes in 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.229
 door frame for this crossbar zone 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.990
 masking tape is stuck on the box 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:48.409
 the rows are lubricated with grease or another 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:51.169
 grease door closes bolts a little 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:51.919
 exhibited so that the mark remains 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.620
 on scotch 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:58.669
 bolts perfectly match holes 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.919
 in the door frame must be considered 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:03.949
 that new homes for some 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:06.889
 time shrinks due to wall shrinkage 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:10.039
 buildings door frame and lock bolts 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:12.710
 may shift to solve the problem 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:15.590
 hole under the bolt and ream 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:19.539
 or swing and then tint 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:21.919
 color box after door installation 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:25.099
 technological gap is wetted by water 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:27.770
 and filled with foam assembly cutting off 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:30.770
 excess vein is produced only after 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.509
 full curing of the foam most 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.849
 high-quality door installation 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:37.460
 produced by filling gaps 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:40.039
 cement mortar draw your 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:43.069
 attention to the fact that during freezing 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:45.409
 foam or mortar 8-10 hours 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:46.770
 use the door with a special 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:50.280
 neatness 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:52.500
 avoid sharp trays and hit on 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:56.780
 the last stage of the presence of the customer 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:59.789
 re - code the lock 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:02.639
 ajar door must be rotated 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:06.840

 bolts extended fully or 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.789
 coding key which comes in 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:14.009
 Complete with a lock inserted into the hole 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:16.289
 under the lower bolt and pressed into 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:18.750
 emphasis continuing to press the peer 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:20.729
 key must be rotated 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.789
 its counterclockwise to
