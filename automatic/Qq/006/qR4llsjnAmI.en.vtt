00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.700
 the starting point of a story 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.420
 it is always one and its development is an intertwining of bodies 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:11.369
 mario mario fani 

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:14.129
 in the name of the young man who with Giovanni acquired 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:19.640
 he had the right idea that gave rise to 140 years ago to Catholic action 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.779
 Italian 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.949
 mario fani is the name of the street where he was kidnapped by the red brigades in 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:26.730
 1978 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.659
 the honorable aldo moro 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:29.760
 the red brigades 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.170
 they are the organization that then if the life in 1980 to the first president of the action 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.240
 catholic of after the council vittorio passion 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.300
 history hell chasing each other meet names and polts 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.800
 readings to understand the story 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.440
 it is not enough to follow the sequence 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.300
 sometimes you have to zoom in to stop inside, there are details that give the 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.060
 key 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.440
 like the bloody sack of the partisan partner gino pistoni 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.200
 he died heroically in 1944 to give the last aid to actors like in war 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.040
 but brother in humanity 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.050
 the sign of an era that asked to take it as a pottery story 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.990
 and don't see the score 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.770
 every place at the bottom 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.630
 he asks to be known well 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.299
 to be consumed by our tireless passion 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.100
 there are passages in history in which it collapses ruinously. 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.429
 others in which it is slowly reconstructed 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:45.680
 and almost fails to perceive what will be at the end 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.790
 the result of your work 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.980
 often this build a prophecy understandable only years after many years 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:53.670
 after 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.330
 certainly this build 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.330
 it cannot always be just an answer 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.280
 but it requires once to be 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.750
 a proposal 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.230
 armida barelli 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.710
 Carlo Carretto had the gift of looking far ahead 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.879
 to think about the future while the present ranch hahaha 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.879
 the weight of the past still strong 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:19.379
 carey mariah carey 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:20.979
 one would say 

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:22.439

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:25.759
 via lunardi cool for keyboard 

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:27.999
 keep them in the alp 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:29.639
 watching 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:32.639
 I appreciate the show 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:36.979
 they then require courage 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:38.489
 so much courage 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.679
 the courage to say 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:41.779
 where I go 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:45.199
 the courage to make choices that also stop the fountain 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:46.869
 advice 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:50.969
 it was an act of courage from the church at a time that demanded courage 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:52.989
 vittorio easy 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.129
 a man of courage 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.079
 for an association that required courage for an association that 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.519
 she asked to respond to new challenges with greater awareness of herself 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.119
 and his own mission 

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:06.089
 the religious choice 

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:09.289
 or the primacy of the essential 

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:14.289
 the democratic organization or lay protagonism 

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:17.399
 even in his personal and professional life 

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:22.189
 the jurist barsellette with the blood shed for the state showed himself a man of 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:26.149
 courage for an Italian company that asked me for courage 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:30.029
 Ecumenical council taught everyone 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:34.409
 to love more the god christ in the bin laden church so it is before 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:35.259
 all 

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:38.999
 that moment in the spirit in the federal one hoping for the moka 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:45.189
 then also the future moment I lead to math tasks of mathematics 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:46.869
 a story 

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:49.349
 any story you start 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:50.989
 it's an intertwining of you 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.390
 but then asks that someone take her by the hand to carry her. 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:58.809
 the long history of Italian Catholic action 

00:03:58.809 --> 00:04:03.329
 that taken by the hand from the name it derives of the continents young boys that adults 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:07.099
 they operate by hand and think for the good of the church of society 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.829
 the story that edits you scares your photograph 

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:16.949
 back just for a moment. look fondly at these 140 is not left 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.949

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.349
 a bow of our food 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:27.629
