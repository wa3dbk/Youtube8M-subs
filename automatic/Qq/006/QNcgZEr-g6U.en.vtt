00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
uh it's what I expected after all the

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.249 
uh it's what I expected after all the
time<00:00:03.210> that<00:00:03.389> we<00:00:03.480> put<00:00:03.659> up<00:00:03.780> with<00:00:04.080> them<00:00:04.230> I

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
time that we put up with them I

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.670 
time that we put up with them I
conditioning-wise<00:00:05.160> and<00:00:06.140> so<00:00:07.140> to<00:00:07.230> see<00:00:07.440> them<00:00:07.589> out

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
conditioning-wise and so to see them out

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.259 
conditioning-wise and so to see them out
here<00:00:07.830> fired<00:00:08.130> up<00:00:08.340> you<00:00:08.519> know<00:00:08.639> here<00:00:08.820> in<00:00:08.910> co<00:00:09.000> chose

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
here fired up you know here in co chose

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.589 
here fired up you know here in co chose
voice<00:00:09.570> across<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.559> field<00:00:10.769> in<00:00:11.210> cement<00:00:12.210> that<00:00:12.480> I

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
voice across the field in cement that I

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.480 
voice across the field in cement that I
think<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.870> attitude<00:00:12.990> has<00:00:13.349> changed<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.889> said<00:00:14.400> it

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
think the attitude has changed I said it

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.040 
think the attitude has changed I said it
before<00:00:14.639> but<00:00:14.849> just<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.900> little<00:00:15.990> more<00:00:18.050> dedication

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
before but just a little more dedication

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.980 
before but just a little more dedication
but<00:00:20.779> being<00:00:21.779> on<00:00:21.990> task<00:00:23.060> we're<00:00:24.060> discipline<00:00:24.539> was

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
but being on task we're discipline was

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.560 
but being on task we're discipline was
more<00:00:25.199> discipline<00:00:25.619> now<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.920> so<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.789> think<00:00:27.359> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
more discipline now and so I think the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.880 
more discipline now and so I think the
code<00:00:27.750> starts<00:00:28.080> with<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.230> coaching<00:00:28.500> staff<00:00:28.529> and

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
code starts with the coaching staff and

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.370 
code starts with the coaching staff and
stuff<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.220> tempo<00:00:29.519> starts<00:00:29.760> with<00:00:29.849> them<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.380> and

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
stuff the tempo starts with them so and

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.560 
stuff the tempo starts with them so and
you<00:00:31.830> know<00:00:31.920> what<00:00:32.550> we<00:00:32.640> wanted<00:00:32.850> from<00:00:32.969> today<00:00:33.239> was

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
you know what we wanted from today was

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.120 
you know what we wanted from today was
this<00:00:33.719> little<00:00:33.840> faster<00:00:34.320> tempo<00:00:34.590> many<00:00:34.770> graphic

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
this little faster tempo many graphic

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.950 
this little faster tempo many graphic
going<00:00:35.340> at<00:00:35.430> practice<00:00:35.790> last<00:00:35.880> year<00:00:36.210> was<00:00:36.329> about<00:00:36.630> I

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
going at practice last year was about I

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.170 
going at practice last year was about I
don't<00:00:37.230> think<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.500> temple<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.070> same<00:00:38.280> last

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
don't think so temple is the same last

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.310 
don't think so temple is the same last
year<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.480> know<00:00:39.540> we<00:00:39.719> were<00:00:39.809> still<00:00:40.020> getting<00:00:40.170> a

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
year you know we were still getting a

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.110 
year you know we were still getting a
lot<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.500> reps<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.219> doing<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:41.940> same

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
lot of reps in and and doing that same

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.100 
lot of reps in and and doing that same
tempo<00:00:42.950> so<00:00:43.950> not<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.430> stated<00:00:44.820> see<00:00:47.750> it<00:00:48.750> hasn't

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
tempo so not that stated see it hasn't

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.170 
tempo so not that stated see it hasn't
changed<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:50.370> hasn't<00:00:50.610> really<00:00:50.700> changed<00:00:50.820> at<00:00:51.090> all

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
changed it hasn't really changed at all

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.540 
changed it hasn't really changed at all
just<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.960> little<00:00:52.110> few<00:00:52.649> terminology<00:00:53.190> changes

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
just a little few terminology changes

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.549 
just a little few terminology changes
but<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.390> office<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:54.989> whole<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.350> stay<00:00:55.500> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
but the office of the whole is stay the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.110 
but the office of the whole is stay the
same<00:00:55.800> but<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.309> think<00:00:56.520> just<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.730> play-calling

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
same but I think just the play-calling

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.080 
same but I think just the play-calling
might<00:00:57.329> be<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.510> little<00:00:57.660> different<00:00:58.250> from<00:00:59.250> what<00:00:59.609> I

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
might be a little different from what I

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.520 
might be a little different from what I
can<00:01:00.149> see<00:01:00.300> now<00:01:00.600> what<00:01:00.960> we're<00:01:01.109> running<00:01:01.320> right<00:01:01.500> now

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
can see now what we're running right now

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.090 
can see now what we're running right now

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
events see if we could handle I don't

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.249 
events see if we could handle I don't
know<00:01:26.400> what<00:01:26.549> his<00:01:26.670> exact<00:01:27.000> thinking<00:01:27.780> was<00:01:27.930> but<00:01:28.229> uh

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259

know what his exact thinking was but uh
we<00:01:28.970> execute<00:01:29.970> itself<00:01:30.270> was<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.990> i<00:01:31.020> drop<00:01:31.619> snap

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
we execute itself was it i drop snap

the<00:01:34.350> lab<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.939> I<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.930> was<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.110> miscue<00:01:37.829> between

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
the lab I I it was a miscue between

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.490 
the lab I I it was a miscue between
Dillon<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.820> don't<00:01:39.780> know<00:01:39.900> exactly<00:01:40.320> what

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
happened but now you joke about it when

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.710 
happened but now you joke about it when
we

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
we

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.060 
we
approach<00:01:45.110> but<00:01:45.320> did<00:01:45.470> it<00:01:45.500> feel<00:01:45.800> any<00:01:45.950> different

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
approach but did it feel any different

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.680 
approach but did it feel any different
out<00:01:46.520> here<00:01:46.550> in<00:01:46.910> terms<00:01:47.120> of<00:01:47.300> the<00:01:47.420> number<00:01:47.660> of

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
out here in terms of the number of

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.660 
out here in terms of the number of
people<00:01:47.900> here<00:01:48.650> to<00:01:48.770> last<00:01:48.950> year<00:01:49.220> anything<00:01:49.520> like

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
people here to last year anything like
