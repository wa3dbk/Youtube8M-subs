00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
it's not covered up gotta lift it up a

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.480 
it's not covered up gotta lift it up a
little<00:01:36.060> bit<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.960> velcro<00:01:40.170> part<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.070> slight

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
little bit the velcro part is a slight

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.310 
little bit the velcro part is a slight
hassle<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.930> necessary<00:01:43.530> for<00:01:44.509> security<00:01:45.509> so

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
hassle that is necessary for security so

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.620 
hassle that is necessary for security so
this<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.680> what<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:46.950> looks<00:01:47.130> like<00:01:48.649> close<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.920> up

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
this is what it looks like close it up

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.500 
this is what it looks like close it up
very<00:01:51.630> easy<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:52.020> carry<00:01:52.259> around

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.510 

this<00:01:58.080> is<00:01:58.230> how<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.500> would<00:01:58.770> generally<00:01:59.220> hold<00:01:59.400> it

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
this is how you would generally hold it

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.400 
this is how you would generally hold it
I<00:01:59.580> guess<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.030> if<00:02:00.870> you<00:02:01.140> want<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.710> make<00:02:01.890> sure<00:02:03.410> the

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
I guess and if you want to make sure the

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.670 
I guess and if you want to make sure the
back<00:02:04.620> does<00:02:04.860> not<00:02:05.040> get<00:02:05.220> in<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.430> way<00:02:06.470> just<00:02:07.470> pull

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
back does not get in the way just pull

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.450 
back does not get in the way just pull
the<00:02:07.710> strap<00:02:08.070> over<00:02:08.399> like<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:10.280> pretty<00:02:11.280> good

nicely<00:03:05.610> accessible<00:03:09.590> now<00:03:10.590> let's<00:03:10.770> look<00:03:10.890> at<00:03:11.040> her

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.620

Procol and color loaded Orange the

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.840 
Procol and color loaded Orange the
obvious<00:03:18.959> advantage<00:03:19.410> of<00:03:19.560> these<00:03:19.709> cases<00:03:20.160> is<00:03:20.340> that

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
obvious advantage of these cases is that

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.910 
obvious advantage of these cases is that
they<00:03:21.450> protect<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:21.959> edges<00:03:22.230> of<00:03:22.350> your<00:03:22.380> surface

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
they protect the edges of your surface

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.640 
they protect the edges of your surface
from<00:03:23.250> bumps<00:03:23.910> and<00:03:24.090> scrapes<00:03:24.360> and<00:03:24.780> when<00:03:25.410> you<00:03:25.500> just

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
from bumps and scrapes and when you just

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.310 
from bumps and scrapes and when you just
have<00:03:25.830> the<00:03:26.100> surface<00:03:26.670> put<00:03:26.910> away<00:03:27.230> when<00:03:28.230> you're

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
have the surface put away when you're

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.120 
have the surface put away when you're
not<00:03:28.470> using<00:03:28.709> it

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
not using it

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.720 
not using it
it<00:03:29.300> is<00:03:30.300> very<00:03:31.050> nicely<00:03:31.350> protected<00:03:31.769> by<00:03:32.220> this<00:03:32.280> you

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
it is very nicely protected by this you

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:33.860 
it is very nicely protected by this you
know<00:03:32.850> there's<00:03:33.090> a<00:03:33.150> decent<00:03:33.450> amount<00:03:33.630> of

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
know there's a decent amount of

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:41.990 
know there's a decent amount of
cushioning<00:03:34.320> there<00:03:35.480> back<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:41.310> disadvantage

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
cushioning there back the disadvantage

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.600 
cushioning there back the disadvantage
is<00:03:42.860> that<00:03:43.860> you<00:03:44.310> cannot<00:03:44.790> comfortably<00:03:45.360> use<00:03:46.610> the

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
is that you cannot comfortably use the

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.479 
is that you cannot comfortably use the
surfaces<00:03:48.320> keyboards<00:03:49.320> with<00:03:49.920> these<00:03:50.160> things

surfaces keyboards with these things

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.300 
surfaces keyboards with these things
because<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.959> tightness<00:03:52.440> just<00:03:52.470> doesn't<00:03:53.130> allow

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
because the tightness just doesn't allow

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.610 
because the tightness just doesn't allow
the<00:03:53.970> keyboard<00:03:54.360> to<00:03:54.510> go<00:03:54.660> in

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.840 

that<00:03:59.620> said<00:04:00.180> I've<00:04:01.180> got<00:04:01.480> my<00:04:01.690> surface<00:04:02.680> closed<00:04:03.040> so

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
that said I've got my surface closed so

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.640 
that said I've got my surface closed so
if<00:04:04.000> I<00:04:04.120> still<00:04:04.420> wanted<00:04:04.720> to<00:04:04.780> use<00:04:04.990> this<00:04:05.140> case<00:04:05.200> and

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
if I still wanted to use this case and

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.120 
if I still wanted to use this case and
have<00:04:05.740> the<00:04:05.830> keyboard<00:04:06.190> I<00:04:06.430> could<00:04:07.300> just<00:04:07.450> do<00:04:07.600> that

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
have the keyboard I could just do that

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.220 
have the keyboard I could just do that
still<00:04:09.130> giving<00:04:09.490> the<00:04:09.670> service<00:04:09.970> some<00:04:10.230> extra

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
still giving the service some extra

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.570 
still giving the service some extra
protection<00:04:11.410> when<00:04:11.950> I'm<00:04:12.040> carrying<00:04:12.370> it<00:04:12.490> around

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
protection when I'm carrying it around

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.890 
protection when I'm carrying it around
or<00:04:13.000> when<00:04:13.150> I<00:04:13.180> just<00:04:13.390> have<00:04:13.540> it<00:04:13.660> set<00:04:13.960> down

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
or when I just have it set down

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.330 
or when I just have it set down
disadvantage<00:04:16.900> being<00:04:17.140> that<00:04:17.500> when<00:04:18.010> I<00:04:18.100> want<00:04:18.280> to

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
disadvantage being that when I want to

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.640 
disadvantage being that when I want to
get<00:04:18.400> it<00:04:18.519> out<00:04:18.640> and<00:04:18.760> use<00:04:18.910> it<00:04:18.940> I'm<00:04:19.650> basically

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
get it out and use it I'm basically

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.190 
get it out and use it I'm basically
separating<00:04:21.519> it<00:04:21.640> from<00:04:21.850> this<00:04:22.360> because<00:04:22.810> it's<00:04:23.050> not

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
separating it from this because it's not

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.260 
separating it from this because it's not
going<00:04:23.500> to<00:04:23.560> be<00:04:23.680> attached<00:04:23.980> to<00:04:24.130> it<00:04:24.340> one<00:04:25.060> more

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
going to be attached to it one more

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.440 
going to be attached to it one more
feature<00:04:25.450> of<00:04:25.660> the<00:04:25.780> case<00:04:25.960> is<00:04:26.910> that<00:04:27.910> it<00:04:28.000> has<00:04:28.150> a
