00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.580
 or the welcome reviews to our 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.260
 medical part we have designed a pattern of 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.210
 makeup exclusively for you 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.710
 a pattern that we will follow trends 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.560
 of spring we will use the 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.970
 last season colors so 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.970
 let's go to the table and have fun 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.960
 the look is called fields is going to be a 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.270
 mix between a fresh spring look 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.360
 a look somewhat retro year 50 because 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.030
 We still have the eyeliner and the 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.920
 great protagonists of this year in 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.920
 As for lip colors, they are still 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:52.399
 being the reds in all their varieties 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.829
 in summer we return as roses and corals 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.659
 the choice of makeup base in 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.460
 this case selected face filtre 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:00.260
 second of more factor in the base of 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.089
 Makeup should never be used 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.040
 as a coloring element of the 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:05.750
 skin the function of the magic base is 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.740
 modify the tone of it and prepare 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.740
 the skin for the colorful 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:23.900
 to cheer up a bit this we're going to put a 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:27.320
 little bit of clear blusher in this case I've 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.000
 selected the tone soft carlos of the 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.040
 very creamy colors cut by me 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.440
 blog plus factor because a blusher in 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.570
 cream because it melts much easier 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.380
 with the finished water skin is much more 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.380
 bright and natural 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.840
 now let's define the eye in this 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.689
 intensive excess case in black 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.619
 and we are going to make a stroke very close to 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.570
 tabs 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.729
 after this we're going to spend a little bit the 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.119
 brush and let's go lengthening a 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.119
 bit 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.459
 we can have a mascara 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:17.280
 excessive what is one of our 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.960
 new mascara and that combines 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.830
 the benefits 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:26.800
 is a 2 in 1 the first is the base 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:30.130
 volume nice dora lets dry 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.310
 seconds and apply the intensified lacquer 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.310
 now 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:49.330
 let's work the lips and it's the the 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.600
 tone by boring of the 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.080
 new lipstick color the ix the jump 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.080
 einstein 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.540
 we have not had a great time if we have already 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.300
 learned the truth that we have been taught 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.110
 a lot of tricks and the truth has been 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.570
 very funny 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.010
 so also a new experience does not 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.550
 We expected him to play us like that 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.550
 that has been great
