00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.990 

oh<00:00:00.030> three<00:00:00.770> okay<00:00:01.770> so<00:00:02.129> we<00:00:03.000> have<00:00:03.950> 18<00:00:04.950> electrons<00:00:05.670> as

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
oh three okay so we have 18 electrons as

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.509 
oh three okay so we have 18 electrons as
it<00:00:06.120> turns<00:00:06.420> out<00:00:06.720> ozone<00:00:07.290> looks<00:00:07.680> like<00:00:08.099> this<00:00:10.519> um

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
it turns out ozone looks like this um

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.110 
it turns out ozone looks like this um
and<00:00:12.059> we'll<00:00:12.929> do<00:00:13.139> lone<00:00:13.620> pair<00:00:14.040> lone<00:00:14.580> pair<00:00:14.880> lone

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
and we'll do lone pair lone pair lone

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.640 
and we'll do lone pair lone pair lone
pair<00:00:15.389> lone<00:00:15.599> pair<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.049> are<00:00:16.230> absolutely

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
pair lone pair and you are absolutely

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.130 
pair lone pair and you are absolutely
welcome<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:17.160> confirm<00:00:17.520> this<00:00:17.699> if<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:18.359> want<00:00:18.570> to

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.179 

well<00:00:22.140> actually<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.590> know<00:00:22.680> what<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:23.070> not

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
well actually you know what this is not

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.460 
well actually you know what this is not
a<00:00:23.250> charged<00:00:23.640> species<00:00:24.000> therefore<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.900> will<00:00:25.260> not

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
a charged species therefore I will not

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.490 
a charged species therefore I will not
put<00:00:25.830> brackets<00:00:26.400> around<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:27.150> however<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:28.080> does

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
put brackets around it however it does

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.870 
put brackets around it however it does
have<00:00:28.529> another<00:00:29.279> resonance<00:00:29.760> structure<00:00:31.880> double

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
have another resonance structure double

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.729 
have another resonance structure double
bond<00:00:33.090> can<00:00:33.300> be<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.690> other<00:00:33.809> side<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.559> can

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
bond can be on the other side this can

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.970 
bond can be on the other side this can
be<00:00:34.860> single<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.640> can<00:00:35.880> be<00:00:36.030> double<00:00:36.500> so<00:00:37.500> we<00:00:37.739> get

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
be single this can be double so we get

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.520 
be single this can be double so we get
three<00:00:38.610> lone<00:00:38.820> pairs<00:00:38.850> here<00:00:39.690> one<00:00:40.230> lone<00:00:40.500> pair

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
three lone pairs here one lone pair

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.000 
three lone pairs here one lone pair
there<00:00:41.219> two<00:00:41.910> lone<00:00:42.180> pairs<00:00:42.210> here<00:00:43.020> now<00:00:43.500> we<00:00:43.559> have

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
there two lone pairs here now we have

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.650 
there two lone pairs here now we have
three<00:00:44.280> different<00:00:44.460> types<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.940> oxygen<00:00:45.390> we<00:00:45.539> have

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
three different types of oxygen we have

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.889 
three different types of oxygen we have
this<00:00:45.809> oxygen<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.410> oxygen<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:46.920> oxygen<00:00:47.190> oh

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
this oxygen this oxygen this oxygen oh

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.900 
this oxygen this oxygen this oxygen oh
one<00:00:49.789> the<00:00:50.789> valence<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.500> six<00:00:52.500> let's<00:00:53.399> look<00:00:53.670> at

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
one the valence is six let's look at

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.110 
one the valence is six let's look at
this<00:00:54.360> one<00:00:54.629> call<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.199> o<00:00:55.350> one<00:00:55.649> one<00:00:56.430> two<00:00:56.730> three

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
this one call it o one one two three

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.319 
this one call it o one one two three
four<00:00:57.420> five<00:00:57.719> six<00:00:58.079> seven<00:00:58.590> seven<00:00:59.100> are<00:00:59.609> signed<00:01:00.059> it

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
four five six seven seven are signed it

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.939 
four five six seven seven are signed it
has<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.350> formal<00:01:02.070> charge<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.640> negative<00:01:03.030> one<00:01:03.480> Oh<00:01:03.989> -

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
has a formal charge of negative one Oh -

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.640 
has a formal charge of negative one Oh -
well<00:01:05.939> let<00:01:06.750> me<00:01:06.780> make<00:01:06.930> these<00:01:07.110> electrons<00:01:07.590> a

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
well let me make these electrons a

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.750 
well let me make these electrons a
little<00:01:07.830> bit<00:01:07.950> clearer<00:01:08.220> those<00:01:08.430> looks<00:01:08.640> like

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
little bit clearer those looks like

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.280 
little bit clearer those looks like
three<00:01:09.090> electrons<00:01:09.570> there<00:01:09.810> that's<00:01:09.990> not<00:01:10.140> going

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
three electrons there that's not going

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.780 
three electrons there that's not going
to<00:01:10.350> work

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
to work

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.249 
to work
okay<00:01:11.790> now<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:13.680> one<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.570> normal<00:01:15.570> oxygen<00:01:16.080> is

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
okay now this one is normal oxygen is

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.210 
okay now this one is normal oxygen is
