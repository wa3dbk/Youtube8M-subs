00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
area pretty awesome um and so my sim is

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.900 
area pretty awesome um and so my sim is
going<00:04:18.780> to<00:04:18.870> do<00:04:18.930> that<00:04:19.109> right<00:04:19.320> now

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
going to do that right now

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.339 
going to do that right now
it<00:04:20.910> only<00:04:21.570> takes<00:04:21.989> four<00:04:22.410> minutes<00:04:23.660> so<00:04:24.660> first<00:04:25.140> they

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
it only takes four minutes so first they

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.080 
it only takes four minutes so first they
groom<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:26.039> cat

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
um and then um I guess the cat is going

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:37.939
