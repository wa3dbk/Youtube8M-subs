when you put your iPhone in there and
all<00:00:40.019> the<00:00:40.140> possibilities<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.950> come<00:00:41.070> out<00:00:41.250> once

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
all the possibilities that come out once

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.889 
all the possibilities that come out once
you<00:00:41.610> attach<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.090> iPhone<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:42.600> that's<00:00:42.750> where

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
you attach the iPhone so that's where

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.330 
you attach the iPhone so that's where
we're<00:00:43.020> going<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.200> jump<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.620> part<00:00:43.860> two<00:00:44.040> here

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
you hook that iPhone up to Robo me all

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.880 
you hook that iPhone up to Robo me all
right<00:00:51.239> now<00:00:51.450> things<00:00:51.750> start<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.110> get<00:00:52.320> fun<00:00:52.649> with

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
right now things start to get fun with

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.160 
right now things start to get fun with
Robo<00:00:53.219> me<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.820> we've<00:00:54.120> put<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.390> iPhone<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.780> here

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
you have a face on here you can now

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.279 
you have a face on here you can now
interact<00:00:57.120> with<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.539> let's<00:00:57.719> say<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.870> poke<00:00:58.170> them

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
interact with it let's say you poke them

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.709 
interact with it let's say you poke them
in<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.410> eye<00:00:58.670> it's<00:00:59.670> not<00:00:59.820> very<00:01:00.030> happy<00:01:00.270> as<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.660> is

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
in the eye it's not very happy as I is

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.900 
in the eye it's not very happy as I is
blinking<00:01:01.199> he<00:01:01.320> says<00:01:01.559> hey<00:01:01.829> blinks<00:01:02.550> for<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.730> little

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
blinking he says hey blinks for a little

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.700 
blinking he says hey blinks for a little
while<00:01:03.059> now<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.629> thing<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:03.989> that's<00:01:04.140> not<00:01:04.379> set

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
while now the thing is that's not set

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.200 
while now the thing is that's not set
you<00:01:04.860> can<00:01:04.979> actually<00:01:05.100> program<00:01:05.729> all<00:01:05.910> of<00:01:05.940> that

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
you can actually program all of that

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.749 
you can actually program all of that
let's<00:01:06.420> say<00:01:06.509> you<00:01:06.570> hit<00:01:06.720> him<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:06.990> nose<00:01:07.759> pick

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
let's say you hit him in the nose pick

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:10.430 
let's say you hit him in the nose pick
me<00:01:08.940> a<00:01:08.970> winner<00:01:09.030> very<00:01:09.479> funny<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.930> can<00:01:10.080> do<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.350> the

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
me a winner very funny you can do in the

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.089 
me a winner very funny you can do in the
mouth<00:01:12.020> so<00:01:13.020> as<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.289> see<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.560> face<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:13.950> all

00:01:14.089 --> 00:01:14.099 
mouth so as you see the face is all

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:15.830 
mouth so as you see the face is all
interactive<00:01:14.759> depending<00:01:15.090> where<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.390> touch<00:01:15.599> it

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
interactive depending where you touch it

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.410 
interactive depending where you touch it
the<00:01:16.259> cool<00:01:16.500> thing<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:17.069> that<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:18.209> can

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
the cool thing is is that you can

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.969 
the cool thing is is that you can
program<00:01:18.660> all<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.289> I'm<00:01:19.470> going<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.619> changes

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
program all of this I'm going to changes

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.430 
program all of this I'm going to changes
some<00:01:20.190> expressions<00:01:20.759> here

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.660 

so<00:01:25.440> and<00:01:25.740> then<00:01:25.890> we're<00:01:26.009> going<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.190> go<00:01:26.310> into<00:01:26.490> the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
so and then we're going to go into the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.949 
so and then we're going to go into the
programming<00:01:27.090> which<00:01:27.300> I<00:01:27.420> think<00:01:27.599> is<00:01:27.690> one<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:27.949 --> 00:01:27.959 
programming which I think is one of the

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:30.850 
programming which I think is one of the
neater<00:01:28.200> parts<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.709> it<00:01:28.800> we'll<00:01:28.920> show<00:01:29.069> you<00:01:29.099> that

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
neater parts of it we'll show you that

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.839 
neater parts of it we'll show you that
all<00:01:31.860> right<00:01:32.039> so<00:01:32.069> these<00:01:32.250> are<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.399> little<00:01:32.580> small

00:01:32.839 --> 00:01:32.849 
all right so these are a little small

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:34.999 
all right so these are a little small
hopefully<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.360> can<00:01:33.479> see<00:01:33.720> them<00:01:33.929> on<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.770> camera

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
hopefully you can see them on the camera

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.770 
hopefully you can see them on the camera
what<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.700> can<00:01:35.819> do<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:35.940> you<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.119> pick<00:01:36.330> a<00:01:36.450> theme

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
what you can do is you can pick a theme

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.479 
what you can do is you can pick a theme
for<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.410> different<00:01:37.709> faces<00:01:38.099> so<00:01:38.220> I'm<00:01:38.280> going<00:01:38.429> to

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:38.489 
for the different faces so I'm going to

00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:40.699 
for the different faces so I'm going to
go<00:01:38.550> ahead<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.880> click<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.209> top<00:01:39.450> one<00:01:39.720> here<00:01:40.050> and

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:40.709 
go ahead and click this top one here and

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:42.139 
go ahead and click this top one here and
as<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.920> see<00:01:40.950> they're<00:01:41.220> different<00:01:41.369> themes<00:01:41.789> here

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
as you see they're different themes here

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.150 
as you see they're different themes here
so<00:01:42.599> we<00:01:42.690> can<00:01:42.840> have<00:01:43.020> all<00:01:43.380> different<00:01:43.679> types<00:01:44.009> of

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
so we can have all different types of

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.490 
so we can have all different types of
characters<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.759> they<00:01:44.849> are<00:01:44.910> male/female<00:01:45.840> more

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
characters and they are male/female more

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.350 
characters and they are male/female more
robotic<00:01:46.950> different<00:01:47.789> themes<00:01:47.940> and<00:01:48.149> you'll<00:01:48.270> be

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
robotic different themes and you'll be

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.240 
robotic different themes and you'll be
able<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.599> completely<00:01:48.959> alter<00:01:49.170> them<00:01:49.560> let's<00:01:50.099> go

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
able to completely alter them let's go

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.589 
able to completely alter them let's go
come<00:01:50.459> with<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:50.729> robot<00:01:51.119> one<00:01:51.270> just<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.569> show

00:01:51.589 --> 00:01:51.599

come with this robot one just to show
you<00:01:51.780> what<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.020> different<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.470> retro<00:01:52.830> robot

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
you what it different the retro robot

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.460 
you what it different the retro robot
what<00:01:53.849> that<00:01:54.030> looks<00:01:54.270> like<00:01:54.390> all<00:01:55.110> right<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.380> the

retro Robo theme as you see looks very

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.229 
retro Robo theme as you see looks very
different<00:01:57.630> but<00:01:57.959> still<00:01:58.170> interactive<00:01:59.239> poke

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:00.239 
different but still interactive poke

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:01.850 
different but still interactive poke
them<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.509> eye<00:02:00.599> doesn't<00:02:01.080> like<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.440> hit<00:02:01.770> him

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
in the mouth as you see you can change

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.770 
in the mouth as you see you can change
that<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:05.819> we're<00:02:05.940> going<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.119> go<00:02:06.239> back<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.599> show

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
I'm going to just go and pick the second

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.960 
I'm going to just go and pick the second
one<00:02:10.050> here<00:02:10.259> which<00:02:10.349> allows<00:02:10.590> us<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.830> change<00:02:11.220> not

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
one here which allows us to change not

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.030 
one here which allows us to change not
the<00:02:12.120> whole<00:02:12.300> theme<00:02:12.569> but<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.989> various<00:02:13.500> elements

the whole theme but the various elements

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.619 
the whole theme but the various elements
so<00:02:14.280> let's<00:02:14.430> say<00:02:14.550> we<00:02:14.670> want<00:02:14.849> different<00:02:15.180> eyes<00:02:15.330> on

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
so let's say we want different eyes on

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.780 
so let's say we want different eyes on
our<00:02:15.690> robot<00:02:15.900> here<00:02:16.379> we<00:02:16.950> can<00:02:17.130> just<00:02:17.280> shift<00:02:17.430> them<00:02:17.640> in

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
our robot here we can just shift them in

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.310 
our robot here we can just shift them in
just<00:02:17.940> by<00:02:18.120> flicking<00:02:18.420> them<00:02:18.660> all<00:02:18.810> different<00:02:19.200> eyes

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
just by flicking them all different eyes

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.980 
just by flicking them all different eyes
we<00:02:20.040> can<00:02:20.220> shift<00:02:20.430> here<00:02:20.820> if<00:02:20.940> we<00:02:21.210> want<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.720> change

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
we can shift here if we want to change

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.699 
we can shift here if we want to change
from<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.290> top

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
from the top

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.009 
from the top
we're<00:02:22.859> gonna<00:02:22.980> change<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.549> eyebrows<00:02:24.030> again

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
we're gonna change the eyebrows again

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.449 
we're gonna change the eyebrows again
you<00:02:25.319> can<00:02:25.439> just<00:02:25.530> shift<00:02:25.709> them<00:02:25.950> let's<00:02:26.250> say<00:02:26.370> you

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
you can just shift them let's say you

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.550 
you can just shift them let's say you
want<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.700> different<00:02:27.030> mouth<00:02:27.150> bring<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.569> robot<00:02:27.900> go

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
want a different mouth bring a robot go

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.380 
want a different mouth bring a robot go
ahead<00:02:28.799> and<00:02:28.950> shift<00:02:29.159> that<00:02:29.219> so<00:02:29.760> very<00:02:30.030> cool<00:02:30.239> you

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
ahead and shift that so very cool you

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.880 
ahead and shift that so very cool you
pick<00:02:30.599> the<00:02:30.750> different<00:02:31.049> themes<00:02:31.290> then<00:02:31.650> within

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
pick the different themes then within

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.110 
pick the different themes then within
each<00:02:32.010> theme<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:32.489> can<00:02:32.609> pick<00:02:32.760> all<00:02:32.969> these

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
each theme you can pick all these

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.880 
each theme you can pick all these
different<00:02:33.480> elements<00:02:33.569> this<00:02:34.409> robot<00:02:34.739> actually

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
different elements this robot actually

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.319 
different elements this robot actually
doesn't<00:02:35.219> have<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.340> nose<00:02:35.549> but<00:02:35.819> if<00:02:35.909> you<00:02:35.969> did<00:02:36.180> we

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
doesn't have a nose but if you did we

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.420 
doesn't have a nose but if you did we
could<00:02:36.510> switch<00:02:36.719> that<00:02:36.930> as<00:02:37.109> well<00:02:37.349> and<00:02:37.590> here<00:02:38.280> we're

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
could switch that as well and here we're

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.649 
could switch that as well and here we're
switching<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.909> actual<00:02:39.269> look<00:02:39.359> at<00:02:39.510> all<00:02:39.599> these

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
switching the actual look at all these

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.330 
switching the actual look at all these
different<00:02:39.810> faces<00:02:40.319> we<00:02:40.439> can<00:02:40.590> put<00:02:40.739> on<00:02:40.829> this<00:02:40.920> robot

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
different faces we can put on this robot

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.759 
different faces we can put on this robot
and<00:02:41.639> there<00:02:42.269> are<00:02:42.450> some<00:02:42.719> with<00:02:42.870> noses<00:02:43.319> there<00:02:43.469> so

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
and there are some with noses there so

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.530 
and there are some with noses there so
you<00:02:43.859> can<00:02:43.980> see<00:02:44.159> that<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:44.579> this<00:02:44.819> is<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.030> lot<00:02:45.209> of<00:02:45.329> fun

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
you can see that so this is a lot of fun

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.780 
you can see that so this is a lot of fun
very<00:02:45.719> cool<00:02:46.349> okay<00:02:47.099> now<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.280> want<00:02:47.519> to<00:02:47.549> get<00:02:47.639> into

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
very cool okay now I want to get into

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.429 
very cool okay now I want to get into
what<00:02:47.939> I<00:02:48.000> think<00:02:48.239> separates<00:02:48.569> the<00:02:48.750> real<00:02:48.930> me<00:02:49.200> from

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:49.439 
what I think separates the real me from

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:50.690 
what I think separates the real me from
a<00:02:49.500> lot<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.769> other<00:02:49.889> toys<00:02:50.159> out<00:02:50.430> there<00:02:50.579> and

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
a lot of the other toys out there and

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.250 
a lot of the other toys out there and
that's<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.909> programming<00:02:51.599> so<00:02:51.989> I'm<00:02:52.049> going<00:02:52.200> to

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
that's the programming so I'm going to

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.470 
that's the programming so I'm going to
go<00:02:52.349> ahead<00:02:52.650> in<00:02:52.799> here<00:02:53.069> and<00:02:53.280> select<00:02:53.609> this<00:02:54.000> third

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
go ahead in here and select this third

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.809 
go ahead in here and select this third
one<00:02:54.689> here<00:02:55.019> now<00:02:55.590> these<00:02:55.739> are<00:02:55.980> custom<00:02:56.400> triggers

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
one here now these are custom triggers

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.789 
one here now these are custom triggers
what's<00:02:57.180> neat<00:02:57.359> is<00:02:57.389> that<00:02:57.540> after<00:02:58.109> one<00:02:58.409> minute<00:02:58.560> of

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
what's neat is that after one minute of

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.190 
what's neat is that after one minute of
being<00:02:59.069> idle<00:02:59.639> you<00:03:00.269> can<00:03:00.419> decide<00:03:00.689> what<00:03:00.989> will<00:03:01.169> be

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
being idle you can decide what will be

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.690 
being idle you can decide what will be
triggered<00:03:01.980> so<00:03:02.129> I'm<00:03:02.189> just<00:03:02.280> going<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.459> click

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
triggered so I'm just going to click

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.580 
triggered so I'm just going to click
that<00:03:02.879> here<00:03:03.269> I'm<00:03:03.689> going<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:03.900> pen<00:03:04.109> down<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.319> little

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
that here I'm going to pen down a little

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.050 
that here I'm going to pen down a little
bit<00:03:04.680> so<00:03:04.799> you<00:03:04.859> can<00:03:04.919> see<00:03:05.189> it<00:03:05.340> so<00:03:05.519> you<00:03:05.579> have<00:03:05.849> some

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
bit so you can see it so you have some

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.879 
bit so you can see it so you have some
options<00:03:06.480> here<00:03:06.569> and<00:03:06.959> it's<00:03:07.349> basically<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:07.799> just

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889 
options here and it's basically you just

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.339 
options here and it's basically you just
drag<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:08.730> right<00:03:08.879> now<00:03:09.060> this<00:03:09.269> says<00:03:09.510> drag<00:03:10.139> and

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
drag so right now this says drag and

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.830 
drag so right now this says drag and
drop<00:03:10.500> event<00:03:10.859> trigger<00:03:11.129> onto<00:03:11.639> here<00:03:11.939> so<00:03:12.180> it<00:03:12.569> could

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
drop event trigger onto here so it could

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
would set what it is you see as an

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.309 
would set what it is you see as an
option<00:03:41.639> now<00:03:41.760> record<00:03:42.299> now<00:03:42.510> so<00:03:42.959> I<00:03:42.989> could<00:03:43.199> record

option now record now so I could record

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.649 
option now record now so I could record
after<00:03:43.709> 30<00:03:44.040> seconds<00:03:44.489> change<00:03:44.819> this<00:03:44.970> expression

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 
after 30 seconds change this expression

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.409 
after 30 seconds change this expression
say<00:03:46.199> something<00:03:46.680> then<00:03:47.099> say<00:03:47.609> something<00:03:47.879> else<00:03:48.209> so

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
say something then say something else so

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.490 
that recording which we just did and as
we<00:04:44.970> wait<00:04:45.150> a<00:04:45.390> couple<00:04:45.420> more<00:04:45.810> seconds<00:04:46.230> you<00:04:46.380> will

can see that I love so there you go as

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.650 
can see that I love so there you go as
math<00:04:56.280> moves<00:04:56.610> and<00:04:56.760> everything<00:04:57.150> so<00:04:57.300> obviously

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
math moves and everything so obviously

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.300 
math moves and everything so obviously
kids<00:04:57.930> are<00:04:58.050> going<00:04:58.170> to<00:04:58.230> love<00:04:58.410> this<00:04:58.620> they<00:04:59.130> can

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
kids are going to love this they can

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.770 
kids are going to love this they can
program<00:04:59.610> it<00:04:59.760> to<00:04:59.790> see<00:05:00.060> different<00:05:00.420> things<00:05:00.450> at

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
program it to see different things at

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.120 
program it to see different things at
different<00:05:00.870> intervals<00:05:01.170> he<00:05:01.860> could<00:05:02.040> have

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
different intervals he could have

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.590 
different intervals he could have
obviously<00:05:02.430> blinked<00:05:02.820> his<00:05:02.880> eyes<00:05:03.030> spun<00:05:03.480> around

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
obviously blinked his eyes spun around

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.590 
obviously blinked his eyes spun around
went<00:05:04.020> backwards<00:05:04.530> and<00:05:04.800> then<00:05:05.190> said<00:05:05.490> that<00:05:05.600> ok

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
went backwards and then said that ok

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.030 
went backwards and then said that ok
this<00:05:06.750> is<00:05:06.930> really<00:05:07.050> my<00:05:07.200> favorite<00:05:07.620> parts<00:05:07.860> we're

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
this is really my favorite parts we're

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.380 
this is really my favorite parts we're
spend<00:05:08.220> little<00:05:08.370> time<00:05:08.430> on<00:05:08.580> it<00:05:08.760> the<00:05:08.910> triggers<00:05:09.240> but

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
spend little time on it the triggers but

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.300 
spend little time on it the triggers but
now<00:05:09.540> that<00:05:09.720> you<00:05:09.840> know<00:05:09.960> how<00:05:10.140> easy<00:05:10.380> it<00:05:10.560> is<00:05:10.620> I<00:05:10.830> want

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
now that you know how easy it is I want

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.560 
now that you know how easy it is I want
to<00:05:11.370> show<00:05:11.490> you<00:05:11.550> all<00:05:11.760> the<00:05:11.940> different<00:05:12.030> triggers

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
to show you all the different triggers

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.180 
to show you all the different triggers
here<00:05:12.750> so<00:05:12.930> you<00:05:13.020> have<00:05:13.200> time<00:05:13.470> triggers<00:05:13.890> one

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
here so you have time triggers one

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.790 
here so you have time triggers one
minute<00:05:14.460> idle<00:05:14.790> you<00:05:15.180> have<00:05:15.270> I<00:05:15.450> poke<00:05:15.960> trigger<00:05:16.320> you

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
minute idle you have I poke trigger you

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.260 
minute idle you have I poke trigger you
have<00:05:16.950> a<00:05:16.980> nose<00:05:17.250> poke<00:05:17.610> trigger<00:05:17.940> you<00:05:18.120> have<00:05:18.240> a

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
have a nose poke trigger you have a

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.120 
have a nose poke trigger you have a
mouth<00:05:18.510> poke<00:05:18.840> let's<00:05:19.500> move<00:05:19.650> into<00:05:19.800> some<00:05:20.010> of<00:05:20.070> the

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
mouth poke let's move into some of the

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.700 
mouth poke let's move into some of the
other<00:05:20.250> ones<00:05:20.460> 30-second<00:05:21.180> idle<00:05:21.480> you've<00:05:22.470> got<00:05:22.680> a

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
other ones 30-second idle you've got a

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.080 
other ones 30-second idle you've got a
video<00:05:23.010> controlled<00:05:23.640> trigger

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
video controlled trigger

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.750 
video controlled trigger
you've<00:05:24.510> got<00:05:24.750> the<00:05:25.080> robot<00:05:25.290> sensor<00:05:26.160> trigger<00:05:26.490> so

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
you've got the robot sensor trigger so

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.100 
you've got the robot sensor trigger so
it<00:05:26.820> can<00:05:26.910> be<00:05:27.000> if<00:05:27.120> something<00:05:27.510> in<00:05:27.720> front<00:05:27.930> of<00:05:28.020> his

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
it can be if something in front of his

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.200 
it can be if something in front of his
sensors<00:05:28.530> he<00:05:28.680> senses<00:05:29.100> something<00:05:29.520> you<00:05:29.940> can<00:05:30.090> ever

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
sensors he senses something you can ever

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.630 
sensors he senses something you can ever
trigger<00:05:30.540> it<00:05:30.690> all<00:05:30.750> off<00:05:31.130> we<00:05:32.130> created<00:05:32.490> some<00:05:32.610> of

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
trigger it all off we created some of

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.220 
trigger it all off we created some of
our<00:05:32.820> own<00:05:32.940> here<00:05:33.270> what<00:05:33.480> is<00:05:33.570> your<00:05:33.750> cat's<00:05:33.960> name

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
our own here what is your cat's name

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.870 
our own here what is your cat's name
that's<00:05:34.470> one<00:05:34.800> where<00:05:35.040> if<00:05:35.160> you<00:05:35.250> asking<00:05:35.730> questions

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
that's one where if you asking questions

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.820 
that's one where if you asking questions
we'll<00:05:36.510> see<00:05:36.660> that<00:05:36.810> in<00:05:36.930> a<00:05:36.990> little<00:05:37.110> bit<00:05:37.230> he's

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
we'll see that in a little bit he's

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.410 
we'll see that in a little bit he's
going<00:05:38.010> to<00:05:38.070> answer<00:05:38.400> an<00:05:38.580> edge<00:05:39.120> detection

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:39.420 
going to answer an edge detection

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.950 
going to answer an edge detection
trigger<00:05:40.110> handshake<00:05:41.070> detection<00:05:41.670> trigger<00:05:41.970> and

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
trigger handshake detection trigger and

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.360 
trigger handshake detection trigger and
then<00:05:43.290> the<00:05:43.440> left<00:05:43.650> these<00:05:44.070> are<00:05:44.190> all<00:05:44.280> the

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
then the left these are all the

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.920 
then the left these are all the
different<00:05:44.490> controls<00:05:45.000> on<00:05:45.270> the<00:05:45.390> remote<00:05:45.690> so<00:05:45.870> you

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
different controls on the remote so you

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.030 
different controls on the remote so you
can<00:05:46.050> have<00:05:46.170> when<00:05:46.320> you<00:05:46.350> press<00:05:46.620> a<00:05:46.650> different

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.040 
can have when you press a different

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.500 
can have when you press a different
button<00:05:47.190> on<00:05:47.370> the<00:05:47.460> remote<00:05:47.610> different<00:05:48.180> triggers

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
button on the remote different triggers

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.050 
button on the remote different triggers
so<00:05:48.660> pretty<00:05:49.290> neat<00:05:49.500> it's<00:05:50.220> really<00:05:50.430> customizable

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
so pretty neat it's really customizable

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.400 
so pretty neat it's really customizable
with<00:05:51.300> all<00:05:51.420> this<00:05:51.510> programming<00:05:51.780> in<00:05:52.170> here

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
with all this programming in here

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.410 
with all this programming in here
alright<00:05:53.040> there's<00:05:53.280> a<00:05:53.340> lot<00:05:53.520> we<00:05:53.640> love<00:05:53.820> about<00:05:53.940> Robo

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:54.420 
alright there's a lot we love about Robo

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.240 
alright there's a lot we love about Robo
me<00:05:54.570> the<00:05:55.290> one<00:05:55.440> thing<00:05:55.560> we've<00:05:55.680> had<00:05:55.770> some<00:05:55.950> trouble

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
me the one thing we've had some trouble

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.160 
me the one thing we've had some trouble
with<00:05:56.280> is<00:05:56.520> the<00:05:56.760> voice<00:05:56.910> recognition<00:05:57.210> for

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.170 
with is the voice recognition for

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:59.780 
with is the voice recognition for
example<00:05:58.680> we're<00:05:58.800> going<00:05:58.950> to<00:05:59.070> try<00:05:59.250> to<00:05:59.310> say<00:05:59.580> now

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
example we're going to try to say now

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.310 
example we're going to try to say now
what<00:06:00.090> is<00:06:00.240> your<00:06:00.270> name<00:06:00.600> let's<00:06:00.960> see<00:06:01.110> if<00:06:01.200> he

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
what is your name let's see if he

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:09.410 
what is your name let's see if he
responds<00:06:04.310> what<00:06:05.310> is<00:06:05.520> your<00:06:06.270> name<00:06:07.160> and<00:06:08.270> as<00:06:09.270> you

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:09.420 
responds what is your name and as you

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.640 
responds what is your name and as you
see<00:06:09.570> that<00:06:09.690> red<00:06:09.870> question<00:06:10.050> mark<00:06:10.260> he's<00:06:10.470> not

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
see that red question mark he's not

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:11.930 
see that red question mark he's not
quite<00:06:10.890> getting<00:06:11.100> it<00:06:11.280> so<00:06:11.400> we're<00:06:11.520> hoping<00:06:11.730> in<00:06:11.850> a

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
quite getting it so we're hoping in a

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.000 
quite getting it so we're hoping in a
future<00:06:12.210> update<00:06:12.360> speech<00:06:13.200> recognition<00:06:13.650> will<00:06:13.920> be

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.010 
future update speech recognition will be

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.590 
future update speech recognition will be
a<00:06:14.040> little<00:06:14.190> bit<00:06:14.340> better<00:06:14.490> sometimes<00:06:15.120> it<00:06:15.270> gets<00:06:15.450> it

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 
a little bit better sometimes it gets it

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.330 
a little bit better sometimes it gets it
sometimes<00:06:15.930> it<00:06:16.080> does<00:06:16.230> and<00:06:16.260> so<00:06:16.620> that's<00:06:17.130> why<00:06:17.310> our

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
sometimes it does and so that's why our

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.830 
sometimes it does and so that's why our
least<00:06:17.700> favorite<00:06:18.090> part<00:06:18.330> is<00:06:18.540> a<00:06:18.570> voice

least favorite part is a voice
recognition<00:06:19.110> the<00:06:19.950> other<00:06:20.100> sensors<00:06:20.550> are<00:06:20.730> cool

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:20.910 
recognition the other sensors are cool

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.550 
recognition the other sensors are cool
we<00:06:21.090> want<00:06:21.300> to<00:06:21.360> show<00:06:21.480> you<00:06:21.540> the<00:06:21.720> telepresence<00:06:22.170> now

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
we want to show you the telepresence now

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.320 
we want to show you the telepresence now
because<00:06:22.860> that's<00:06:22.980> a<00:06:23.160> very<00:06:23.310> neat<00:06:23.550> feature<00:06:23.820> all

the telepresence sometimes we had some

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.659 
the telepresence sometimes we had some
crashing<00:07:30.750> and<00:07:30.930> sinking<00:07:31.350> issues<00:07:31.710> so<00:07:32.490> there's

00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:32.669 
crashing and sinking issues so there's

crashing and sinking issues so there's
still<00:07:32.820> some<00:07:32.970> work<00:07:33.060> to<00:07:33.120> be<00:07:33.330> done<00:07:33.450> there<00:07:33.510> good

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:33.990

so<00:07:35.580> that<00:07:35.610> app<00:07:35.880> gets<00:07:36.150> upgraded<00:07:36.410> basically<00:07:37.410> the

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:37.530 
so that app gets upgraded basically the

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.140 
so that app gets upgraded basically the
brain<00:07:37.740> says<00:07:37.980> rubble<00:07:38.310> may<00:07:38.430> will<00:07:38.580> be<00:07:38.610> upgraded

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:39.150 
brain says rubble may will be upgraded

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.150 
brain says rubble may will be upgraded
and<00:07:39.300> should<00:07:39.540> get<00:07:39.630> better<00:07:39.810> as<00:07:40.050> well<00:07:40.290> so<00:07:40.890> come<00:07:41.070> on
