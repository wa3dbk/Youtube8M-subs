00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello look because I am not such a thing old and I live in Brabant and the 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.310
 child's diary to judge the duke or lexus I don't think everyone 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.670
 Certainly, it is certain that the group B will judge the 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.560
 spots well 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.650
 what can start how the game works and what the what you have to do well the goal 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.180
 of the game is that on the other side of the human you have their nexus that 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.060
 is well I was also based on the nexus that is just that you have to 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.910
 and then you have won the game but of course I have for myself 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.239
 and excesses and that thinking this 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.820
 You have to screen yourself with your life as Dirk Jan Potters than the famous 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.340
 eastermar celebrate 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.659
 in those claessens 

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:39.730
 epic 3 lequesne from the top 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.180
 the mcqueen 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.140
 and the bone leak 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.470
 eventually Bonn could anp 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.309
 and with the app 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:46.620
 difficult otherwise 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.260
 skinny obviously doesn't just go over to a boss and again I think I have 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.430
 Therefore, growers invented fur that protect the links 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.830
 the nexus that sees first 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.770
 the counters that sit everywhere in the here and me 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:01.890
 on her own 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.560
 and therein 7 3 each loan maybe you have again on completion 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.560
 2 3 at the intersection 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.090
 then if you 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.740
 these titles aren't that soft on me either 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.780
 complain together to radiation 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.150
 that I take anyway 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.050
 a fake that is very important if you have this kind of fall out and unity of course 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.060
 then a record fine crisis but lately 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.270
 Brussels Intel later 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.550
 after questioning it would be a quick look at what you can do 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.130
 it is normal not to have it 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.070
 neat 5 to 5 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.960
 in this market 15 5 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.010
 man what have you now shown both kevin one and the coast a king starts 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.070
 cries have been made for the children themselves 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.150
 they operate as an observer 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.930
 promotion of this platform 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.590
 do you know anything goes wrong he could be important in the game you then more 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.740
 textile hit 9 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.110
 courard against celtic player time but stay on this easy rather it 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.110
 money I just seemed like he will return one wanted 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.120
 the a6 on the schedule to see it all running well I already finished it so busy and see 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.049
 all items must be served 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.249
 but oh well it's easy if you set the game a weekend to diegem and time stand 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:13.100
 paper is akc impressions of 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.790
 starting eighties debate should pick up strike from try on boots with 4 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.820
 street after figuring that out 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.210
 of course i have read all the money but i expect a lot from his journey goals and 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.450
 you get per second 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.289
 I get you to leave a single 

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:30.159
 to take a central position in the members, let's take a look at what needs to be done 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.000
 destroying these crops is usually the intention 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.459
 what an example too 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:37.449
 a doll 

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:39.249
 one out of five people goes top 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:41.179
 one is alive 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:46.369
 2 help on one so then you have m on the city I wish that on with his horses 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:49.219
 book full and the sporty you get made 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:51.489
 there is a bit on the edge 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.560
 the jungle nice and hard as I do and according to ad 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.290
 I don't know what it is like to be overgrown by the municipality but then it still remains 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.489
 fall 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.069
 we are going to be nice states that are a bit and that are puppets that adje 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:04.799
 I never buy these tates either 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.009
 nexus went well 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:10.519
 who come la every loan it is handsome that you will ever come here for middle classes you ever 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.040
 already walk along in the positive divide at the top 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.319
 it is also all in the middle 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.269
 all of these also downstairs 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.870
 I don't see that an option was the only option because fifteen bicycles 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.470
 outside we went 6 because they are unfair because they see nothing 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.429
 there are worldwide 

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:30.949
 If you stand in front of it and you must try the dolls that are very enjoyable to silence 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:34.739
 when you add top chef exchange act last time 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.159
 i would give it life for him 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.269
 if I now have this text 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:39.549
 but according to me 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.529
 the last honor to excesses coming 

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:44.859
 output is of course something else i don't feel it has anymore 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.219
 lives complained 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:47.979
 and so try 

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:49.569
 look the same anyway 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.899
 on 60 murder 

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:54.129
 of course all with one from this text 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.289
 that the municipality waits until it comes to such a container 

00:03:57.289 --> 00:04:00.289
 You can also sit still Feyenoord every pound has on 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:02.350
 it totally skills 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.799
 in culture 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.739
 and pps 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.329
 apparently i got this we knew where your hands were 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:11.219
 click here to see the van with a human size 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:14.219
 I was set as a bonus according to friendly 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:16.579
 then there was still doing it 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.729
 I also do that on our cubic meter 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.709
 also required 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.709
 hopefully 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.370
 sweet lake anp 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.960
 that couples can 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.449
 we see some sort of true 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:31.499
 this makes wage costs seem too high 

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:34.589
 with the light towers accident, terpstra is going naturally 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.960
 so that they can keep 3 themselves 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.849
 play his michel credit 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:41.419
 thereby was on Islam 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:42.409
 that is one 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:45.159
 this time sees the top man as second 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:47.960
 also yes and i don't want that 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.960
 each option has the other 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.740
 so are the game 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.410
 I can now not exactly clear how satisfied fixed 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.110
 but i also have a hot tip one in the bergse the sweden you should always be good 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.900
 read 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.559
 what it is you have to read english well 

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:05.920
 staff are the other way around 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.740
 you can feel it when you are tortured by the crisis 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.210
 sometimes it's you 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.919
 van dikes used more like this 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.270
 so if you have the most extra budget 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.780
 if you predicted to look but that is because there must be send I am me 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:20.569
 don't explain 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:23.569
 in addition, you also have acv requirements for the game 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:26.490
 the fastest one 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.910
 this is terrible the rejection it is good that you are near the second corner 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:30.669
 meal 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.669
 I would like to see if they were and further as usual 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:36.599
 that's what it's about to be from Alkmaar, of course 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:38.930
 I can bring a completely different use of football 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.210
 but that's just the question 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.210
 important drafting he is an example also because you 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:47.849
 the always like animals on a terrace to do that 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.070
 the ban on going out often makes a nice picture 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.529
 what is wrong with the church district as perpetrator 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:56.669
 ma the number of places we do not 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:58.409
 so when you are in the back it appears 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:01.409
 nothing can happen and then a few you see that dikes 

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:04.389
 there is no place either 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:09.360
 I think you are so worried about it if you think that means following the little one 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.870
 believes that they determine who it is 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.520
 the more spam research how do you get property tips 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.099
 if you book these crops 

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:17.879
 this pumping back nd plays contact 

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:21.049
 then again at the ecb if you broke this also to the superikes 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.810
 she believes they are much stronger once more on the ns with much more half 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.249
 that made it much easier then because that one 

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:30.680
 so who can 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.529
 it is very exciting in the car I say this 

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:34.650
 so that 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.430
 portion are automatic because there has been a while that he steven his mission 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.650
 the care machine they come to this ex faster 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:46.050
 At the end of the continent, guys are nipping, I don't always pass a movie 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.460
 cocks it's full point 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.430
 3 2 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.620
 so i think we dodge a lot more a friend an that is nice that 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.550
 they will be there we are going to kill 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.180
 guys i am i then i look or thank insight 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.289
 for killing this video 

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:02.719
 I opened it up in the air though it is what they want like all markets where it is 

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:06.490
 According to the head of the agency she is active, she can already watch a video with 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.669
 I spent far too long and that the study yes I am still stuck at the moment 

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:12.070
 looking thirsty about it 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.510
 point ever see him over window the second album there becomes really huge 

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.210
 arsenal i say 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:17.930
 poor
