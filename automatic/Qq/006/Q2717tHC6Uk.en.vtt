00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.580
 upload video 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.600
 a new video past an excellent super 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.520
 good day guys this time I bring you a 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.910
 incredible mod which is called electric 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.470
 mod 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.750
 and good that what adds us then we 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.520
 add a few electric weapons and 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.780
 electrical armor is incredible 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.940
 you're going to love them a lot and 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.500
 good we went through the review guys what 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.300
 is what adds us more than anything this 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.910
 incredible motorbike because we found a 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:57.019
 new now that is called chromos and good 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.580
 this new today this is chromos the 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:01.850
 we will find anywhere in the 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.769
 world I hope it is generated in the world 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.810
 I think when we install the mod then 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.060
 they start to generate like any other 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.010
 time like diamond and anything 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.260
 and well we would simply do the same 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.049
 As if it were iron, we put it 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.760
 obviously baked and obviously because 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.700
 it would not come out what it is not what it is 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.930
 our our trading cards ingots ok and 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.240
 good and with ourselves it has as 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.750
 We could change a variety of things 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.480
 of which is in them arcs 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.910
 swords armor 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.700
 obviously with different objects more 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.980
 that nothing we went several instruments for 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.650
 there we can this that carbon plate 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.300
 we can this that is the carbon arm 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.110
 co2 several little things out there that are 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.460
 interesting medium that they have to check 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.260
 each of them can also check 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.880
 all the changes in what was supposed 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.680
 they were remember that if they do not have it then 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.690
 I leave you in the description of the same and 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.460
 you can see it and good guys among the 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.140
 variety of things that adds us then 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.630
 the main ones and that I liked the most 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.850
 me well they were the swords is for 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.180
 we have the carbon sword we have the 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.570
 sword what is from chromos the sword that 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.430
 says advanced advanced shooting and the 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.619
 electric sword are four swords 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.240
 hyper really amazing that is going to 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.460
 like a lot we are going to try the I took it 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.410
 I ask you against these little zombies 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.180
 be careful because some eliminate 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.100
 I think several men and they explode before 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.560
 Be careful out there as you can see 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.770
 the carbon sword eliminates them from a 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.080
 just hit the chromed sword is not 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.240
 fire lights off the sword 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.830
 advanced what throws it several and 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.690
 exploits photos 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:39.360
 we're going to have to kill all the kills 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.850
 I'm not burning burning and I have the 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.290
 leather armor guys and through 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.990
 do that problem since we have there 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.760
 but it 's more missing that I think this is 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.820
 the one that the environmental ones inhabit like that 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.440
 is a small explosion out there that 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.030
 be more careful with that but good and 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.130
 we have the amazing swords we have 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.870
 like an arc that I do not know is to say I do not know 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.460
 how is thrown not find a prick 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.920
 way that I add pinches arrows not 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.930
 I know what prince but good person a 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.520
 very very incredible thing about this we have 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.220
 two types of armor one that we 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.110
 protects completely as if it were a 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.540
 diamond armor and we have another one that 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.610
 they went to hands as will be the iron but 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.160
 like it protects us something when we had 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.290
 this what is like a bottle of 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.270
 I like energy much like nothing else 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.950
 it gives us life, it does not give us so much power 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.230
 let's say nothing hands regenerates us what 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.120
 is life completely if we already have 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.890
 half another rib out there 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.590
 we have some paintings that are like 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.810
 usher I do not know if this is like 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.300
 decorative more than anything there we had one 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.250
 but which it is supposed to 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.080
 turn on ok go check out there 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.569
 and another amazing thing that adds this 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.670
 mode is the box and there is a mod that 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.739
 called quarry that is amazing of 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.290
 truth and willow genia was that also what 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.640
 they added is in this part is me 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.980
 I really like running 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.670
 because more than anything simply that 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.170
 we put the cube of quart and summon 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.480
 we put what is a chest above the 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.630
 box and I would leave them what is this 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.970
 these bars would incredibly go 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.970
 removing what is the blocks below 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.400
 we just activate it with a peak 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.560
 implied diamond matter which one and 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.790
 It is activated and will gradually remove 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.560
 the layers of it from the world incredibly 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.630
 it is nothing else, it keeps us what are the 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.979
 Vaquitas our things but good is 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.780
 amazing what you will like 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.610
 very much the mold has variety of 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.190
 things we have is like there is a 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:33.000
 grenade equal active 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.740
 how they saw that walking is not the other way around 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.700
 but I remove the change table from the 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.870
 there 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:42.740
 ok too and I miss that have a little 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.740
 upside down 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.750
 but good the grenade and obviously nothing 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.640
 the more we play the 15th I think it explodes 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:57.120
 simply explodes to make more holes 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:01.770
 we do not care about ovens, although all 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:03.510
 4 kg layers well I hope you have them 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.970
 liked the mod can check everything 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.340
 have with the tomato irons is amazing 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.350
 I liked it very much and well you know I 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.920
 I am begic and see you next time 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.920
 a new video
