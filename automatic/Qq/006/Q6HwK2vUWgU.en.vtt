NIC on lens on the front quite nice and
wise<00:00:30.829> you<00:00:31.160> know<00:00:31.220> and<00:00:31.520> put<00:00:32.239> the<00:00:32.329> point<00:00:32.480> about

wise you know and put the point about

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.210 
wise you know and put the point about
these<00:00:32.810> in<00:00:33.140> the<00:00:33.230> trouble<00:00:33.710> for<00:00:33.739> Steadicam

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
these in the trouble for Steadicam

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.819 
these in the trouble for Steadicam
operators<00:00:34.670> as<00:00:34.970> with<00:00:35.660> film<00:00:35.930> incidentally<00:00:36.590> is

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
operators as with film incidentally is

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.260 
operators as with film incidentally is
that<00:00:37.550> these<00:00:37.730> things<00:00:38.060> being<00:00:39.130> bigger<00:00:40.130> chips<00:00:40.730> are

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
that these things being bigger chips are

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.389 
that these things being bigger chips are
consequently<00:00:42.640> shallower<00:00:43.640> depth<00:00:43.970> of<00:00:44.060> field<00:00:44.120> so

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
consequently shallower depth of field so

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.380 
consequently shallower depth of field so
it's<00:00:46.399> a<00:00:46.430> bit<00:00:46.550> more<00:00:46.699> difficult<00:00:46.850> to<00:00:47.030> keep<00:00:47.149> things

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
it's a bit more difficult to keep things

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.330 
it's a bit more difficult to keep things
in<00:00:47.539> focus<00:00:47.570> especially<00:00:48.559> if<00:00:49.039> you're<00:00:49.190> on<00:00:49.219> a

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
in focus especially if you're on a

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.060 
in focus especially if you're on a
Steadicam<00:00:49.730> and<00:00:49.969> you're<00:00:50.300> on<00:00:50.390> the<00:00:50.449> move<00:00:50.600> so<00:00:51.440> you

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
Steadicam and you're on the move so you

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.639 
Steadicam and you're on the move so you
know<00:00:52.219> keeping<00:00:53.059> things<00:00:53.809> a<00:00:53.929> set<00:00:54.140> distance<00:00:54.350> from

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
know keeping things a set distance from

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.639 
know keeping things a set distance from
the<00:00:54.769> lens<00:00:54.980> is<00:00:55.960> it's<00:00:56.960> fairly<00:00:57.230> tricky<00:00:57.410> at<00:00:57.589> the

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
the lens is it's fairly tricky at the

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.410 
the lens is it's fairly tricky at the
best<00:00:57.800> of<00:00:57.920> times<00:00:58.039> but<00:00:58.820> when<00:00:58.969> you're<00:00:59.120> in<00:00:59.269> motion

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
best of times but when you're in motion

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.720 
best of times but when you're in motion
hand<00:00:59.899> for<00:01:00.109> instance<00:01:00.170> your<00:01:01.039> talent<00:01:01.489> is<00:01:01.579> in

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
hand for instance your talent is in

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.170 
hand for instance your talent is in
motion<00:01:02.000> as<00:01:02.089> well<00:01:02.269> well<00:01:03.109> then<00:01:04.100> you<00:01:04.879> know<00:01:05.000> then

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
motion as well well then you know then

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:16.410 
motion as well well then you know then
you<00:01:05.269> call<00:01:05.420> in<00:01:05.540> the<00:01:05.600> professionals

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.700 

so<00:01:17.420> what<00:01:17.990> this<00:01:18.140> shallow<00:01:18.380> depth-of-field

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
so what this shallow depth-of-field

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.350 
so what this shallow depth-of-field
thing<00:01:19.160> means<00:01:19.400> is<00:01:19.640> that<00:01:19.790> we<00:01:19.880> can<00:01:20.030> get<00:01:20.150> some

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
thing means is that we can get some

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.340 
thing means is that we can get some
really<00:01:20.630> nice<00:01:21.160> creeping<00:01:22.160> slow<00:01:22.640> moves

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
really nice creeping slow moves

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.600 
really nice creeping slow moves
especially<00:01:24.350> with<00:01:24.500> this<00:01:24.710> or<00:01:24.950> or<00:01:25.040> longer<00:01:25.400> lens

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
especially with this or or longer lens

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.650 
especially with this or or longer lens
this<00:01:25.910> is<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.410> 14<00:01:27.410> to<00:01:27.530> 24<00:01:27.890> Nikon<00:01:28.580> F<00:01:28.729> 2.8<00:01:29.390> so<00:01:29.600> you

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
this is the 14 to 24 Nikon F 2.8 so you

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.480 
this is the 14 to 24 Nikon F 2.8 so you
can<00:01:29.840> imagine<00:01:30.320> you<00:01:30.710> know<00:01:30.740> that<00:01:30.950> depth<00:01:31.160> of<00:01:31.250> field

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
can imagine you know that depth of field

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.969 
can imagine you know that depth of field
is<00:01:31.640> absolutely<00:01:32.150> minimal<00:01:32.510> and<00:01:32.660> if<00:01:32.720> you've<00:01:32.840> seen

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
is absolutely minimal and if you've seen

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.109 
is absolutely minimal and if you've seen
some<00:01:33.979> other<00:01:34.160> videos<00:01:34.520> you'll<00:01:34.670> notice<00:01:34.940> that

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
some other videos you'll notice that

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.940 
some other videos you'll notice that
even<00:01:35.540> I<00:01:35.720> can't<00:01:35.960> get<00:01:36.080> it<00:01:36.220> spot-on<00:01:37.220> all<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:37.580> time

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
even I can't get it spot-on all the time

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.620 
even I can't get it spot-on all the time
with<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.040> Steadicam<00:01:40.310> that<00:01:40.610> opens<00:01:40.910> up<00:01:41.060> a<00:01:41.240> whole

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
with the Steadicam that opens up a whole

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.930 
with the Steadicam that opens up a whole
range<00:01:41.990> of<00:01:42.200> beautiful<00:01:42.950> cinematic

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
range of beautiful cinematic

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.390 
range of beautiful cinematic
possibilities<00:01:44.600> so<00:01:45.440> for<00:01:45.740> instance<00:01:46.070> a<00:01:46.160> little

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
possibilities so for instance a little

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.940 
possibilities so for instance a little
creeps<00:01:46.760> along<00:01:47.030> let's<00:01:47.869> just<00:01:48.170> roll<00:01:48.560> on<00:01:48.740> this<00:01:48.920> a

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
creeps along let's just roll on this a

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.830 
creeps along let's just roll on this a

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
little creepy moves along with the

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.160 
little creepy moves along with the
Steadicam<00:02:01.490> and<00:02:01.880> as<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.509> Steadicam<00:02:02.780> moves

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.830 
EFP cfp Steadicam totally stripped it
down<00:03:06.470> so<00:03:06.860> we've<00:03:06.950> got<00:03:07.100> small<00:03:08.090> battery<00:03:08.660> we've

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
down so we've got small battery we've

got small TFT monitor rather than the

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.289 
got small TFT monitor rather than the
big<00:03:11.120> green<00:03:11.360> screen<00:03:11.660> that<00:03:11.690> we<00:03:11.840> usually<00:03:11.959> use<00:03:13.299> so

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
big green screen that we usually use so

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:15.610 
big green screen that we usually use so
it's<00:03:14.450> as<00:03:14.600> light<00:03:14.840> as<00:03:15.019> it<00:03:15.049> can<00:03:15.260> be<00:03:15.380> and<00:03:15.530> we<00:03:15.590> can

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
it's as light as it can be and we can

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.620 
it's as light as it can be and we can
just<00:03:16.040> about<00:03:16.340> it's<00:03:16.700> just<00:03:16.760> about<00:03:17.209> heavy<00:03:17.420> enough

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
just about it's just about heavy enough

to balance the atrocity EFP arm so what

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.830 
to balance the atrocity EFP arm so what
can<00:03:23.720> we<00:03:23.780> say<00:03:24.019> it<00:03:24.319> seems<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.620> work<00:03:24.650> very<00:03:24.770> well

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
can we say it seems to work very well

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
light rig as we said so it has a

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.710 
light rig as we said so it has a
tendency<00:04:51.860> to<00:04:51.919> the<00:04:52.669> influence<00:04:53.090> much<00:04:53.270> easier<00:04:53.570> by

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
wind and bits and pieces than if it were

wind and bits and pieces than if it were
much<00:04:56.780> heavier<00:04:57.700> but<00:04:58.700> essentially<00:04:59.060> it<00:04:59.870> does<00:05:00.169> its

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
much heavier but essentially it does its

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.510 
much heavier but essentially it does its
job<00:05:01.210> regardless<00:05:02.210> of<00:05:02.360> whether<00:05:02.540> I<00:05:02.660> am

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
influencing it all I'm doing is keeping

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.520 
influencing it all I'm doing is keeping
it<00:05:08.450> pointing<00:05:08.750> in<00:05:08.840> the<00:05:08.900> right<00:05:09.020> direction

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
it pointing in the right direction

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.110 
it pointing in the right direction
keeping<00:05:09.950> the<00:05:10.040> framing<00:05:10.370> on<00:05:10.520> bits<00:05:10.880> and<00:05:11.000> pieces

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.540 
keeping the framing on bits and pieces
like<00:05:11.360> that<00:05:13.210> which<00:05:14.210> means<00:05:14.479> that<00:05:15.340> it<00:05:16.340> keeps

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
like that which means that it keeps

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.180 
like that which means that it keeps
everything<00:05:16.820> beautifully<00:05:17.450> smooth<00:05:17.690> I<00:05:18.110> can<00:05:19.070> see

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
everything beautifully smooth I can see

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.590 
everything beautifully smooth I can see
what<00:05:19.340> I'm<00:05:19.430> doing<00:05:19.460> with<00:05:19.790> the<00:05:19.910> built-in<00:05:20.210> monitor

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
what I'm doing with the built-in monitor

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.490 
what I'm doing with the built-in monitor
so<00:05:20.750> I<00:05:20.810> don't<00:05:20.930> have<00:05:20.990> to<00:05:21.080> be<00:05:21.169> looking<00:05:21.380> in<00:05:21.470> the

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
so I don't have to be looking in the

00:05:21.500 --> 00:06:01.360 
so I don't have to be looking in the
viewfinder

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:17.119 

smoothly<00:06:02.370> does<00:06:02.790> it
