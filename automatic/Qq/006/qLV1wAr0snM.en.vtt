their handling around corners so he's
really<00:00:37.020> soft<00:00:37.350> have<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.890> pay<00:00:38.040> attention<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.579> a

lot of things and it's one of those

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.340 
lot of things and it's one of those
things<00:00:42.480> might<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.719> lot<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:42.960> people<00:00:43.170> don't

because of those things and those

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.630 
because of those things and those
factors<00:00:46.530> because<00:00:47.219> there's<00:00:47.399> simply

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
factors because there's simply

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.299 
factors because there's simply
simplicity<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.600> not<00:00:48.780> there<00:00:48.989> as<00:00:49.260> we<00:00:49.440> have<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
simplicity is not there as we have the

these<00:01:22.530> supports<00:01:22.830> classics<00:01:23.189> as<00:01:23.610> we<00:01:23.880> were

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
these supports classics as we were

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.539 
these supports classics as we were
witness<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.330> far<00:01:24.650> top<00:01:25.650> speed<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.070> interesting

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
witness so far top speed is interesting

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.160 
witness so far top speed is interesting
actually<00:01:26.670> because<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:27.180> know<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.450> classics<00:01:28.020> is

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
actually because we know the classics is

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.920 
actually because we know the classics is
three<00:01:28.590> speed<00:01:28.970> but<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.119> Pigalle<00:01:30.509> actually

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
three speed but the Pigalle actually

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.710 
three speed but the Pigalle actually
takes<00:01:31.110> quite<00:01:31.290> some<00:01:31.710> time<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.970> keep<00:01:33.180> up<00:01:33.390> and

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
takes quite some time to keep up and

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.300 
takes quite some time to keep up and
actually<00:01:34.049> catch<00:01:34.200> up<00:01:34.229> towards<00:01:34.770> classic<00:01:35.220> you

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
actually catch up towards classic you

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.010 
actually catch up towards classic you
see<00:01:35.490> how<00:01:35.549> long<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.850> takes<00:01:35.880> here<00:01:36.299> on<00:01:36.750> this

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
see how long it takes here on this

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.569 
see how long it takes here on this
straight<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.890> by<00:01:38.100> far<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.400> longest

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
straight this by far the longest

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.190 
straight this by far the longest
overtake<00:01:39.270> I've<00:01:39.420> seen<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:39.750> quite<00:01:39.990> some<00:01:40.170> time

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
overtake I've seen in quite some time

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.230 
overtake I've seen in quite some time
bought<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.619> took<00:01:40.770> forever<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.250> keep<00:01:41.939> up<00:01:42.090> and

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
bought it took forever to keep up and

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.359 
bought it took forever to keep up and
overtake<00:01:42.570> because<00:01:42.899> we<00:01:43.049> know<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.920> top<00:01:44.100> speed

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
overtake because we know the top speed

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.499 
overtake because we know the top speed
isn't<00:01:44.549> gonna<00:01:44.729> be<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:44.880> great<00:01:45.210> for<00:01:45.390> the

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
isn't gonna be that great for the

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.050 
isn't gonna be that great for the
classic<00:01:46.079> was<00:01:46.200> three<00:01:46.500> speed<00:01:46.770> but<00:01:46.979> but<00:01:47.759> with<00:01:47.880> big

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
classic was three speed but but with big

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.960 
classic was three speed but but with big
alley<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.960> was<00:01:49.950> expecting<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.549> big<00:01:50.670> alley<00:01:50.820> to

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
alley I was expecting the big alley to

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.149 
alley I was expecting the big alley to
have<00:01:51.060> better<00:01:51.240> top<00:01:51.420> speed<00:01:51.659> but<00:01:51.869> didn't<00:01:52.770> didn't

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
have better top speed but didn't didn't

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.340 
have better top speed but didn't didn't
expect<00:01:53.460> this<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.820> take<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:54.960> long<00:01:55.200> to

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
expect this to take this long to

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.560 
expect this to take this long to
actually<00:01:55.439> overtake<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.520> then<00:01:57.060> keep<00:01:57.240> going

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
actually overtake and then keep going

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.179 
actually overtake and then keep going
obviously<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.110> gap<00:01:58.259> does<00:01:58.530> increase<00:01:58.890> when<00:01:59.100> it

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
obviously the gap does increase when it

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.410 
obviously the gap does increase when it
does<00:01:59.310> eventually<00:01:59.430> overtake<00:02:00.030> but<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.270> just

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
does eventually overtake but I just

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.179 
does eventually overtake but I just
shown<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.689> here<00:02:00.840> how<00:02:01.350> long<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.649> does<00:02:01.799> take<00:02:02.070> to

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
shown you here how long it does take to

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.130 
shown you here how long it does take to
oversteer<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.240> obviously<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.689> have<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:03.960> take

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
oversteer so so obviously I have it take

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.749 
oversteer so so obviously I have it take
so<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:04.799> see<00:02:04.979> how<00:02:05.070> long<00:02:05.189> it's<00:02:05.340> taking<00:02:05.610> right

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
so you see how long it's taking right

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.619 
so you see how long it's taking right
now<00:02:05.790> over<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.630> same<00:02:06.869> line<00:02:07.049> right<00:02:07.259> now<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:08.629> we

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
now over the same line right now and we

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.260 
now over the same line right now and we
pretty<00:02:09.780> much<00:02:09.869> past<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.649> finish<00:02:11.220> line

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
pretty much past the finish line

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.270 
pretty much past the finish line
poached<00:02:12.450> in<00:02:12.660> this<00:02:12.870> section<00:02:13.350> here<00:02:13.560> with<00:02:14.250> the

poached in this section here with the

poached in this section here with the
bridge<00:02:14.870> that<00:02:15.870> we<00:02:15.990> burnt<00:02:16.200> halfway<00:02:16.560> through<00:02:16.770> the

bridge that we burnt halfway through the
highway<00:02:17.250> at<00:02:18.090> this<00:02:18.240> point<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.780> now<00:02:19.110> eventually

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
highway at this point and now eventually

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.770 
highway at this point and now eventually
catches<00:02:20.040> up<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:20.550> I<00:02:21.270> was<00:02:21.390> going<00:02:21.450> for<00:02:21.690> the

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
catches up and I was going for the

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.710 
catches up and I was going for the
overtake<00:02:22.170> with<00:02:22.530> its<00:02:22.680> top<00:02:22.950> speed<00:02:23.450> my<00:02:24.450> cars

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
overtake with its top speed my cars

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.230 
overtake with its top speed my cars
already<00:02:24.990> reached<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.260> top<00:02:25.410> speed<00:02:26.060> third<00:02:27.060> gear

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
already reached a top speed third gear

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.490 
already reached a top speed third gear
is<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.420> limit<00:02:27.710> so<00:02:28.710> at<00:02:29.580> this<00:02:29.790> point<00:02:30.500> you've

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
is the limit so at this point you've

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.280 
is the limit so at this point you've
noticed<00:02:31.830> that<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.070> Pigalle<00:02:32.340> keeps<00:02:32.640> going

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
noticed that the Pigalle keeps going

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.780 
noticed that the Pigalle keeps going
so<00:02:34.290> obviously<00:02:34.650> Zinda<00:02:35.160> Kane's<00:02:35.370> got<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:35.640> better

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
so obviously Zinda Kane's got a better

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.130 
so obviously Zinda Kane's got a better
top<00:02:35.940> speed<00:02:36.210> but<00:02:36.330> we<00:02:36.420> already<00:02:36.540> known<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:36.810> and

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
top speed but we already known that and

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.100 
top speed but we already known that and
we<00:02:37.230> already<00:02:37.350> knew<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:38.180> it's<00:02:39.180> crazy<00:02:39.360> the

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
we already knew that so it's crazy the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.580 
we already knew that so it's crazy the
amount<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:40.860> time<00:02:41.040> it<00:02:41.190> took<00:02:41.400> but<00:02:41.640> still<00:02:42.590> there

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
amount of time it took but still there

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.020 
amount of time it took but still there
you<00:02:43.680> go

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
you go

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.000 
you go
top<00:02:45.030> point<00:02:45.540> right<00:02:45.720> there<00:02:45.750> towards<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.620> galley

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
top point right there towards the galley

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.380 
top point right there towards the galley
and<00:02:47.220> it's<00:02:47.730> going<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:47.910> keep<00:02:48.000> going<00:02:48.180> at<00:02:48.330> this

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
and it's going to keep going at this

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.460 
and it's going to keep going at this
point<00:02:48.570> so<00:02:48.840> you<00:02:49.110> guys<00:02:49.920> pretty<00:02:50.100> much<00:02:50.250> expect

point so you guys pretty much expect

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.040 
point so you guys pretty much expect
