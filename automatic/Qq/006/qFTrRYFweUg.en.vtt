00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
hi this is Colin at the dog line thanks

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.839 
hi this is Colin at the dog line thanks
for<00:00:07.200> joining<00:00:07.410> us<00:00:07.529> on<00:00:07.680> our<00:00:07.740> video<00:00:08.130> series<00:00:08.519> about

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
for joining us on our video series about

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.820 
for joining us on our video series about
the<00:00:09.000> pet<00:00:09.179> barrier<00:00:09.420> let's<00:00:10.290> have<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.500> look<00:00:10.620> at<00:00:10.740> the

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
the pet barrier let's have a look at the

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.589 
the pet barrier let's have a look at the
radio<00:00:11.160> signal<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:11.820> how<00:00:12.059> its<00:00:12.269> actually

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
radio signal and how its actually

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.749 
radio signal and how its actually
created<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.830> amazing<00:00:14.250> difference<00:00:14.580> we're

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
created the amazing difference we're

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.120 
created the amazing difference we're
offering<00:00:15.179> is<00:00:15.330> that<00:00:15.480> we<00:00:15.599> have<00:00:15.780> an<00:00:15.870> FM<00:00:16.440> coded

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
offering is that we have an FM coded

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.570 
offering is that we have an FM coded
digital<00:00:17.760> radio<00:00:18.300> frequency<00:00:18.990> now<00:00:19.800> first<00:00:20.160> radio

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
digital radio frequency now first radio

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.609 
digital radio frequency now first radio
when<00:00:20.880> FM<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.570> now<00:00:21.779> everything<00:00:22.199> seems<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.529> be

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
when FM and now everything seems to be

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.500 
when FM and now everything seems to be
going<00:00:22.859> digital<00:00:23.160> but<00:00:24.000> we've<00:00:24.150> already<00:00:24.359> got

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
going digital but we've already got

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.990 
going digital but we've already got
digital<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:26.310> does<00:00:26.550> have<00:00:26.820> its

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
digital and that does have its

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.589 
digital and that does have its
advantages

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
advantages

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.410 
advantages
our<00:00:28.410> FM<00:00:28.830> radio<00:00:29.189> frequency<00:00:29.789> won't<00:00:30.090> interfere

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
our FM radio frequency won't interfere

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.450 
our FM radio frequency won't interfere
with<00:00:30.750> any<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.140> radio<00:00:31.470> signals<00:00:31.980> inside

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
with any of the radio signals inside

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.549 
with any of the radio signals inside
your<00:00:32.730> house<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.210> it's<00:00:33.630> even<00:00:33.960> safe<00:00:34.260> for<00:00:34.469> your

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
your house and it's even safe for your

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.740 
your house and it's even safe for your
dog<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.829> wear<00:00:35.190> in<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.610> inside<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.090> next<00:00:36.630> to

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
dog to wear in the inside and next to

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.590 
dog to wear in the inside and next to
the<00:00:36.840> TV<00:00:37.129> no<00:00:38.129> other<00:00:38.399> radio<00:00:38.820> signals<00:00:39.360> will

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
the TV no other radio signals will

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.360 
the TV no other radio signals will
activate<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.290> receiver<00:00:40.680> collar<00:00:40.980> on<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.340> dog

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
activate the receiver collar on the dog

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.030 
activate the receiver collar on the dog
so<00:00:42.090> it's<00:00:42.239> quite<00:00:42.510> safe<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:43.079> be<00:00:43.170> worn<00:00:43.469> without

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
so it's quite safe to be worn without

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.619 
so it's quite safe to be worn without
fear<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.520> getting<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.969> dog<00:00:45.149> getting<00:00:45.360> any

the radio transmitter if you imagine
that<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.119> be<00:01:06.240> like<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.450> radio<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.680> sending<00:01:08.010> the

radio signal up the aerial but the
aerial<00:01:11.100> instead<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.700> having<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.150> radio

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450

aerial instead of having the radio
signal<00:01:12.869> projecting<00:01:13.350> forever<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:14.400> wire<00:01:14.670> is

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
signal projecting forever the wire is

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.850 
signal projecting forever the wire is
the<00:01:15.180> aerial<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.810> we<00:01:15.990> take<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.409> around<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
the aerial and we take that around the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.740 
the aerial and we take that around the
property<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.700> when<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.000> radio<00:01:18.299> signal

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
property and when the radio signal

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.539 
property and when the radio signal
returns<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.380> transmitter<00:01:19.920> the

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
returns to the transmitter the

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.429 
returns to the transmitter the
transmitters<00:01:21.180> job<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.810> actually<00:01:22.140> block

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
transmitters job is to actually block

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.710 
transmitters job is to actually block
the<00:01:22.799> radio<00:01:23.130> signal<00:01:23.670> now<00:01:24.210> when<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.479> turn<00:01:24.659> up

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
the radio signal now when you turn up

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.170 
the radio signal now when you turn up
the<00:01:24.990> rangecontrol<00:01:25.430> you<00:01:26.430> actually<00:01:26.820> create

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
the rangecontrol you actually create

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.090 
the rangecontrol you actually create
more<00:01:27.390> pressure<00:01:27.689> on<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.200> radio<00:01:28.530> signal<00:01:29.009> and

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
more pressure on the radio signal and

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.429 
more pressure on the radio signal and
you<00:01:29.400> expand<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.119> radio<00:01:30.450> signal<00:01:30.900> out<00:01:31.049> from<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
you expand the radio signal out from the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.310 
you expand the radio signal out from the
wire<00:01:31.650> one<00:01:32.610> thing<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.329> grounds<00:01:33.869> keeper<00:01:34.200> is

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
wire one thing the grounds keeper is

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.620 
wire one thing the grounds keeper is
very<00:01:34.560> good<00:01:34.770> at<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.070> doing<00:01:35.280> very<00:01:35.640> small<00:01:36.030> radio

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
very good at is doing very small radio

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.020 
very good at is doing very small radio
signals<00:01:37.170> which<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.560> quite<00:01:37.799> often<00:01:38.070> difficult

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
signals which is quite often difficult

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.050 
signals which is quite often difficult
so<00:01:39.630> we<00:01:39.810> can<00:01:39.990> create<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.560> small<00:01:40.950> radio<00:01:41.369> signal<00:01:41.880> at

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
so we can create a small radio signal at

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.850 
so we can create a small radio signal at
the<00:01:42.210> bottom<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.659> fence<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.140> one<00:01:43.350> small

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
the bottom of the fence and one small

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.770 
the bottom of the fence and one small
radio<00:01:44.220> signal<00:01:44.640> at<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.939> top<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.299> fence<00:01:45.540> as

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
radio signal at the top of the fence as

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.630 
radio signal at the top of the fence as
well<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.259> we<00:01:46.380> have<00:01:46.530> two<00:01:46.740> ways<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:47.189> controlling

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
well so we have two ways of controlling

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.969 
well so we have two ways of controlling
the<00:01:47.909> depth<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.390> radio<00:01:48.689> signal<00:01:49.229> using<00:01:49.799> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
the depth of the radio signal using the
