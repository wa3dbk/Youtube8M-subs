so<00:00:01.700> that's<00:00:02.700> how<00:00:03.000> to<00:00:03.300> think<00:00:03.750> about<00:00:03.959> grip

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
so that's how to think about grip

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.190 
so that's how to think about grip
changes<00:00:04.680> just<00:00:04.950> get<00:00:05.250> in<00:00:05.339> your<00:00:05.370> hoop<00:00:06.200> practice

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
changes just get in your hoop practice

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.500 
changes just get in your hoop practice

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
holding it and stepping through it every

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.749 
holding it and stepping through it every
way<00:00:09.900> you<00:00:09.929> can<00:00:10.519> turning<00:00:11.780> reversing<00:00:12.780> directions

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:13.759 
way you can turning reversing directions

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.439 
way you can turning reversing directions
passing<00:00:14.759> it<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.059> other<00:00:15.210> hand<00:00:15.660> stopping

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:17.449 
passing it to the other hand stopping

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:24.320 
passing it to the other hand stopping
starting<00:00:18.449> speeding<00:00:19.350> up<00:00:21.289> um<00:00:23.119> freezing<00:00:24.119> just

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
starting speeding up um freezing just

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.009 
starting speeding up um freezing just
holding<00:00:25.519> and<00:00:26.519> just<00:00:27.180> from<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.539> you'll<00:00:27.779> figure

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
holding and just from that you'll figure

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.650 
holding and just from that you'll figure
out<00:00:28.140> ways<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.920> can<00:00:29.300> step<00:00:30.300> through<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
out ways that you can step through the

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.700 
out ways that you can step through the
hoop<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:31.199> might<00:00:31.380> not<00:00:31.529> have<00:00:31.650> thought

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
hoop that you might not have thought

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.120 
hoop that you might not have thought
about<00:00:31.920> before<00:00:33.170> ways<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.440> can<00:00:34.649> turn<00:00:34.860> with

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
about before ways that you can turn with

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.110 
about before ways that you can turn with
the<00:00:35.160> hoop<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.610> might<00:00:35.790> not<00:00:35.940> have<00:00:36.059> thought

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
the hoop you might not have thought

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.660 
the hoop you might not have thought
about<00:00:36.270> before<00:00:36.559> things<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:37.800> can<00:00:37.980> do<00:00:38.489> with

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
about before things that you can do with

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.799 
about before things that you can do with
it<00:00:40.700> so<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:42.059> quick<00:00:42.719> fix<00:00:43.140> for<00:00:44.510> trying<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.660> learn

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
it so a quick fix for trying to learn

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.740 
it so a quick fix for trying to learn
transitions<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:47.280> look<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.820> sit<00:00:48.030> down<00:00:48.239> and

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
transitions is to look to sit down and

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.170 
transitions is to look to sit down and
make<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.989> little<00:00:49.289> short<00:00:49.590> note<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:50.070> all<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
make a little short note of all the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.029 
make a little short note of all the
moves<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.809> know<00:00:52.020> what<00:00:52.320> planes<00:00:52.680> they're

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
moves that you know what planes they're

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.150 
moves that you know what planes they're
in<00:00:53.219> let's<00:00:54.149> say<00:00:54.480> we're<00:00:54.780> going<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.960> choose<00:00:55.170> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
in let's say we're going to choose the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.150 
in let's say we're going to choose the
front<00:00:56.489> plane<00:00:56.879> well<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:58.079> know<00:00:58.440> how<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.859> do<00:00:59.039> it

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
front plane well I know how to do it

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.650 
front plane well I know how to do it
across<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.609> back<00:00:59.760> roll<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.239> across<00:01:00.449> the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
across the back roll and across the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.850 
across the back roll and across the
chest<00:01:00.930> roll<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.530> step<00:01:02.460> through<00:01:03.290> elbow<00:01:04.290> whooping

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
chest roll a step through elbow whooping

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.490 
chest roll a step through elbow whooping
so<00:01:05.700> let's<00:01:06.150> just<00:01:06.299> take<00:01:06.630> those<00:01:06.869> things<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.350> try

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
so let's just take those things and try

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.109 
so let's just take those things and try
to<00:01:07.560> put<00:01:07.770> them<00:01:07.890> together<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.490> see<00:01:08.549> if<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.939> can

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
to put them together and see if I can

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.420 
to put them together and see if I can
flow<00:01:09.450> from<00:01:09.689> one<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.110> other<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.680> if<00:01:11.280> I'm

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
flow from one to the other so if I'm

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.050 
flow from one to the other so if I'm
hand<00:01:11.700> whooping<00:01:12.150> then<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.869> can<00:01:13.049> do<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.760> chest<00:01:14.760> roll

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
hand whooping then I can do a chest roll

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.999 
hand whooping then I can do a chest roll
a<00:01:16.460> backroom<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:18.830> step<00:01:19.830> through<00:01:20.659> um<00:01:21.799> nest<00:01:22.799> eight

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
a backroom a step through um nest eight

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.499 
a backroom a step through um nest eight
and<00:01:23.280> elbow<00:01:23.640> whooping<00:01:25.610> and<00:01:26.610> anything<00:01:27.390> else

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
and elbow whooping and anything else

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.469 
and elbow whooping and anything else
that<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.900> can<00:01:28.049> think<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:29.030> so<00:01:30.030> just<00:01:30.240> practice

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
that you can think of so just practice

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.410 
that you can think of so just practice
that<00:01:30.990> plane<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.799> then<00:01:32.400> when<00:01:32.549> you're<00:01:32.700> when<00:01:33.270> you

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
that plane and then when you're when you

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.080 
that plane and then when you're when you
explore<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.590> for<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.950> while<00:01:35.130> say<00:01:35.549> okay<00:01:35.909> I'm

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
explore that for a while say okay I'm

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.899 
explore that for a while say okay I'm
going<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.360> change<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.780> side<00:01:37.079> plane<00:01:37.439> now<00:01:37.909> what

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
going to change the side plane now what

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.800 
going to change the side plane now what
can<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.119> do<00:01:39.180> here<00:01:40.400> and<00:01:41.400> as<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.150> play<00:01:42.479> with<00:01:42.630> those

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
can I do here and as you play with those

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.710 
can I do here and as you play with those
practice<00:01:43.470> going<00:01:44.189> forwards<00:01:44.820> going<00:01:45.180> backwards

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
practice going forwards going backwards

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.020 
practice going forwards going backwards
stopping<00:01:46.490> switching<00:01:47.490> planes<00:01:49.850> following<00:01:50.850> your

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030

the<00:05:16.390> side<00:05:16.660> move<00:05:17.080> the<00:05:17.200> hoop<00:05:17.350> to<00:05:17.530> the<00:05:17.650> other<00:05:17.830> side

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
the side move the hoop to the other side

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.640 
the side move the hoop to the other side
get<00:05:18.970> faster<00:05:19.360> it's<00:05:19.750> lower<00:05:19.930> uh<00:05:21.060> fries<00:05:22.650> you

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
get faster it's lower uh fries you

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.170 
get faster it's lower uh fries you
should<00:05:23.890> be<00:05:24.040> able<00:05:24.130> to<00:05:24.250> freeze<00:05:24.460> almost<00:05:24.820> anywhere

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
should be able to freeze almost anywhere

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.450 
should be able to freeze almost anywhere
right<00:05:25.240> in<00:05:25.600> the<00:05:25.690> middle<00:05:25.870> of<00:05:26.050> a<00:05:26.110> move<00:05:26.410> and<00:05:26.680> if<00:05:27.070> you

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
right in the middle of a move and if you

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.280 
right in the middle of a move and if you
can't<00:05:27.820> that<00:05:28.390> tells<00:05:28.630> you<00:05:28.750> that's<00:05:28.870> the<00:05:29.080> place

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
can't that tells you that's the place

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.750 
can't that tells you that's the place
that<00:05:29.320> you<00:05:29.530> pay<00:05:29.830> attention<00:05:29.919> to<00:05:30.310> in<00:05:30.400> that<00:05:30.490> move

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
that you pay attention to in that move

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.740 
that you pay attention to in that move
and<00:05:31.030> build<00:05:31.720> strength<00:05:32.080> there<00:05:32.910> so<00:05:33.910> that's<00:05:34.479> all<00:05:34.720> I

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
and build strength there so that's all I

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.930 
and build strength there so that's all I
can<00:05:34.900> think<00:05:35.050> of<00:05:35.350> really<00:05:35.890> complicated<00:05:36.400> topic<00:05:36.850> I

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
can think of really complicated topic I

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.219 
can think of really complicated topic I
hope<00:05:37.090> this<00:05:37.270> makes<00:05:37.900> some<00:05:38.169> kind<00:05:38.290> of<00:05:38.410> sense<00:05:38.470> um

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
hope this makes some kind of sense um

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:43.350 
hope this makes some kind of sense um
just<00:05:41.229> play<00:05:41.979> with<00:05:42.130> it<00:05:42.190> just<00:05:42.520> experiment<00:05:43.210> that's

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
just play with it just experiment that's

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.969 
just play with it just experiment that's
how<00:05:43.570> we<00:05:43.630> learn<00:05:43.930> all<00:05:44.140> of<00:05:44.169> our<00:05:44.350> best<00:05:44.530> stuff<00:05:44.830> is

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
how we learn all of our best stuff is

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:46.170 
how we learn all of our best stuff is
not<00:05:45.160> from<00:05:45.310> somebody<00:05:45.490> telling<00:05:45.760> us<00:05:45.940> to<00:05:46.030> do

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
not from somebody telling us to do

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.820 
not from somebody telling us to do
something<00:05:46.300> it's<00:05:46.960> by<00:05:47.169> figuring<00:05:47.500> out<00:05:47.560> for

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
something it's by figuring out for

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.800 
something it's by figuring out for
ourselves<00:05:47.890> so<00:05:48.610> just<00:05:48.820> play<00:05:49.330> with<00:05:49.510> it<00:05:49.570> give

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
ourselves so just play with it give

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.950 
ourselves so just play with it give
yourself<00:05:50.200> permission<00:05:50.470> to<00:05:51.210> look<00:05:52.210> goofy<00:05:52.510> to

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
yourself permission to look goofy to

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.480 
yourself permission to look goofy to
feel<00:05:53.229> goofy<00:05:53.500> to<00:05:53.770> try<00:05:53.950> everything<00:05:54.250> that<00:05:54.430> you

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
feel goofy to try everything that you

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:55.860 
feel goofy to try everything that you
can<00:05:54.580> think<00:05:54.640> of<00:05:54.820> and<00:05:55.000> anything<00:05:55.360> that<00:05:55.540> you<00:05:55.720> can

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
can think of and anything that you can

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.630 
can think of and anything that you can
do<00:05:55.990> one<00:05:56.169> direction<00:05:56.650> try<00:05:57.340> it<00:05:57.400> another

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:57.640 
do one direction try it another

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
do one direction try it another
direction<00:05:57.940> even<00:05:58.390> like<00:05:59.340> it<00:06:00.340> across<00:06:00.580> the<00:06:00.660> back

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660 
direction even like it across the back

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.690 
direction even like it across the back
roll<00:06:02.040> okay<00:06:03.040> I<00:06:03.070> can<00:06:03.220> do<00:06:03.310> it<00:06:03.430> horizontally

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
roll okay I can do it horizontally

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.440 
roll okay I can do it horizontally
but<00:06:05.300> I<00:06:05.390> can<00:06:05.570> also<00:06:05.750> take<00:06:06.620> my<00:06:06.800> hip<00:06:06.980> to<00:06:07.100> the<00:06:07.220> side

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.450 
but I can also take my hip to the side

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.810 
but I can also take my hip to the side
do<00:06:08.450> it<00:06:08.540> across<00:06:08.720> the<00:06:08.810> back<00:06:09.110> here<00:06:09.500> and<00:06:10.340> if<00:06:10.550> I<00:06:10.670> can

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
do it across the back here and if I can

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.120 
do it across the back here and if I can
do<00:06:10.940> it<00:06:10.970> that<00:06:11.270> way<00:06:11.510> I<00:06:11.810> can<00:06:12.230> also<00:06:12.440> do<00:06:12.740> it<00:06:12.770> coming

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
do it that way I can also do it coming

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.530 
do it that way I can also do it coming
back<00:06:13.310> at<00:06:14.890> so<00:06:15.910> everything<00:06:16.910> you<00:06:17.030> can<00:06:17.180> think<00:06:17.210> of

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:17.540 
back at so everything you can think of

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.260 
back at so everything you can think of
try<00:06:18.440> it<00:06:18.500> in<00:06:18.710> every<00:06:18.980> direction<00:06:19.100> I<00:06:19.580> hope<00:06:20.060> I<00:06:20.150> got

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270 
try it in every direction I hope I got

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:30.129 
try it in every direction I hope I got
this<00:06:20.390> in<00:06:20.570> in<00:06:20.720> under<00:06:20.960> 10<00:06:21.110> minutes
