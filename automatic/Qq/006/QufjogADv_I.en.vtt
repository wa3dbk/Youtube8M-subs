my<00:00:10.200> computer<00:00:10.620> parts<00:00:11.809> first<00:00:12.809> we're<00:00:13.019> gonna

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
my computer parts first we're gonna

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.849 
my computer parts first we're gonna
start<00:00:13.440> off<00:00:13.530> with<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.120> power<00:00:15.120> color<00:00:15.389> HD<00:00:15.830> for<00:00:16.830> a

start off with the power color HD for a
90<00:00:17.369> it's<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.630> totally<00:00:19.350> kick-ass<00:00:19.800> card<00:00:20.900> that

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
90 it's a totally kick-ass card that

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.740 
90 it's a totally kick-ass card that
literally<00:00:22.650> can<00:00:22.949> play<00:00:23.189> every<00:00:23.640> game<00:00:23.670> on<00:00:23.880> the

highest graphics out now and probably

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.980 
highest graphics out now and probably
will<00:00:28.800> do<00:00:29.220> for<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.580> couple<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.849> months<00:00:29.939> from<00:00:30.750> here

processor the real beast this is the x4
965<00:00:39.469> and<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.620> came<00:00:40.860> with<00:00:41.129> this<00:00:41.960> cpu<00:00:42.960> cooler<00:00:43.440> the

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
965 and it came with this cpu cooler the

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.639 
965 and it came with this cpu cooler the
which<00:00:45.000> i<00:00:45.210> did<00:00:45.420> not<00:00:45.600> use<00:00:45.930> because<00:00:46.140> i<00:00:46.320> bought<00:00:46.530> an

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
which i did not use because i bought an

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
under cpu cooler which was this one

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.560 
under cpu cooler which was this one
which<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.180> also<00:00:51.809> totally<00:00:52.590> kick<00:00:52.980> ass<00:00:53.149> this<00:00:54.149> the

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
which is also totally kick ass this the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.750 
which is also totally kick ass this the
cmps<00:00:55.640> 9900<00:00:57.230> which<00:00:58.230> get<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> blue<00:00:58.680> LED<00:00:59.309> light<00:00:59.550> in

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
cmps 9900 which get a blue LED light in

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.229 
cmps 9900 which get a blue LED light in
it<00:00:59.910> which<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.359> really<00:01:00.390> cool<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.550> it<00:01:02.550> was<00:01:02.699> very

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
it which is really cool and it was very

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.070 
it which is really cool and it was very
easy<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.870> install<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.760> is<00:01:05.760> really<00:01:06.570> cooling<00:01:06.900> it

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
easy to install and is really cooling it

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.740 
easy to install and is really cooling it
down<00:01:07.110> even<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:07.860> loads<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.460> give<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.479> thumbs

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
down even in loads so give it a thumbs

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:18.460 
down even in loads so give it a thumbs
up<00:01:11.689> here<00:01:12.689> we<00:01:12.810> got<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.260> Rams<00:01:15.080> 6<00:01:16.080> gigabytes<00:01:17.360> ddr3

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
up here we got the Rams 6 gigabytes ddr3

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.980 
up here we got the Rams 6 gigabytes ddr3
chrome<00:01:19.470> coarser<00:01:20.030> they<00:01:21.030> really<00:01:21.360> work<00:01:21.570> as<00:01:21.780> well

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
chrome coarser they really work as well

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.609 
chrome coarser they really work as well
and<00:01:22.560> they<00:01:22.979> got<00:01:23.130> heat<00:01:23.310> sink<00:01:23.580> on<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.150> I

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
and they got heat sink on it so I

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.179 
and they got heat sink on it so I
recommend<00:01:25.619> those<00:01:26.100> two<00:01:27.619> here<00:01:28.619> we<00:01:28.710> got<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
recommend those two here we got the

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.030 
recommend those two here we got the
power<00:01:29.549> supply<00:01:29.759> from<00:01:30.329> coarser<00:01:30.840> which<00:01:31.259> actually

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
power supply from coarser which actually

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.130 
power supply from coarser which actually
is<00:01:32.369> my<00:01:32.549> favorite<00:01:33.030> power<00:01:33.960> supply<00:01:34.970> brand

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
is my favorite power supply brand

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.380 
is my favorite power supply brand
because<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.470> really<00:01:37.829> does<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.850> work<00:01:39.030> and

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
because it really does the work and

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.749 
because it really does the work and
keeps<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.229> cold<00:01:40.470> down<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.860> pretty<00:01:41.430> quiet

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
keeps the cold down it pretty quiet

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.660 
keeps the cold down it pretty quiet
though<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.380> give<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.710> thumbs<00:01:43.979> up<00:01:44.159> although

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
though so I give a thumbs up although

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.950 
though so I give a thumbs up although
it's<00:01:44.850> for<00:01:45.180> nvidia<00:01:45.750> sly

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
it's for nvidia sly

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.980 
it's for nvidia sly
that<00:01:48.680> does<00:01:48.950> just<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.400> mark<00:01:49.760> so<00:01:50.450> doesn't

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
that does just the mark so doesn't

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.300 
that does just the mark so doesn't
matter<00:01:51.110> you<00:01:51.260> could<00:01:51.409> probably<00:01:51.710> pray<00:01:51.979> or<00:01:52.130> you

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
matter you could probably pray or you

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.219 
matter you could probably pray or you
can<00:01:52.520> play<00:01:52.729> experiments<00:01:53.479> or<00:01:53.630> crossfire<00:01:53.930> as

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
can play experiments or crossfire as

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.590 
can play experiments or crossfire as
well<00:01:54.440> so<00:01:55.100> that<00:01:55.280> doesn't<00:01:55.610> matter<00:01:55.729> and<00:01:56.270> it's

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
well so that doesn't matter and it's

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.050 
well so that doesn't matter and it's
five<00:01:57.229> years<00:01:57.440> warranty<00:01:57.920> so<00:01:58.250> which<00:01:58.640> is<00:01:58.820> really

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
five years warranty so which is really

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.730 
five years warranty so which is really
great<00:01:59.270> as<00:01:59.600> well<00:02:01.570> and<00:02:02.570> then<00:02:02.780> you<00:02:02.810> got<00:02:03.080> the<00:02:03.380> mud

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
great as well and then you got the mud

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.180 
great as well and then you got the mud
war<00:02:04.180> which<00:02:05.180> is<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.750> OSIS<00:02:06.380> m4a<00:02:07.369> 78<00:02:08.149> te<00:02:08.920> this<00:02:09.920> is

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
war which is the OSIS m4a 78 te this is

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.110 
war which is the OSIS m4a 78 te this is
among<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.180> most<00:02:11.450> newest<00:02:12.580> this<00:02:13.580> is<00:02:13.730> one<00:02:13.910> of<00:02:14.000> the

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
among the most newest this is one of the

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.040 
among the most newest this is one of the
best<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.690> it<00:02:15.140> also<00:02:15.290> got<00:02:15.590> this<00:02:16.030> turbo<00:02:17.030> key<00:02:17.300> and

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
best and it also got this turbo key and

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.320 
best and it also got this turbo key and
I'll<00:02:18.709> leave<00:02:18.950> a<00:02:19.069> question<00:02:19.310> Marcus<00:02:19.880> I<00:02:20.060> do<00:02:20.120> not

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
I'll leave a question Marcus I do not

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
I'll leave a question Marcus I do not
know<00:02:20.600> what<00:02:20.720> that<00:02:20.930> is<00:02:22.510> but<00:02:23.510> I<00:02:23.570> think<00:02:24.019> it's<00:02:24.170> for

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
know what that is but I think it's for

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.100 
know what that is but I think it's for
overclocking<00:02:24.830> so<00:02:25.300> when<00:02:26.300> you<00:02:26.450> hold<00:02:26.750> down<00:02:26.900> the

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
overclocking so when you hold down the

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.310 
overclocking so when you hold down the
button<00:02:27.140> hit<00:02:27.560> also<00:02:28.010> or<00:02:28.790> it<00:02:29.390> will<00:02:29.510> go<00:02:29.750> on<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:30.290> a

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
button hit also or it will go on to a

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.430 
button hit also or it will go on to a
overclock<00:02:31.040> mode<00:02:31.280> instantly<00:02:32.170> without<00:02:33.170> you

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
overclock mode instantly without you

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.920 
overclock mode instantly without you
have<00:02:33.620> to<00:02:33.769> lose<00:02:34.070> switch<00:02:34.820> anything<00:02:37.480> up<00:02:38.480> there<00:02:38.690> so

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
have to lose switch anything up there so

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:49.650
