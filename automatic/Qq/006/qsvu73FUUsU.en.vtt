watching progress happen there must be

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:52.860 
watching progress happen there must be
some<00:00:51.819> other<00:00:51.850> reason<00:00:52.059> they're<00:00:52.479> catching<00:00:52.780> on

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
some other reason they're catching on

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.629 
some other reason they're catching on
now<00:00:53.109> after<00:00:53.769> all<00:00:53.920> these<00:00:54.129> are<00:00:54.280> some<00:00:54.460> of<00:00:54.489> the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:54.639 
now after all these are some of the

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:56.489 
now after all these are some of the
simplest<00:00:55.030> games<00:00:55.329> ever<00:00:55.629> to<00:00:55.809> create<00:00:56.019> you'd

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:56.499 
simplest games ever to create you'd

00:00:56.499 --> 00:00:57.959 
simplest games ever to create you'd
think<00:00:56.649> something<00:00:56.979> this<00:00:57.100> compelling<00:00:57.489> and<00:00:57.760> easy

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
think something this compelling and easy

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.309 
think something this compelling and easy
to<00:00:58.179> make<00:00:58.359> would<00:00:58.510> have<00:00:58.600> taken<00:00:58.780> off<00:00:58.959> years<00:00:59.260> ago

00:00:59.309 --> 00:00:59.319 
to make would have taken off years ago

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:01.919 
to make would have taken off years ago
so<00:01:00.039> then<00:01:00.190> what's<00:01:00.459> changed<00:01:00.909> well<00:01:01.449> to<00:01:01.659> really

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:01.929 
so then what's changed well to really

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:03.360 
so then what's changed well to really
answer<00:01:02.139> this<00:01:02.499> we're<00:01:02.739> gonna<00:01:02.859> have<00:01:02.979> to<00:01:03.219> look

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
answer this we're gonna have to look

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.859 
answer this we're gonna have to look
into<00:01:03.519> the<00:01:03.699> history<00:01:04.089> of<00:01:04.210> idle<00:01:04.479> games

the earliest idle game I can recall was

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.940 
the earliest idle game I can recall was
called<00:01:07.299> progress<00:01:07.630> quest<00:01:08.170> a<00:01:08.380> game<00:01:08.649> that<00:01:08.799> came

years<00:01:17.320> before<00:01:17.530> these<00:01:17.859> games<00:01:18.100> started<00:01:18.549> really

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.590 
turning into the mass audience activity
they've<00:01:20.770> become<00:01:20.950> today<00:01:21.340> so<00:01:21.820> again<00:01:22.180> we<00:01:22.329> have<00:01:22.479> to

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
they've become today so again we have to

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.029 
they've become today so again we have to
ask<00:01:22.630> what's<00:01:23.380> changed

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039 
ask what's changed

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:26.069 
ask what's changed
well<00:01:24.460> first<00:01:24.789> off<00:01:24.939> how<00:01:25.240> you<00:01:25.299> access<00:01:25.869> these

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079

well first off how you access these
games<00:01:26.380> has<00:01:26.619> changed<00:01:27.070> rather<00:01:27.520> than<00:01:27.820> having<00:01:28.030> to

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
games has changed rather than having to

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.999 
games has changed rather than having to
install<00:01:28.600> a<00:01:28.630> program<00:01:29.109> and<00:01:29.380> having<00:01:29.619> all<00:01:29.799> of<00:01:29.829> your

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:06.159 
guess responses several of them

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:07.710 
guess responses several of them
mentioned<00:04:06.519> that<00:04:06.669> it<00:04:06.879> was<00:04:06.909> actually<00:04:07.359> hard<00:04:07.659> for

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
mentioned that it was actually hard for

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.330 
mentioned that it was actually hard for
them<00:04:08.019> to<00:04:08.199> sit<00:04:08.409> through<00:04:08.560> a<00:04:08.620> lecture<00:04:08.739> without

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
them to sit through a lecture without

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.439 
them to sit through a lecture without
doing<00:04:09.760> anything<00:04:10.060> else

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:10.449 
doing anything else

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:12.960 
doing anything else
it<00:04:10.780> made<00:04:10.989> them<00:04:11.109> feel<00:04:11.169> weird<00:04:11.859> and<00:04:12.220> nervous<00:04:12.790> and

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
it made them feel weird and nervous and

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.939 
it made them feel weird and nervous and
idle<00:04:13.479> games<00:04:13.629> were<00:04:13.900> a<00:04:13.930> good<00:04:14.199> answer<00:04:14.470> to<00:04:14.590> that<00:04:14.620> so

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:14.949 
idle games were a good answer to that so

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:17.640 
idle games were a good answer to that so
idle<00:04:15.909> games<00:04:16.060> are<00:04:16.329> just<00:04:16.510> big<00:04:16.810> Skinner<00:04:17.199> boxes

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
idle games are just big Skinner boxes

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
isn't something games have really tried

isn't something games have really tried
before<00:04:46.320> and<00:04:46.530> so<00:04:47.130> while<00:04:47.400> I<00:04:47.430> don't<00:04:47.759> think<00:04:47.970> these

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
before and so while I don't think these

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.370 
before and so while I don't think these
games<00:04:48.330> will<00:04:48.509> maintain<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:49.080> level<00:04:49.320> of

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380

and<00:04:51.750> novel<00:04:51.960> phenomenon<00:04:52.620> for<00:04:52.800> most<00:04:52.979> people<00:04:53.280> I

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
and novel phenomenon for most people I

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.100 
and novel phenomenon for most people I
think<00:04:53.550> they<00:04:53.850> have<00:04:54.000> a<00:04:54.030> niche<00:04:54.300> and<00:04:54.570> given<00:04:54.990> how

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
think they have a niche and given how

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.930 
think they have a niche and given how

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
easy they are to create you'll probably

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.129 
easy they are to create you'll probably
always<00:04:57.120> see<00:04:57.479> some<00:04:57.690> around

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
always see some around

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.379 
always see some around

another<00:05:00.419> for<00:05:00.660> attention<00:05:01.199> I<00:05:01.320> think<00:05:01.350> many<00:05:01.860> idol

game designers will start to naturally
move<00:05:04.320> their<00:05:04.500> games<00:05:04.710> toward<00:05:05.070> the<00:05:05.250> unfolding

games<00:05:06.120> we<00:05:06.330> talked<00:05:06.539> about<00:05:06.660> earlier<00:05:07.080> this<00:05:07.229> year

games we talked about earlier this year
I<00:05:07.710> think<00:05:07.889> this<00:05:08.190> is<00:05:08.340> a<00:05:08.370> healthy<00:05:08.610> direction<00:05:08.880> for

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
I think this is a healthy direction for

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.060 
I think this is a healthy direction for
this<00:05:09.419> genre<00:05:09.630> to<00:05:09.840> go<00:05:09.990> and<00:05:10.199> hopefully<00:05:10.710> it'll

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
this genre to go and hopefully it'll

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.770 
this genre to go and hopefully it'll
give<00:05:11.250> more<00:05:11.460> people<00:05:11.729> a<00:05:11.820> jumping-off<00:05:12.270> point<00:05:12.570> for

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
give more people a jumping-off point for

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.900 
give more people a jumping-off point for
where<00:05:12.990> to<00:05:13.139> start<00:05:13.380> designing<00:05:13.560> games<00:05:14.070> I'll<00:05:14.789> see

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
where to start designing games I'll see

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.300 
where to start designing games I'll see
you<00:05:14.970> next<00:05:15.000> week
