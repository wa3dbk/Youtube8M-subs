00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.830
 Hallöchen here is another murder with one 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.440
 no chaos but a mess 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:13.950
 strategy video under the heading 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.660
 get better, I am myself 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.820
 affected I am bad myself 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.260
 meanwhile and really good i was 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.060
 Of course you never have that too 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.980
 Let's be honest for example 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.170
 worse than usual does not annoy 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.230
 and one wants to get better and better the 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.779
 is clear anyway that's always the case 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.980
 exhausting because you have so much 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.230
 work for us yes i believe many 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.219
 are affected so silver gold and 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.670
 you stagnate but you play somehow 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.469
 nothing happens 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.360
 and now I'm on it too 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:51.360
 this level currently where I am 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:54.300
 Somehow it really does fruit 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.620
 That's not all he has to do 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.629
 bit apart with the matter 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.250
 and I have that today 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:04.080
 tomorrow just done a bit yes 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.170
 working on me in my game too 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.180
 work and to get better is that 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.430
 most important first 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.100
 You have to say I want to get better 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.810
 Well that's logical there but the first 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.000
 you have to find out what to do first 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.260
 i am actually wrong what is with me 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.830
 bad thing I have to actually 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.150
 work and there the battle.net helps 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.710
 itself very good 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.940
 I think most of today's children 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.340
 I'll show you that you just click 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.290
 on an icon then opens completely this year 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.660
 great profile and then you can 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.240
 here under letters so i believe 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.520
 Ranking in Germany and then in 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.060
 look at the statistics and then you see 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.649
 is basically my story a race 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.840
 well known and I see now 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.430
 here that I am really the matchmaking 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.170
 system works so i have against 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.460
 all races are often played in comparison 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.520
 what, for example, does he prove 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.399
 Great thing right next to the left and 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.450
 that describes in the reason yes which 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.910
 my best and which mine 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.530
 worst matchup is you see here 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.869
 shows relatively clearly is mine 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.580
 worst matchup but watch 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.520
 I really care about everything right now 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.110
 So, since I learned so every 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.660
 this one if I now times the 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.790
 currency isn then look at the whole 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.200
 even clearer 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.720
 photos on the contrary then I have one 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.420
 relatively good balance 6 63 percent 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.130
 quite passable but 38 against zerg it 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.870
 Of course it's totally shit here 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.940
 that's the match from where I am now 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.040
 First of all care must be taken protoss 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.010
 against zerg is my bad match 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.390
 that means I have to take action here 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.500
 is first what you for yourself clear 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.180
 should do and there you can also quiet 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.440
 I can not say that but that is 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.120
 not bad I can not do that 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.209
 i cant break bread against zerg 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.209
 that was strong that was already so 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.840
 that is also in cars 2 it is too 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.850
 not otherwise 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.730
 so here for me clearly the 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.870
 Construction site this is my problem the match 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.760
 From there I have to take care of it 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.549
 second point, what you also on 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.260
 his profile just got out of it 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.540
 I just look at matches 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.150
 tree is relatively easy to find 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:10.260
 Just take some game click 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:12.730
 he likes it and then he says one 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.630
 below this performance comes relatively 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.950
 well see yes what phase is yes where 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.239
 that only seems to be a relatively short one 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.480
 Game was I go again another 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.230
 purely that was a shit example 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.810
 Here we go 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:30.609
 Seeing here on the basis of these statistics 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.549
 that's the first thing you can do 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:34.690
 is just the average 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.060
 you leave resources on the account 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.070
 second as is somehow much like 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.260
 has long been one time in the game supply block 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.299
 and how many workers built a castle 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.960
 and the epm but apples now he resists 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:48.150
 is a bit silly 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:52.320
 Actually it is always important 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:56.640
 that here and here so average speed 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:58.230
 resources &amp; supply tilts the two 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.180
 values ​​when they are high is not 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.280
 Well 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.260
 and if you average 904 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.290
 minerals on the resources on the 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:11.640
 account has and in the game a minute 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:14.340
 Supply block was then you can here 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.920
 relatively clear saying okay macro is now 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.110
 not underground bad but stop 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.360
 not really good either 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:22.590
 and that means for me so clearly me 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.210
 can also times I can indeed 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.720
 been saying okay bad game because 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.660
 they do not 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:31.110
 I'll click another one but we'll 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.780
 See a lot about everything 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.760
 400 is not good so it always stays 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.100
 So under 30 seconds or under one 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.350
 minute is fine but here for me 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.570
 So the second construction site, firstly pvz 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:46.350
 practice 21 one likes to watch roman because 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:50.250
 Apparently there is something to do with 800 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:52.080
 minerals in the cut yes that's 86 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.450
 if you want to just do not like it 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.570
 were built on average that 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.640
 bad and as I said then you have to 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.350
 just add the two things 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.960
 and say okay so I'm macro 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.920
 problem and i have problems with 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.920
 I have to do these two things now 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.210
 work and if this statistic does not work 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.670
 rich there are now in the 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.600
 internet a few tools so easy 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.240
 googling times 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.100
 since there do dragDrop sc2 or so 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.630
 or dropp sc2 has the homepage you can 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.520
 upload replays and then you pull the 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.800
 statistics out where you will also see 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.000
 can ok there and there I have construction sites 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.110
 but you have to do that for yourself first 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.940
 identify that you know okay now 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.130
 the two things are with me 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.750
 relatively bad that rausgefunden 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.310
 you can now go to the second chapter and 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.780
 That's exactly what we're looking at 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.100
 what can you do with these two now? 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.480
 I will show you information 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.720
 Now, in that sense, I say up 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.720
 equal
