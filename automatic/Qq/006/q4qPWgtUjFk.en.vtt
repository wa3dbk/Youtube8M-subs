 hello how I hope that very well in the 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:16.020
 Today's video I'll show you how to do 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:19.380
 a lipstick we are going to need the candle 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.550
 and it is I got a spoon 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.650
 very large and a small 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.170
 and chopsticks 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.300
 the ingredients are going to be Vaseline 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.220
 I'm going to use this neutral in the 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.050
 mercadona a cocoa a quintal someone 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.540
 that has been spent for me but the 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.559
 product and I'm also going to take this 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.559
 little bit that I have stayed 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.980
 and eye shadows or lipsticks that do not 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.870
 use and I'm going to use this one 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.680
 here and this little bit that I have left here 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.680
 I'm going to mix them 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.040
 and we started and as always we are going to take 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.110
 well first I'm going to take what I 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.480
 it's here 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.290
 with the back of the spoon I'm going to 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.960
 tease out 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.820
 what's left of the product because neither 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.159
 we are going to throw it away 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.190
 and I'm going to put them in the spoon 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.190
 big 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.619
 let's get it all 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.620
 and when I get so little with a 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.620
 toothpick 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.159
 the rest is removed 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.110
 good 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.360
 once the product is removed, we will 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.760
 save to put it later and 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.159
 we continue doing the same with the 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.069
 vaseline 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.880
 with the small spoon the back 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:58.880
 let's catch 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.880
 and we're going to serve our 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.219
 big spoon 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.890
 if it's another better but if you have any 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.690
 smell because nothing happens either 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.150
 because we will do the lipstick or 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.370
 Floor to that 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.370
 so there's no problem 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:27.200
 well, once that's done, we take our 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:31.030
 shadows and a toothpick and let's go 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.030
 scraping and spooning 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:46.620
 once we put our things in the 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.620
 spoon let's light our candle 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:56.200
 and let's wait for it to melt and with 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.750
 our spoon when it goes saying 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.879
 Well, the candle went out what I say 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.420
 when it's going to melt, we're going 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:06.590
 circling 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.519
 let's see now this 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.519
 with the 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.260
 as we always go around 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.130
 as it melts and adds 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.130
 the necessary amounts 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.069
 and it took a while 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.680
 once melted what we do is 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:32.019
 spin 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.239
 and this the truth that smells pretty good 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:38.530
 because what I throw from the cocoa that I 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:40.450
 it was honey, so it smells great 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.670
 Well now I'm going to take a little 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:47.480
 more shadow and I'll show you 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:50.050
 also once we cast this we continue 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.680
 mixing well 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:57.450
 and when we see that it is completely 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.450
 let's take our container 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.540
 now let's throw it in our container 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:08.300
 this is how we have got it now 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.660
 simply missing it in the fridge or 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.730
 in the freezer for 5 minutes and 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.269
 will be ready right now he taught us how 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:21.049
 It's been good we've finished like this 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:24.530
 is our lipstick still want 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.060
 that marries a little more but good the 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.260
 thing is that this color is so 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:32.040
 beautiful throwing red with something of 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.170
 shines 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.740
 and now I'm going to show you how they would be 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.740
 the lips 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.430
 it's a creamy pair 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:03.620
 having thrown so much petroleum jelly and you give the 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.560
 touch of color I guess when I already 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.620
 be solidified at all and others 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.040
 they will give more color that usually always happens 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.040
 this is how 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.750
