once that back cover is removed there's
a<00:00:47.900> screw<00:00:48.350> I'm<00:00:48.920> going<00:00:49.070> to<00:00:49.160> take<00:00:49.310> a<00:00:49.340> Phillips

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
a screw I'm going to take a Phillips

00:00:50.180 --> 00:01:01.279 
a screw I'm going to take a Phillips
head<00:00:50.270> screwdriver<00:00:50.960> and<00:00:52.120> undo<00:00:53.120> the<00:00:53.630> screw

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.200 

flip<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.100> around<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.489> front<00:01:02.760> we're<00:01:03.030> going<00:01:03.059> to

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
flip it around the front we're going to

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:12.010 
flip it around the front we're going to
twist<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:04.610> kokal<00:01:05.610> tweeter<00:01:07.130> to<00:01:08.130> release<00:01:08.520> it

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.120 

and<00:01:13.909> probably<00:01:14.909> would<00:01:15.119> be<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> good<00:01:15.509> idea<00:01:15.659> to

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
and probably would be a good idea to

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:24.700 
and probably would be a good idea to
keep<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.189> screw<00:01:17.640> tighten<00:01:18.090> down<00:01:18.140> initially

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.289 

unscrew<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.860> tweeter<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.430> then<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:26.970> can<00:01:27.119> go

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
unscrew the tweeter and then you can go

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:45.010 
unscrew the tweeter and then you can go
ahead<00:01:27.860> remove<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.070> screw

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.190 

we'll<00:01:46.020> take<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.229> pair<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.590> pliers<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:48.079> cut<00:01:49.079> the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
wire together we're going to clip the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.380 
wire together we're going to clip the
wire<00:01:53.640> carefully<00:01:55.610> removing<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.729> positive<00:01:57.240> and

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390

wire carefully removing the positive and
the<00:01:57.420> negative<00:01:57.509> which<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:58.470> the<00:01:58.770> wire<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:58.979> goes

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
the negative which is the wire that goes

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.630 
the negative which is the wire that goes
to<00:01:59.429> the<00:01:59.729> tweeter<00:02:00.000> flip<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:01.020> around<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.640> remove

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640

the factory cover back on here covers

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.890 
the factory cover back on here covers
back<00:02:14.519> on<00:02:15.140> there<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.230> my<00:02:16.349> six<00:02:16.620> by<00:02:16.769> nine<00:02:16.799> law<00:02:17.160> firm

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
back on there is my six by nine law firm

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.650 
back on there is my six by nine law firm
here's<00:02:18.900> my<00:02:19.110> tweeter<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:20.330> inside<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.480> little

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
here's my tweeter and inside the little

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.900 
here's my tweeter and inside the little
housing<00:02:22.230> has<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.920> crossover<00:02:23.489> for<00:02:23.730> the

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
housing has the crossover for the

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.710 
housing has the crossover for the
tweeter<00:02:24.380> so<00:02:25.380> that's<00:02:25.650> how<00:02:25.799> you<00:02:25.860> take<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.540> six<00:02:27.540> by
