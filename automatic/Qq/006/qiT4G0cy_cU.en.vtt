00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.500
 I feel very embarrassed by it 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.269
 which has been called seventy years this way 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.860
 in short, it embarrasses why a person is 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.639
 instead, as we are we are used to it 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:21.930
 in short I come now andrea bencini 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:24.779
 they are scandicci in the province of florence 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.869
 first because florence has now become the 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.630
 florence seems to leave us for 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.920
 connect short, even for a roma 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.140
 another journey 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.750
 I belong to the commission of 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.660
 eleventh senate concerning work and 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.040
 social security is a convention neither 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.680
 obviously in this year he had to 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.920
 produce many answers for a country in 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.510
 whose work and where it comes less and less 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.920
 choices made regarding the 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.809
 social Security 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.020
 in short, I went to hit many 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.309
 Italians and in an age has no age we say 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.969
 Limina brought the retirement age 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.250
 forward in time 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.379
 this is obviously a contract too 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.290
 let's see if all of us jobs 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.000
 we push to work up to 67 68 years is 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.369
 obvious that then do not turn out to be places of 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.990
 work to get young people in and how 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.549
 we have already told young people they are 40 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.220
 percent unemployment on 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.360
 population of about 6 million 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.630
 unemployed 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.390
 many countries in Italy or at least many 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.460
 we get up to 60 percent there is not 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.380
 We have been saying a great policy in 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.450
 these 11 months he allowed to 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.820
 unlock this situation that has 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.289
 permission to release jobs is 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.970
 a serious industrial policy that is 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:39.060
 take there is not a policy that 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.720
 allows entrepreneurs to be 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.850
 relieved of contributions to the rates and therefore 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.490
 to grant them also the possibility a 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.590
 shine less for an employee but 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.539
 partial so dependent have a pay 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.549
 a little higher than that of Lecce 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:54.179
 today here is the whole thing put we say 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.390
 done a lot 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:59.490
 you couldn't do much more instead 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.069
 it seemed to us that in short it was not 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.530
 done something else that was not done 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:05.310
 stop this mountain exodus of the 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.039
 our businesses 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.450
 these migrations to other countries a 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.360
 labor is less expensive than this commodification 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.700
 just pure and this too 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.470
 it seems that at present it has not been 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.329
 done 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.940
 so this change of witness as 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:23.069
 has already said future president of 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.540
 council 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.030
 he says that just change the 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.400
 witness said it does not seem to me that he has 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.780
 said that this is what they are 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.160
 for testimonial means to continue 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.299
 at the same pace there will be only one 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.900
 witnesses resort to the same 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.000
 finish line 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.010
 it would seem he wants to run to a 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.660
 different goal to me what 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.980
 affects the whole of for non instances 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.470
 we will remain at present your strength 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.389
 of opposition and that we continue to 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.030
 make our voice heard to be heard 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:51.030
 our thought to feel ours 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.980
 ability to show that there is another 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.959
 how to act also for what 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.220
 it's about work, entrepreneurship is 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.230
 all except that there is neither for the 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.760
 pensions continue to carry on 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.000
 our voice make it there 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.380
 tracollano hear our petitions 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 because we have heart instances from a 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.709
 and improvement distances that can 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.180
 be welcomed this interests us 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.980
 we will do and will help to get busy 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.260
 in this sense up to those who do not 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.540
 we will probably be able to govern not 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.700
 I know when it will be but it will be there 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.700
 he finds tension that we don't let up
