00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
that's okay that tag is a huge pain the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.580 
that's okay that tag is a huge pain the
but<00:01:04.979> anyway<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.610> he<00:01:06.390> uses<00:01:06.659> his<00:01:06.750> little<00:01:07.020> ice

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590

but anyway and he uses his little ice
beam<00:01:07.920> well<00:01:08.760> he<00:01:09.270> does<00:01:09.450> but<00:01:09.630> it's<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.810> lot<00:01:09.930> bigger

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
beam well he does but it's a lot bigger

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.719 
beam well he does but it's a lot bigger
and<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.320> lot<00:01:10.409> more<00:01:10.470> dangerous<00:01:10.950> if<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.490> ever<00:01:11.610> get

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
and a lot more dangerous if you ever get

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.280 
and a lot more dangerous if you ever get
started<00:01:11.850> using<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.270> but<00:01:12.330> yeah<00:01:12.479> bomb<00:01:13.080> is

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
started using it but yeah bomb is

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
started using it but yeah bomb is
probably<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.619> best<00:01:13.740> tricks<00:01:13.920> there's<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.159> lot

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
probably the best tricks there's a lot

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.590 
probably the best tricks there's a lot
of<00:01:14.369> damage<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.790> explicit<00:01:15.000> really<00:01:15.330> hard<00:01:15.509> to

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
of damage the explicit really hard to

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.120 
of damage the explicit really hard to
avoid<00:01:15.659> he'll<00:01:16.080> actually<00:01:16.200> tend<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.680> teleport

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
avoid he'll actually tend to teleport

that he teleported right to the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.770 
that he teleported right to the
explosion<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:38.189> um<00:01:38.460> probably<00:01:39.210> your<00:01:39.420> best<00:01:39.509> call

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
explosion so um probably your best call

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.960 
explosion so um probably your best call
here<00:01:40.049> um<00:01:40.650> as<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.070> can<00:01:41.100> see<00:01:41.250> even<00:01:41.369> even<00:01:41.850> with

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
here um as you can see even even with

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.310 
here um as you can see even even with
bomb<00:01:42.270> though<00:01:42.479> I'm<00:01:42.600> still<00:01:42.840> taking<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.140> lot<00:01:43.290> of

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
bomb though I'm still taking a lot of

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.499 
bomb though I'm still taking a lot of
damage<00:01:43.500> I'm<00:01:43.979> even<00:01:44.880> though<00:01:44.970> he's<00:01:45.119> only<00:01:45.210> one<00:01:45.390> two

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
damage I'm even though he's only one two

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.300 
damage I'm even though he's only one two
it's<00:01:45.630> away<00:01:45.840> I'm<00:01:46.140> still<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.560> pretty<00:01:46.890> low<00:01:47.070> health

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
it's away I'm still a pretty low health

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.910 
it's away I'm still a pretty low health

ice<00:03:36.030> form<00:03:36.329> Eclair<00:03:36.659> form<00:03:36.989> and<00:03:37.199> a<00:03:37.260> spark<00:03:37.560> form

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
ice form Eclair form and a spark form

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.220 
ice form Eclair form and a spark form
each<00:03:38.639> time<00:03:38.849> after<00:03:38.970> moose<00:03:39.299> spark<00:03:39.930> form<00:03:40.139> is

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
each time after moose spark form is

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.569 
each time after moose spark form is
probably<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.650> most<00:03:40.799> dangerous<00:03:41.069> as<00:03:41.430> you'll

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
probably the most dangerous as you'll

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:42.170 
probably the most dangerous as you'll
see<00:03:41.730> shortly

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
see shortly

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.909 
see shortly
but<00:03:42.780> even<00:03:43.019> then<00:03:43.139> I<00:03:43.229> mean<00:03:43.379> this<00:03:43.500> I<00:03:43.709> mean<00:03:43.829> it

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
but even then I mean this I mean it

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.920 
but even then I mean this I mean it
makes<00:03:44.069> the<00:03:44.220> floor<00:03:44.519> slippery<00:03:45.180> I<00:03:45.269> suppose<00:03:45.569> but

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
makes the floor slippery I suppose but

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.490 
makes the floor slippery I suppose but
it's<00:03:46.470> not<00:03:46.590> that<00:03:46.739> big<00:03:46.859> of<00:03:46.919> a<00:03:46.979> deal<00:03:47.159> um<00:03:48.260> it's<00:03:49.260> part

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
it's not that big of a deal um it's part

form as you can see though he shoots
these<00:03:50.549> things<00:03:50.760> out<00:03:50.940> and<00:03:50.970> then<00:03:51.209> he<00:03:51.329> shoots<00:03:51.659> a

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
these things out and then he shoots a

these things out and then he shoots a
little<00:03:53.090> yeah<00:03:54.090> he<00:03:54.299> just<00:03:54.870> attacks<00:03:55.260> pretty<00:03:55.500> hard

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
little yeah he just attacks pretty hard

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.680

and<00:03:57.840> in<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.079> entire<00:03:58.290> outside<00:03:58.590> gets<00:03:59.069> shocked

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
and in the entire outside gets shocked

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.030 
and in the entire outside gets shocked
as<00:03:59.849> well<00:04:00.030> so<00:04:00.329> I<00:04:00.599> mean<00:04:01.290> he<00:04:01.500> used<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.680> be<00:04:01.739> a<00:04:01.769> pretty

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
as well so I mean he used to be a pretty

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.369 
as well so I mean he used to be a pretty
decent<00:04:02.129> damage<00:04:02.639> I'm<00:04:03.030> I'm<00:04:03.540> still<00:04:03.840> kind<00:04:04.229> of<00:04:04.290> the

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
decent damage I'm I'm still kind of the

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.229 
decent damage I'm I'm still kind of the
one<00:04:04.500> health<00:04:04.680> but<00:04:04.919> still<00:04:05.699> not<00:04:05.819> much<00:04:06.060> of<00:04:06.180> a

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
one health but still not much of a

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.430 
one health but still not much of a
threat<00:04:06.269> I<00:04:06.510> mean<00:04:06.629> he<00:04:06.690> has<00:04:06.810> these<00:04:06.959> homes<00:04:07.290> like

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
threat I mean he has these homes like

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.689 
threat I mean he has these homes like
these<00:04:07.560> wreaking<00:04:07.889> just<00:04:08.010> really<00:04:08.250> well<00:04:08.459> off

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:08.699 
these wreaking just really well off

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:10.399 
these wreaking just really well off
damage<00:04:09.000> I<00:04:09.090> think<00:04:09.239> it's<00:04:09.329> almost<00:04:09.569> dead<00:04:09.959> actually

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:10.409 
damage I think it's almost dead actually

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:13.129 
damage I think it's almost dead actually
so<00:04:10.650> it's<00:04:10.889> a<00:04:10.979> few<00:04:11.159> more<00:04:11.310> stars<00:04:11.549> and<00:04:12.030> that<00:04:12.959> should

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
so it's a few more stars and that should

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.860 
so it's a few more stars and that should
be<00:04:13.229> out<00:04:13.440> no<00:04:13.979> no<00:04:14.250> no<00:04:14.459> stupid<00:04:15.060> spark<00:04:15.510> things<00:04:15.690> so

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
be out no no no stupid spark things so
