00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.130
 welcome back to a game of world trip 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.410
 in other words 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.970
 geocacher hope people say from to 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.289

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.610
 we do that 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.530
 get the blades also says how it 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.190
 game I see every time in the 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.690
 comments 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.310
 You can find a link in the description 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.359
 do you want to do this game too I can 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.800
 be click have 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.079
 and then you automatically go to the one 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.850
 that site so this is a geocache there 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.379
 We have to guess where we are at something 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.600
 the world we have to indicate on the 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.530
 map above and that is actually none 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.729
 games 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.589
 other people also feel it again 

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:47.789
 no game no 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:50.319
 so then it is one or the other 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.449
 teaching job, or if not, but this is then 

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:53.829
 just ordinary games for my part 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.149

 device restaurant this is called that ego 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:31.270
 wait for the red door and looked at me 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.950
 if there was the thick branch then I would be 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.840
 another piece 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.450

 regional diamond 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:51.350
 Island Well for now I think Alaska 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:55.219
 in any case the north of america 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.319

 canada there is still a possibility too 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.759
 think that the ball on the air support 

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:06.770
 the one where nothing on the street like that 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:11.209

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.750
 then a bit this angle 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:24.610
 british columbia alberta standing in that corner 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.829
 make s14 100 km it was up to alaska 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.239
 wave of alaska of course it was alaska 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:31.849
 I had it right away for most intervention 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:35.599
 must go this is a very nice time 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:36.769
 bridge where does that bridge go 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.290
 probably to the other side of it 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.049
 the river that is usually without bridges 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.489
 it is nice and warm here the citrox 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:49.880
 this is not alaska where is this then 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:52.430
 I say Florida for now 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.660
 united states that anyway 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.239
 Florida 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.310
 so that i can find it super tasty 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.579
 warm beer and we drive american 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.370
 cars and again the brush what 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:05.930
 you were what you got to the goal you what 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.419
 Sweden 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.430
 ok well then i'm about i say lorida 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:12.430
 that will be a separate because I am never 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.269
 previously been with effort florida 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.620
 there is in miami 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.930
 215 kilometers 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.060
 I was right it was still I had more 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.500
 go to miami 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.230
 I 'll be a little higher yet it was four 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.720
 more to the south many 15 km 27 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.579
 a 65 points and immediately back in the 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.549
 middle of nowhere 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:36.440
 of course but we are lines yellow 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.500
 suffer on the side of the road 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.189
 and usually was on 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.329
 in south africa or in australia and then 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:45.409

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:48.250

 We drive them opening here though 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.069
 I think they have it in South Africa 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.689
 talking about things is not that bad either 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.370

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.209
 in australia eye australia and 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.849
 South Africa 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.439
 pretty both left just nice bar 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:08.930

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:51.000
 South Africa towards the border with 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:53.250
 botswana and zimbabwe why because that 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.240
 two black people have also pure and 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:59.370
 only for that reason 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:00.750
 make s6 139km hoppekee south africa cup 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.520

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.129
 thai letters 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:30.530
 because true in thailand there are few 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:35.000

 burma and the border of laos 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:55.460

 again japan or a japanese not 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.219
 that the Chinese hardly punctuation 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.389
 are a lot more complicated and japanese 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:13.639
 truth there is a gentleman on the left 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:15.770

 I can't remember she being you 

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:23.960
 driving on the left in japan is a problem 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.740

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.740
