00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.310
 hello friends here so well 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.639
 It happened that in one place came together 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:11.880
 dark country night camcorder and 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:13.429
 lantern fenix e25 now try 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:23.029
 to demonstrate 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:23.029
 the light is on, otherwise this is the 27th 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.119
 90 lumens 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.260
 in principle, in principle, you can disassemble 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:47.100
 already a lot of things 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:49.230
 here he is a fence well there is a tree in the distance with something 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:58.890
 my eyes I see that the sacred camera 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:01:03.210
 trains 187 see rain it goes this 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.540
 wood fence seen already almost in 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.540
 all details 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.040
 but 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:20.580
 here from her husband there is with this 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:28.020
 lighting we can by all the details 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:30.000
 disassemble it unfortunately the poor service 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.340
 cameras this pillar of light which goes into 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.250
 sky and so here they are 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.250
 minimum mode average maximum 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.390
 that is not known, in principle, can be 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:58.760
 over time, I'll buy myself a flashlight more powerful 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:02:01.550
 this is so out of my mind all well Zosima 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:05.950
 I can't imagine tasks with 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.950
 which this lantern could not do 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.930
 that is, even the camera even in the rain 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.190
 captures a fairly large flow of color 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:31.000
 liked it all, thank you for your attention 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.000
