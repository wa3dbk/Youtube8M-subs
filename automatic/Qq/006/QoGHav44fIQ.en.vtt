 grams of dark chocolate then 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.850
 began to assemble this cake 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:23.170
 chocolate bomb in my bowl I have 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:27.280
 sifted cocoa now add and salt 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:31.840
 if I find it we make a half 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:36.040
 teaspoon of salt about then I add it 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.569
 twisted sugar a quick put our e 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.830
 then the others began to add 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:44.530
 liquid ingredients then the eggs there 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:49.660
 cream and here I added yeast milk e 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:55.090
 lemon juice as we said the 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:56.940
 melted butter and at temperature e 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.870
 now with whips he began to 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:04.390
 mix everything I check with the whisk 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.239
 all the ingredients are by hand 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:12.190
 were also taken from the bottom if in the 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:13.630
 do this always and even bowl 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.450
 edges 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.920
 at this point I begin to amalgamate 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.920
 also flour and vanillin 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:29.769
 sifting the dough is now ready 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:35.799
 verse in a baking dish that I buttered and 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:37.660
 Floured in the oven at 180 degrees for 30 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.220
 40 minutes approx 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.370
 or until a toothpick stuck into the 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.420
 center does not come out clean once cooked 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.450
 the cake lets it cool 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.459
 completely before filling it in 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.380
 while that the cake in the oven 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:55.030
 I prepare the ganache so I put in a 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:57.850
 small pan the remaining fresh cream la 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.280
 I put on the fire and when it is almost over 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.040
 boil I will remove it so it should not 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.340
 boil the 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.590
 cream but get there to boil 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.920
 at that point it is removed from the fire and yes 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.560
 add the io chocolate to the pan 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.510
 I cut it into tiny little pieces 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.280
 you can also grate to be 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.139
 sure that then it melts inside the 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.709
 cream anyway in the meantime put it when 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.709
 on fire 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.190
 then I removed the cream from the fire 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:29.750
 just before it boiled now 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:33.110
 towards the inside in the chocolate I leave it 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.599
 a few moments just barely rest 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.280
 after which it began to stir until 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:40.280
 you have not melted everything inside 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.830
 then the cream and chocolate if they are 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.539
 perfectly fused together now leave 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.639
 cool to room temperature though 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:48.199
 always coming around every 15 minutes 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.300
 about 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:51.740
 when it will be precisely at temperature 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.960
 environment I put it in the fridge so yes 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.810
 solidifies a little bit even if I want it 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.520
 however, keep it quite malleable 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.349
 because this is a cream that you are 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.570
 kept in the fridge for a long time becomes its own 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:07.729
 beautiful solid other thing if you want it more 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.919
 foamy a little bit softer once 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:11.449
 which will be cooled you can mount it with 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:14.750
 whips just like you do with the 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:17.930
 cream and you will have a nice cream too 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.880
 foamy consistently always to stuff the 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.070
 sweet then I finish the cake 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.580
 first of all the design, so here it is 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:28.300
 the base and then there is the other part this is 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.039
 the ganache as you see the consistency is 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.289
 sufficiently dense as I told you 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:36.919
 you can mount it with electric whips 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:38.389
 and at that point it will come more foamy and e 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:40.970
 even clearer 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:43.880
 or simply leave it so that 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:46.310
 remains more lucid and use it to fill 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.340
 the inside of cakes or even how 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:53.039
 external filling then like 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:55.319
 cover so here I distribute it 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:57.710
 on the car and then cover it with the layer 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:57.710
 higher 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.900
 here is how
