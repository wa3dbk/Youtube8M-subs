00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
around it was like like kind of hiding

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.209

behind<00:00:53.190> me<00:00:53.579> Oh<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:54.149> Pokemon<00:00:54.860> and<00:00:55.860> that's<00:00:56.039> where

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
behind me Oh a Pokemon and that's where

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.819 
behind me Oh a Pokemon and that's where
this<00:00:56.340> thing<00:00:56.579> kind<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.910> got<00:00:57.059> revealed<00:00:57.829> never

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
this thing kind of got revealed never

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.099 
this thing kind of got revealed never
seeing<00:00:59.250> any<00:00:59.489> like<00:01:00.000> kind<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:00.660> form<00:01:00.930> before

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
seeing any like kind of this form before

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.460 
seeing any like kind of this form before
I<00:01:01.530> was<00:01:02.309> maybe<00:01:02.609> maybe<00:01:03.300> thinking<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.899> might<00:01:04.290> have

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
I was maybe maybe thinking it might have

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.140 
I was maybe maybe thinking it might have
to<00:01:04.589> do<00:01:04.680> with<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.920> Z<00:01:04.979> Florida<00:01:05.489> but<00:01:05.700> that's<00:01:05.880> so

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
to do with a Z Florida but that's so

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.090 
to do with a Z Florida but that's so
pretty<00:01:06.360> far<00:01:06.659> off<00:01:06.689> compared<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:07.770> design

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
pretty far off compared to this design

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.280 
pretty far off compared to this design
so<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.460> probably<00:01:08.760> isn't<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.780> then<00:01:10.170> after

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
so it probably isn't that and then after

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.810 
so it probably isn't that and then after
this<00:01:10.619> was<00:01:10.799> shown<00:01:11.150> it<00:01:12.150> went<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:13.020> just<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.040> small

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
this was shown it went to a just a small

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.950 
this was shown it went to a just a small
very<00:01:15.450> like<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.990> second<00:01:16.470> video<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.659> image

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
very like to second video of the image

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.890 
very like to second video of the image
we<00:01:19.140> saw<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.710> poor<00:01:20.040> report<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.939> new<00:01:21.090> salute

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
we saw a poor report of the new salute

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.870 
we saw a poor report of the new salute
of<00:01:22.140> whatever<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.890> Pokemon<00:01:23.369> could<00:01:23.520> possibly

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
of whatever that Pokemon could possibly

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.929 
of whatever that Pokemon could possibly
be<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.330> obviously<00:01:25.229> whatever<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.070> if<00:01:26.700> it's

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
be so obviously whatever this is if it's

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.390 
be so obviously whatever this is if it's
somehow<00:01:27.840> another<00:01:28.380> board<00:01:28.650> with<00:01:28.770> letter<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.130> mean

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
somehow another board with letter I mean

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.690 
somehow another board with letter I mean
it<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.640> green<00:01:30.110> if<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.320> is

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
it is green if it is

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.639 
it is green if it is
another<00:01:32.149> form<00:01:32.600> of<00:01:32.719> his<00:01:32.869> ID<00:01:32.990> card<00:01:33.460> then<00:01:35.649> we'll

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
another form of his ID card then we'll

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:37.779 
another form of his ID card then we'll
just<00:01:36.799> have<00:01:36.920> to<00:01:36.979> see<00:01:37.039> what<00:01:37.189> happens<00:01:37.490> with<00:01:37.610> this

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
just have to see what happens with this

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:39.670 
just have to see what happens with this
it's<00:01:38.509> going<00:01:38.689> to<00:01:38.719> be<00:01:38.840> pretty<00:01:38.960> soon<00:01:39.409> see<00:01:39.619> how

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
it's going to be pretty soon see how

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.910 
it's going to be pretty soon see how
this<00:01:39.829> plays<00:01:39.979> out<00:01:40.219> but<00:01:41.210> who<00:01:41.840> knows<00:01:41.990> honestly<00:01:42.590> it

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
this plays out but who knows honestly it

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.529 
this plays out but who knows honestly it
could<00:01:43.219> be<00:01:43.369> another<00:01:43.460> former<00:01:43.909> zygarde<00:01:44.270> it<00:01:44.420> could

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
could be another former zygarde it could

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.899 
could be another former zygarde it could
be<00:01:44.659> something<00:01:44.899> like<00:01:45.049> maybe<00:01:45.740> or<00:01:46.310> maybe<00:01:46.579> it's

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909
