 in the street of the girls we have 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.629
 want to tell them you did the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.780
 bad choice the foundation is too much 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.879
 clear too dark gives an appearance 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.020
 greyish or greenish so what are 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.000
 the basic rules that's what we 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.129
 let's go see today so there is 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.500
 different categories 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.670
 foundation qualities it can be 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.649
 compact 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.020
 we have stick foundation that 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.879
 is as follows 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.650
 we also have foundations 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.979
 fluid it can be wait and see as 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.500
 we say that is to say to use dry or 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.720
 wet so we'll have to take in 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.710
 account different parameters 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.650
 the hue of skin on the one hand but 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.620
 also the way of life 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.480
 the season is what we are in summer is this 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.700
 that we are in a dry environment or 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.090
 wet so all these parameters are going 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:35.300
 intervene in order to make the right choice 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.030
 the right shade is detected at the level of 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.510
 the maxillary area so anais is going 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.060
 apply 3 thyme salt that will not be 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.400
 visible in relation to the cost will be the 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.680
 good cause 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.770
 we must also consider the 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.229
 composition of the foundation it arrives 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.520
 that some foundations that are not 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:00.950
 not formulated for dark skin has 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.140
 an interaction with the ph of the skin 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.140
 in particular and that some of 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.270
 migrant ingredients surface of such 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.470
 so cotton 0 where we made the makeup 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:15.050
 Thai perfect and as we go 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.930
 will see a mask effect appear or 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.370
 too red or gray that or greenish that 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.709
 comes from the fact that there is a 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.520
 decomposition of certain elements that 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.500
 migrate to the surface 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.890
 we saw the basic rules for 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:31.000
 to choose a foundation skin 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.739
 well prepared in advance well moisturize 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.500
 choosing the right formula that 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:40.220
 suitable for human kanem honey skins 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.730
 and the choice of hue neither too bright 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.010
 neither too dark that can be forgotten 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.040
 which simply gives a result 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.720
 perfectly natural and transparent for 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.739
 young women who are well in 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.739
 their skin and well in life
