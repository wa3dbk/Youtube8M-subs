were<00:00:36.780> going<00:00:36.900> to<00:00:36.960> be<00:00:37.020> talking<00:00:37.110> about<00:00:37.350> gameplay

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
were going to be talking about gameplay

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.010 
were going to be talking about gameplay
and<00:00:38.850> we<00:00:39.030> can't<00:00:39.239> talk<00:00:39.360> about<00:00:39.420> game<00:00:39.780> play

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
and we can't talk about game play

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.410 
and we can't talk about game play
without<00:00:40.280> sort<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.340> talking<00:00:41.520> about<00:00:41.670> tricks<00:00:42.059> and

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
without sort of talking about tricks and

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.540 
without sort of talking about tricks and
over-the-top<00:00:43.020> environments<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.040> controls

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
over-the-top environments and controls

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.760 
over-the-top environments and controls
and<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.480> key<00:00:45.720> components<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:46.199> level<00:00:46.470> designs

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
and the key components of level designs

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.350 
and the key components of level designs
so<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.220> video<00:00:47.520> we're<00:00:47.910> going<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.059> take<00:00:48.239> you

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
so in this video we're going to take you

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.760 
so in this video we're going to take you
through<00:00:48.390> each<00:00:48.720> one<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.960> those<00:00:49.110> aspects<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.680> the

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
through each one of those aspects of the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.740 
through each one of those aspects of the
game<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.129> try<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.910> give<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.150> a<00:00:51.239> little<00:00:51.300> bit<00:00:51.629> of

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
game and try to give you a little bit of

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.090 
game and try to give you a little bit of
understanding<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:52.650> how<00:00:52.680> we're<00:00:52.890> doing<00:00:52.980> things

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
understanding on how we're doing things

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.460 
understanding on how we're doing things
we<00:00:53.760> wanted<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.059> take<00:00:54.330> sort<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.900> all<00:00:55.080> of<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.290> old

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
we wanted to take sort of all of the old

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.009 
we wanted to take sort of all of the old
SSX<00:00:56.100> levels<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.699> rather<00:00:57.360> than<00:00:57.510> have<00:00:57.780> anything

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
SSX levels and rather than have anything

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.290 
SSX levels and rather than have anything
defense<00:00:58.559> tour<00:00:58.830> gated<00:00:59.280> or<00:00:59.430> block<00:00:59.760> we<00:01:00.000> wanted<00:01:00.269> to

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
defense tour gated or block we wanted to

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.880 
defense tour gated or block we wanted to
basically<00:01:00.510> turn<00:01:00.870> every<00:01:01.260> square<00:01:01.530> inch<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
basically turn every square inch of the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.470 
basically turn every square inch of the
level<00:01:02.160> into<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> sort<00:01:02.790> of<00:01:02.850> three<00:01:03.030> dimensional

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
level into a sort of three dimensional

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.299 
level into a sort of three dimensional
physics<00:01:03.660> playground<00:01:04.290> it's<00:01:04.649> all<00:01:04.800> really<00:01:05.040> part

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
physics playground it's all really part

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.999 
physics playground it's all really part
of<00:01:05.369> making<00:01:05.759> awesome<00:01:05.940> easy<00:01:06.710> you<00:01:07.710> look<00:01:07.830> so

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
of making awesome easy you look so

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.630 
of making awesome easy you look so
natural<00:01:08.220> there<00:01:10.160> Dave<00:01:11.160> what<00:01:11.250> are<00:01:11.369> we<00:01:11.430> looking

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
natural there Dave what are we looking

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.100 
natural there Dave what are we looking
at<00:01:11.729> in<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:11.880> clip<00:01:12.180> here<00:01:12.420> alright<00:01:12.690> so<00:01:12.810> here<00:01:12.960> we

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
at in this clip here alright so here we

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.779 
at in this clip here alright so here we
see<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.259> case<00:01:13.440> where<00:01:13.710> I'm<00:01:14.040> coming<00:01:14.399> off<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.759> the

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:14.789 
see a case where I'm coming off the the

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:16.670 
see a case where I'm coming off the the
mountain<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.630> I've<00:01:15.750> got<00:01:15.930> some<00:01:16.140> angular

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
mountain and I've got some angular

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.670 
mountain and I've got some angular
momentum<00:01:17.640> when<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.789> come<00:01:17.970> off<00:01:18.149> and<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:19.200> I'm

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
momentum when I come off and so I'm

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.529 
momentum when I come off and so I'm
getting<00:01:20.190> a<00:01:20.399> situation<00:01:21.240> where<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.360> want<00:01:21.509> to

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
getting a situation where I want to

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:22.940 
getting a situation where I want to
preserve<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.050> angular<00:01:22.320> momentum<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.800> have<00:01:22.920> a

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
preserve the angular momentum and have a

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.969 
preserve the angular momentum and have a
role<00:01:23.310> as<00:01:23.759> he<00:01:23.880> comes<00:01:24.060> off<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:25.229> i<00:01:25.259> guess<00:01:25.440> rolling

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
role as he comes off so i guess rolling

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.800 
role as he comes off so i guess rolling
and<00:01:26.250> then<00:01:26.550> we<00:01:27.149> want<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.390> make<00:01:27.479> sure<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.750> i

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
and then we want to make sure that i

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.719 
and then we want to make sure that i
could<00:01:27.930> get<00:01:27.990> my<00:01:28.080> grab<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.740> make<00:01:29.460> sure<00:01:29.580> that<00:01:29.700> i

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
could get my grab and make sure that i

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.609 
could get my grab and make sure that i
can<00:01:29.759> land<00:01:30.119> nice<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.840> easy<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.259> stick<00:01:31.500> my

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
can land nice and easy and stick my

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.560 
can land nice and easy and stick my
landing<00:01:31.950> nice<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.280> tight<00:01:32.430> there<00:01:32.729> yeah<00:01:33.270> that's

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
landing nice and tight there yeah that's

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.340 
landing nice and tight there yeah that's
awesome<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.049> easy<00:01:35.869> so<00:01:36.869> one<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.140> things<00:01:37.170> we

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
awesome and easy so one of the things we

per se fuentes personally is working on
some<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.270> tricks<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.540> go<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.780> game<00:01:45.900> why

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
some of the tricks to go in the game why

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.760 
some of the tricks to go in the game why
don't<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.229> show<00:01:46.380> us<00:01:46.470> what<00:01:46.619> you're<00:01:46.710> doing
