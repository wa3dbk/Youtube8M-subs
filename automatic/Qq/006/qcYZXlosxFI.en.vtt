 Hi Yamada It is Yamada rental Yamada 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:19.080
 Today I would like to share the importance of air filters 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.590
 If you are working in this way, remove the hair filter in the field etc. 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.010
 But 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:29.140
 This usage would be a good sprout quit immediately 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:34.629
 Why? When Yogi piston of you can see, it is the expulsion of the foreigners movement 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:39.940
 A piston ring is woven into the head of the piston and the tension of the ring 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:45.610
 In the gap between the piston know the wall of Winder Fusae Masu Tei thereby 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:48.650
 It can be compressed by the rise of the piston . If the engine is not compressed, it will 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:52.820
 Even if it does not explode 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:56.540
 What if the air that does not pass the filter enters there? 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:01:00.140
 If sand gets in and damages the wall of the ring and cylinder 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.480
 Air will be lost when the piston rises 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.600
 You will not be able to compress enough 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.930
 It means that the result engine does not start 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.580
 This can not be cured without disassembling Endy 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.780
 Replacement parts are not cheap either 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.770
 Considerably higher Tsukimasu 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:23.620
 Depending on the species you may cheap is better to buy the 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:28.170
 Some people may think that the air filter is so important, but it is so 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:34.340
 I 'll regret later if someone thinks it is an air filter 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:39.770
 Fair filter parts themselves are quite cheap compared to the overhaul area 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:45.319
 If you use a clean thing firmly, the life of the machine will be considerably extended 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.880
 By doing distance maintenance , it will help the person who also uses the opportunity firmly 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:50.929
 I think that 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:54.330
