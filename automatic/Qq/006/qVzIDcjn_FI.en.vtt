00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:41.819

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.760

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:19.380
 art is not so much the better man 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:21.450

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.770

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.020
 and the event already has one 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.250

 dj legend is true but it is one 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.490
 legend that such a DJ should be 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:52.730
 Jim Button is the real name 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.650

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.480
 Interested taken for granted 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.070

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.260
 on the way as I have already noticed 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.890
 as a paparazzi because you've already got me off 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:11.930

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:16.370
 but why are you driving why? 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:19.910
 here in the atlantic hotel one tells me 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.560
 better way of not knowing it 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.170
 that his present 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.300
 who feels naturally has asked 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:29.570
 also sell vacuum cleaners 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.520
 vorwerk not good but now only once 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:35.120
 who decided that you are here? 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:39.230
 go andrÃ© had my best friend 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.910
 his bill is my mistress ok and 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.590
 unfortunately, they broke up, oh you 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.790
 shame 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:48.770
 But moment that he was already two years ago 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:52.850
 believe and still afterwards the 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:55.570
 Woman but now without shit interested 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.570
 small right now 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.350
 I 'm just wondering why you shoot 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.380
 in hallways why not dancefloor or 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.330
 with the drinks 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.400
 because you asked me to come here 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.820
 to come here with me an interview too 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.240
 to lead 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.980
 I found you lucky here 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.760

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.760
