00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.670
 Today I 'm going to show you how to make a 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:10.690
 worm farm or a worm was 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.040
 this is part of the effort that we are 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.710
 doing many people around the 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.869
 world to raise awareness and to 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.570
 teach many how to better use 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.369
 resources that are practically founded 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.320
 by nature before starting to 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.300
 spend our money on things that we have 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.439
 artificially made then that the 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.660
 let's do let's make a great 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.210
 remove to give men who will live 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.920
 in these containers now this is 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.600
 container these containers are three 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.230
 of the same size you can use 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.809
 any of them any kind of 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.239
 vessels then just as 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.160
 rectangular on the bottom I'm going to 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:49.780
 use a key and the reason is that 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.969
 when we receive it here from the 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.410
 kitchen or what we are doing 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:55.780
 I get appointments that are going to split the second 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.329
 compartment so they will go up they go to 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.629
 eat 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.339
 and they're going to start to get rid of it for 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.379
 begin to decompose everything that is 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.600
 here now this work is done by 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.180
 bacteria the microbes and they do 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.040
 earthworms the result is a liquid that 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.070
 it is very high in a nutritional content 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.030
 for plants it's called a compound or 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.680
 a compost tea and then I'll show you 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.420
 another video how can you enrich it further 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.000
 these pairs as steroids for 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.009
 plants then let's make it a 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.570
 series of holes to our 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.610
 containers 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.930
 and we are going to install this key if it is in 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.040
 the bottom part to be able to drain ok 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.900
 the container that is in the part 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.640
 top what we're going to do in this is 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.500
 than with a three-eighth-bit or 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.630
 half tried we're going to do some 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.360
 perforations to this place the intention 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.530
 is where the worms live from 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.720
 come up and eat because this is going to be 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.890
 perfectly 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.300
 above where I live they go to 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.590
 going up to eat these bones are going to 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.500
 return again where they live 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.910
 naturally this cycle that they have 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.350
 then they have then we are going to 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.480
 do a perforation I'm starting 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.740
 of our formations here do not do 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.840
 well, too many not to damage the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.899
 integrity of the container and so 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.820
 we continue with this is the first phase 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:17.550
 it goes already we have container note here that 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.860
 that unfortunately the very big witch 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.190
 I was like trying to break then 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.390
 run and use one of three eighths 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.860
 they are going to clean a little bit of I have a 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.080
 knife was cleaning a little bit the 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.450
 holes to make it look good and this is 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.650
 the first phase then what are we going to 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.900
 do in the second one is that we're going to do 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.600
 some holes a little more smaller 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.260
 to occur in the water inside the 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.360
 ok container 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.060
 it looks like our second container 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.569
 denies the middle we're going to make him a 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.510
 hole with a drill of 1 and we tell you 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.860
 stopped inches we're going to do what's 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.720
 the lowest part that is this so that 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.970
 when the water starts to drain 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.670
 face in the first container that is the 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:02.200
 president who will have the key appointment 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:05.670
 to be able to take out and drain the container 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.670
 so we do not drown the worms 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:12.640
 says a good amount of perforations 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:14.260
 to this container for smaller ones this 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:19.920
 is going to be the means you can 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.920
 add more big holes for me 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.870
 little head using you are looking for some 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.030
 in packets that suit you 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.290
 depending on the size 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:35.590
 and they're also going to find a bit that 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.780
 I pointed out that the folder is pointed to 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.710
 size of its thread ok but i will do 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.710
 a little hole on a side 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:50.230
 for the last container that is the one 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.240
 has the key I put in several packages 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.580
 He cited if he says he was caught with a small tube 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.200
 PVC on the inside you 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.550
 political position of silicone now 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.550
 these accounts that you see here these 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.470
 plastics of 10 and 2 holes has 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.569
 has has a surface as well as 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.299
 half bumpy so that he 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.400
 in the case that men fall 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.260
 here where is the water this liquid 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.790
 because he is chosen is very precious to 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.079
 the plants do not throw it out afterwards 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.180
 I will show how it is used but 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:19.150
 simply hitting on the plants is 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.799
 very nutritious and nutritious now then 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.270
 this this container the second 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.250
 container to download here engineers 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.310
 this care has also been really taken care of 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.410
 sure that the bits of bottles 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.810
 well that the young woman well here 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.320
 here are going to put the worms the 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.840
 worms put the leaves or can 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.190
 be a piece of newsprint and a 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.470
 little bit of land where they take to live 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.180
 where will they get the worms 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.990
 they pick up a little cardboard puts it in a place 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.580
 shoulder a little hiding in the 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.990
 garden of the dican a little water 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.490
 and huston and they already like to be around 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.320
 below that among the good ones they bring 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.889
 They can buy somewhere where 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:05:00.190
 they sell bait to fish or where 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:01.720
 they sell where they say yes to the last and 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.060
 Well, you can put more of these 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.620
 enzymes being ending here that have 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.740
 the other biggest holes here is 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.150
 where the things that go to the 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.139
 rubbish and we go to the kitchen the 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.379
 waste 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:16.030
 they're going to go in here and they're going to 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:17.770
 upload this insurance that is like 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.289
 mattress adif or on the earth that is in 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.789
 the bottom in the other material 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:23.710
 so they go up eat they come back down 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:25.930
 there and all that liquid is staying 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.279
 until then this is going to go up and 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.340
 is going to go up and going to go up 

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:32.229
 until until I have the moment that 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.819
 is going to select a bit the earth what 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:36.159
 use in a place obviously the earth 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:39.279
 is very fertile and puts more things back 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:41.169
 in this the last stage is here and 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:43.389
 this keeps it in matter in this 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:44.949
 east west container 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:47.590
 this worm factory let's say it like this 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:49.330
 in a dark place in a place where 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.669
 you're stuck a lot this second the one 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.039
 keep moistened and they will have a 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.180
 very good factory of nutrients for your 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:57.250
 gardens ok 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:00.779
 thank you very much and I hope to see you in the 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.779
 next video that are very well
