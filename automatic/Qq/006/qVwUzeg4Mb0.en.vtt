 the extraordinary referendum campaign is underway and is the first time in the 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.400
 history of the Italian republic that the committee promoting questions 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.039
 referendaries and a promoter committee only you discussed active citizenship times 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.330
 basically the cdc contacts 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.620
 the associations 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.069
 and all those 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:24.630
 and all those movements 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.359
 because so many will work for public water to prevent 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.360
 the looting 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.660
 of the common good par excellence star 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.750
 the first time you are together 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.650
 and presented 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.810
 three referendum questions 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.830
 within which political parties practically some political parties 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.970
 support 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.220
 referendum questions but the first great harmony is not an active part of the limit 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.430
 our country 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.640
 of implementation of the application 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.900
 the principles of democracy 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.130
 of participation 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.530
 referendum questions have reached almost for the moment 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.150
 600,000 films 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.400
 in the film and requests 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.350
 the constitution is 500 miles 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.540
 - been only a month pools next month the objective of course 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.940
 that of reaching the best 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.610
 a goal that 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.650
 the climate is easily added to this fixed point 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.090
 euphoric participation that exists 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.270
 come back this 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.080
 referendum campaign 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.340
 referendum questions are 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.590
 was the first 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.090
 requirement to repeal article 23 bis 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.080
 of the law and the so-called ronchi decree 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.470
 and it is an article 15 thousand wipe out 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.350
 that model 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.170
 of forced privatization 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.500
 mostly. by the ronchi decree 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.570
 where the competition the race in private become are 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.310
 principle on all 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.650
 and where therefore all essential public services 3 such as water 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.650
 must be compulsory courses 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:15.599
 now all this is not in contrast with the constitution 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.409
 they are in contrast with the constitutional principles they assign 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.249
 to public institutions 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:26.849
 to the state to the regions and local authorities a fundamental role for what 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.649
 regards the management of essential public services, interest services 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:31.569
 general 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:32.909
 for painting 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.749
 Article 23bis teen compass 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:36.729
 with me 

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:37.949
 all 

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:40.459
 that community discipline 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.519
 that trilly because also for services general economic interest 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.749
 even more directly pt the website of the websites 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:52.019
 books social dimension 24 hours 

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:56.049
 the aspects related to all perfect social rights 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:01.990
 to prevent the negative aspects of the last minute environment claim 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.730
 lice a whole social dimension in the tested Community law 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.189
 absolutely no abrogation is abrogated 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:11.939
 now all this 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:16.389
 ok strongly both wheel and hypocrite because why lol 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:21.579
 only you can meet your position with Community law Article 23 bis 7 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.229
 use 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:26.320
 Community law to say openly 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.419
 that these choices are imposed 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:31.260
 from Community law nothing more false 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.840
 and he is also a coward 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.729
 kijiji 

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:38.589
 App assumed these choices hand of pure courage to take them up in 

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:41.589
 flight liability fund 

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:45.869
 a referendum 

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:51.259
 only on the pavement twenty triple lords of the creditors vicenza of those models 

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:54.509
 privatistic than in our system 

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:57.329
 I'm happy with parts of the Gallic law 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:02.779
 then of the 94 to then be implemented now unified text of 2002 yes 

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:07.289
 hear in particular article 103 as well as all corsets 13 

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:12.509
 as then changed by the world so called berlusconi buttiglione 

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:13.380
 that is what 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.940
 that model 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.340
 which has already introduced about 15 years 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.180
 forcibly the public services privatization system 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.479
 essential 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.789
 and then we had to hit so many 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:34.430
 this normative source must be inserted the - referendum questions to cup 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.199
 referendum that they had said abrogation 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:41.219
 of Article 100 13 of the Consolidated Law on Local Authorities 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.199
 just because 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.099
 it was a regulatory context 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:48.979
 provided 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:50.349
 models 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:55.080
 rt obviously management of local public eagle services 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.150
 which is a model entirely based on the 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.240
 public private partnership 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.939
 another model based on direct assignment 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:07.919
 as like accepted reaction 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:09.639
 to public capital 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:12.490
 all three models albeit with some distinctions 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:18.330
 profit-oriented orienting oneself to the market orient yourself to finish the water 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.749
 a me there and therefore and as such 

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:24.669
 placed on the market an absolutely commercial logic 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:28.199
 that since it was introduced our country had determined 

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:33.330
 an increase in tariffs to make 60% 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.460
 had brought about a reduction 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.879
 of investments 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:39.820
 40% part 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.219
 photo compared to the investments of the previous decade when management 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:47.229
 opinions of the transversal economy of companies 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:49.800
 er municipalized 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.720
 umbra also a privatization of the last 15 years 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.580
 Vibrational use of contrast water resources all principle 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.670
 see international organizations regarding the rational use of the 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:04.979
 water resources 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:08.579
 and worsening also from the qualitative point of view 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:11.919
 the speeches of cats at the court 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:13.710
 ocupazione 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.789
 now then you were watching 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:17.770
 that infomotori 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.800
 of privatizations I thought of you 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.650
 were it obtained I took privatization of reality I am not there 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:25.419
 they are required 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:27.520
 no flaws were kept 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.669
 opposite to 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:30.710
 places are kept in the chest 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.999
 therefore it has been set aside 

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:39.809
 of pirates the attempt to re-enter the investment cost only by increasing 

00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:42.330
 . tango guide fees 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.599
 of citizens 

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:48.929
 oppose some cases as if by chance of aprilia causing the manager to 

00:06:48.929 --> 00:06:51.319
 to move on 

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:52.800
 asked 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.960
 particular abante loans 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.389

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:05.069

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:08.069

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:12.149

00:07:12.149 --> 00:07:17.110
 and sheeran instead here is a stuttering, fine loan

 real manager the real subject who decides the choices the most oxygenating gates 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.550
 just reiterate the prophet 

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.870
 therefore a situation already devastated 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:31.260
 that article 23 bis is increased and therefore we ask the second question 

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.809
 referendum 

00:07:32.809 --> 00:07:35.809
 also the repeal 

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:40.189

00:07:40.749 --> 00:07:42.159

 you can queue differentiated at all
