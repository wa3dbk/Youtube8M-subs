00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
okay in this clip we're taking a peek at

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.859 
okay in this clip we're taking a peek at
a<00:00:22.960> cushion<00:00:23.529> on<00:00:23.710> the<00:00:23.739> left<00:00:24.160> and<00:00:24.429> a<00:00:25.269> radiant<00:00:25.779> on

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
a cushion on the left and a radiant on

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:27.960 
a cushion on the left and a radiant on
the<00:00:26.019> right<00:00:26.199> the<00:00:26.949> cushion<00:00:27.369> on<00:00:27.460> the<00:00:27.489> left<00:00:27.759> is<00:00:27.939> a

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
the right the cushion on the left is a

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.689 
the right the cushion on the left is a
249<00:00:28.899> H<00:00:29.619> comma<00:00:30.070> si<00:00:30.609> 1<00:00:30.910> and<00:00:31.379> the<00:00:32.379> radiant<00:00:32.860> is<00:00:32.980> also

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:33.699 
249 H comma si 1 and the radiant is also

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.700 
249 H comma si 1 and the radiant is also
an<00:00:33.910> HSI<00:00:34.870> 1<00:00:35.140> except<00:00:35.620> that's<00:00:35.710> a<00:00:35.890> 253<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:38.620> 2

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
an HSI 1 except that's a 253 so 2

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.590 
an HSI 1 except that's a 253 so 2
diamonds<00:00:39.460> that<00:00:39.610> are<00:00:39.670> come<00:00:39.970> pretty<00:00:40.269> comparable

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
diamonds that are come pretty comparable

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.090 
diamonds that are come pretty comparable
in<00:00:40.899> the<00:00:41.019> weight<00:00:41.699> get<00:00:42.699> different<00:00:43.030> shapes<00:00:44.100> and

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
in the weight get different shapes and

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.439 
in the weight get different shapes and
we're<00:00:45.370> looking<00:00:45.640> at<00:00:45.760> the<00:00:45.850> brightness<00:00:46.269> and

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
we're looking at the brightness and

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:49.410 
we're looking at the brightness and
contrast<00:00:46.659> patterning<00:00:47.589> between<00:00:48.579> these<00:00:49.149> two

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
contrast patterning between these two

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.649 
contrast patterning between these two
diamonds<00:00:53.339> in<00:00:54.339> various<00:00:54.820> angles<00:00:55.239> now<00:00:55.420> I'm<00:00:55.540> going

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:55.659 
diamonds in various angles now I'm going

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:57.689 
diamonds in various angles now I'm going
to<00:00:55.750> take<00:00:55.839> a<00:00:55.869> look<00:00:56.080> at<00:00:56.170> Sparkle<00:00:57.040> scintillation

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
to take a look at Sparkle scintillation

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:04.890 
to take a look at Sparkle scintillation
between<00:00:58.119> these<00:00:58.390> two<00:01:02.759> and<00:01:03.759> this<00:01:04.000> is<00:01:04.180> this<00:01:04.629> is

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
between these two and this is this is

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.859 
between these two and this is this is
okay<00:01:05.680> is<00:01:06.220> all<00:01:06.460> Sparkle<00:01:07.060> differences<00:01:07.659> between

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
okay is all Sparkle differences between

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:36.700 
okay is all Sparkle differences between
these<00:01:08.229> two<00:01:08.350> diamonds

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.270 

I<00:01:36.770> don't<00:01:37.460> think

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
I don't think

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.770 
I don't think
okay

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
okay

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.609 
okay
like<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:42.990> sparkle<00:01:43.560> scintillation<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:45.619> now

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
like so sparkle scintillation and now

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.350 
like so sparkle scintillation and now
we're<00:01:46.710> going<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.890> look<00:01:46.979> at<00:01:47.159> fire<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.549> stronger

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
we're going to look at fire and stronger

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:57.280 
we're going to look at fire and stronger
spotlight

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.390 

that's<00:01:57.770> from<00:01:57.980> our<00:01:58.070> tilt<00:01:58.400> angles<00:01:59.740> and<00:02:00.740> as<00:02:01.190> we

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
that's from our tilt angles and as we

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.250 
that's from our tilt angles and as we
rocked<00:02:01.730> up<00:02:01.940> into<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.360> faces<00:02:02.600> of<00:02:02.930> each<00:02:03.050> of

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
rocked up into the faces of each of

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.650 
rocked up into the faces of each of
these<00:02:06.400> different<00:02:07.400> looks<00:02:07.550> between<00:02:08.300> these<00:02:08.480> two

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
these different looks between these two

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.740 
these different looks between these two
diamonds<00:02:09.460> -<00:02:10.460> notably<00:02:10.940> different<00:02:11.390> looks

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
diamonds - notably different looks

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.880 
diamonds - notably different looks
between<00:02:12.230> those<00:02:12.380> two<00:02:12.590> diamonds<00:02:13.930> okay<00:02:14.930> each<00:02:15.860> one

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
between those two diamonds okay each one

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.010 
between those two diamonds okay each one
though<00:02:16.220> has<00:02:16.430> characteristics<00:02:17.300> that<00:02:17.390> may<00:02:17.660> draw

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
though has characteristics that may draw

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:33.350 
though has characteristics that may draw
you<00:02:18.080> towards<00:02:18.650> it<00:02:18.770> or<00:02:19.070> not

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360
