00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:08.040
 hello friends with you evgeny and today 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.560
 we will flash on nexus 5 in this version 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.930
 flyme firmware from meizu 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.840
 has flowed a warm procedure associated with 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.420
 firmware we need to save on 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.090
 our device several files is a file 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.280
 in fact, the firmware itself fly 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.090
 Further if you need google application 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.560
 and gaps 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.300
 and if you need root then file root 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.879
 addition to this can also be installed 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.249
 I will attach all the files in the description to this 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.350
 video to continue us 

00:00:35.249 --> 00:00:38.370
 you need to restart our device but 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.159
 and turn on the power 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.929
 we have to go into river mode and 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:45.569
 Naturally recovery should be 

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:46.920
 installed in advance how to do it 

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:49.949
 can look at my previous 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.690
 video and so we load the phone into mode 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.179
 Recovery for this we press the button 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.319
 volume down and the power button and 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:01:01.079
 hold for a few seconds grape 

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:04.339
 is android open belly buttons 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.899
 volume scrolling not only down 1 2 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.329
 you probably will experience the river and 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:12.110
 agree agree these orders 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:14.850
 by pressing the power button 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.960
 We wait until the phone reboots and it 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.210
 went to wrp recovery notice me 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.390
 especially recovery twrp 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.789
 this recovery multirom is not playing 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.920
 no role in which action we will 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:30.090
 perform exactly the same as 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.520
 usual 3w 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.920
 so don't worry first thing i 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.020
 highly recommend making equal 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.780
 as in the rest of the video that shot 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.729
 About firmware to make a backup that is 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.520
 click on backup and save the current one 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.320
 system so that if something is not 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.109
 go wrong you could easily 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.259
 I personally would have recovered as I did 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:53.100
 in advance therefore just continue to 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.950
 next step 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.749
 So we go into the absurdity and in order 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.270
 to delete all current data 

00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:01.049
 firmware select all but the option 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.359
 internal storage 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.090
 as if we choose internal storage 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:08.580
 all your data on your smartphone including that 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.229
 the firmware of which we saved include 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.490
 backup all everything is erased 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.400
 therefore it is not 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:22.080
 I note and confirm it all with you and 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:24.300
 waiting for all the wipe did all the data from the valley 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.750
 Napa smartphone is not currently 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.330
 no firmware go to the main menu 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.340
 click on the install option as I have already 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.050
 noted both must be saved these 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.710
 files 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.450
 The first thing is that I choose the flare option 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:42.810
 I press Mr. Murzik 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.060
 and note I do not expose the gaps as 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.220
 in this case directly in the case of 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.250
 this gapps firmware i will have to 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.110
 flash then I'll show it to you and go for 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.840
 that choosing this parliament and 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.360
 confirm everything but finish 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.400
 set what I noted 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.040
 we need to reboot into the system 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.650
 in order to get a quick activation 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:10.460
 and so the meizu system starts to rise 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.460
 this is already a good sign we are just waiting and 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.150
 so flyme loaded the first thing that we 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.560
 offer to choose this language to choose from 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.940
 there is quite limited here 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:27.110
 the number of languages ​​is very strange but there is 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.460
 equipment we choose an option 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:33.690
 skip so after we have passed 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:35.850
 in the initial setup of the system personally this 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.680
 moment we can install the application 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.070
 from google what we do we are again 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.440
 reboot 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:46.970
 turn on the power we hold down two buttons 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.599
 order to boot into this very 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:58.310
 recaro 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:04:00.590
 we confirm and only now without doing 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.310
 wipe any personal push button 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.060
 install 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.100
 select the gaps and agree to their 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.060
 I note the firmware I use 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.590
 The version of gapps from paranoid android is 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.100
 micro version is like it does not contain 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.229
 no extra to dogs that i 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.479
 most cases do not need general they 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:23.620
 you can reboot and reboot 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:26.030
 the idea is that we will have a market already established and 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:30.229
 standard core applications from 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.600
 google and then she asks what 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:37.220
 launcher we prefer not i need to mid 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.639
 I will choose a locker from the firmware they went to here and 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.330
 all the market in place rub in place 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:44.060
 firmware installed 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.950
 then can only use here 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.900
 in such a simple way, we asked flyme 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.919
 here is meizu 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.410
 Subscribe comments what you think 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:54.110
 On this occasion, put likes on likes 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:57.430
 for today on it all until all 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.430
 new meetings
