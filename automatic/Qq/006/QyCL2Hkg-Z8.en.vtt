00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.880
 stefani beach 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.790
 the most beautiful beach of all 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.840
 update a little moschino and the 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.740
 beauty of a 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.060
 some are perceived above all 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:46.150
 from above I wonder why they are there 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:49.989
 the stones and honestly it hurts a 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.430
 healthy but the pe of I sit the beauty 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.830
 of this thing is perceived above all 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.590
 from the loop after established sets face 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:01:00.610
 in the recovery b chatter of another 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:03.820
 book that I almost finished but I already know that 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:09.180
 it is hardly possible to read the novel 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:11.710
 criminal of giancarlo de cataldo forces 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.320
 others we have already seen the film 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.930
 who followed the series also has me 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.750
 also spoke very well of the series on 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.220
 place pat iannone that the waves did 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.950
 too much noise so they talked to me 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.790
 the book is also very good in the series 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.580
 spectacular 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:34.930
 then context rome italy rome end 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:38.770
 70s there are red brigades there are 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:41.560
 the communists there are neo-fascists there is the 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:46.590
 massacre of bologna the kidnapping of moro 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:53.310
 this is a bit the socio-political framework 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:55.840
 in Rome a handful of criminals say 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.630
 decides to get together under the 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.940
 guide we say of he who does himself 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.770
 call the Lebanese decide to 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.280
 get together because they realize 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.830
 that an organized crime group 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.280
 surely can get more respect 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.380
 to many small groups of criminals 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.840
 loose of loose dogs so yes 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.280
 put together get together 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.230
 begin a 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.440
 conquer Rome at the end no 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:29.610
 through seizures control of the 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.780
 drug dealing various brothels 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.159
 illegal gambling dens activities 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.379
 we say that they impose themselves over the 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.970
 crime that was handled by several 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:43.230
 small groups that put from that of 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:46.560
 Neapolitans from Marseilles and yes 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.900
 impose them I like a casino me 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.909
 like a casino for two reasons 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.940
 first of all because it is absolutely 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:56.269
 based on a true story that is that 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.129
 of the Magliana band 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.480
 if you go on the internet and document yourself 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.430
 a minimum on the mesh band 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.200
 magliana you realize first of all 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.450
 that the band of the Magliana band 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.959
 It was structured to absolutely 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.400
 same way with the chiefs and sub-bosses ad 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.049
 example the dealers are there 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.900
 horses that are the ones that control 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.519
 the various areas and then the ants 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.109
 which are the real e 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.859
 the magliana band was structured 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:24.630
 effectively so the technical seizure 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:27.110
 at the beginning of the book they did it 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.420
 really them too 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.520
 and therefore it is very real and very real 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.740
 as a story we say that the 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.770
 fictionalized version of what 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.500
 actually the story behind the gang 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.280
 of the Magliana that crosses 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.160
 very much also with the events 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.680
 politics of Italy in the 70s 80 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.190
 so also interesting in that 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.530
 meaning is written very well I like it 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.140
 very fast they are otherwise not me 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.450
 I would be talking about it and I recommend it 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.510
 absolutely reading this book 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.640
 in the meantime I greet you can be 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.440
 probably the last blogghino because 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.280
 I'm almost leaving 15 resents from 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.180
 turin 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.180
