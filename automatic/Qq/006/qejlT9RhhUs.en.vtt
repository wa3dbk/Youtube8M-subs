00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
snow when everything it's beautiful

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.760 
snow when everything it's beautiful
really<00:00:24.260> it's<00:00:24.680> beautiful<00:00:25.030> but<00:00:26.030> I<00:00:26.150> don't<00:00:26.330> like

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
really when it's so cold and I certainly

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.420 
really when it's so cold and I certainly
don't<00:00:31.160> like<00:00:31.640> being<00:00:32.210> out<00:00:32.480> in<00:00:32.719> traffic<00:00:33.050> in<00:00:34.010> this

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
don't like being out in traffic in this

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.889 
don't like being out in traffic in this
kind<00:00:34.850> of<00:00:34.940> weather<00:00:35.530> because<00:00:36.530> it's<00:00:36.739> dangerous

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 
kind of weather because it's dangerous

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:43.990 
kind of weather because it's dangerous
so<00:00:40.630> when<00:00:41.630> the<00:00:41.750> snow<00:00:42.340> didn't<00:00:43.340> come<00:00:43.640> for

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
so when the snow didn't come for

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.990 
so when the snow didn't come for
christmas<00:00:44.480> or<00:00:45.010> new<00:00:46.010> years<00:00:48.520> or<00:00:49.520> even<00:00:49.579> my

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
christmas or new years or even my

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.170 
christmas or new years or even my
birthday<00:00:50.059> I<00:00:51.010> think<00:00:53.800> it<00:00:54.800> didn't<00:00:55.460> have<00:00:55.700> to<00:00:55.940> come

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
birthday I think it didn't have to come

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.600 
birthday I think it didn't have to come
really<00:00:56.450> because<00:00:57.350> it's<00:00:57.559> already<00:00:57.920> spring<00:00:58.309> here

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
really because it's already spring here

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.650 
really because it's already spring here
I<00:00:58.960> mean<00:00:59.960> the<00:01:00.140> plants<00:01:00.890> and<00:01:01.160> bushes<00:01:01.790> and<00:01:02.390> trees

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
I mean the plants and bushes and trees

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.109 
I mean the plants and bushes and trees
and<00:01:02.809> everything<00:01:03.680> it<00:01:05.020> has<00:01:06.020> really<00:01:06.619> thought<00:01:07.119> if

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
and everything it has really thought if

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.469 
and everything it has really thought if
a<00:01:08.299> plant<00:01:08.570> can<00:01:08.840> think<00:01:09.110> which<00:01:09.799> I<00:01:10.070> think<00:01:11.000> it<00:01:11.240> can

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
a plant can think which I think it can

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.859 
a plant can think which I think it can
