a punch instead of a plyo not using your

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
too wide landing too compressed so you

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.240 
too wide landing too compressed so you
can't<00:01:40.880> explode<00:01:41.479> into<00:01:41.720> the<00:01:41.930> movement<00:01:42.250> blending

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
can't explode into the movement blending

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:58.340 
can't explode into the movement blending
flat-footed<00:01:43.729> and<00:01:44.000> not<00:01:44.150> rocking<00:01:44.690> forward

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.920 

thanks<00:01:59.220> so<00:01:59.340> much<00:01:59.369> for<00:01:59.520> watching<00:01:59.760> a<00:02:00.180> plyo<00:02:00.689> has

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
thanks so much for watching a plyo has

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.380 
thanks so much for watching a plyo has
more<00:02:01.170> control<00:02:01.590> on<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.890> take-off<00:02:02.250> but<00:02:03.030> it's

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
more control on the take-off but it's

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.289 
more control on the take-off but it's
slower<00:02:03.840> than<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.320> stride<00:02:04.650> strides<00:02:05.280> faster<00:02:05.820> thus

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
slower than a stride strides faster thus

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.469 
slower than a stride strides faster thus
giving<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.780> more<00:02:06.960> distance<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:08.300> switch<00:02:09.300> them

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
giving you more distance so switch them

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.960 
giving you more distance so switch them
up<00:02:09.600> have<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.530> got<00:02:10.709> one<00:02:10.950> easy<00:02:11.130> do<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.580> next<00:02:11.760> one

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
up have you got one easy do the next one

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.890 
up have you got one easy do the next one
work<00:02:12.630> between<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.170> two<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:14.660> see<00:02:15.660> you<00:02:15.750> on<00:02:15.870> the

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
work between the two and see you on the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.319 
work between the two and see you on the
next<00:02:16.140> one
