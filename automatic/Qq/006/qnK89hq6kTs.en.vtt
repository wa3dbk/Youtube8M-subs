00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.030
 hello very good morning we meet 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:41.120
 the patient nobody 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:45.530
 which is doing a treatment 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.530
 specifically directly to 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.400
 a facial paralysis that is 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.700
 presenting this is secondary 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.750
 second consultation and we are working 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.910
 precisely in the sugar part 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.350
 facial paralysis and also working in 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.940
 nerves 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.520
 as you can see here is 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.140
 in the together that I am trying we are 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.300
 marking today 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:18.479
 also the importance of this therapy 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:20.850
 from neural therapy we do it before 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.670
 what later we continue with the 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.070
 acupuncture then it's a trip 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.100
 totally integral 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.470
 are two bars that work in the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.400
 neurovegetative system and has a 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.950
 relationship directly by starting 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.520
 then confronting it we have it up 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.810
 holy time we are already more 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.360
 personalities that remove the acute 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.920
 and later I can talk with 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.220
 nobody what are the results that has 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.190
 had in these two in these two 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.780
 sessions for this type of treatments 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.110
 to regulate mind as I mentioned it in 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.800
 the first session are about a 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.720
 ten actions for us to start seeing 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.409
 almost without continuous wave we can give of 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.770
 high 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.780
 all depending on how the reaction that 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.560
 called in general that has to do a lot 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.920
 with the metabolism of each person there 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.440
 of people in five therapies the 303 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.099
 sees a quite abrupt change in this 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.390
 case to this talent but I think that it 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.269
 has felt quite new area that 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.220
 talk to her and we hope that those 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:32.340
 same shares of 10 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.680
 well then let's work the 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.660
 emotional and physical psychological part of 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.930
 the three units located 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.520
 and then we go to the 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.170
 questions to anyone about how he has felt 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.200
 treatment nobody can talk to us 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.890
 about this is your second therapy 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.890
 how you felt 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:02.070
 Well, at the beginning I felt very 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:05.040
 breathing very tense very nervous and with 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:09.460
 the relaxation he has given me with the 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:12.430
 elections and culture that sense 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:15.640
 I'm a little quieter apart from 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:19.960
 that my relatives say is more 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:23.150
 notorious of the recovery that I have 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:27.799
 part of my face affects 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:30.709
 and as usually this is mainly 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.569
 problem is the nervous system and how 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.140
 I mentioned it because it has been felt 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:38.030
 much better the nervous system than 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.860
 others careful but from this 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:46.780
 our final skin 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:49.450
 they are taking the products they have 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.140
 that the doctor recommended me to be more 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.140
 quiet 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.780
 sudden changes in temperature 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.630
 tell us about the food that 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.110
 It was what they promise 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:07.410
 so this everything depends on our 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.090
 food is our recovery 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.360
 then if you are eating a 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.340
 little bit more to be able to have an early 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.470
 Recovery 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.650
 exactly it is very important not the 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.229
 feeding 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.360
 everything depends on the balance we have 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:26.449
 with it to have a 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.490
 improvement that has spoken with all 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:30.650
 therapies well let's see a change 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.259
 quite important foreign 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.900
 our physical bodies a thing well 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:38.570
 important is that the discipline of 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.270
 patient true when the patient is 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.910
 disciplined well in his therapies he takes 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.820
 the nutrients and feeds on the 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:50.020
 correct way because it starts to know 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.020
 very important changes
