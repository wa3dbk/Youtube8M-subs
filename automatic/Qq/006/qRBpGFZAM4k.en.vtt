00:00:03.734 --> 00:00:05.734
 Geneva Motor Show 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.480
 Parking garage 12 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.100
 We steal a car! 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.840
 The car of blogger Jens &amp; Moritz 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.620
 The guys from rad-ab.com and auto-blog.de 

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.694
 Participated in a challenge: 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.920
 Experience all Opel OnStar features - 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.867
 before they exist. 

00:00:36.513 --> 00:00:38.513
 One feature is still missing: 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.740
 Stolen Vehicle Assistance. 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:42.914
 We park your car. 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.700
 and wait. 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.020
 Then they come! 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.180
 "Um where did we park?" 

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:57.689
 "Was it here ?!" 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.020
 "Where is our car?" 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.540
 We follow them. 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.420
 Prepare for the surprise ... 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.300
 Jens &amp; Moritz search and search. 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.620
 "Where the hell did we park?" 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.820
 They do not even notice our camera. 

00:01:47.076 --> 00:01:49.076
 Now is enough - 

00:01:49.076 --> 00:01:50.023
 we dissolve! 

00:02:04.134 --> 00:02:06.134
 "Surprise from Opel?" "Yes, pigs ?! I knew it ..." 

00:02:06.134 --> 00:02:08.134
 "What do you think you are doing here?" 

00:02:08.134 --> 00:02:11.200
 "He said yesterday that it was a cool April Fool, but we have not got April!" 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.300
 "That was really not bad .." "You participated in the bloggerchangallange ..!?" 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.100
 "Yeaaahhh" 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.100
 "Boah OnStar, what we're talking about ... connectivity!" "You've tried all the features of OnStar!" 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.400
 "Ahh awesome, well then cool idea, very good idea!" "But then we have to clarify something briefly now, namely, 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.900
 that we called the gendarmerie and of course reported the car as stolen properly. " 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.100
 "Exactly, we've already prepared for the handcuffs ..." "That's why all the questions 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.800
 When do I leave and when do you drive? "" Aso, yes, right! "" And that's why the banishment here, 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.500
 that we could stay here until 8.00 pm what we actually wanted to do 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.300
 and have not gotten the content because they kidnapped us here 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.300
 That's why I was a little acidified. 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.300
 "That had to be easy now, every OnStar feature and the last one missing? 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.000
 The theft emergency service! So what if the car is gone? " 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 "Yes, and where is the app when you need it?" "Now of course you only have one key in your hand, 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 that's stupid of course ..! "" But our car is not that back there right now, is it? 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.500
 "No, he is not! But of course we do not want to torture you anymore, you already have one 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.700
 had a long day at work. We bring you to the car and that's enough, we have good pictures ... " 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.000
 "Yes and you know what, my backpack weighs 10 kilos - the Opel now carries of course!" 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.700
 "Of course, I like to wear it over there now." "But a very good idea, I really liked it!" 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.000
 "You can use that!" "Closing words to the Blogger Challenge?" 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.800
 "Yes, best regards to the Opel fans and you are welcome to watch our videos, 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.000
 you can find them on Facebook at "rad-ab.com" or also under "automobil-blog". " 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.400
 "And otherwise that was a crowning glory. Super" "Good home trip to both of you, thank you."
