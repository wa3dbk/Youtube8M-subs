00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 if all of me I am fat in need 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.759
 If this is minecraft, we are up to date 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.200
 motorcycles you know that every day we are 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.840
 new and we can tell the truth that is 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.150
 very interesting is very cool and is a 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.940
 little google power opera but come on 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.010
 very ope or they have restricted it in such 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.170
 way that is not very ope but let's go 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.279
 a little bit 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.510
 let's start is a very simple bar and 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.920
 it's worth it they've installed you 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.769
 agreement because when we go block 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.680
 create is in different characters of 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.960
 agreement as you see here is worth what 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.399
 you have now is a model with wings is 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.710
 saying this module that is going to serve is 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.030
 so that you can fly according to the 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.190
 practical I'll leave the description 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.600
 of this video is valid so that you see it is 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.910
 the same page on which you are going to 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.670
 can download liberation link and in that 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.440
 the instant link the searches as the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.440
 downloads of agreement and good as you see 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.379
 well, that 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.899
 in each armor it is worth a few endures 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.570
 plus the resistances and others less in the 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.559
 difference that here we have several 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.559
 armor that we are going to put 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.400
 this is for example 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.700
 as you see 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.750
 I am creative and without creative and I can 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:18.070
 I will fly but I will descend 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.070
 slowly you see 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.610
 if pulse like that was whatever it is not going to 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.580
 go down faster 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.030
 and from 100 200 200 cent to what point 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.290
 that one 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.290
 and nothing happens 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.810
 You see there like I ran out and go something 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.000
 faster 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.420
 maximum speed 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.280
 more double all the space is like 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.150
 I'm going to run a little bit, it's like a 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.150
 kind of villain tour 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.340
 now at this age now space what 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.340
 I keep and I can go flying 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.670
 What if I take it off and put it off and 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.880
 I put and then 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.400
 we arrived before the floor inconvenient 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.780
 of this has several good agreements there 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.950
 some who endure more those who endure 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.459
 unless you are seeing it 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.319
 quietly with the mod to see the point 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.890
 more things 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.590
 the other thing he has as well as curious 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.800
 the next this is the level and it's 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.459
 here is the foot is called as being 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.459
 mature are worth 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.240
 As you can see, I'm going here talking 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.490
 talking talking talking 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.940
 when speaking talking talking and 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.100
 I fall faster 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.430
 faster what does that mean that's 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.440
 trash okay this is a bit screwed 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.080
 because it's a little faster I'm 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.280
 first but if you tried to avoid it 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.610
 stamped and well I think it's a mistake 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.260
 Sincerely, look, I'm at a 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.610
 height that is at this height black can 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.040
 bring the sun and I would not die not look 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.570
 boom hol to those as sorry 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.880
 then it's a bit having accounts 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:08.080
 always those two things is this 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.190
 slope is worth and without seeing the level that 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.140
 I do not know how to pronounce it but good 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.040
 all are sold without any problem 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.780
 except one 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.060
 so nothing to be careful with that is a 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.140
 total jetpack of agreement great guys 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.579
 this is all that in the mountain if you 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.379
 like the video of the like subscribe and 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.790
 It gives me more and better place I 'll leave you 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.980
 fall that it is possible that this week 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.390
 start to go up and games that are not 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:32.280
 minecraft or some that yes with 1.0 is 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.980
 say with my gepetto communicated with my 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.950
 eyebrows that I know are moving alone that we 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.560
 invades and nuances slowly with those and 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.680
 didactic tomorrow will be better until 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.680
 then
