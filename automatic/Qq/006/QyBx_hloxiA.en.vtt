all the way back down ends up being
about<00:02:02.409> two<00:02:02.679> miles<00:02:03.569> so

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.339 

I<00:02:06.689> would<00:02:07.469> all<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.250> way<00:02:08.340> there<00:02:08.489> it's<00:02:08.789> downhill

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
I would all the way there it's downhill

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.809 
I would all the way there it's downhill
because<00:02:10.349> like<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.920> ground<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.340> even<00:02:11.670> there

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
because like the ground is even there

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.130 
because like the ground is even there
it's<00:02:11.940> like<00:02:12.060> just<00:02:12.239> uphill<00:02:12.660> here<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.020> it's

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
it's like just uphill here and it's

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.410 
it's like just uphill here and it's
downhill<00:02:13.950> over<00:02:14.370> there<00:02:14.580> so<00:02:16.970> going<00:02:17.970> down<00:02:18.000> to

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
downhill over there so going down to

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.850
