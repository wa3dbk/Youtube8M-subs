something that's so extraordinary well
with<00:00:19.329> iPhone<00:00:19.750> 4s<00:00:20.110> we<00:00:20.770> did<00:00:20.919> exactly<00:00:21.340> that<00:00:21.430> by

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:22.329 
with iPhone 4s we did exactly that by

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:24.060 
with iPhone 4s we did exactly that by
taking<00:00:22.689> this<00:00:22.750> amazing<00:00:23.410> design<00:00:23.529> and

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
taking this amazing design and

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.780 
taking this amazing design and
completely<00:00:24.880> rethinking<00:00:25.509> the<00:00:25.930> inside<00:00:26.790> we

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:27.790 
completely rethinking the inside we

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.780 
completely rethinking the inside we
started<00:00:28.149> by<00:00:28.270> adding<00:00:28.419> the<00:00:28.660> dual<00:00:28.840> core<00:00:29.110> a5<00:00:29.349> chip

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:29.790 
started by adding the dual core a5 chip

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.310 
started by adding the dual core a5 chip
which<00:00:30.790> is<00:00:30.910> up<00:00:31.059> to<00:00:31.090> twice<00:00:31.390> as<00:00:31.660> fast

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
which is up to twice as fast

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.069 
which is up to twice as fast
then<00:00:33.070> we<00:00:33.250> completely<00:00:33.760> redesign<00:00:34.449> the<00:00:34.660> camera

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079 
then we completely redesign the camera

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.770 
then we completely redesign the camera
which<00:00:35.440> not<00:00:35.710> only<00:00:35.739> has<00:00:36.190> eight<00:00:36.519> megapixels<00:00:37.269> but

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780
