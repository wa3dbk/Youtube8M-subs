00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello there is a little bit of you 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.569
 today I will show another mechanism 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.730
 which will be useful for creating maps 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.280
 in maykravt not that from the very 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.160
 the appearance of papers created the owl himself 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.139
 concepts mapper st in minecraft some 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.140
 the creators of maps for the passage did not find 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.119
 full implementation of their ideas and cop cube 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.529
 grow for them there were no such conditions 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.939
 to bring their idea to life for them 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.510
 especially for them were created such 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.070
 mods like mission castes which 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.890
 were present in some maps on 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.460
 passage and today seal version 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.340
 minecraft 1.7 some commands 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.430
 which can replace part of what 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.039
 did not know how to minekravta but could cast pisi 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.910
 sharpen most ordinary chat with 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.789
 ability to select an answer and 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.949
 actions that will take place post 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.100
 Well, fewer words, let's click here 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.510
 this gnome is usually a signal here nothing 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.860
 No, there is a signal that can 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.630
 be described by any demand shake with us 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.299
 seeding the message we can 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.790
 answer exactly open chat 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.540
 that is, no buttons, no books 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.380
 just open the chat and click for example yes 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.890
 with us you are connected with another message not 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.780
 surely only the message we have 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.650
 signal we can for example give some 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.650
 thing 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:38.130
 creators boost skype and more generally 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:41.020
 there is a signal and all your hands and not too 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.429
 clickable chat sky 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:49.509
 on clickable reported in chat after 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:53.409
 once we clicked no longer 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.840
 pressed here and here with this here 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.899
 Some problems I see in the chat 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.259
 we are still starting to write this 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:06.090
 that's the message that we raise our drill 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:10.209
 but it can not be treated so to speak 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:14.890
 no no gimme gimme more while 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:17.049
 I do not remember this game setting 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.349
 game rules ok like that absolutely not 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:22.599
 helps, so let's close the door 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:26.019
 so that no creepers come in and 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:30.819
 let's see well first we need to create 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:33.280
 skype would 1 skyport it will be ours one 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:38.049
 sky fort to one answer 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:43.209
 group or rather roughly so I called 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:46.510
 like this, the second one is exactly the same 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:49.389
 there all the commands will be in the description for 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.359
 so that it all works again 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:56.700
 that is, we need to delete the chat first 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:03:00.730
 or forget all the more interesting 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:04.299
 here we actually begin 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.400
 interactive vat instead of dollars you can 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.849
 set an ordinary goal because here 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.609
 This here this simply so say start the 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:16.390
 there is it not clickable did not dig further 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:21.670
 There is such a tug command . 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:25.030
 and then I shoot a lot of things 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:28.840
 shake back you see what team 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.709
 very big started for a start we need 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:36.209
 do so to all that is if it is 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:40.090
 multiplayer should display all 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.920
 here the text is the text and we put 2 quotes 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.580
 because to 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.220
 but it should be shorter extra this text 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.390
 which will be with us 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.709
 clickable that is what we will 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.840
 live if we are here in this text here in this 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.209
 text we write something he does not have 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.190
 will be shouts clickable will only be 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.959
 text that is written between these two 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:07.120
 in two 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:11.350
 apostrophes further damn event this here 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:14.709
 what will be the fact that we actually click 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.870
 started on the text which will be highlighted 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:19.359
 chad we will have action 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.320
 namely the execution of commands and the meaning 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.140
 doing this 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.320
 and secretly here it is written to me soon 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:29.380
 will be playoff 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.210
 Well, that is, we finish one on one 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.840
 point so say your skype 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:39.490
 each person can be here instead 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:44.050
 This body for example , any team but 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:47.410
 i'm better but i ca n't be yes 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.530
 You can for example here, too, with a neck and so 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.990
 I just wanted to show exactly what it is. 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.350
 Now I will show why it is necessary so 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.060
 made 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.220
 here and here is the exact same team 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:04.780
 only we have here the text and 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:07.480
 no all the same thing only the text is not and 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.410
 here is another 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:14.590
 only already 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:17.880
 overestimate another skype ie there is another one 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.000
 I corresponds to this lol 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.580
 corresponds to 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.270
 because we click yes that is see 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:29.610
 here we are looking for people who 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:31.600
 this same skyport for above and 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:36.580
 the comparator will give a signal 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:38.140
 can see our own what we 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.580
 want to get 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:46.270
 that's why you need to do so 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:48.970
 because because if we do 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:52.390
 so we can continue this chain and 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:55.090
 already here for example at the same time perform 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:57.250
 not one for several teams because 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.740
 put some teams in here 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.590
 impossible end here this option 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:07.390
 will be more 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:09.910
 workers and then it may happen 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:12.970
 so for example the person who opened 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:16.840
 to chat again he can click again 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:19.090
 all this is not removed this is clickable 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:26.940
 garbage is not removed and it will work 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:26.940
 the whole game respectively here 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:35.440
 if we answer our question 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:39.620
 not in these command blocks we delete 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:42.260
 excalibur here still needs to be noted 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:45.710
 that these must necessarily stand 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:47.570
 Two sky weekdays, that is, the system should 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.210
 reckon otherwise nothing will work 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:53.060
 these 2 block commands with these 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.750
 values can be set for example the beginning 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.820
 cards if there you understand that is 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:03.080
 to start the map we need to 

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:04.910
 push the window or again somehow 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:08.510
 yet that is the command units must 

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:11.290
 be increasingly well here and all around until 

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:11.290
 subscribe
