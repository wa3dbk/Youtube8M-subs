00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
so a garden time hasn't changed its you

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.609 
so a garden time hasn't changed its you
know<00:00:18.390> perspective<00:00:19.080> on<00:00:19.170> anything<00:00:19.500> you're

looking at our feet because we're gonna
be<00:00:20.970> talking<00:00:21.240> about<00:00:21.320> reflexology<00:00:22.320> in<00:00:22.500> gardens

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:22.950 
be talking about reflexology in gardens

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.920 
be talking about reflexology in gardens
today<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.369> I'm<00:00:23.460> here<00:00:23.580> with<00:00:23.730> Rebecca<00:00:24.060> her<00:00:24.660> wood

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.150 
understands this concept fully can you

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.390 
understands this concept fully can you
give<00:00:33.269> us<00:00:33.360> some<00:00:33.540> basic<00:00:33.960> stuff<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.769> go<00:00:34.890> on

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:35.400 
give us some basic stuff to go on

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.509 
give us some basic stuff to go on
yeah<00:00:36.059> Chinese<00:00:36.570> foot<00:00:36.780> reflexology<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.620> part<00:00:38.370> of

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:38.519 
yeah Chinese foot reflexology is part of

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:40.189 
yeah Chinese foot reflexology is part of
traditional<00:00:38.879> Chinese<00:00:39.239> medicine<00:00:39.269> and<00:00:39.989> it's

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
traditional Chinese medicine and it's

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:47.779 
traditional Chinese medicine and it's
well<00:00:40.410> over<00:00:40.680> 3,000<00:00:41.430> years<00:00:41.610> old<00:00:41.760> yeah<00:00:46.460> but<00:00:47.460> the

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
well over 3,000 years old yeah but the

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.060 
well over 3,000 years old yeah but the
basic<00:00:48.239> tenets<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.719> foot<00:00:48.899> reflexology<00:00:49.070> say

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
basic tenets of foot reflexology say

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.610 
basic tenets of foot reflexology say
that<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.820> foot<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.120> microcosm<00:00:51.809> or<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> map<00:00:52.379> of

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
that the foot is a microcosm or a map of

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.529 
that the foot is a microcosm or a map of
the<00:00:52.739> entire<00:00:53.010> body<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:53.969> through<00:00:54.420> your

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
the entire body so that through your

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.240 
the entire body so that through your
feet<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.960> can<00:00:54.989> treat<00:00:55.350> pretty<00:00:55.620> much<00:00:55.860> anything

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
feet you can treat pretty much anything

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.810 
feet you can treat pretty much anything
and<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.020> concept<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.770> walking<00:00:59.579> on

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
and the the concept of walking on

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.930 
and the the concept of walking on
surfaces<00:01:00.859> what<00:01:01.859> what<00:01:02.129> does<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.430> mean<00:01:02.699> what

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
surfaces what what does that mean what

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.310 
surfaces what what does that mean what
is<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.059> supposed<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.420> do<00:01:03.629> for<00:01:03.899> you

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
is that supposed to do for you

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.139 
is that supposed to do for you
well<00:01:04.589> walking<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.220> different<00:01:05.550> surfaces<00:01:05.970> like

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149 
well walking on different surfaces like

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:07.999 
well walking on different surfaces like
the<00:01:06.360> mosaic<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.110> pathways<00:01:07.500> here<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:07.890> the

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
the mosaic of pathways here in the

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:09.620 
the mosaic of pathways here in the
garden<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.490> puts<00:01:08.729> pressure<00:01:08.970> on<00:01:09.180> different

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
garden it puts pressure on different

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.840 
garden it puts pressure on different
points<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.080> your<00:01:10.200> feet<00:01:10.440> different<00:01:11.250> foot

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
points in your feet different foot

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.120 
points in your feet different foot
reflexology<00:01:12.140> points<00:01:13.140> again<00:01:13.380> if<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.710> entire

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
reflexology points again if the entire

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.400 
reflexology points again if the entire
body<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.880> mapped<00:01:15.119> on<00:01:15.330> your<00:01:15.539> foot<00:01:15.780> by<00:01:15.960> putting

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
body is mapped on your foot by putting

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.320 
body is mapped on your foot by putting
pressure<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.100> massaging<00:01:17.640> different<00:01:18.030> points

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
pressure and massaging different points

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.780 
pressure and massaging different points
on<00:01:18.450> your<00:01:18.539> feet<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:19.409> can<00:01:19.770> access<00:01:20.549> those

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
on your feet you can access those

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.039 
on your feet you can access those
different<00:01:21.060> parts<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.450> body<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.689> affect

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
different parts of the body to affect

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.810 
different parts of the body to affect
change<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.560> if<00:01:22.770> you're<00:01:22.950> constantly<00:01:23.340> working

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
change and if you're constantly working

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.570 
change and if you're constantly working
on<00:01:24.060> soil<00:01:24.450> or<00:01:24.810> on<00:01:25.170> like<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> sole<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:26.009> shoe<00:01:26.040> or<00:01:26.549> a

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
on soil or on like a sole of a shoe or a

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.280 
on soil or on like a sole of a shoe or a
flat<00:01:26.970> surface<00:01:27.270> you're<00:01:27.810> not<00:01:27.930> getting<00:01:28.170> those

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
flat surface you're not getting those

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.170 
flat surface you're not getting those
pressure<00:01:28.560> points<00:01:28.650> no<00:01:29.640> then<00:01:29.939> you're<00:01:30.060> getting

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
pressure points no then you're getting

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.789 
pressure points no then you're getting
even<00:01:30.509> pressure<00:01:30.720> all<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.140> time<00:01:31.350> when<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.650> had

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
even pressure all the time when you had

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.289 
even pressure all the time when you had
that<00:01:31.920> same<00:01:32.100> even<00:01:32.430> pressure<00:01:32.610> all<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.880> time<00:01:33.150> you

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
that same even pressure all the time you

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.399 
that same even pressure all the time you
know<00:01:33.390> you're<00:01:33.509> walking<00:01:33.630> every<00:01:34.049> day<00:01:34.170> all<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
know you're walking every day all the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.469 
know you're walking every day all the
weight<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.770> your<00:01:34.799> body<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.250> getting<00:01:35.369> pound<00:01:36.150> and

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
weight of your body is getting pound and

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.420 
weight of your body is getting pound and
pounded<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.079> pounded<00:01:37.140> on<00:01:37.560> your<00:01:37.740> feet<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.280> they

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
pounded and pounded on your feet so they

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.249 
pounded and pounded on your feet so they
need<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.640> little<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:39.119> little<00:01:39.509> change<00:01:39.810> sometimes

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
need a little a little change sometimes

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.300 
need a little a little change sometimes
well<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.650> would<00:01:40.770> make<00:01:40.890> sense<00:01:41.040> when<00:01:41.220> you

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
well that would make sense when you

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.859 
well that would make sense when you
think<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.610> like<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.970> heels<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.720> your<00:01:42.810> shoes

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
think of like the heels of your shoes

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.630 
think of like the heels of your shoes
where<00:01:43.320> on<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.530> certain<00:01:43.860> level<00:01:44.009> well<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.520> only

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
where on a certain level well that only

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.039 
where on a certain level well that only
would<00:01:44.850> do<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.149> if<00:01:45.270> there<00:01:45.390> was<00:01:45.450> consistency

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
would do that if there was consistency

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.109 
would do that if there was consistency
on<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.649> slant<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.490> makes<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.970> lot<00:01:48.000> of

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
on that slant so that makes a lot of

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.350 
on that slant so that makes a lot of
sense<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:49.430> what<00:01:50.430> what<00:01:50.759> would<00:01:50.909> be<00:01:51.090> something

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
sense so what what would be something

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.149 
sense so what what would be something
that<00:01:51.540> someone<00:01:52.020> like<00:01:52.229> at<00:01:52.500> home<00:01:52.740> could<00:01:53.009> do

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
that someone like at home could do

these tools at home you could certainly

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.729 
these tools at home you could certainly
come<00:02:38.299> down<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.900> Portland<00:02:39.319> classical

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
tell us like what why some of them are

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:50.920 
tell us like what why some of them are
different<00:02:49.849> for<00:02:50.120> what<00:02:50.269> reasons

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930
