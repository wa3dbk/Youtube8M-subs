00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
um time ran into an issue here baffles

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.510 
um time ran into an issue here baffles
are<00:02:36.430> too<00:02:36.790> short<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.770> it's<00:02:38.770> not<00:02:38.980> just<00:02:39.160> a<00:02:39.280> little

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
are too short and it's not just a little

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.500 
are too short and it's not just a little
bit<00:02:39.640> I<00:02:39.850> screwed<00:02:40.840> up<00:02:40.930> measuring<00:02:44.940> yeah<00:02:45.940> so

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
bit I screwed up measuring yeah so

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.810 
bit I screwed up measuring yeah so
they're<00:02:47.440> like<00:02:47.590> quarter<00:02:48.220> of<00:02:48.340> an<00:02:48.460> inch<00:02:48.520> too

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
they're like quarter of an inch too

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.250 
they're like quarter of an inch too
short<00:02:48.850> so<00:02:49.360> therefore<00:02:49.510> there's<00:02:49.900> an<00:02:49.990> eighth<00:02:50.110> of

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
short so therefore there's an eighth of

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.450 
short so therefore there's an eighth of
an<00:02:50.380> inch<00:02:50.470> each<00:02:50.770> side<00:02:51.660> that<00:02:52.660> there's<00:02:53.080> play<00:02:53.500> when
