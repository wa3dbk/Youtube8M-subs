to the left so I know what you guys are

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.539 
to the left so I know what you guys are
think<00:04:12.269> oh<00:04:12.390> this<00:04:12.630> play<00:04:12.840> was<00:04:12.989> bad<00:04:13.200> man<00:04:13.500> he<00:04:14.400> was

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
think oh this play was bad man he was

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.159 
think oh this play was bad man he was
beat<00:04:14.730> yeah<00:04:15.060> I<00:04:15.269> could<00:04:15.540> have<00:04:15.630> lobbed<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:15.989> ball

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
beat yeah I could have lobbed the ball

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.740 
beat yeah I could have lobbed the ball
but<00:04:16.829> I<00:04:17.190> figured<00:04:18.090> why<00:04:18.180> would<00:04:18.359> I<00:04:18.389> want<00:04:18.570> to<00:04:18.600> do

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
but I figured why would I want to do

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.129 
but I figured why would I want to do
that<00:04:18.780> and<00:04:19.139> have<00:04:20.100> my<00:04:20.660> defense<00:04:21.660> play<00:04:21.840> what<00:04:22.019> was

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
that and have my defense play what was

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:23.600 
that and have my defense play what was
he<00:04:22.260> doing<00:04:22.500> he<00:04:22.590> was<00:04:22.650> a<00:04:22.740> perfect<00:04:22.919> position<00:04:23.130> Kiko

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
he doing he was a perfect position Kiko

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.480 
he doing he was a perfect position Kiko
Alonso<00:04:23.639> what<00:04:24.630> was<00:04:24.840> that<00:04:24.870> like<00:04:25.770> Kiko<00:04:26.160> was<00:04:26.340> in

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
Alonso what was that like Kiko was in

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.890 
Alonso what was that like Kiko was in
perfect<00:04:26.669> position<00:04:26.910> to<00:04:27.180> intercept<00:04:27.360> that<00:04:27.660> ball

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
perfect position to intercept that ball

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.159 
perfect position to intercept that ball
but<00:04:28.080> long<00:04:28.380> story<00:04:28.410> short<00:04:28.740> I<00:04:29.960> precision<00:04:30.960> past

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
but long story short I precision past

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.290 
but long story short I precision past
that<00:04:31.380> pass<00:04:31.560> forward<00:04:32.190> on<00:04:32.460> fourth<00:04:32.700> and<00:04:32.820> four<00:04:33.090> he

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
that pass forward on fourth and four he

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.760 
that pass forward on fourth and four he
gets<00:04:33.479> it<00:04:33.660> our<00:04:33.960> precision<00:04:34.260> passed<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.650> ball

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
gets it our precision passed the ball

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.950 
gets it our precision passed the ball
forward<00:04:35.100> and<00:04:35.700> it<00:04:35.820> went<00:04:36.000> to<00:04:36.090> the<00:04:36.120> left<00:04:36.240> which<00:04:36.840> is

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
forward and it went to the left which is

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.390 
forward and it went to the left which is
why<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.139> interception<00:04:37.740> happened<00:04:38.100> it<00:04:38.280> was

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
why the interception happened it was

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.300 
why the interception happened it was
just<00:04:38.550> a<00:04:38.610> bad<00:04:38.729> ball<00:04:39.000> from<00:04:39.210> cam<00:04:39.450> I<00:04:40.039> kind<00:04:41.039> of<00:04:41.160> don't
