exact here again um the question that is
asked<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.620> lot<00:00:11.099> about<00:00:11.370> disqus<00:00:11.969> is<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.450> it<00:00:12.660> hard

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
asked a lot about disqus is is it hard

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.550 
asked a lot about disqus is is it hard
to<00:00:13.049> take<00:00:13.320> care<00:00:13.530> for<00:00:13.740> discus<00:00:14.130> in<00:00:14.490> my<00:00:15.360> opinion<00:00:15.690> it

to take care for discus in my opinion it

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.220 
to take care for discus in my opinion it
can<00:00:16.949> be<00:00:17.190> but<00:00:17.220> it's<00:00:17.970> not<00:00:18.090> it's<00:00:18.570> actually<00:00:18.960> not

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
can be but it's not it's actually not

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.279 
can be but it's not it's actually not
too<00:00:19.289> hard<00:00:20.060> people<00:00:21.060> always<00:00:21.240> say<00:00:21.600> that<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:22.140> is

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
too hard people always say that it is

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.490 
too hard people always say that it is
hard<00:00:22.560> but<00:00:23.600> you<00:00:24.600> just<00:00:24.750> have<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.019> watch<00:00:25.230> out<00:00:25.470> and

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
hard but you just have to watch out and

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.830 
hard but you just have to watch out and
be<00:00:25.680> careful<00:00:25.980> that's<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.789> thing<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.539> I've<00:00:27.660> had

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
be careful that's the thing so I've had

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.349 
be careful that's the thing so I've had
these<00:00:28.050> two<00:00:28.529> guys<00:00:28.769> for<00:00:29.220> about<00:00:29.429> probably<00:00:29.670> two

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
these two guys for about probably two

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.549 
these two guys for about probably two
months<00:00:30.630> now<00:00:31.460> they're<00:00:32.460> going<00:00:32.669> strong<00:00:33.559> they

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
months now they're going strong they

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.990 
months now they're going strong they
love<00:00:34.800> all<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.130> fish<00:00:35.719> they're<00:00:36.719> pretty<00:00:36.989> cool<00:00:37.260> um

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
love all the fish they're pretty cool um

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.410 
love all the fish they're pretty cool um
what<00:00:39.000> let's<00:00:39.930> jump<00:00:40.290> right<00:00:40.350> into<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:42.030> hard<00:00:42.270> or

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
what let's jump right into is it hard or

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.590 
what let's jump right into is it hard or
not<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.710> reason<00:00:43.739> why<00:00:44.190> people<00:00:45.149> say<00:00:45.420> that

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
not so the reason why people say that

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.540 
not so the reason why people say that
it's<00:00:45.660> hard<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.530> because<00:00:46.590> people<00:00:47.129> say<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.430> you

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
it's hard is because people say that you

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.630 
it's hard is because people say that you
need<00:00:47.760> RO<00:00:48.000> water<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:49.289> need<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.039> stable

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
need RO water you need to have a stable

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.910 
need RO water you need to have a stable
um<00:00:51.649> pH<00:00:52.649> like<00:00:53.059> 6.8<00:00:54.059> nothing<00:00:54.750> above<00:00:55.170> seven<00:00:55.649> point

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
um pH like 6.8 nothing above seven point

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.290 
um pH like 6.8 nothing above seven point
like<00:00:56.489> seven<00:00:56.910> just<00:00:57.420> seven<00:00:57.780> um<00:00:58.789> but<00:00:59.789> that's

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
like seven just seven um but that's

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.560 
like seven just seven um but that's
typically<00:01:00.750> not<00:01:00.960> true<00:01:01.940> these<00:01:02.940> guys<00:01:03.149> have<00:01:03.420> been

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
typically not true these guys have been

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.800 
typically not true these guys have been
bred<00:01:03.840> for<00:01:04.549> several<00:01:05.549> several<00:01:05.850> several<00:01:06.330> years

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
bred for several several several years

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.800 
bred for several several several years
these<00:01:07.680> aren't<00:01:07.890> wild<00:01:08.159> anymore<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.970> know<00:01:09.060> that

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
these aren't wild anymore I know that

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.020 
these aren't wild anymore I know that
people<00:01:10.140> are<00:01:10.500> trying<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.979> match<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.610> ph<00:01:12.000> of

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
people are trying to match the ph of

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.359 
people are trying to match the ph of
their<00:01:12.900> normal<00:01:13.790> like<00:01:14.790> home<00:01:15.210> but<00:01:16.100> they've<00:01:17.100> been

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
their normal like home but they've been

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.300 
their normal like home but they've been
bred<00:01:17.610> for<00:01:17.670> many<00:01:18.540> years<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.110> they're<00:01:19.650> not<00:01:19.770> wild

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
bred for many years and they're not wild

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.530 
bred for many years and they're not wild
anymore<00:01:20.509> so<00:01:21.920> to<00:01:22.920> be<00:01:23.040> honest<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.939> really<00:01:24.330> don't

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
anymore so to be honest you really don't

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.770 
anymore so to be honest you really don't
need<00:01:24.689> RO<00:01:24.990> water<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.710> use<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.850> just<00:01:27.060> because<00:01:27.450> i

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
need RO water I use it just because i

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.899 
need RO water I use it just because i
have<00:01:28.619> an<00:01:29.040> RO<00:01:29.250> system<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.000> i<00:01:30.840> just<00:01:31.500> i<00:01:31.829> do<00:01:32.340> water

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
have an RO system and i just i do water

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.940 
have an RO system and i just i do water
changes<00:01:33.000> with<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.960> i<00:01:34.439> know<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.829> a

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
changes with that and i know this is a

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.340 
changes with that and i know this is a
very<00:01:35.220> small<00:01:35.579> tank<00:01:35.880> but<00:01:36.090> i<00:01:36.119> am<00:01:36.450> getting<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.900> 55

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
very small tank but i am getting a 55

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.980 
very small tank but i am getting a 55
gallon<00:01:37.650> well<00:01:38.070> i<00:01:38.100> have<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> 55<00:01:38.909> gallon<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.450> just

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
gallon well i have a 55 gallon it's just

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.200 
gallon well i have a 55 gallon it's just
cycling<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.650> let<00:01:40.950> cycle<00:01:41.400> my<00:01:41.490> tanks<00:01:41.820> for<00:01:42.000> about

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
cycling I let cycle my tanks for about

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.590 
cycling I let cycle my tanks for about
five<00:01:42.810> days<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:43.920> cycling<00:01:46.189> so<00:01:47.189> that's<00:01:47.610> what

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
five days so it's cycling so that's what

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.620 
five days so it's cycling so that's what
it<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.840> with<00:01:49.110> RO<00:01:49.380> water<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.180> you<00:01:51.180> really<00:01:51.509> don't

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
it is with RO water and you really don't

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.880 
it is with RO water and you really don't
need<00:01:51.869> RO<00:01:52.140> water<00:01:53.210> but<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:55.170> can<00:01:55.380> use<00:01:55.619> tap<00:01:55.860> water

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
need RO water but you can use tap water

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.730 
need RO water but you can use tap water
the<00:01:56.729> main<00:01:57.060> thing<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.420> it's<00:01:58.020> better<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.530> have<00:01:58.680> a

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
the main thing is it's better to have a

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.550 
the main thing is it's better to have a
stable<00:01:59.250> pH<00:01:59.820> instead<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.899> messing<00:02:01.290> with<00:02:01.439> your

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
stable pH instead of messing with your

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.950 
stable pH instead of messing with your
pH<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.159> if<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.430> have<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.000> pH<00:02:03.479> coming<00:02:03.810> out<00:02:03.930> of

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
pH so if you have a pH coming out of

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.069 
pH so if you have a pH coming out of
your<00:02:04.140> faucet<00:02:04.380> like<00:02:04.710> 7.2<00:02:05.600> you<00:02:06.600> don't<00:02:06.780> want<00:02:06.990> to

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
your faucet like 7.2 you don't want to

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.820 
your faucet like 7.2 you don't want to
go<00:02:07.500> out<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.009> buy<00:02:08.340> some<00:02:08.670> PhD<00:02:09.149> creaser<00:02:09.840> because

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
go out and buy some PhD creaser because

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.530 
go out and buy some PhD creaser because
that<00:02:11.700> will<00:02:11.879> just

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
that will just

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.899 
that will just
I<00:02:12.599> hurt<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:13.019> fish<00:02:13.260> and<00:02:13.650> it's<00:02:14.219> better<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.849> have

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
I hurt the fish and it's better to have

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:19.580 
I hurt the fish and it's better to have
a<00:02:15.030> high<00:02:15.890> stable<00:02:16.890> pH<00:02:17.189> then<00:02:17.819> have<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.060> low<00:02:18.450> up<00:02:19.230> and

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
a high stable pH then have a low up and

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.699 
a high stable pH then have a low up and
down<00:02:19.769> pH<00:02:21.349> these<00:02:22.349> guys<00:02:22.620> are<00:02:23.069> just<00:02:23.670> awesome<00:02:23.939> and

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
down pH these guys are just awesome and

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.490 
down pH these guys are just awesome and
you<00:02:25.709> really<00:02:26.129> do<00:02:26.280> not<00:02:26.430> need<00:02:26.700> our<00:02:27.030> water<00:02:27.659> that's

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
you really do not need our water that's

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.140 
you really do not need our water that's
the<00:02:28.709> main<00:02:29.010> reason<00:02:29.040> why<00:02:29.430> people<00:02:29.640> say<00:02:29.970> they're

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
the main reason why people say they're

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.729 
the main reason why people say they're
hard<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.510> take<00:02:30.750> care<00:02:30.989> for<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.530> then<00:02:32.489> also

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
hard to take care for and then also

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.949 
hard to take care for and then also
they're<00:02:34.739> pretty<00:02:34.980> easy<00:02:35.280> you<00:02:35.730> just<00:02:36.030> have<00:02:36.239> to<00:02:36.450> go

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
they're pretty easy you just have to go

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.009 
they're pretty easy you just have to go
out<00:02:36.989> and<00:02:37.349> buy<00:02:37.500> like<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:38.189> different<00:02:39.180> diet<00:02:39.599> for

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
out and buy like a different diet for

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.750 
out and buy like a different diet for
them<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.500> don't<00:02:40.650> have<00:02:40.799> to<00:02:40.980> always<00:02:41.189> feed<00:02:41.579> them

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
them you don't have to always feed them

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.910 
them you don't have to always feed them
flakes<00:02:42.060> I<00:02:42.329> mean<00:02:42.870> they're<00:02:43.019> on<00:02:43.200> herb<00:02:43.439> or<00:02:43.530> so<00:02:43.799> they

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
flakes I mean they're on herb or so they

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.190 
flakes I mean they're on herb or so they
eat<00:02:44.099> meat<00:02:44.129> too<00:02:44.639> I've<00:02:44.909> freed<00:02:45.629> them<00:02:45.780> frozen

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
eat meat too I've freed them frozen

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.710 
eat meat too I've freed them frozen
bloodworms<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:47.180> spring<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.269> out<00:02:48.389> the<00:02:48.510> color

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
bloodworms and spring it out the color

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.420 
bloodworms and spring it out the color
really<00:02:49.079> well<00:02:50.750> they<00:02:51.750> love<00:02:51.989> it<00:02:52.019> they<00:02:52.319> come<00:02:53.159> up<00:02:53.310> to

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
really well they love it they come up to

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.449 
really well they love it they come up to
the<00:02:53.549> tank<00:02:53.760> whenever<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.180> want<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.510> feed<00:02:54.689> them

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
the tank whenever I want to feed them

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.509 
the tank whenever I want to feed them
but<00:02:56.459> you<00:02:56.549> can<00:02:56.700> also<00:02:56.849> feed<00:02:57.120> them<00:02:57.299> flakes<00:02:57.629> and

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
but you can also feed them flakes and

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.509 
but you can also feed them flakes and
yeah<00:02:59.519> another<00:03:00.510> question<00:03:01.049> is<00:03:01.230> how<00:03:01.650> big<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:02.189> a

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
yeah another question is how big of a

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.750 
yeah another question is how big of a
tank<00:03:03.269> you<00:03:03.419> want<00:03:03.689> you<00:03:04.560> probably<00:03:05.129> want<00:03:05.519> about<00:03:05.730> a

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
tank you want you probably want about a

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.440 
tank you want you probably want about a
55<00:03:06.269> gallon<00:03:06.569> tank<00:03:06.900> at<00:03:07.519> minimum<00:03:08.519> I<00:03:08.760> just<00:03:09.299> have

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
55 gallon tank at minimum I just have

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.699 
55 gallon tank at minimum I just have
these<00:03:09.599> guys<00:03:09.840> in<00:03:10.079> there<00:03:10.290> because<00:03:10.470> I've<00:03:10.680> had

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
these guys in there because I've had

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:11.809 
these guys in there because I've had
them<00:03:10.980> in<00:03:11.099> there<00:03:11.280> since<00:03:11.489> they<00:03:11.639> were<00:03:11.790> little

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
them in there since they were little

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.220 
them in there since they were little
babies<00:03:13.730> but<00:03:14.730> I<00:03:14.819> am<00:03:15.000> moving<00:03:15.299> them<00:03:15.419> up<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.810> 55

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
babies but I am moving them up to the 55

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
babies but I am moving them up to the 55
gallon<00:03:16.650> here<00:03:17.069> in<00:03:17.609> about<00:03:17.970> two<00:03:18.269> days<00:03:18.449> and<00:03:19.250> I

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
gallon here in about two days and I

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.890 
gallon here in about two days and I
think<00:03:20.579> they'll<00:03:21.030> like<00:03:21.209> it<00:03:21.560> but<00:03:23.629> that's<00:03:24.629> pretty

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
think they'll like it but that's pretty

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.890 
think they'll like it but that's pretty
much<00:03:25.049> it<00:03:25.199> to<00:03:25.680> taking<00:03:26.489> care<00:03:26.639> of<00:03:26.699> Disqus<00:03:27.209> there's

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
much it to taking care of Disqus there's

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.399 
much it to taking care of Disqus there's
not<00:03:28.079> too<00:03:28.319> much<00:03:28.530> more<00:03:28.859> to<00:03:29.609> it<00:03:29.790> I<00:03:30.000> mean<00:03:30.599> you

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:31.409 
not too much more to it I mean you

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:34.490 
not too much more to it I mean you
really<00:03:31.440> don't<00:03:31.859> need<00:03:31.949> auto<00:03:32.190> water<00:03:32.549> and<00:03:33.500> that's

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
really don't need auto water and that's

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.899 
really don't need auto water and that's
that's<00:03:35.190> pretty<00:03:35.310> much<00:03:35.669> the<00:03:36.030> main<00:03:36.569> factor<00:03:36.870> is

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
that's pretty much the main factor is

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:40.759 
that's pretty much the main factor is
it's<00:03:38.909> better<00:03:39.239> to<00:03:39.389> have<00:03:39.449> a<00:03:39.569> stable<00:03:39.840> pH<00:03:40.349> and<00:03:40.620> do

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
it's better to have a stable pH and do

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.039 
it's better to have a stable pH and do
water<00:03:41.010> changes<00:03:41.129> with<00:03:41.699> the<00:03:41.879> same<00:03:42.120> exact<00:03:42.569> pH

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
water changes with the same exact pH

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.129 
water changes with the same exact pH
instead<00:03:43.769> of<00:03:43.889> increasing<00:03:44.280> it<00:03:45.209> decreasing<00:03:46.019> it

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
instead of increasing it decreasing it

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:49.849 
instead of increasing it decreasing it
and<00:03:46.409> messing<00:03:46.769> going<00:03:47.609> up<00:03:47.790> and<00:03:47.970> down<00:03:48.590> these<00:03:49.590> guys

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
and messing going up and down these guys

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.189 
and messing going up and down these guys
are<00:03:50.280> not<00:03:50.699> aggressive<00:03:51.030> at<00:03:51.299> all<00:03:51.359> I<00:03:51.720> mean<00:03:52.019> they're

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199 
are not aggressive at all I mean they're

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:54.469 
are not aggressive at all I mean they're
awesome<00:03:52.430> they<00:03:53.430> they<00:03:54.060> are<00:03:54.239> definitely

community fish and they did along with

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.099 
community fish and they did along with
others<00:03:56.790> um<00:03:58.729> they<00:03:59.729> also<00:03:59.939> like<00:04:00.299> to<00:04:00.329> swim<00:04:00.989> in

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
definitely need a bigger tank for them

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.659 
definitely need a bigger tank for them
they<00:04:10.470> do<00:04:10.530> cost<00:04:10.919> a<00:04:11.099> lot<00:04:11.220> of<00:04:11.280> money<00:04:11.400> because

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.620 

the<00:04:35.160> reason<00:04:35.520> why<00:04:35.610> you<00:04:35.639> really<00:04:35.940> don't<00:04:36.180> need<00:04:36.389> our

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
the reason why you really don't need our

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.189 
the reason why you really don't need our
waters<00:04:37.289> because<00:04:37.800> the<00:04:38.460> place<00:04:38.699> that<00:04:38.970> the<00:04:39.539> local

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
waters because the place that the local

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.980 
waters because the place that the local
fish<00:04:40.410> stores<00:04:40.710> buy<00:04:41.039> them<00:04:41.250> from<00:04:41.490> they<00:04:42.150> don't

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
fish stores buy them from they don't

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.540 
fish stores buy them from they don't
really<00:04:43.199> care<00:04:43.320> they<00:04:43.800> don't<00:04:43.919> want<00:04:44.160> to<00:04:44.220> go<00:04:44.520> out

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
really care they don't want to go out

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.520 
really care they don't want to go out
and<00:04:44.880> get<00:04:45.060> some<00:04:45.270> auto<00:04:45.479> water<00:04:45.810> just<00:04:46.110> to<00:04:46.169> do<00:04:46.320> water

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
and get some auto water just to do water

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.350 
and get some auto water just to do water
changes<00:04:46.680> I<00:04:47.250> mean<00:04:47.759> these<00:04:47.970> farms<00:04:48.509> are<00:04:49.940> 7.2<00:04:50.940> ph

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
changes I mean these farms are 7.2 ph

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.779 
changes I mean these farms are 7.2 ph
pretty<00:04:51.720> much<00:04:51.930> they<00:04:52.889> don't<00:04:52.979> want<00:04:53.220> to<00:04:53.310> go<00:04:53.490> deal

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
pretty much they don't want to go deal

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:57.650 
pretty much they don't want to go deal
with<00:04:53.850> all<00:04:54.360> right<00:04:55.080> RO<00:04:55.830> water<00:04:56.280> you<00:04:57.120> can<00:04:57.270> even<00:04:57.389> ask

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
with all right RO water you can even ask

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.590 
with all right RO water you can even ask
the<00:04:58.169> farms<00:04:58.970> they're<00:04:59.970> not<00:05:00.150> going<00:05:00.270> to<00:05:00.330> want<00:05:00.419> to

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
the farms they're not going to want to

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.900 
the farms they're not going to want to
deal<00:05:00.780> with<00:05:01.020> it<00:05:01.169> then<00:05:01.560> they<00:05:01.919> have<00:05:02.100> millions<00:05:02.789> of

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
deal with it then they have millions of

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.029 
deal with it then they have millions of
Tanks<00:05:03.330> they've<00:05:03.750> millions<00:05:04.320> of<00:05:04.470> little<00:05:04.650> sheds

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
Tanks they've millions of little sheds

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:07.400 
Tanks they've millions of little sheds
and<00:05:05.340> they<00:05:05.850> don't<00:05:05.970> want<00:05:06.090> to<00:05:06.300> do<00:05:06.630> RO<00:05:06.990> water

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
and they don't want to do RO water

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.330 
and they don't want to do RO water
changing<00:05:08.070> I<00:05:08.250> mean<00:05:08.850> it's<00:05:09.000> just<00:05:09.090> too<00:05:09.419> much<00:05:10.340> but

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
changing I mean it's just too much but

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.129 
changing I mean it's just too much but
that<00:05:11.550> is<00:05:11.729> your<00:05:11.970> decision<00:05:12.120> because<00:05:12.750> if<00:05:12.930> you

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
that is your decision because if you

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.200 
that is your decision because if you
want<00:05:13.410> RL<00:05:13.740> water<00:05:13.979> it<00:05:14.220> does<00:05:14.430> cost<00:05:14.639> a<00:05:14.760> lot<00:05:15.150> of

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
want RL water it does cost a lot of

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.350 
want RL water it does cost a lot of
money<00:05:15.360> but<00:05:15.630> you<00:05:15.690> really<00:05:16.199> don't<00:05:16.410> need<00:05:16.650> it<00:05:16.710> I

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
money but you really don't need it I

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.260 
money but you really don't need it I
sometimes<00:05:18.360> do<00:05:18.840> it<00:05:18.930> I<00:05:19.050> sometimes<00:05:19.530> still<00:05:19.800> but

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
sometimes do it I sometimes still but

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.560 
sometimes do it I sometimes still but
that's<00:05:21.270> your<00:05:21.509> choice<00:05:22.009> well<00:05:23.300> that's<00:05:24.300> pretty

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570
