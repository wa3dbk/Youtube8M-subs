00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.900
 what if we were not denied 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.310
 what if the customers of thousands of people claim and 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.350
 In fact, having identifiable flying objects has consequences for 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.460
 resist the existence of extraterrestrial spacecraft 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.300
 what if the thousands of people around the world were the ones from 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.170
 their encounters with foreign read that is through friendly contact 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.590
 or abductions 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.530
 in reality, tell the truth 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.970
 What if our governments have long been aware of the presence of ITyX? 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.440
 You know and have known this for more than half a century 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.700
 Those in possession of terrestrial technologies are resisting the potential 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.270
 a change within which our planet is led will trigger 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.949
 could make the choice 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.680
 to the public in the dark 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.399
 with the help of a secret campaign for information cover-up 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.340
 with this campaign something like a chain around the shackles of humanity 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.979
 that would be allowed to prevent us 2 1 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.610
 wholly new levels of consciousness ascend to a new understanding 

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:18.119
 of our own planet and what the universe around us is 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.119
 when this campaign will find its end tomorrow 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.010
 that was nothing 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.660
 "That's one of those historical currents that are not denied 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.479
 the truth will come out and if this happens it will be exclusive 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.430
 once the house is over we will go and complete the twentieth century 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.330
 Reassemble new ones somehow even need to write new ones 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.270
 So go there 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.659
 is the criticism of the period of the last 2000 years of writing new 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.370
 growth 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.079
 this is the biggest story in human history 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:11.849
 The reason is that this is the greatest history of humanity 

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:06.699
 There is nothing new in the field of physics years ago 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:11.119
 the only thing left over is the tour's resignation 

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:12.139
 from Munich 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:15.900
 The world view which is portrayed in this statement emerged 

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:17.420
 renowned scientists 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.589
 such clauses in 1900 

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:23.869
 however, was shattered only five years later than Albert Einstein Rembrandt 

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:27.709
 breaking the sheet issued concerning a special creativity 

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:32.079
 Neuenkirchen claim that currently is currently still in the understanding 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.699
 and thus forced the scientific community to do so 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:39.679
 get a bigger perspective on nature in front of reality 

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:43.609
 open this event to the fundamentalist change of 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.230
 paradigm shift 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.260
 Surprised the scholars of that time immensely, but we stop 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.890
 no difficulties the series of breakthroughs in science with the 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.590
 The emergence of Einstein remains fine right up to the gate of the day 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.359
 Althaus to follow 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:02.059
 we knew that you the earth is a disk 

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:05.490
 we knew that we were the center of the universe 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:06.729
 and we knew 

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:10.559
 a man-made machine heavier than air itself impossible 

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:11.859
 can fly 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.739
 through all stages of human history 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.829
 intellectual instances show things that are not in the context of 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.659
 accepted knowledge 

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:23.499
 to suppress or ridicule 

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:27.599
 the so-called father of modern science the Italian astronomer 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:32.009
 Galileo was even sentenced by the Catholic Church for life 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:36.809
 Under house arrest for putting out a book it is the idea 

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:40.419
 the winning team was not the center of the universe 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:41.680
 supported 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.800
 His work was banned for more than 200 years 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.979
 So much different today has our acceptance in terms of what is in 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.090
 this frame really fits changed 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.740
 maybe there are still concerts within our reality the Viennese 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.879
 need to understand 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:01.119
 if we open our eyes we may realize that something is happening 

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:04.119
 have overlooked 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.309
 r 

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:49.309
 one 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:56.889
 my name is bought 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:00.110
 I worked for the Ministry of Defense within the 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.069
 British government for the period of 20 years most of the time 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:06.919
 In the early nineties I was in charge of her Ueffeln 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:10.879
 op projects responsible the British Ministry of Defense has since the 

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:15.419
 1950s research on Rousseau's sightings operated the number of 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:19.289
 Reports amounts to about 12 thousand within the RAF an active one 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:23.539
 Although from October 9 to 10 when I was employed there in the nineties one was 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:26.539
 Ditty about 200 to 300 he reported directly 

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:32.239
 In May 2008, the British government opened its first one 

00:06:32.239 --> 00:06:35.059
 Blue preliminary reports to the exact not insight 

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:38.729
 for the masses as the Internet this drew an immense public 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:42.569
 Interest and that of the media supervision there were over 20 minutes of downloads 

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:44.680
 made within the first few weeks 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.759
 but people nutmeg followed by many others France Beijing Ireland 

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:53.689
 Denmark Turkey and Brazil Argentina Mexico 

00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:56.970
 despite company law 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.569
 the most amazing stories came to light from Steffen 

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:01.830
 Mischief mischief 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.380
 Landings and extraterrestrial 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.460
 Entities that were seen
