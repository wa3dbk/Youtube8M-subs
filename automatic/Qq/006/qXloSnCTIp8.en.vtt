roots<00:00:26.760> too<00:00:27.029> fast<00:00:27.269> you're<00:00:27.420> going<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.630> need<00:00:28.019> a

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
roots too fast you're going to need a

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.929 
roots too fast you're going to need a
Rubik's<00:00:28.439> Cube<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.650> moves<00:00:29.010> fast<00:00:29.369> right<00:00:29.730> so

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939

it doesn't turn good this here is my old
Rubik's<00:00:38.160> torba<00:00:38.579> which<00:00:39.510> does<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.559> fact<00:00:40.590> turn

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
Rubik's torba which does in fact turn

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.030 
Rubik's torba which does in fact turn
better<00:00:41.750> right<00:00:42.750> but<00:00:43.260> as<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.590> can<00:00:43.680> see<00:00:43.860> it's<00:00:43.980> a

just<00:01:16.520> pry<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:18.119> out<00:01:18.740> alright<00:01:19.790> may<00:01:20.790> take<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.060> bit

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
just pry it out alright may take a bit

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.359 
just pry it out alright may take a bit
of<00:01:21.299> forced<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.750> do<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.049> but<00:01:22.200> trust<00:01:22.470> me<00:01:22.530> chances

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
of forced to do so but trust me chances

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.730 
of forced to do so but trust me chances
are<00:01:23.520> your<00:01:23.729> cube<00:01:24.000> will<00:01:24.090> not<00:01:24.240> break<00:01:24.740> alright

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
are your cube will not break alright

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.740 
are your cube will not break alright
some<00:01:26.340> cubes<00:01:26.670> may<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:26.970> do<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:27.450> at<00:01:27.570> your<00:01:27.659> own

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
some cubes may so do this at your own

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.300 
some cubes may so do this at your own
risk<00:01:27.810> now<00:01:28.380> once<00:01:28.590> you've<00:01:28.710> popped<00:01:28.920> out<00:01:29.100> this

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
risk now once you've popped out this

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.719 
risk now once you've popped out this
piece<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:30.450> can<00:01:30.600> then<00:01:30.750> continue<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.729> fully

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
piece you can then continue to fully

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.109 
piece you can then continue to fully
disassembled<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.390> cube<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.990> then<00:01:35.000> once<00:01:36.000> you

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
disassembled the cube and then once you

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.350 
disassembled the cube and then once you
have<00:01:36.240> done<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.869> can<00:01:36.900> lubricate<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.650> with

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
have done so you can lubricate it with

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.300 
have done so you can lubricate it with
silicone<00:01:39.360> spray<00:01:39.780> do<00:01:40.229> not<00:01:40.439> use<00:01:40.710> vaseline

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
silicone spray do not use vaseline

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.580 
silicone spray do not use vaseline
vaseline<00:01:41.520> gets<00:01:42.509> in<00:01:42.659> your<00:01:42.780> cube<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.259> makes<00:01:43.439> it

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
vaseline gets in your cube and makes it

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.819 
vaseline gets in your cube and makes it
all<00:01:43.820> bad<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:44.850> dusting<00:01:45.450> stuff<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.960> silicone

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
all bad and dusting stuff and silicone

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.200 
all bad and dusting stuff and silicone
keeps<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.369> clean<00:01:47.670> as<00:01:48.000> well<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:49.970> once<00:01:50.970> you've

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
keeps it clean as well so once you've

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.840 
keeps it clean as well so once you've
lubricated<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.439> can<00:01:52.649> reassemble<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.610> I'm

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
lubricated it you can reassemble it I'm

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.240 
lubricated it you can reassemble it I'm
sure<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.869> can<00:01:55.020> figure<00:01:55.229> out<00:01:55.350> how<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.680> yourself

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
sure you can figure out how to yourself

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.920 
sure you can figure out how to yourself
and<00:01:56.490> if<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.780> can't<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.350> might<00:01:58.680> make<00:01:58.860> a

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
and if you can't I might make a

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.429 
and if you can't I might make a
reassembly<00:02:00.930> video<00:02:01.200> tutorial<00:02:02.070> soon<00:02:02.600> now<00:02:03.600> once

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
running from now the next step comes in

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.809 
running from now the next step comes in

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
handy when your top corner is oriented

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.330 
handy when your top corner is oriented
in<00:04:04.000> such<00:04:04.090> a<00:04:04.329> way<00:04:04.569> that<00:04:04.769> be<00:04:05.769> that<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:07.090> white<00:04:07.840> is

in such a way that be that the white is

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.819 
in such a way that be that the white is
facing<00:04:09.340> towards<00:04:09.639> the<00:04:09.819> left<00:04:10.030> so<00:04:10.709> what<00:04:11.709> this

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
facing towards the left so what this

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:13.590 
facing towards the left so what this
means<00:04:12.069> is<00:04:12.190> instead<00:04:12.310> of<00:04:12.519> doing<00:04:12.850> are<00:04:13.060> you<00:04:13.329> r

it<00:04:33.710> will<00:04:33.830> be<00:04:33.949> solved<00:04:34.310> see<00:04:35.830> so<00:04:36.830> I'll<00:04:37.159> show<00:04:37.460> you

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
it will be solved see so I'll show you

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:47.460 
it will be solved see so I'll show you
the<00:04:37.819> comparison<00:04:37.940> this<00:04:42.280> versus<00:04:43.280> this<00:04:46.030> the

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
the comparison this versus this the

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.459 
the comparison this versus this the
figure<00:04:48.470> out<00:04:48.620> for<00:04:48.800> yourself<00:04:48.830> which<00:04:49.250> is<00:04:49.280> quicker

00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:50.469 
figure out for yourself which is quicker

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:54.189 
figure out for yourself which is quicker
all<00:04:51.469> right<00:04:51.620> so<00:04:52.210> what<00:04:53.210> these<00:04:53.419> two<00:04:53.690> shortcuts

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199 
all right so what these two shortcuts

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:55.360 
all right so what these two shortcuts
you<00:04:54.379> should<00:04:54.560> be<00:04:54.710> able<00:04:54.800> to<00:04:54.949> figure<00:04:55.129> out<00:04:55.250> the

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
you should be able to figure out the

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.570 
you should be able to figure out the
other<00:04:55.840> ones<00:04:56.840> yourself<00:04:57.400> now<00:04:58.400> the<00:04:58.460> next

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
other ones yourself now the next

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.029 
other ones yourself now the next
shortcut<00:04:59.389> comes<00:04:59.690> in<00:04:59.840> handy<00:05:00.080> when<00:05:00.440> you<00:05:00.919> are

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 
shortcut comes in handy when you are

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:04.390 
shortcut comes in handy when you are
solving<00:05:01.960> the<00:05:02.960> top<00:05:03.259> cross<00:05:03.620> now<00:05:03.949> if<00:05:04.129> you<00:05:04.250> have

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
solving the top cross now if you have

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.899 
solving the top cross now if you have
the<00:05:04.520> backwards<00:05:04.909> L<00:05:05.289> instead<00:05:06.289> of<00:05:06.319> doing<00:05:06.440> F<00:05:06.949> R<00:05:07.310> u<00:05:07.639> R

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:07.909 
the backwards L instead of doing F R u R

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:12.820 
the backwards L instead of doing F R u R
prime<00:05:08.210> u<00:05:08.389> prime<00:05:08.449> F<00:05:08.840> prime<00:05:09.139> twice<00:05:10.690> you<00:05:11.690> can<00:05:12.020> hold

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
prime u prime F prime twice you can hold

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.890 
prime u prime F prime twice you can hold
the<00:05:12.949> cube<00:05:13.159> so<00:05:13.370> the<00:05:13.490> backwards<00:05:13.969> L<00:05:14.120> is<00:05:14.270> down<00:05:14.479> here

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
the cube so the backwards L is down here

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.700 
the cube so the backwards L is down here
like<00:05:15.440> so<00:05:16.120> enter<00:05:17.120> the<00:05:17.270> first<00:05:17.509> two<00:05:17.840> layers<00:05:18.169> like

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
like so enter the first two layers like

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.939 
like so enter the first two layers like
this<00:05:18.949> so<00:05:19.159> first<00:05:19.430> two<00:05:20.030> layers<00:05:20.389> all<00:05:21.380> you're<00:05:21.770> our

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:21.949 
this so first two layers all you're our

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:25.290 
this so first two layers all you're our
prime<00:05:22.190> u<00:05:22.340> prime<00:05:22.370> first<00:05:23.300> two<00:05:23.419> layers<00:05:23.630> back<00:05:23.900> so

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
prime u prime first two layers back so

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.969 
prime u prime first two layers back so
so<00:05:26.300> it's<00:05:26.630> the<00:05:26.900> same<00:05:26.930> thing<00:05:27.349> except<00:05:27.650> instead<00:05:27.860> of

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 
so it's the same thing except instead of

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:30.519 
so it's the same thing except instead of
turning<00:05:28.190> just<00:05:28.520> the<00:05:28.940> first<00:05:29.210> front<00:05:30.169> layer<00:05:30.380> you

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:30.529 
turning just the first front layer you

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:33.700 
turning just the first front layer you
would<00:05:30.650> turn<00:05:31.099> both<00:05:31.779> now<00:05:32.779> the<00:05:32.870> next<00:05:33.110> step<00:05:33.259> comes

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
would turn both now the next step comes

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.309 
would turn both now the next step comes
in<00:05:33.860> handy<00:05:34.039> when<00:05:34.250> salt<00:05:34.729> when<00:05:35.330> orientate<00:05:35.990> went

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:36.319 
in handy when salt when orientate went

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:38.969 
in handy when salt when orientate went
in<00:05:36.469> the<00:05:36.620> last<00:05:36.830> step<00:05:37.099> when<00:05:37.340> orientating<00:05:38.060> these

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
in the last step when orientating these

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:42.149 
in the last step when orientating these
want<00:05:39.979> these<00:05:40.190> top<00:05:40.460> corners<00:05:40.909> here<00:05:41.180> alright<00:05:41.840> so

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:42.159 
want these top corners here alright so

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:44.769 
want these top corners here alright so
after<00:05:43.159> you<00:05:43.669> flipped<00:05:44.000> over<00:05:44.120> the<00:05:44.240> cube<00:05:44.539> and

00:05:44.769 --> 00:05:44.779 
after you flipped over the cube and

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:46.540 
after you flipped over the cube and
you're<00:05:45.050> about<00:05:45.169> to<00:05:45.229> solve<00:05:45.500> them<00:05:45.740> if<00:05:45.889> the<00:05:46.279> cube

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
you're about to solve them if the cube

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.629 
you're about to solve them if the cube
is<00:05:46.699> if<00:05:47.120> the<00:05:48.110> QB<00:05:48.440> is<00:05:48.529> orientated<00:05:49.009> in<00:05:49.219> such<00:05:49.400> a<00:05:49.430> way

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:49.639 
is if the QB is orientated in such a way

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:51.839 
is if the QB is orientated in such a way
that<00:05:49.669> is<00:05:49.879> pointing<00:05:50.150> to<00:05:50.240> the<00:05:50.330> left<00:05:50.360> you<00:05:51.259> can<00:05:51.440> do

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:51.849 
that is pointing to the left you can do

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:56.499 
that is pointing to the left you can do
if<00:05:52.849> you<00:05:53.690> can<00:05:53.900> do<00:05:54.099> the<00:05:55.099> arguer<00:05:55.940> prime<00:05:56.300> u<00:05:56.479> prime

00:05:56.499 --> 00:05:56.509 
if you can do the arguer prime u prime

00:05:56.509 --> 00:05:58.480 
if you can do the arguer prime u prime
algorithm<00:05:57.199> backwards<00:05:57.620> twice<00:05:57.949> instead<00:05:58.310> of

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
algorithm backwards twice instead of

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.550 
algorithm backwards twice instead of
having<00:05:58.639> to<00:05:58.759> do<00:05:58.940> it<00:05:59.090> the<00:05:59.539> right<00:05:59.569> way<00:05:59.750> for<00:06:00.199> x<00:06:00.440> so

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
having to do it the right way for x so

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.719 
having to do it the right way for x so
i'll<00:06:00.680> show<00:06:00.830> you<00:06:00.919> the<00:06:01.009> comparison<00:06:03.129> that<00:06:05.620> vs

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 
i'll show you the comparison that vs

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:10.959 
i'll show you the comparison that vs
that<00:06:09.069> you<00:06:10.069> guys<00:06:10.279> can<00:06:10.490> figure<00:06:10.669> it<00:06:10.789> out<00:06:10.849> for

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:10.969 
that you guys can figure it out for

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:14.619 
that you guys can figure it out for
yourself<00:06:11.029> i'm<00:06:11.419> sure<00:06:11.599> so<00:06:12.310> you<00:06:13.310> do<00:06:13.460> that<00:06:13.639> and

00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:14.629 
yourself i'm sure so you do that and

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:20.439 
yourself i'm sure so you do that and
