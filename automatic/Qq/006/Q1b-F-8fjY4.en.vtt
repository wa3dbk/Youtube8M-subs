00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 
oh crap button for PvE I like to go

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:26.600 
oh crap button for PvE I like to go
ahead<00:06:24.539> and<00:06:24.929> go<00:06:25.199> and<00:06:25.439> you<00:06:25.619> send<00:06:26.039> it<00:06:26.159> here<00:06:26.369> it

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
ahead and go and you send it here it

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.789

upgrades<00:06:27.029> the<00:06:27.209> range<00:06:27.479> a<00:06:27.749> pretty<00:06:28.110> decent

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:28.799 
upgrades the range a pretty decent

00:06:28.799 --> 00:06:30.439 
upgrades the range a pretty decent
amount<00:06:28.889> and<00:06:29.369> then<00:06:29.579> it<00:06:29.669> also<00:06:29.789> upgrades<00:06:30.329> the

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:30.449 
amount and then it also upgrades the

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:33.079 
amount and then it also upgrades the
accuracy<00:06:31.110> I<00:06:31.259> find<00:06:31.799> that<00:06:31.919> helps<00:06:32.159> at<00:06:32.459> a<00:06:32.639> lot<00:06:33.059> more

00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:33.089 
accuracy I find that helps at a lot more

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:36.229 
accuracy I find that helps at a lot more
in<00:06:33.749> PvE<00:06:34.139> than<00:06:34.559> a<00:06:34.589> dozen<00:06:34.860> PvP<00:06:35.610> and<00:06:35.849> then<00:06:35.999> we<00:06:36.119> have
