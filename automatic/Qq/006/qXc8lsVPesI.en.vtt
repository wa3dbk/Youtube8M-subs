either<00:02:00.670> 40s<00:02:01.180> or<00:02:01.270> 42<00:02:01.600> like<00:02:02.259> so<00:02:02.440> big<00:02:02.649> fat<00:02:02.950> and

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
either 40s or 42 like so big fat and

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.859 
either 40s or 42 like so big fat and
it's<00:02:03.700> just<00:02:04.000> break<00:02:04.240> so<00:02:04.420> you<00:02:04.479> can<00:02:04.690> you<00:02:04.750> know<00:02:04.840> you

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
it's just break so you can you know you

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.780 
it's just break so you can you know you
got<00:02:05.080> plenty<00:02:05.259> of<00:02:05.470> clearance<00:02:05.680> this<00:02:05.890> is<00:02:06.009> that's

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
got plenty of clearance this is that's

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.150 
got plenty of clearance this is that's
right<00:02:07.030> disc<00:02:07.570> allows<00:02:07.930> all<00:02:08.259> these<00:02:08.410> this<00:02:08.890> clear

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
right disc allows all these this clear

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.160 
right disc allows all these this clear
as<00:02:09.310> huh<00:02:09.520> yeah<00:02:09.970> yeah<00:02:10.420> most<00:02:10.690> definitely<00:02:10.869> and

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
as huh yeah yeah most definitely and

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.350 
as huh yeah yeah most definitely and
this<00:02:11.230> has<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.590> new<00:02:11.739> that<00:02:12.190> hope<00:02:12.430> v-twin<00:02:12.970> kind

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
this has the new that hope v-twin kind

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.440 
this has the new that hope v-twin kind
of<00:02:13.450> converter<00:02:13.780> ha<00:02:14.110> yeah<00:02:14.739> it<00:02:15.640> takes<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:16.060> cable

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
of converter ha yeah it takes the cable

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.140 
of converter ha yeah it takes the cable
and<00:02:16.630> turns<00:02:16.870> it<00:02:17.019> into<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:17.670> hydraulic<00:02:18.670> disc<00:02:18.880> set

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
and turns it into a hydraulic disc set

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.900 
and turns it into a hydraulic disc set
up<00:02:19.300> aha<00:02:19.810> so<00:02:20.320> and<00:02:20.650> it<00:02:20.920> actually<00:02:21.070> feels<00:02:21.430> and<00:02:21.730> runs

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
up aha so and it actually feels and runs

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.790 
up aha so and it actually feels and runs
just<00:02:22.239> like<00:02:22.360> you<00:02:22.750> know<00:02:22.840> hydraulic<00:02:23.380> my<00:02:23.530> legs<00:02:23.709> I

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
just like you know hydraulic my legs I

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.070 
just like you know hydraulic my legs I
call<00:02:24.040> it<00:02:24.220> yeah<00:02:24.400> very<00:02:24.850> very<00:02:25.180> similar<00:02:25.600> to<00:02:25.630> yeah

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
call it yeah very very similar to yeah

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.650 
call it yeah very very similar to yeah
yeah<00:02:26.500> hydraulic<00:02:27.010> yeah<00:02:27.130> once<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:27.430> hit<00:02:27.670> there's

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
yeah hydraulic yeah once you hit there's

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.390 
yeah hydraulic yeah once you hit there's
some<00:02:28.810> more<00:02:28.930> modulation<00:02:29.410> yeah<00:02:29.950> oh<00:02:30.130> yeah

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
some more modulation yeah oh yeah

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.750 
some more modulation yeah oh yeah
exactly<00:02:30.640> not<00:02:31.120> like<00:02:31.530> rocking<00:02:32.530> up<00:02:32.709> yeah<00:02:33.010> and<00:02:33.610> you

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
exactly not like rocking up yeah and you

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.340 
exactly not like rocking up yeah and you
don't<00:02:33.970> have<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.239> machinist<00:02:34.690> of<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:34.959> rear<00:02:35.140> brake

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
don't have the machinist of a rear brake

you run a full cable kind of yeah the

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.600 
you run a full cable kind of yeah the
rear<00:02:39.819> brake<00:02:40.030> cable<00:02:40.360> flexes<00:02:40.780> up<00:02:41.050> so<00:02:41.800> and<00:02:42.430> it's

all<00:02:59.829> the<00:02:59.920> way<00:02:59.950> through<00:03:00.310> so<00:03:00.489> you<00:03:00.610> don't<00:03:00.700> have<00:03:00.910> a

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
all the way through so you don't have a

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.600 
all the way through so you don't have a
feed<00:03:01.420> and<00:03:01.450> yeah<00:03:01.900> you<00:03:01.959> you<00:03:02.440> run<00:03:02.620> a<00:03:02.650> tube<00:03:03.370> all<00:03:03.579> the

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
feed and yeah you you run a tube all the

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.039 
feed and yeah you you run a tube all the
way<00:03:03.700> through<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:04.180> braise<00:03:04.360> it<00:03:04.390> on<00:03:04.660> either<00:03:04.780> end

you're trying to get that in the end of

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.449 
you're trying to get that in the end of
the<00:03:14.170> cable<00:03:14.320> down<00:03:14.590> there<00:03:14.829> is<00:03:14.950> a<00:03:15.010> 10<00:03:15.220> minute

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
the cable down there is a 10 minute

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.330 
the cable down there is a 10 minute
video<00:03:15.579> on<00:03:16.209> how<00:03:16.360> to<00:03:16.390> feed<00:03:16.799> on<00:03:17.799> how<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.040> feed<00:03:18.250> the

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
video on how to feed on how to feed the

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.430 
video on how to feed on how to feed the
cable<00:03:18.459> yeah<00:03:18.970> yeah<00:03:19.329> I<00:03:19.600> viewed<00:03:19.959> it<00:03:20.049> and<00:03:20.260> then<00:03:20.380> I

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
cable yeah yeah I viewed it and then I

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.340 
cable yeah yeah I viewed it and then I
said<00:03:20.590> okay<00:03:20.860> there's<00:03:21.070> Mike<00:03:21.190> single<00:03:21.489> speed<00:03:21.670> yeah

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
said okay there's Mike single speed yeah

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.220 
said okay there's Mike single speed yeah
yeah<00:03:23.350> take<00:03:23.709> it<00:03:23.829> off<00:03:23.980> yeah<00:03:24.390> so<00:03:25.390> ya<00:03:25.570> later<00:03:25.840> yeah<00:03:26.200> a

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
yeah take it off yeah so ya later yeah a

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.930 
yeah take it off yeah so ya later yeah a
true<00:03:26.560> way<00:03:26.709> to<00:03:26.739> do<00:03:27.010> internal<00:03:27.340> routing<00:03:27.609> is<00:03:27.820> to

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
true way to do internal routing is to

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.000 
true way to do internal routing is to
run<00:03:28.120> a<00:03:28.150> you<00:03:28.900> know<00:03:29.019> full<00:03:29.290> internal<00:03:29.680> side

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
run a you know full internal side

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.860 
run a you know full internal side
housing<00:03:30.549> what<00:03:30.700> about<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:31.000> hydraulic<00:03:31.570> cable

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
housing what about the hydraulic cable

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.960 
housing what about the hydraulic cable
have<00:03:31.989> you<00:03:32.109> get<00:03:32.230> that<00:03:32.350> too<00:03:32.530> I<00:03:32.769> broke<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:33.820> line

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
have you get that too I broke the line

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.580 
have you get that too I broke the line
and<00:03:34.239> actually<00:03:34.540> put<00:03:34.690> it<00:03:34.750> through<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.049> you<00:03:35.470> know

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
and actually put it through the you know

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.930 
and actually put it through the you know
through<00:03:35.769> the<00:03:35.890> frame<00:03:36.070> it<00:03:36.340> comes<00:03:36.549> through<00:03:36.790> and

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
through the frame it comes through and

so so there's a future you think in this

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.750 
so so there's a future you think in this
kind<00:03:49.840> of<00:03:49.900> bike<00:03:50.079> this<00:03:50.409> breaks<00:03:50.739> and<00:03:51.010> big<00:03:51.189> tire<00:03:51.430> oh

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
kind of bike this breaks and big tire oh

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.030 
kind of bike this breaks and big tire oh
definitely<00:03:52.269> I<00:03:52.569> think<00:03:52.659> that<00:03:53.140> ma<00:03:53.379> I<00:03:53.739> mean<00:03:54.010> I

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
definitely I think that ma I mean I

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.729 
definitely I think that ma I mean I
think<00:03:54.159> the<00:03:54.489> road<00:03:55.359> will<00:03:55.629> slowly<00:03:55.900> move<00:03:56.049> over<00:03:56.530> to

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
think the road will slowly move over to

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.520 
think the road will slowly move over to

there's less little stores there but
it's<00:05:02.050> more<00:05:02.229> about<00:05:02.380> the<00:05:02.620> ride<00:05:02.770> in<00:05:02.919> the<00:05:03.010> distance

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
it's more about the ride in the distance

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.480
