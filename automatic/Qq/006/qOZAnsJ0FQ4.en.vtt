00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
highlight of this review where we're

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.530 
highlight of this review where we're
going<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.369> spend<00:01:29.610> most<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.909> our<00:01:30.030> time<00:01:30.090> it's

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
going to spend most of our time it's

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.870 
going to spend most of our time it's
worth<00:01:31.140> noting<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.920> pre<00:01:32.189> tube<00:01:32.460> features

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
worth noting that the pre tube features

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.359 
worth noting that the pre tube features
a<00:01:32.909> 5<00:01:33.240> megapixel<00:01:33.450> camera<00:01:34.320> which<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.979> boost

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
a 5 megapixel camera which is a boost

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.600 
a 5 megapixel camera which is a boost
from<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.329> pre<00:01:36.900> plus<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.950> original<00:01:38.100> pre

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
from the pre plus and the original pre

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.460 
from the pre plus and the original pre
we<00:01:39.000> can<00:01:39.180> talk<00:01:39.299> about<00:01:39.450> image<00:01:39.810> quality<00:01:40.020> now

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
we can talk about image quality now

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.499 
we can talk about image quality now
because<00:01:41.040> it's<00:01:41.220> going<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.579> be<00:01:41.700> short<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.210> sweet

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
because it's going to be short and sweet

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.200 
because it's going to be short and sweet
to<00:01:42.689> get<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.960> out<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.229> way<00:01:43.700> it<00:01:44.700> was<00:01:44.850> probably

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
to get it out of the way it was probably

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.240 
to get it out of the way it was probably
one<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.509> most<00:01:45.630> disappointing<00:01:46.259> image
