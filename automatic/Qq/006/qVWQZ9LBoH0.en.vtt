00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.280
 beams 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.300
 follow the recommendations of the 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.670
 the required thickness in your 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.220
 work on external walls 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.789
 remember to continue pipelines 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.789
 air 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:39.220
 case for the beam of 20 centimeters 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.380
 only accommodates cashier after the 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:47.350
 channel of the last row is 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:54.489
 concrete grout the parties with mass 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:57.180
 to avoid run- off, 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.180
 hardware 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.700
 being lagen we can conquer the drops 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.700
 next to the beam at the same time 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.869
 within the possibilities another option 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.290
 for load reduction is the beam against 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.290
 list 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:35.070
 fixing only half of the bricks with 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.520
 glue on the outer walls camouflaging the 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.520
 life 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.790
 covers less weight load 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:58.480
 or scissors may support only 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:59.560
 on the concrete of the mooring channel 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.320
 of scissors 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.320
 sum the hardware in the intended position
