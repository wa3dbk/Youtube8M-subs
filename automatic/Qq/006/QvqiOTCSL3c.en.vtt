pull<00:01:07.020> off<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.320> parish<00:01:07.650> trap<00:01:07.979> but<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.220> sub<00:01:08.580> here

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
pull off the parish trap but I sub here

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.700 
pull off the parish trap but I sub here
because<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.180> figured<00:01:09.540> he'd<00:01:09.689> switch<00:01:10.049> out<00:01:10.290> for<00:01:10.619> my

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
because I figured he'd switch out for my

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.530 
because I figured he'd switch out for my
mean<00:01:10.920> look<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.640> know<00:01:11.700> he's<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.909> houndoom<00:01:12.390> and

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
mean look and I know he's a houndoom and

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.760 
mean look and I know he's a houndoom and
he'd<00:01:12.630> probably<00:01:12.840> just<00:01:12.990> switch<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.530> thing

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
he'd probably just switch to that thing

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.260 
he'd probably just switch to that thing
so<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.130> way<00:01:14.280> i<00:01:14.310> could<00:01:14.490> get<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.610> sub<00:01:14.880> up<00:01:15.060> and

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
so this way i could get a sub up and

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.359 
so this way i could get a sub up and
then<00:01:15.689> i<00:01:15.720> can<00:01:15.900> mean<00:01:16.080> look<00:01:16.229> as<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.380> houndoom<00:01:17.159> from

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
then i can mean look as a houndoom from

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.020 
then i can mean look as a houndoom from
there<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> pair<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.000> sawing<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.360> from<00:01:18.509> there<00:01:18.750> but

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
there a pair of sawing it from there but

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.420 
there a pair of sawing it from there but
he<00:01:21.030> ends<00:01:21.240> up<00:01:21.299> staying<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.680> really<00:01:23.280> don't

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
he ends up staying in and I really don't

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.160 
he ends up staying in and I really don't
know<00:01:23.490> why<00:01:23.700> but<00:01:23.729> now<00:01:24.030> he's<00:01:24.180> trapped<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:24.990> got

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
know why but now he's trapped and I got

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.510 
know why but now he's trapped and I got
him<00:01:25.320> with<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.470> mean<00:01:25.710> look<00:01:25.920> he's<00:01:26.159> not<00:01:26.340> going

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520
