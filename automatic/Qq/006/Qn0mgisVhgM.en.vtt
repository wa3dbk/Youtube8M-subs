00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
to it listen to this the SM is made up

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.919 
to it listen to this the SM is made up
by<00:02:00.049> Committees<00:02:00.679> of<00:02:00.759> men<00:02:01.759> who<00:02:02.479> have<00:02:02.689> political

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
by Committees of men who have political

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:05.169 
by Committees of men who have political
opinion<00:02:03.590> and<00:02:03.770> women<00:02:04.069> too<00:02:04.250> who<00:02:04.459> have<00:02:04.580> biases

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
and political opinions and so there

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.320 
and political opinions and so there
isn't<00:02:09.319> nearly<00:02:09.709> as<00:02:09.920> much<00:02:10.099> science<00:02:10.580> in<00:02:10.759> DSM<00:02:11.180> as

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330

there ought to be like in the previous
one<00:02:12.709> people<00:02:12.980> had<00:02:13.099> a<00:02:13.130> meeting<00:02:13.400> in<00:02:13.459> the<00:02:13.519> bathroom

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
one people had a meeting in the bathroom

one people had a meeting in the bathroom
and<00:02:14.060> they<00:02:14.120> decided<00:02:14.510> that<00:02:14.599> something<00:02:14.840> should

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:15.109 
and they decided that something should

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:16.539 
and they decided that something should
be<00:02:15.200> in<00:02:15.290> there<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:15.709> then<00:02:15.829> they<00:02:15.950> point<00:02:16.160> would<00:02:16.400> go

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
be in there and then they point would go

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:17.620 
be in there and then they point would go
and<00:02:16.700> propose<00:02:16.940> it<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.239> the<00:02:17.329> whole<00:02:17.450> committee

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
and propose it to the whole committee

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.930 
and propose it to the whole committee
have<00:02:17.900> this<00:02:18.109> kind<00:02:18.440> of<00:02:18.590> lumping<00:02:19.160> together<00:02:19.370> of
