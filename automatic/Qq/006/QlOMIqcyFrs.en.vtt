00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:08.710
 Life is a digging of Nanjing jp is a new true that can be operated intuitively today 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:13.330
 I would like to introduce the clear of management application 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:17.560
 I really saw it-I can't understand it unless I see it 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.220
 It is a pet app, but there are several lists like this when you open this list 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.600
 I will 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:24.320
 Click here to for example the construction work in 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.620
 And it is lined with the task at fart When you open 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:31.030
 Well this is correct 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:34.180
 From top to bottom in this way you can change the order doing intuitive way by dragging 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:40.570
 The color gradually fades towards 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:45.410
 It is such a sequence that is arranged from high to low priority 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:51.560
 If you want to add a task to the top, this screen 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:52.130
 If you do so, the top will make the head a new task, so something appropriate 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.350
 Add 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:01:00.400
 Naturally , if you want to add something to the bottom of the Japanese button , tap here 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.520
 Then again this way 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:08.900
 Can be added 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:11.659
 Then use two fingers if you want to add a task between this second and third 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:17.159
 In the form of say to extend 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:22.070
 You can still add in the task when finished 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:25.880
 And a swipe to the right to delete itself the task 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.830
 Operate in the form of swipe to the left 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.110
 If you want to go back to the list again with two fingers 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.170
 If you close it and you can go back to it 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.400
 It is an application that says 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.280
 There is only one device like a shortcut, though 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.720
 If you want to add a lot of tasks 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:49.480
 8 For example 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:56.890
 Head will do the task here and leave this screen without pressing Finish here 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:58.260
 In order not to hide the keyboard, you can pull it sideways without pressing Finish and one more + 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:03.900
 can do 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:09.300
 When the keyboard disappears and the original screen is returned to the completed cycle when another one can be taken out 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:14.240
 So when you want to add more sighs to a date, don't settle for it like this 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:16.849
 A lot of and get along with the reduction pulled down to add on and on 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.000
 You can add tasks 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.000
 so 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.480
 In the form of 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.400
 Apps that can be operated intuitively 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.400
 It was clear
