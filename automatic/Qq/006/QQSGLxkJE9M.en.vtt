hoping<00:02:15.770> it<00:02:15.920> translates<00:02:16.640> really<00:02:17.060> nicely<00:02:17.270> into

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
hoping it translates really nicely into

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.520 
hoping it translates really nicely into
the<00:02:18.440> small<00:02:18.890> screen<00:02:19.250> of<00:02:19.430> this<00:02:19.760> console<00:02:20.350> from<00:02:21.350> my

the small screen of this console from my
earlier<00:02:22.010> look<00:02:22.190> at<00:02:22.280> this

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
earlier look at this

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.730 
earlier look at this
the<00:02:22.820> colours<00:02:23.240> are<00:02:23.270> absolutely<00:02:23.990> fantastic

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
the colours are absolutely fantastic

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.960

let's take a look

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.620 
let's take a look
load<00:02:26.750> times<00:02:27.050> seem<00:02:27.470> to<00:02:27.709> be<00:02:27.940> fairly<00:02:28.940> long<00:02:29.330> on

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
load times seem to be fairly long on

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.990 
load times seem to be fairly long on
this<00:02:30.080> game<00:02:30.350> I<00:02:30.620> was<00:02:30.980> hoping<00:02:31.430> it<00:02:31.550> would<00:02:31.640> be<00:02:31.700> a

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
this game I was hoping it would be a

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.940 
this game I was hoping it would be a
little<00:02:32.360> bit<00:02:32.450> quicker<00:02:32.660> because<00:02:33.350> we<00:02:33.590> all<00:02:33.740> hate

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
little bit quicker because we all hate

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.350 
little bit quicker because we all hate
the<00:02:33.980> loading<00:02:34.430> screens<00:02:34.850> while<00:02:35.090> we're<00:02:35.270> doing

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.199 

and<00:03:28.530> we<00:03:28.739> can<00:03:28.920> pick<00:03:29.159> up<00:03:29.280> power-ups<00:03:29.790> as<00:03:29.940> we<00:03:30.060> go

and we can pick up power-ups as we go

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.520 
and we can pick up power-ups as we go
round<00:03:30.450> we<00:03:30.780> can<00:03:30.810> also<00:03:32.810> try<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:33.989> avoid<00:03:34.230> this

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
round we can also try and avoid this

round we can also try and avoid this
incoming<00:03:35.040> missile<00:03:35.519> if<00:03:35.760> we<00:03:36.060> can<00:03:36.440> which<00:03:37.440> I<00:03:37.590> think

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
incoming missile if we can which I think

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.570 
incoming missile if we can which I think
we<00:03:38.010> did<00:03:38.220> very<00:03:39.140> lucky<00:03:40.140> there<00:03:40.319> and<00:03:40.980> we're<00:03:41.400> on<00:03:41.549> our

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
we did very lucky there and we're on our

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.780 
we did very lucky there and we're on our
way<00:03:41.760> to<00:03:42.920> hopefully<00:03:43.920> take<00:03:44.430> over<00:03:44.760> somebody

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
way to hopefully take over somebody

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.180 
way to hopefully take over somebody
we've<00:03:47.790> got<00:03:47.970> a<00:03:48.000> power<00:03:48.299> up<00:03:48.510> here<00:03:48.750> so<00:03:49.709> we<00:03:49.829> can<00:03:49.980> tap

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
we've got a power up here so we can tap

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:57.650 
we've got a power up here so we can tap
on<00:03:50.220> that<00:03:50.370> to<00:03:50.730> use<00:03:50.879> the<00:03:51.060> power<00:03:51.269> up<00:03:56.480> and<00:03:57.480> it's

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
on that to use the power up and it's

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.539 
on that to use the power up and it's
sort<00:03:57.870> of<00:03:57.959> autocorrects<00:03:59.010> where<00:03:59.370> you're

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
sort of autocorrects where you're

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.190 
sort of autocorrects where you're
driving<00:04:00.120> a<00:04:00.180> lot<00:04:00.329> of<00:04:00.360> the<00:04:00.510> time<00:04:00.720> so<00:04:00.750> if<00:04:01.049> you're

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
driving a lot of the time so if you're

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.949 
driving a lot of the time so if you're
if<00:04:01.349> you're<00:04:01.379> gonna<00:04:01.680> sort<00:04:02.519> of<00:04:02.609> skid<00:04:03.030> off<00:04:03.239> of<00:04:03.840> the

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
if you're gonna sort of skid off of the

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.349 
if you're gonna sort of skid off of the
track<00:04:04.290> it<00:04:04.590> normally<00:04:04.980> put<00:04:05.160> you<00:04:05.340> back<00:04:05.549> on<00:04:05.609> target

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
track it normally put you back on target

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:12.050 
track it normally put you back on target
it's<00:04:06.540> quite<00:04:06.780> forgiving<00:04:07.319> in<00:04:07.709> that<00:04:08.430> way<00:04:10.849> so<00:04:11.849> here

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
it's quite forgiving in that way so here

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.690 
it's quite forgiving in that way so here
we<00:04:12.180> go<00:04:12.299> we're<00:04:12.540> still<00:04:12.750> on<00:04:12.870> lap<00:04:13.079> number<00:04:13.290> one<00:04:13.700> but

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
we go we're still on lap number one but

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.860 
we go we're still on lap number one but
we're<00:04:14.970> in<00:04:15.660> fourth<00:04:16.139> place<00:04:16.350> as<00:04:16.739> expected

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
we're in fourth place as expected

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.180 
we're in fourth place as expected
I've<00:04:18.870> only<00:04:19.049> played<00:04:19.260> this<00:04:19.500> a<00:04:19.530> couple<00:04:19.889> of<00:04:19.979> times

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
I've only played this a couple of times

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.090

avoid<00:04:46.480> that<00:04:47.100> we<00:04:48.100> really<00:04:48.550> do<00:04:48.670> need<00:04:48.880> to<00:04:48.940> do<00:04:49.420> some

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
avoid that we really do need to do some

00:04:49.660 --> 00:05:00.209 
avoid that we really do need to do some
catching<00:04:49.870> up

00:05:00.209 --> 00:05:00.219 

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:02.549 

not<00:05:00.789> sure<00:05:01.029> what<00:05:01.270> those<00:05:01.419> landing<00:05:02.080> pad<00:05:02.289> store<00:05:02.529> I

00:05:02.549 --> 00:05:02.559 
not sure what those landing pad store I

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:04.049 
not sure what those landing pad store I
think<00:05:02.770> they're<00:05:02.919> hiding<00:05:03.429> things<00:05:03.639> the<00:05:03.909> little

00:05:04.049 --> 00:05:04.059 
think they're hiding things the little

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:07.139 
think they're hiding things the little
plus<00:05:04.360> signs<00:05:04.709> we've<00:05:05.709> got<00:05:05.860> another<00:05:06.159> jump<00:05:06.789> start

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:07.149 
plus signs we've got another jump start

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:08.909 
plus signs we've got another jump start
power<00:05:07.419> up<00:05:07.599> here<00:05:07.839> so<00:05:08.050> let's<00:05:08.169> try<00:05:08.409> using<00:05:08.619> this

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
power up here so let's try using this

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.899 
power up here so let's try using this
when<00:05:09.249> we<00:05:09.339> land<00:05:10.830> hasn't<00:05:11.830> done<00:05:12.219> a<00:05:12.249> lot<00:05:12.669> it's

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:12.909 
when we land hasn't done a lot it's

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:15.719 
when we land hasn't done a lot it's
given<00:05:13.179> us<00:05:13.269> a<00:05:13.389> nice<00:05:13.539> boost<00:05:13.929> of<00:05:14.199> speed<00:05:14.729> and

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
given us a nice boost of speed and

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:17.999 
given us a nice boost of speed and
that's<00:05:15.879> about<00:05:16.029> it<00:05:16.389> we've<00:05:17.229> also<00:05:17.349> got<00:05:17.800> our

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:18.009 
that's about it we've also got our

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:20.309 
that's about it we've also got our
little<00:05:18.819> missile<00:05:19.300> thing<00:05:19.629> here<00:05:19.839> as<00:05:19.959> well<00:05:20.110> so

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:20.319 
little missile thing here as well so

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:21.779 
little missile thing here as well so
let's<00:05:20.439> see<00:05:20.619> if<00:05:20.679> we<00:05:20.739> can<00:05:20.979> try<00:05:21.219> and<00:05:21.249> take<00:05:21.550> out

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
let's see if we can try and take out

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:25.559 
let's see if we can try and take out
somebody<00:05:23.189> well<00:05:24.189> we've<00:05:24.669> not<00:05:24.939> go<00:05:25.119> enough<00:05:25.330> time

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:25.569 
somebody well we've not go enough time

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:27.449 
somebody well we've not go enough time
to<00:05:25.749> do<00:05:25.869> that<00:05:26.050> we<00:05:26.199> finished<00:05:26.529> fourth<00:05:26.860> on<00:05:27.069> that<00:05:27.249> go

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:27.459 
to do that we finished fourth on that go

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:30.089 
to do that we finished fourth on that go
as<00:05:28.029> I<00:05:28.209> say<00:05:28.360> it<00:05:28.479> one<00:05:28.929> of<00:05:29.080> the<00:05:29.139> first<00:05:29.379> full<00:05:29.679> races

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:30.099 
as I say it one of the first full races

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:32.939 
as I say it one of the first full races
I've<00:05:30.249> completed<00:05:30.669> the<00:05:31.629> graphics<00:05:32.229> on<00:05:32.529> this

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:32.949 
I've completed the graphics on this

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:35.850 
I've completed the graphics on this
really<00:05:33.490> nice<00:05:33.639> I<00:05:34.059> do<00:05:34.749> like<00:05:35.080> the<00:05:35.199> graphics<00:05:35.589> a<00:05:35.679> lot

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
really nice I do like the graphics a lot

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.639 
really nice I do like the graphics a lot
the<00:05:36.490> soundtrack<00:05:37.149> little<00:05:37.839> bit<00:05:37.959> irritating<00:05:38.529> at

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:38.649 
the soundtrack little bit irritating at

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:40.469 
the soundtrack little bit irritating at
times<00:05:38.679> and<00:05:39.189> it's<00:05:39.580> also<00:05:39.759> a<00:05:39.909> little<00:05:40.029> bit<00:05:40.149> laggy

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
times and it's also a little bit laggy

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.779 
times and it's also a little bit laggy
but<00:05:41.110> hopefully<00:05:41.679> they'll<00:05:42.009> have<00:05:42.129> optimized<00:05:42.580> the

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
but hopefully they'll have optimized the

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:44.759 
but hopefully they'll have optimized the
code<00:05:43.029> by<00:05:43.449> the<00:05:43.479> time<00:05:43.809> this<00:05:43.959> comes<00:05:44.229> out<00:05:44.379> good<00:05:44.679> and

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:44.769 
code by the time this comes out good and

00:05:44.769 --> 00:05:47.639 
code by the time this comes out good and
proper<00:05:45.119> so<00:05:46.119> this<00:05:46.240> was<00:05:46.419> ModNation<00:05:46.809> racers<00:05:46.839> on

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:47.649 
proper so this was ModNation racers on

00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:50.219 
proper so this was ModNation racers on
