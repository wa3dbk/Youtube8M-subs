and it just it stays like that and then

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.270 
and it just it stays like that and then
throughout<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.440> day<00:02:28.530> obviously<00:02:29.010> it's<00:02:29.130> not

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
throughout the day obviously it's not

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.340

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
but it still looks really pretty really

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.000 
but it still looks really pretty really
natural<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.600> then<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.110> might<00:02:34.320> at<00:02:34.440> pin<00:02:34.650> curl<00:02:34.890> it

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
earlier a little bit fuller and it's

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.140 
earlier a little bit fuller and it's
just<00:03:16.110> not<00:03:16.709> that<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:17.070> hair<00:03:17.250> itself<00:03:17.580> was<00:03:17.820> thin

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
just not that the hair itself was thin

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.300 
just not that the hair itself was thin
there<00:03:18.510> just<00:03:18.840> isn't<00:03:19.080> enough<00:03:19.410> hair<00:03:19.890> on<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.160> wig

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
there just isn't enough hair on the wig

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.680 
there just isn't enough hair on the wig
for<00:03:20.519> me<00:03:20.549> if<00:03:20.850> that<00:03:21.000> makes<00:03:21.180> sense<00:03:21.209> like<00:03:21.480> it's

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
for me if that makes sense like it's

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.110 
for me if that makes sense like it's
just<00:03:21.870> not<00:03:22.830> not<00:03:23.100> dense<00:03:23.340> enough<00:03:23.459> for<00:03:23.730> me<00:03:23.790> I<00:03:23.820> like

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
just not not dense enough for me I like

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.970 
just not not dense enough for me I like
it<00:03:24.269> to<00:03:24.390> be<00:03:24.420> like<00:03:24.720> super<00:03:25.260> full<00:03:25.410> especially

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
it to be like super full especially

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.680 
it to be like super full especially
because<00:03:26.100> I<00:03:26.250> stall<00:03:26.880> them<00:03:27.030> a<00:03:27.060> lot<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.450> you<00:03:27.660> know

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
because I stall them a lot and you know

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.750 
because I stall them a lot and you know
due<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.560> just<00:03:28.769> normal<00:03:28.950> wear<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:29.250> tear<00:03:29.489> the

due to just normal wear and tear the

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.150 
due to just normal wear and tear the
hair<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.330> winds<00:03:30.510> will<00:03:30.690> start<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:30.900> shed<00:03:31.200> and<00:03:31.650> I

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
hair the winds will start to shed and I

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.229 
hair the winds will start to shed and I
just<00:03:32.400> don't<00:03:32.580> want<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:32.790> be<00:03:32.880> put<00:03:33.030> in<00:03:33.090> a<00:03:33.150> situation

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
just don't want to be put in a situation

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.420 
just don't want to be put in a situation
where<00:03:33.720> this<00:03:33.900> starts<00:03:34.590> shedding<00:03:34.980> super<00:03:35.250> fast

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
where this starts shedding super fast

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.510 
where this starts shedding super fast
hopefully<00:03:35.790> there's<00:03:35.970> no<00:03:36.120> issues

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520

just don't want to be put in a situation

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.250 
just don't want to be put in a situation
where<00:03:40.030> a<00:03:40.060> month<00:03:40.270> or<00:03:40.420> two<00:03:40.540> from<00:03:40.690> now<00:03:40.720> it<00:03:41.020> looks

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
where a month or two from now it looks

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.960 
where a month or two from now it looks
like<00:03:41.530> all<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.800> years<00:03:41.950> gone<00:03:42.160> so<00:03:42.550> I<00:03:42.730> don't<00:03:42.760> know

again and it's gonna be a little bit

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.620 
again and it's gonna be a little bit
different<00:04:30.460> from<00:04:30.610> what<00:04:30.850> I've<00:04:30.940> done<00:04:31.120> with<00:04:31.450> any

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
different from what I've done with any

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.540 
different from what I've done with any
of<00:04:31.750> my<00:04:31.810> wave<00:04:32.020> so<00:04:32.260> I'm<00:04:32.410> excited<00:04:32.770> to<00:04:33.250> show<00:04:33.490> you

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
of my wave so I'm excited to show you

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.790 
of my wave so I'm excited to show you
guys<00:04:33.760> how<00:04:33.910> I'm<00:04:34.060> gonna<00:04:34.180> release<00:04:34.750> them<00:04:35.230> but<00:04:35.530> yeah

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
guys how I'm gonna release them but yeah

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.990 
guys how I'm gonna release them but yeah
I<00:04:35.830> think<00:04:35.950> I'm<00:04:36.190> gonna<00:04:36.280> be<00:04:36.460> curling<00:04:36.730> this<00:04:36.880> one

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
I think I'm gonna be curling this one

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.970 
I think I'm gonna be curling this one
more<00:04:37.120> often<00:04:37.360> until<00:04:37.660> I<00:04:37.690> do<00:04:37.810> cut<00:04:38.110> it<00:04:38.230> simply

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
more often until I do cut it simply

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.170 
more often until I do cut it simply
because<00:04:39.190> it<00:04:39.340> is<00:04:39.430> a<00:04:39.460> little<00:04:39.610> bit<00:04:39.760> on<00:04:39.880> the<00:04:39.970> thin

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
because it is a little bit on the thin

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.520 
because it is a little bit on the thin
side<00:04:40.390> and<00:04:40.750> I

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
side and I

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.740 
side and I
I<00:04:41.860> definitely<00:04:42.190> weather<00:04:42.730> my<00:04:43.300> hair's<00:04:43.510> weren't

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
I definitely weather my hair's weren't

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:44.970

straight<00:04:43.990> or<00:04:44.110> curly<00:04:44.290> I<00:04:44.500> definitely<00:04:44.830> have<00:04:44.920> to

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
straight or curly I definitely have to

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.500 
straight or curly I definitely have to
add<00:04:45.040> some<00:04:45.190> volume<00:04:45.310> so<00:04:45.700> that<00:04:45.730> prompts<00:04:46.330> me<00:04:46.480> to

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
add some volume so that prompts me to

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.940 
add some volume so that prompts me to
curl<00:04:46.840> this<00:04:46.960> more<00:04:47.110> frequently<00:04:47.500> other<00:04:47.740> than

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950
