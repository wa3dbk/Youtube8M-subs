you're<00:01:13.920> pretty<00:01:14.159> solid<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.700> fact<00:01:14.939> if<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.180> go

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
you're pretty solid in fact if you go

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.560 
you're pretty solid in fact if you go

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
get pretty good speeds but the problem

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.090 
get pretty good speeds but the problem
is<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.729> their<00:01:21.330> 4g<00:01:22.140> LTE<00:01:22.409> coverage<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:22.830> is

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
is that their 4g LTE coverage just is

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.620 
is that their 4g LTE coverage just is

what<00:02:27.450> I<00:02:27.480> recommend<00:02:27.630> doing<00:02:28.080> is<00:02:28.350> borrowing<00:02:28.770> a

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
what I recommend doing is borrowing a

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.180 
what I recommend doing is borrowing a
friend's<00:02:29.280> phone<00:02:29.460> or<00:02:29.840> if<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:31.050> do<00:02:31.230> buy<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.830> phone

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190

thing about spring thaw is it's the only

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.370 
thing about spring thaw is it's the only
carrier<00:04:38.150> that's<00:04:38.360> often<00:04:38.780> a<00:04:38.840> truly<00:04:39.230> unlimited
