take one of those
I<00:02:52.450> guess<00:02:53.080> that's<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.350> most<00:02:53.500> basically<00:02:54.010> sets

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
I guess that's the most basically sets

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:01.170 
I guess that's the most basically sets
you<00:02:55.510> take<00:02:55.780> one<00:02:55.930> of<00:02:56.020> those<00:02:56.110> to<00:02:56.350> get<00:03:00.090> one<00:03:01.090> of

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
you take one of those to get one of

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.979 
you take one of those to get one of
these<00:03:01.300> pieces<00:03:02.100> and<00:03:03.180> then<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.300> stud<00:03:04.600> you<00:03:04.780> stick

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
these pieces and then the stud you stick

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.100 
these pieces and then the stud you stick
it<00:03:05.110> on<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.320> end<00:03:05.350> then<00:03:06.160> lift<00:03:06.550> this<00:03:06.670> piece<00:03:07.110> you

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
it on the end then lift this piece you

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:17.040 
it on the end then lift this piece you
stick<00:03:08.380> this<00:03:08.970> one<00:03:12.120> all<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.330> way<00:03:13.420> down<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:16.090> then

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
stick this one all the way down and then

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.720 
stick this one all the way down and then
you<00:03:17.140> do<00:03:17.290> that<00:03:17.470> twice<00:03:19.170> then<00:03:20.170> you<00:03:20.410> stick<00:03:20.739> it<00:03:20.920> you

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
you do that twice then you stick it you

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
you do that twice then you stick it you
might<00:03:21.880> want<00:03:22.060> to<00:03:22.090> do<00:03:22.239> this<00:03:22.390> like<00:03:22.860> together<00:03:24.750> you

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
might want to do this like together you

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.789 
might want to do this like together you
will<00:03:25.870> put<00:03:26.170> this<00:03:26.380> in<00:03:27.720> here<00:03:28.720> like<00:03:28.930> this<00:03:29.560> and<00:03:30.420> then

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
will put this in here like this and then

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.600 
will put this in here like this and then
take<00:03:32.799> one<00:03:32.980> of<00:03:33.070> your<00:03:33.540> one<00:03:34.540> of<00:03:34.570> these<00:03:35.459> let's<00:03:36.459> see

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
take one of your one of these let's see

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:37.949 
take one of your one of these let's see
how<00:03:36.700> there's<00:03:36.940> a<00:03:37.000> little<00:03:37.030> nub<00:03:37.420> sticking<00:03:37.450> out

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
how there's a little nub sticking out

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:45.960 
how there's a little nub sticking out
right<00:03:37.989> there<00:03:38.970> you<00:03:39.970> take<00:03:40.209> this<00:03:42.780> one<00:03:43.780> you<00:03:44.970> take

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
right there you take this one you take

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.190 
right there you take this one you take
one<00:03:46.330> of<00:03:46.360> the<00:03:46.510> ones<00:03:46.690> that<00:03:48.690> you<00:03:49.690> can<00:03:49.870> fit<00:03:50.080> on

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200

one of the ones that you can fit on
there<00:03:50.410> and<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:52.060> push<00:03:52.750> it<00:03:52.780> on<00:03:55.049> so<00:03:56.049> it's<00:03:56.170> like

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
there and you push it on so it's like

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.400 
there and you push it on so it's like
that<00:03:56.850> then<00:03:57.850> we<00:03:58.030> repeat<00:03:58.239> with<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:58.480> other<00:03:58.600> side

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.960 

I'll<00:04:02.410> put<00:04:02.620> it<00:04:02.709> down<00:04:02.739> so<00:04:03.070> I<00:04:03.100> can<00:04:03.160> do<00:04:03.670> this<00:04:03.820> better

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
I'll put it down so I can do this better

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.890 
I'll put it down so I can do this better
and<00:04:04.660> you<00:04:04.840> stick<00:04:05.110> it<00:04:05.200> like<00:04:05.230> this<00:04:06.660> you<00:04:07.660> do<00:04:07.810> the

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
and you stick it like this you do the

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.839 
and you stick it like this you do the
same<00:04:08.080> thing

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
same thing

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:18.110 
same thing
a<00:04:10.109> lot<00:04:11.109> of<00:04:11.140> seconds<00:04:13.230> and<00:04:14.230> you<00:04:14.319> stick<00:04:14.560> it<00:04:14.590> on<00:04:16.590> um

bottom the two studs you have on the
bottom<00:05:47.940> you<00:05:48.940> put<00:05:49.150> it<00:05:49.240> on<00:05:49.330> like<00:05:49.479> this<00:05:50.400> so<00:05:51.400> let<00:05:51.550> us

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
bottom you put it on like this so let us

00:05:51.580 --> 00:06:01.610 
bottom you put it on like this so let us
run<00:05:51.849> away<00:05:52.830> like<00:05:53.830> this<00:05:54.479> and<00:05:55.979> then<00:05:58.409> like<00:05:59.409> this

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.850 

then<00:06:02.620> for<00:06:03.190> the<00:06:03.280> final<00:06:03.430> thing

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
then for the final thing

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:10.010 
then for the final thing
you<00:06:05.849> put<00:06:06.270> the<00:06:06.659> number<00:06:07.699> the<00:06:08.699> actual<00:06:09.030> gun

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
you put the number the actual gun

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:15.619 
you put the number the actual gun
barrels<00:06:12.469> you<00:06:13.699> take<00:06:14.699> the<00:06:14.849> two<00:06:15.030> little<00:06:15.419> nub

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:15.629 
barrels you take the two little nub

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:18.499 
barrels you take the two little nub
sticking<00:06:15.659> off<00:06:16.199> the<00:06:16.349> sides<00:06:17.060> if<00:06:18.060> you<00:06:18.120> want<00:06:18.389> you

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:18.509 
sticking off the sides if you want you

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:20.089 
sticking off the sides if you want you
can<00:06:18.659> stick<00:06:18.870> this<00:06:18.990> on<00:06:19.169> first<00:06:19.379> that's<00:06:19.949> what<00:06:20.069> I

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:20.099 
can stick this on first that's what I

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:24.110 
can stick this on first that's what I
would<00:06:20.250> probably<00:06:20.340> do<00:06:20.610> because<00:06:21.270> it<00:06:21.419> bends<00:06:23.120> you

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
would probably do because it bends you

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:29.420 
would probably do because it bends you
put<00:06:24.360> these<00:06:24.509> two<00:06:24.719> things<00:06:24.750> on<00:06:27.259> and<00:06:28.259> then<00:06:28.469> you

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:29.430 
put these two things on and then you

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:41.269 
put these two things on and then you
just<00:06:31.879> hold<00:06:32.879> on<00:06:33.090> just<00:06:36.919> you<00:06:37.919> put<00:06:38.129> this<00:06:39.830> into<00:06:40.830> here

00:06:41.269 --> 00:06:41.279 
just hold on just you put this into here

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:44.899 
just hold on just you put this into here
and<00:06:41.819> then<00:06:41.969> this<00:06:42.300> should<00:06:42.719> go<00:06:43.580> into<00:06:44.580> here<00:06:44.879> I

00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:44.909 
and then this should go into here I

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:47.510 
and then this should go into here I
should<00:06:45.120> be<00:06:45.300> equal<00:06:45.719> and<00:06:45.960> then<00:06:46.409> that<00:06:46.710> is<00:06:47.009> how<00:06:47.069> you

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 
should be equal and then that is how you

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.659 
should be equal and then that is how you
make<00:06:47.699> a<00:06:47.729> lego<00:06:48.150> number<00:06:48.509> work
