00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.610
 and well that's all according to 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.129
 comments I bring blackout gameplay 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.809
 2 as if it's a gameplay with the sml 

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:09.280
 but as you have seen during the 

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:12.040
 last days the videos that I've been 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.950
 climbing has been practically very 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.750
 varied in terms of let's say one of 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.910
 every two videos has been no call of duty 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.830
 and well the truth is that I do not know 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.900
 I just told you it was stolen 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.760
 other games and such and such and that plays 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.980
 I usually play roscones that no no no 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.929
 went up and during the past week I was 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.429
 many things while recording 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.800
 I played also which and during this 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:34.960
 week then I have put a bit to what 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.730
 that is being editing the videos that 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.860
 he had recorded all the works he had 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.210
 recorded and make small videos that 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.160
 what I have seen in general terms and 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.860
 as you have done in the 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.989
 comments and from what has been seen in 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.780
 visits or adaptations are the 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.039
 votes and others have liked you more and 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.420
 the proposal has been greater than in the 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.230
 videos of ecologists beauty man being 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.120
 this channel 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.520
 let's say that between quotes of call of 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.280
 duty so good I followed super 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.989
 glad the truth of how always you 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.420
 I say and net to continue raising what 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.710
 more or less at every moment I feel like 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.770
 play sometimes sometimes play more 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.330
 the well-known applicant three months and 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.820
 Then I do not know, I have another desire and 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.920
 it's good to know that you also accept that 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.810
 climb after different things and good 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.729
 let's say that leaving that degree and already 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.940
 focusing a bit more on all the new 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:24.070
 generations that I mentioned to you ago 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.630
 time and when I was the events with 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.060
 the angels in the e3 and I'm testing 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.850
 different games I'm obviously going to 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.050
 play a lot of games what I eat 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.060
 always in fact is what I do not know if 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.250
 finally you come up to 2 but it's 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.440
 what I tell you moment that I take and recorded 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.270
 something that is to be programmed and many times 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.670
 I catch record things and different games 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.960
 and there were not even any but I think so 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.800
 what fun I will obviously follow 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.270
 going up 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.580
 let's say anything else that does not 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.399
 It's the color of you but a little bit what 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.350
 that I wanted to comment on were two things in 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.050
 first place I do not know if some 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.880
 you will agree but it is already available 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.100
 the images that for those who have 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.409
 blogs is available and writing is 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.090
 download my play not in full then in play 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.280
 obviously not because you can not 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.979
 to do is to say something that the 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.590
 mlg of electronic sports there in 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.340
 us and it's something that only works 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.030
 for me 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.530
 like microsoft but let's say that 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.230
 it was simply because I already know that in 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.930
 Spain I think we say with a fifth 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.550
 part or a first part people have 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.950
 one x two pints with states in the 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.540
 better like four fifths do not 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.560
 I think we should not say that on the one hand 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.510
 and then you know what went down in the 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.340
 description and you will also have down on 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.890
 the description 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.260
 a link to a video that I explained to you 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.849
 how they work let's say I take out the 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.040
 new shirts that many of you had 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.180
 asked for a test 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.950
 let's say a while ago because they 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.530
 let's say kevin jonas with a t-shirt 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.799
 I walk a design and they did not put me 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.870
 some videos or others and let's say what 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.980
 I started asking and demands decisions that I 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.750
 I had bought I had not put my 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.090
 design there I bought myself my book 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.190
 his own shirt and well let's say 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.400
 I did a test they just let me 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.010
 sell 150 t-shirts something like that and provisor 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.090
 they all sold out then I talked 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.890
 with another company so that it is 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.079
 much more capable and all that much what 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.090
 explained in a video uploaded to the other 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.470
 channel a video that explained how 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.030
 if someone interests you the shirts or 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.340
 wants to buy them or whatever the 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.349
 you have there 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.430
 the truth is that I think it may be 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.190
 quite interesting 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.140
 the answer was quite greater with the 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.950
 theme of minecraft and so on 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.000
 more or less the one of maintained and 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.760
 they just let me put doses on them 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.799
 in the future if I see that you like them well 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.989
 you who will put things that I have 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.459
 let's say that thought color designs 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.010
 different hawks and others that I think that 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.989
 it can be quite entertaining and 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.519
 just because I say so good 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.650
 so that at first now not 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.540
 You know it , it's not interesting here, I think 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.530
 in principle as I tell you it 's all 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.060
 explained I will not repeat the same 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.590
 video on the two channels because it would be a 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.150
 little absurd I leave the link too 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.790
 down in the description if you want 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.860
 keep an eye on and practically that would be 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.120
 I hope you liked this one 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.799
 video like the video vote the 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.690
 differences for everything for all the support 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.720
 in the videos and especially with the ones 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:10.790
 different things so nothing to throw it away 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.790
 and it 's not just all of us and goodbye
