the<00:03:01.080> late<00:03:01.710> 80s<00:03:02.340> I<00:03:02.460> believe<00:03:02.730> in<00:03:03.030> Washington<00:03:03.570> DC

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
the late 80s I believe in Washington DC

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.140 
the late 80s I believe in Washington DC
who<00:03:04.260> was<00:03:04.410> reelected<00:03:04.890> after<00:03:05.580> that<00:03:05.670> video<00:03:05.850> came

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
who was reelected after that video came

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.640 
who was reelected after that video came
out<00:03:06.300> so<00:03:06.540> I<00:03:06.570> don't<00:03:06.840> think<00:03:06.960> that<00:03:07.080> Toronto<00:03:07.530> guy

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
out so I don't think that Toronto guy

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.970 
out so I don't think that Toronto guy
has<00:03:07.800> to<00:03:07.920> worry<00:03:08.480> all<00:03:09.480> right<00:03:09.690> more<00:03:09.930> crime<00:03:10.290> news<00:03:10.590> I
