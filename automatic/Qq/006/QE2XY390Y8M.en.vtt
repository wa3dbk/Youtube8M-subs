00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:07.170
 So now we were again 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.000
 rather have a terrace as you can see 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.500
 on the right I have already cleaned others 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.299
 so that we can do it in real time 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:18.379
 So see how it works 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.379
 we put the machine into operation 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:31.470
 we are already seeing something like this 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.140
 our machine and where i already 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.350
 have agreed now let's go 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.219
 the right side in real time 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:44.430
 but I'm filming here and have 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.450
 simultaneously appeared in the hand 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.750
 look how we do it all 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.800
 hinbekommen 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.780
 the editorial office 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.760
 besides just times 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.510
 two stripes of the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.240
 began 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.620
 so much better before 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.460
 Thoughts crashed with water and 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.740
 messi course 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.850
 although the whole 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.970
 be right 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:14.080
 in the second picture again 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.080
 classes difference 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.430
 once 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.430
 now 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.520
 in comdirect 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.930
 without detergent this rally 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.930
 casual and 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.729
 In addition, here can be a more accurate 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.920
 if we use familiar terraces 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.810
 to have 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:57.470
 It is a gray from the company osmo 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:02.200
 wood in gray and this one gray 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.200
 I'll bring it up again 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:11.660
 so only on these two we want that 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.050
 actually stock up now 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:21.550
 dirty water you just back out times 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:23.010
 and mediocre 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.120
 work loud 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.120
 grief in wood 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.360
 there 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.360
 something happens 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:38.260
 what a clap our fight but 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:41.420
 the whole thing the exhausting so 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.110
 will already have been completed 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.110
 with the cleaning 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.350
 next to the shoes
