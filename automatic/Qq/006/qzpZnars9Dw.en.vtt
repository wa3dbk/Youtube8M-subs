00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:10.580
 I am for me and in this tutorial I'm going 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.310
 to teach how to make a rosita like this 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.309
 and best of all 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:19.240
 has a smell 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.240
 so let's start 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:27.650
 We're going to need a little bit of your will 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:30.990
 peace a fomix werder scissors and a pencil 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.030
 10 a rule and your favorite perfume 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.420
 Even if you want like you want 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.480
 perceive in their families their parents love 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.390
 with you your compass in the rule you go to 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.150
 Mark 4 centimeters and she is checked 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:50.290
 and you are going to do in your background 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:53.220
 the circumference of 4 centimeters is 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.220
 something like that will remain 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.150
 and with its scissors features 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:04.050
 so that something like that 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:06.540
 I do not know what the circles are and then 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.920
 that's why circles do not have to be 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.880
 the perfect circles and with your scissors 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.140
 from now the following 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.080
 Let's see 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.650
 cut as 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.110
 at either end of the circle until 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.450
 half 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.220
 from either end of the circle to 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.220
 half and now you do 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.060
 four circles that you have already made in your 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.150
 blue family four circles of four 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.150
 centimeters and you will also make two circles 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.060
 two centimeters and they will do the same for 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:47.410
 taras from either end of the 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:52.480
 circle is half where you left 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:55.210
 the point compass and then I also 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.210
 I forgot to say you're going to quote a toothpick 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:02.790
 a stick of these wooden tipped if 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:08.340
 you do not have to have and a little hurried 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:10.850
 then this is to collect this already 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.750
 fold it in 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.410
 in this way 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.950
 v 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.950
 Y 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.900
 the sounds that are giving like a fat 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:29.460
 but before that you're going to draw on you in 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:32.030
 your fomix you are going to draw a star of 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.430
 five tips as is here 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.819
 of the user that is a star 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.950
 perfect has to do that to put 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.920
 here 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.360
 then it is a star like this and it 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.360
 put on the cross stick 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:54.200
 first is the poke the intruder 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.549
 well more or less and then comes the 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.709
 star is not a perfect leaf is not 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:06.010
 a perfect star when this that 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:10.569
 we were going to talk to him as you already 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:12.969
 I said we will fold it like this 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:18.249
 with me then it will stay but this will 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:21.299
 we sit like that and we put him here in the 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:21.299
 stick hut 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.329
 do not 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.460
 I do not understand looks like a pooch 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.110
 from the column 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.110
 we have something like that 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.870
 and we will do the same with the other two 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.020
 other circles 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.870
 we will see him 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:52.370
 lying but instead of putting him like that the 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:54.350
 we are going to turn it around so that 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.740
 is included contrary 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:01.080
 so in the opposite direction one wants them 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:03.930
 another on the right and with this one 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:07.530
 let's do one of the sides then 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.690
 that right now I will make you one of 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.360
 the sides like this 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.960
 Perez 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.720
 and with the other they grew 4 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.459
 I will do 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.459
 to the other extreme 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:30.970
 so it would draw a heart with 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.970
 plus 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.759
 you do not throw me here not joining them just a 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.029
 little bit the tip has for a while its 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:44.479
 favorite perfume the pain if this is left 

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:48.919
 very high that only pulls it and that remain 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:53.649
 so and ready your expo miso rose as 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.649
 take as you call it is finished 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.490
 why
