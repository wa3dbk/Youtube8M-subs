00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.430
 ten years later the São Paulo 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:04.820
 and for the game 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.480
 thinkers 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.960
 of the 54 thousand fans are already in the stadium when two minutes of game 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.369
 The ball came from above. 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:14.669
 Fabiana 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:17.380
 hit the foot 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.380
 a liberators 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.310
 I played on the ball in the second goal I told the evangelicals and in Haiti 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.669
 of those 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:30.939
 when he was in a night of those days 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.100
 p with the opponent's foot at the intersection of Gustavo Nery and points seems to be worth it 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.090
 touch the ball 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.020
 2-a-1 from sao paulo 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.510
 the other attacks of the Brazilian team shows that in terms of aim only 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.320
 luis fabiano is on one of those nights 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.320
 the biggest chance and whoever loses this sim 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.560
 the last time Sao Paulo had played in Morumbi by the liberators 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.570
 shirt 23 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.740
 we do ceni was 21 of the current group the goalkeeper is the only one who was already in the 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.070
 club 10 years ago is booking 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.960
 is the leader that Luis Fabiano takes care of the goals rogério deals with 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.280
 avoid them even with the legs as in a kick of daniel perez and had 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.760
 lucky in the wrong conclusion of new villa 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.070
 which forced them to lose chances and the players the index 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.790
 the same goal against him expelled after spitting Luis fabiano 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.140
 unresponsive 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.140
 in the second time at the intersection of cisterns 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.520
 we fall into the trap of the adversary who in the line of hindrance 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.900
 I do not know for sure, but I imagine at least three more days in one of these 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.900
 entrepreneurs luis fabiano goes on a long ball 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.020
 and this is not worth 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.560
 quieter 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.160
 as they get the better of it 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.160
 thanks for both 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.659
 many understand 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:11.659
 take the entrepreneurs out of the player 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:13.969
 2008 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:16.569
 in that in the activity it 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.549
 I counted on luck and 3 to 1 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:24.189
 o são paulo got more power interrupted three years ago the generation 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:28.659
 of rogério ceni and at the foot of Luis Fabiano a decade ago 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:30.269
 but there are also commonalities 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.659
 as well as goalkeeper the top scorer wants to have long life in morumbi the platform to 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:37.089
 even more facing 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:38.759
 all over the city 

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:40.149
 what need of demand
