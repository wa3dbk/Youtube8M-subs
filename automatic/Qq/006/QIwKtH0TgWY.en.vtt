so<00:00:00.299> we'll<00:00:00.690> start<00:00:00.870> off<00:00:00.960> here<00:00:01.170> with<00:00:01.350> the<00:00:01.500> haze

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
so we'll start off here with the haze

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.490 
so we'll start off here with the haze
disc<00:00:02.250> brake<00:00:02.659> you<00:00:03.659> could<00:00:03.840> remove<00:00:04.080> these<00:00:04.230> pads

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
disc brake you could remove these pads

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.840 
disc brake you could remove these pads
when<00:00:04.680> they're<00:00:04.859> on<00:00:04.890> the<00:00:05.040> bike<00:00:05.250> but<00:00:05.520> it's<00:00:05.759> a

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
when they're on the bike but it's a

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.629 
when they're on the bike but it's a
pretty<00:00:06.060> simple<00:00:06.330> process<00:00:06.509> just<00:00:07.610> stick<00:00:08.610> a

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
pretty simple process just stick a

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.169 
pretty simple process just stick a
finger<00:00:08.849> in<00:00:09.000> there<00:00:09.469> pull<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.590> pad<00:00:10.769> out<00:00:12.799> and<00:00:14.179> our

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
finger in there pull the pad out and our

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.019 
finger in there pull the pad out and our
pads<00:00:15.450> are<00:00:15.630> out<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:16.680> haze<00:00:17.010> disc<00:00:17.520> brake<00:00:17.760> pads

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
pads are out the haze disc brake pads

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.109 
pads are out the haze disc brake pads
are<00:00:18.949> actually<00:00:19.949> different<00:00:20.279> for<00:00:20.730> each<00:00:20.789> side

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
are actually different for each side

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.050 
are actually different for each side
it's<00:00:21.480> hard<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.869> tell<00:00:22.050> just<00:00:22.080> looking<00:00:22.380> at<00:00:22.800> them

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
it's hard to tell just looking at them

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.519 
it's hard to tell just looking at them
but<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.180> can<00:00:24.330> tell<00:00:24.510> they're<00:00:24.900> profiled<00:00:25.470> a

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
but you can tell they're profiled a

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.620 
but you can tell they're profiled a
little<00:00:25.740> bit<00:00:25.859> differently<00:00:26.330> you<00:00:27.330> see<00:00:27.480> on<00:00:27.599> the

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
little bit differently you see on the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.220 
little bit differently you see on the
back<00:00:27.930> they've<00:00:28.289> got<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.740> little<00:00:29.099> spring<00:00:29.609> and

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
back they've got a little spring and

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.290 
back they've got a little spring and
then<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.289> bore<00:00:31.800> on<00:00:32.040> them<00:00:32.489> which<00:00:32.759> sits<00:00:33.120> over<00:00:33.690> the

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
then a bore on them which sits over the

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.280 
then a bore on them which sits over the
piston<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.570> break<00:00:37.430> so<00:00:38.430> here's<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.090> break<00:00:39.870> a

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
piston and the break so here's a break a

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.729 
piston and the break so here's a break a
haze<00:00:41.250> brake<00:00:41.489> piston<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.140> what<00:00:43.140> we<00:00:43.320> see<00:00:43.500> is

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
haze brake piston and what we see is

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.330 
haze brake piston and what we see is
that<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:45.230> wrong<00:00:46.940> side<00:00:47.940> for<00:00:48.719> this<00:00:48.870> pad

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
that this is the wrong side for this pad

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.720 
that this is the wrong side for this pad
because<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.940> pad<00:00:51.270> wants<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.809> line<00:00:52.140> up<00:00:52.350> with

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
because the pad wants to line up with

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.330 
because the pad wants to line up with
the<00:00:53.730> piston<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.600> slide<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.350> one<00:00:55.590> on<00:00:55.710> you

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
the piston so I slide this one on you

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.849 
the piston so I slide this one on you
can<00:00:56.489> hear<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.480> see<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:58.500> it's<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.680> positive

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
can hear and see that it's a positive

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.400 
can hear and see that it's a positive
connection<00:00:59.550> so<00:01:00.149> they<00:01:00.420> are<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.899> know<00:01:00.989> they're

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
connection so they are you know they're

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.000 
connection so they are you know they're
handed<00:01:01.800> left<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.309> right<00:01:02.430> handed<00:01:02.760> and

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
handed left and right handed and

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.160 
handed left and right handed and
depending<00:01:05.010> on<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.909> type<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.420> replacement

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
depending on the type of replacement

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.840 
depending on the type of replacement
disc<00:01:07.710> brake<00:01:07.979> pad<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.460> get<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:08.790> your

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
disc brake pad that you get for your

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.760 
disc brake pad that you get for your
Hayes<00:01:09.000> brakes<00:01:09.360> they<00:01:09.930> may<00:01:10.170> or<00:01:10.260> may<00:01:10.380> not<00:01:10.409> come

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
Hayes brakes they may or may not come

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.469 
Hayes brakes they may or may not come
with<00:01:10.890> these<00:01:11.010> little<00:01:11.159> Springs<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:12.360> these

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
with these little Springs so these

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.969 
with these little Springs so these
little<00:01:12.720> Springs<00:01:12.960> are<00:01:13.049> like<00:01:13.170> gold<00:01:13.439> don't<00:01:13.860> let

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
little Springs are like gold don't let

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.039 
little Springs are like gold don't let
them<00:01:14.130> go<00:01:14.220> flying<00:01:14.549> across<00:01:14.850> your<00:01:15.180> garage<00:01:15.450> or

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
them go flying across your garage or

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.719 
them go flying across your garage or
lose<00:01:16.740> them<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.070> parking<00:01:17.369> lot<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
lose them in the parking lot on the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.460 
lose them in the parking lot on the
trail<00:01:17.970> because<00:01:18.659> your<00:01:18.810> brake<00:01:18.960> pads<00:01:18.990> aren't

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
trail because your brake pads aren't

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.590 
trail because your brake pads aren't
going<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.710> work<00:01:19.799> without<00:01:19.979> them<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.600> sometimes

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
going to work without them and sometimes

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.780 
going to work without them and sometimes
you<00:01:22.049> buy<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.229> replacement<00:01:22.590> pads<00:01:22.920> through<00:01:23.220> don't

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
you buy a replacement pads through don't

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.380 
you buy a replacement pads through don't
come<00:01:24.000> with<00:01:24.150> them<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:26.000> we're<00:01:27.000> going<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.180> move<00:01:27.299> on

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
come with them so we're going to move on

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.980 
come with them so we're going to move on
now<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.659> removing<00:01:28.729> added<00:01:29.729> disc<00:01:30.270> brake<00:01:30.479> pads<00:01:30.860> so

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
now to removing added disc brake pads so

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.050 
now to removing added disc brake pads so
I'm<00:01:33.990> going<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.229> leave<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.560> one<00:01:34.770> on<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.759> wheel

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
I'm going to leave this one on the wheel

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.679 
I'm going to leave this one on the wheel
here<00:01:36.619> and<00:01:39.079> it's<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.170> similar<00:01:40.560> operation<00:01:41.689> the

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
here and it's a similar operation the

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.170 
here and it's a similar operation the
inside<00:01:43.350> pad<00:01:43.560> here<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:43.890> actually<00:01:44.070> bent<00:01:44.549> which

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
inside pad here is actually bent which

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.749 
inside pad here is actually bent which
makes<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.540> easier<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.840> grab<00:01:46.369> but<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.549> like<00:01:47.729> to

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
makes it easier to grab but I like to

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.999 
makes it easier to grab but I like to
grab<00:01:48.030> em<00:01:49.310> both<00:01:50.310> at<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.579> same<00:01:50.759> time<00:01:50.790> if<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.210> can

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
grab em both at the same time if I can

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.830 
grab em both at the same time if I can
tug<00:01:53.009> on<00:01:53.130> them<00:01:53.250> but<00:01:53.549> looks<00:01:54.090> like<00:01:54.180> going<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.720> grab

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
tug on them but looks like going to grab

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.209 
tug on them but looks like going to grab
the<00:01:54.960> outside<00:01:55.259> one<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:56.360> that's<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:58.100> little<00:01:59.100> bit

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
the outside one and that's a little bit

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.590 
the outside one and that's a little bit
rough<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.700> get<00:01:59.850> out<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.119> what<00:02:00.210> I'm<00:02:00.299> going<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.450> do

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
rough to get out so what I'm going to do

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.819 
rough to get out so what I'm going to do
is<00:02:00.750> I'm<00:02:00.810> going<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:00.960> go<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.140> my<00:02:01.200> toolbox<00:02:01.649> I'm

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
is I'm going to go to my toolbox I'm

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.950 
is I'm going to go to my toolbox I'm
going<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.040> grab<00:02:02.219> some<00:02:02.509> needle<00:02:03.509> nose<00:02:03.540> pliers

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
going to grab some needle nose pliers

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.580 
going to grab some needle nose pliers
and<00:02:04.820> that's<00:02:05.820> going<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.570> make<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:07.049> operation

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
and that's going to make this operation

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.310 
and that's going to make this operation
a<00:02:07.649> little<00:02:07.890> bit<00:02:07.979> simpler
