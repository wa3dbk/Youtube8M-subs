00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
different if it was a lot tighter it

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.520 
different if it was a lot tighter it
feels<00:02:26.550> much<00:02:26.700> more<00:02:26.910> responsive<00:02:27.290> you're<00:02:28.290> able

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
feels much more responsive you're able

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.670 
feels much more responsive you're able
to<00:02:28.650> pass<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:29.790> your<00:02:29.910> teammates<00:02:30.390> more<00:02:31.260> fluidly

in a way that someone coming from FIFA

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.479 
in a way that someone coming from FIFA
had<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:04.050> completely<00:03:04.380> learn<00:03:04.800> a<00:03:04.830> completely<00:03:05.340> new

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
had to completely learn a completely new

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.880 
had to completely learn a completely new
system<00:03:05.910> so<00:03:06.420> it's<00:03:06.540> just<00:03:06.690> tuned<00:03:07.019> so<00:03:07.440> we've<00:03:07.860> just

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
system so it's just tuned so we've just

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.410 
system so it's just tuned so we've just
kind<00:03:08.130> of<00:03:08.250> tuned<00:03:08.489> and<00:03:08.670> tweaked<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.000> existing

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
kind of tuned and tweaked the existing

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.120 
kind of tuned and tweaked the existing
system<00:03:09.810> so<00:03:10.230> if<00:03:10.320> you're<00:03:10.410> coming<00:03:10.590> from<00:03:10.680> Fifi<00:03:11.040> you

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
system so if you're coming from Fifi you

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.740 
system so if you're coming from Fifi you
probably<00:03:11.580> won't<00:03:11.880> notice<00:03:12.120> that<00:03:12.420> much<00:03:12.570> of<00:03:12.690> a

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
probably won't notice that much of a

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.390 
probably won't notice that much of a
difference<00:03:12.780> it's<00:03:13.350> for<00:03:13.590> those<00:03:13.709> casuals<00:03:14.190> and

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
difference it's for those casuals and

difference it's for those casuals and
come<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:14.730> kind<00:03:14.850> of<00:03:14.970> hold<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.780> joystick<00:03:16.290> top

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530

actually went to rosette for those it's

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.100 
actually went to rosette for those it's
a<00:03:20.250> bit<00:03:20.400> more<00:03:20.489> forgiving<00:03:20.970> because<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.329> the<00:03:21.570> if

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
a bit more forgiving because the the if

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.690 
a bit more forgiving because the the if
you<00:03:22.260> play<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.530> mini<00:03:22.709> game<00:03:22.890> now<00:03:23.070> you<00:03:23.130> kind<00:03:23.640> of

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.449 
assured he won't feel broken like say
you<00:03:31.260> probably<00:03:31.769> won't<00:03:31.980> know<00:03:32.130> that<00:03:32.280> much

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
you probably won't know that much

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:33.920 
you probably won't know that much
difference<00:03:32.850> but<00:03:33.000> for<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.239> brand<00:03:33.420> new<00:03:33.510> users

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
difference but for the brand new users

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.530 
difference but for the brand new users
they'll<00:03:34.470> just<00:03:34.650> find<00:03:34.829> a<00:03:34.950> lot<00:03:35.100> more<00:03:35.250> intuitive

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.780 

yeah<00:03:41.409> so<00:03:41.560> we've<00:03:41.680> really<00:03:41.709> pushed<00:03:42.069> to<00:03:42.189> 360<00:03:42.670> and

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
yeah so we've really pushed to 360 and

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.849 
yeah so we've really pushed to 360 and
ps3<00:03:43.030> to<00:03:43.420> its<00:03:43.540> limits<00:03:43.840> I<00:03:43.870> mean<00:03:43.989> coming<00:03:44.230> to<00:03:44.500> the

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
ps3 to its limits I mean coming to the

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.500 
ps3 to its limits I mean coming to the
later<00:03:45.099> on<00:03:45.280> in<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.489> console<00:03:45.819> cycle<00:03:46.030> so<00:03:46.390> we've

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
later on in the console cycle so we've

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.000 
later on in the console cycle so we've
obviously<00:03:46.629> got<00:03:46.959> a<00:03:47.019> lot<00:03:47.079> of<00:03:47.230> back<00:03:47.590> catalogue<00:03:47.980> of

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
obviously got a lot of back catalogue of

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.740 
obviously got a lot of back catalogue of
knowledge<00:03:48.400> of<00:03:48.519> how<00:03:48.640> to<00:03:48.670> do<00:03:48.939> that<00:03:49.120> we<00:03:49.569> brought

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
knowledge of how to do that we brought

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.300 
knowledge of how to do that we brought
on<00:03:49.930> some<00:03:50.109> guys<00:03:50.349> from<00:03:50.560> who'd<00:03:50.920> worked<00:03:51.099> on<00:03:51.250> the

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
on some guys from who'd worked on the

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.009 
on some guys from who'd worked on the
gen<00:03:51.489> for<00:03:51.730> product<00:03:52.060> and<00:03:52.209> FIFA<00:03:52.540> so<00:03:52.689> we<00:03:52.780> kind<00:03:52.989> of

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
gen for product and FIFA so we kind of

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.380 
gen for product and FIFA so we kind of
really<00:03:53.260> push<00:03:53.469> the<00:03:53.500> boundaries<00:03:53.950> so<00:03:54.609> a<00:03:55.000> lot<00:03:55.359> of

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
really push the boundaries so a lot of

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.599 
really push the boundaries so a lot of
what<00:03:55.569> we've<00:03:55.719> done<00:03:55.900> is<00:03:56.170> we've<00:03:56.469> we've<00:03:57.370> saved

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
what we've done is we've we've saved

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.069 
what we've done is we've we've saved
memory<00:03:58.030> to<00:03:58.150> get<00:03:58.269> into<00:03:58.450> kind<00:03:58.569> of<00:03:58.689> technical

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
memory to get into kind of technical

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:00.330 
memory to get into kind of technical
terms<00:03:59.260> with<00:03:59.439> free<00:03:59.620> up<00:03:59.769> memory<00:03:59.890> from<00:04:00.159> other

terms with free up memory from other

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.190 
terms with free up memory from other
areas<00:04:00.549> which<00:04:00.819> allows<00:04:01.090> us<00:04:01.299> to<00:04:01.480> kind<00:04:01.900> of<00:04:02.019> blow

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
areas which allows us to kind of blow

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.839 
areas which allows us to kind of blow
out<00:04:02.349> the<00:04:02.470> visuals<00:04:02.859> improve<00:04:03.250> the<00:04:03.400> textures<00:04:03.819> of

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
out the visuals improve the textures of

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.240 
out the visuals improve the textures of
a<00:04:04.079> lot<00:04:05.079> of<00:04:05.170> other<00:04:05.260> things<00:04:05.319> other<00:04:05.650> stadiums

that's why you kind of can see the

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.550 
that's why you kind of can see the
external<00:04:08.670> geometry<00:04:09.670> of<00:04:09.700> the<00:04:09.790> stadiums<00:04:10.269> now

not like freedom to train at any and
every<00:04:37.570> single<00:04:37.720> point<00:04:38.080> and<00:04:38.560> you<00:04:38.620> can<00:04:38.740> only

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
every single point and you can only

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.010 
every single point and you can only
really<00:04:38.949> focus<00:04:39.430> in<00:04:39.520> on<00:04:39.639> one<00:04:39.820> trip<00:04:40.120> one<00:04:40.449> aspect

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
really focus in on one trip one aspect

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.230 
really focus in on one trip one aspect
so<00:04:41.410> it<00:04:41.710> is<00:04:41.889> limited<00:04:42.370> in<00:04:42.460> what<00:04:42.550> you<00:04:42.610> can<00:04:42.729> do<00:04:43.030> and

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
so it is limited in what you can do and

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.430 
so it is limited in what you can do and
there's<00:04:43.599> also<00:04:43.750> on<00:04:44.020> top<00:04:44.199> of<00:04:44.320> that<00:04:44.380> a

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
there's also on top of that a

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.620 
there's also on top of that a
risk/reward<00:04:45.070> so<00:04:45.250> if<00:04:45.370> you're<00:04:45.520> not<00:04:45.669> really<00:04:46.360> good

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
risk/reward so if you're not really good

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.719 
risk/reward so if you're not really good
at<00:04:46.750> it<00:04:46.870> you<00:04:47.500> could<00:04:47.710> actually<00:04:47.860> detrimentally

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
at it you could actually detrimentally

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.990 
at it you could actually detrimentally
affect<00:04:49.570> their<00:04:49.750> morale<00:04:50.349> and<00:04:50.620> form<00:04:50.919> so<00:04:51.430> yeah

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
affect their morale and form so yeah

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.490 
affect their morale and form so yeah
it's<00:04:52.150> a<00:04:52.210> fine<00:04:52.389> balance<00:04:52.539> we<00:04:52.840> certainly<00:04:53.320> didn't

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
it's a fine balance we certainly didn't

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.290 
it's a fine balance we certainly didn't
want<00:04:53.590> to<00:04:53.740> create<00:04:53.919> you<00:04:54.099> know<00:04:54.130> teams<00:04:54.490> of<00:04:54.639> 99<00:04:55.060> and

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
want to create you know teams of 99 and

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.610 
want to create you know teams of 99 and
there's<00:04:55.449> also<00:04:55.539> potential<00:04:56.020> with<00:04:56.320> each<00:04:56.409> of<00:04:56.560> the

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
there's also potential with each of the

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.839 
there's also potential with each of the
players<00:04:56.770> where<00:04:57.010> they<00:04:57.099> can't<00:04:57.340> kind<00:04:57.580> of<00:04:57.669> can't

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:57.849 
players where they can't kind of can't

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:00.000 
players where they can't kind of can't
exceed<00:04:58.240> so<00:04:58.810> you<00:04:58.870> shouldn't<00:04:59.139> find<00:04:59.409> the<00:04:59.650> you

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
exceed so you shouldn't find the you

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:05.560 
exceed so you shouldn't find the you
know<00:05:00.099> teams<00:05:00.610> of<00:05:00.729> Superman
