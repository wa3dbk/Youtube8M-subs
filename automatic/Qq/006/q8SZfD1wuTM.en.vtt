00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.350
 Hello everyone in this video, I will consider 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.120
 three factions of nomads who came out in 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.490
 recently 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:25.810
 dls that is, the addition to the game is 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.810
 fractions of massages roksolana ff and 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.550
 royal Scythians 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.269
 First, let's take a look at general information on 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.420
 him in the menu a new company appeared new 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:41.109
 icon nomads and accordingly you 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.309
 see these three fractions and so the first 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:44.109
 Roksolany fraction 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.510
 you see their starting position in 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:50.260
 companies and, accordingly, the nuances of the game 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.329
 back next honey Royal Scythians their 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.989
 the initial position of the nuances of the game for them and 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.949
 Massagets too initial position 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.039
 and 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:02.889
 game nuances of the game for them now let's 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:06.750
 consider the types of units in multiplayer 

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:06.750
 which are available to the faction 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.909
 I will immediately say a choice 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.850
 they have a mediocre meaning they don't have 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.340
 in general, there are no infantry units 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.729
 only cavalry and equestrian 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:25.930
 that is, we see only 10 massagets 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:30.270
 types of squads and five of them this 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:32.729
 finally hit again rifle squads 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.579
 nothing special 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.469
 except massages have a cat 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:40.570
 fragment you, that is, heavily armored 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:43.329
 teams that are very serious 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.789
 melee score for these species 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:48.070
 units that is cl 51 units 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:52.899
 but naturally they are very costly 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:55.080
 dear well and archers that is naturally 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:02:00.500
 this is immediately clear 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:02.810
 understand their main tactics 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.180
 horse rifle 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.360
 windows on the composition of the army that is 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.280
 maximum amount 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.440
 cavalry 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.770
 to cover horse riders main 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.630
 damage is naturally caused by horse arrows 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.670
 that is, we recruit their maximum 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:27.120
 quantity 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:30.060
 we take the general and accordingly we go 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.890
 We attack the enemy, that is, when the arrows 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.880
 consumes all ammunition at the sight 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.190
 enemy units then the main part 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.100
 a cavalier who previously covered them 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.810
 from strikes of enemy infantry and cavalry 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:47.820
 attacks enemy remnants and smashes 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:51.750
 their tactics that is clear I simply have nothing 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:54.660
 I did not see this particular faction for 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.850
 The exception here is that the very 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.820
 expensive kind of horse archers 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.239
 Archers is the cat which is extremely frag 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:07.500
 high armor rate of 90 and pretty 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:11.720
 a serious indicator of melee exactly 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.720
 for archers that is as much as 38 units 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:18.930
 Further, the second fraction is Roksolany too 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:22.620
 nomads they already have two species 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.080
 assault cavalry but also three kinds 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.590
 horse shooters and four types of shock 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.989
 Cavalry absolutely similar 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.000
 detachments with the exception of the royal Sarmatian 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.580
 spearmen that is you see too 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.680
 high rates of armor and the highest 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:41.040
 the onslaught rate in the game is generally among 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.500
 all units as much as 80 units 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.160
 seriously enough and deals damage 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:51.890
 the enemy is no longer anything special 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.890
 my faction is not here 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.070
 accordingly, the composition is typed exactly 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.830
 the same as in the preceding fraction 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:04.950
 you see 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:07.900
 the general is taken 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:11.380
 in order to cover up and 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:15.370
 fight enemy cavalry and infantry 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:17.200
 and recruited horse archers that is 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.620
 large enough to 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.280
 thin out and enemy types of remnants 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:26.610
 the remnants of the enemy seek cavalry 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:30.190
 that is, again, nothing special 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:35.320
 no one stands out here and the last is 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:37.720
 Royal Scythians have seen a very large 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:41.110
 choice of horse shooters as many as six units 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.320
 and three types of cavalry then there are two types 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.520
 shock cavalry 1 assault 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.470
 the composition of the given fact is typed 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.160
 similar preceding that is 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:53.190
 cavalry which covers horse 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:58.270
 shooters 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:05:00.130
 that is, about 8-9 squads and 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:04.240
 directly themselves and equestrian arrows 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:06.340
 which cause damage to the enemy attacks 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.960
 him and accordingly as soon as 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.950
 spends spending the rest of the stream 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.840
 the enemy is surrounded and with one blow he 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:18.070
 killed if the opponent is trying to run 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.960
 for your troops, you can select it 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.590
 some kind of detachments beat them with 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:27.210
 different sides and thereby destroy something 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:31.510
 there is this basic tactic when playing for 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:34.720
 all three factions of the nomads more 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:37.060
 Tactics not unfortunately not because on 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.390
 other types of units especially infantry 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.070
 there are no choices here therefore 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.730
 extremely small and 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:48.940
 factions are pretty poor and in my opinion 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:51.580
 just uninteresting they will play something 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:54.190
 there are 1 2 3 times you run and shoot 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.320
 and the arrows will kill the enemy further 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.870
 cavalry but no further i don't think that you 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.569
 It will be interesting to play for these factions 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.789
 there are developers in my opinion 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:06.789
 these fractions have not been fully completed 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:09.039
 now but most likely in the future will be 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:10.749
 modifying because as far as I know 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:12.819
 in the company data fractions have 

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:16.419
 still infantry troops and most likely 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:18.539
 they will add infantry squads 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:21.629
 to these fractions in order not to be 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:25.569
 more varied and tactic we were 

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:28.679
 play more interesting than now on 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:31.179
 put it all like huskies 

00:06:28.679 --> 00:06:34.089
 comments subscribe to the channel
