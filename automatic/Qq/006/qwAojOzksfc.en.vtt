cut it and that is what I used to

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.340 
cut it and that is what I used to
install<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.820> hair<00:01:00.000> onto<00:01:00.359> my<00:01:00.510> head<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.930> took<00:01:01.230> the

which made a loop at the end I attached

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.280 
which made a loop at the end I attached
the<00:01:11.040> loop<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.549> hook<00:01:11.869> close<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.080> latch

once<00:01:23.130> it's<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.399> the<00:01:23.520> other<00:01:23.640> side<00:01:23.969> I<00:01:24.000> remove<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
once it's on the other side I remove the

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.810 
once it's on the other side I remove the
hook<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.110> then<00:01:25.560> using<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:25.979> opening<00:01:26.640> I'm

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
circle twist it bring it through a

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.279 
circle twist it bring it through a

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
second time twist it again and then

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.200 
second time twist it again and then
bring<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.590> through<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.890> third<00:01:38.189> time<00:01:41.090> then<00:01:42.090> I'm

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
bring it through a third time then I'm

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.910 
bring it through a third time then I'm
just<00:01:42.390> pulling<00:01:42.720> on<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.990> end<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.860> is

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
just pulling on the end and this is

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.800 
just pulling on the end and this is
going<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.460> secure<00:01:44.969> the<00:01:45.090> hair<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.539> the<00:01:45.569> braid

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
going to secure the hair to the braid

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.380 
going to secure the hair to the braid
and<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.710> pretty<00:01:46.920> much<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.460> process<00:01:47.789> for

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
and that is pretty much the process for

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.990 
and that is pretty much the process for
crochet<00:01:48.899> braids<00:01:52.219> so<00:01:53.219> I<00:01:53.250> just<00:01:53.520> repeated<00:01:53.789> that

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
crochet braids so I just repeated that

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.690 
crochet braids so I just repeated that
same<00:01:54.209> process<00:01:54.450> all<00:01:54.929> over<00:01:55.289> my<00:01:55.439> head<00:01:55.679> and<00:01:55.950> here

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
same process all over my head and here

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.990 
same process all over my head and here
it<00:01:56.819> is<00:01:56.939> again<00:01:57.360> from<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.840> back<00:01:58.080> I<00:01:59.000> usually

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
it is again from the back I usually

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.669 
it is again from the back I usually
start<00:02:00.240> from<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.509> back<00:02:00.720> and<00:02:00.990> work<00:02:01.079> my<00:02:01.380> way<00:02:01.409> up

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
start from the back and work my way up

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.830 
start from the back and work my way up
towards<00:02:02.099> the<00:02:02.220> front<00:02:02.399> because<00:02:03.179> that<00:02:03.420> way<00:02:03.569> just

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
towards the front because that way just

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.600 
towards the front because that way just
seems<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.170> lot<00:02:04.319> easier<00:02:04.679> to<00:02:04.890> me<00:02:05.069> and<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.369> comes

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
seems a lot easier to me and it comes

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:35.780 
seems a lot easier to me and it comes
out<00:02:05.729> better

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.460 

so<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:36.910> took<00:02:37.090> me<00:02:37.240> about<00:02:37.450> two<00:02:37.660> and<00:02:37.810> a<00:02:37.870> half<00:02:37.900> hours

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
so it took me about two and a half hours

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.740 
so it took me about two and a half hours
to<00:02:38.500> do<00:02:38.770> my<00:02:39.010> entire<00:02:39.040> head<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:40.030> this<00:02:40.390> is<00:02:40.510> what<00:02:40.660> it

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
to do my entire head and this is what it

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:56.640 
to do my entire head and this is what it
looked<00:02:40.930> like<00:02:40.990> when<00:02:41.290> I<00:02:41.350> was<00:02:41.410> done<00:02:55.350> as<00:02:56.350> you<00:02:56.500> can

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
looked like when I was done as you can

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.110 
looked like when I was done as you can
see<00:02:56.770> I<00:02:56.800> could<00:02:57.010> wear<00:02:57.130> my<00:02:57.160> hair<00:02:57.400> on<00:02:57.490> the<00:02:57.580> side<00:02:57.790> and

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
see I could wear my hair on the side and

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.650 
see I could wear my hair on the side and
I<00:02:58.150> could<00:02:58.210> also<00:02:58.480> wear<00:02:58.750> it<00:02:58.900> down<00:02:59.080> the<00:02:59.200> middle<00:02:59.320> and

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
I could also wear it down the middle and

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.060 
I could also wear it down the middle and
here<00:03:01.660> I'm<00:03:01.750> just<00:03:01.780> cutting<00:03:02.080> off<00:03:02.350> those<00:03:02.620> scraggly

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
here I'm just cutting off those scraggly

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.520 
here I'm just cutting off those scraggly
little<00:03:03.340> pieces<00:03:03.700> on<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.240> ends<00:03:04.660> so<00:03:05.170> I<00:03:05.200> didn't

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
little pieces on the ends so I didn't

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.870 
little pieces on the ends so I didn't
want<00:03:05.680> to<00:03:05.710> wear<00:03:05.800> my<00:03:05.980> hair<00:03:06.190> like<00:03:06.220> this<00:03:06.400> I<00:03:06.760> was

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
want to wear my hair like this I was

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.540 
want to wear my hair like this I was
going<00:03:07.060> for<00:03:07.390> a<00:03:07.450> curly<00:03:08.080> look<00:03:08.260> so<00:03:08.860> to<00:03:08.920> get<00:03:09.190> my<00:03:09.340> hair

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
going for a curly look so to get my hair

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.940 
going for a curly look so to get my hair
curly<00:03:09.760> I<00:03:10.090> grabbed<00:03:10.750> medium<00:03:11.110> sized<00:03:11.350> sections<00:03:11.620> of

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
curly I grabbed medium sized sections of

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.280 
curly I grabbed medium sized sections of
hair<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:12.490> applied<00:03:13.000> a<00:03:13.270> creamy<00:03:13.630> moisturizer

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
hair and applied a creamy moisturizer

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.590 
hair and applied a creamy moisturizer
and<00:03:14.710> that<00:03:15.250> just<00:03:15.430> helps<00:03:15.670> soften<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:16.120> hair<00:03:16.360> and

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
and that just helps soften the hair and

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.390 
and that just helps soften the hair and
make<00:03:16.900> it<00:03:16.930> easier<00:03:17.320> to<00:03:17.440> work<00:03:17.590> with<00:03:17.860> then<00:03:18.370> I

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
make it easier to work with then I

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.010 
make it easier to work with then I
lightly<00:03:18.730> brushed<00:03:19.060> it<00:03:19.210> out<00:03:19.270> to<00:03:19.540> smooth<00:03:19.810> out<00:03:19.960> the

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
lightly brushed it out to smooth out the

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.010 
lightly brushed it out to smooth out the
section<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:21.300> then<00:03:22.300> I<00:03:22.330> did<00:03:22.570> sort<00:03:22.810> of<00:03:22.900> like<00:03:22.990> a

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
section and then I did sort of like a

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.620 
section and then I did sort of like a
bantu<00:03:23.560> knot<00:03:23.860> so<00:03:24.190> I<00:03:24.220> put<00:03:24.520> my<00:03:24.640> finger<00:03:25.090> a<00:03:25.270> couple

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
bantu knot so I put my finger a couple

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.050 
bantu knot so I put my finger a couple
inches<00:03:25.810> from<00:03:26.230> the<00:03:26.350> top<00:03:26.560> and<00:03:26.890> I<00:03:27.580> just<00:03:27.610> brought

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
inches from the top and I just brought

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.300 
inches from the top and I just brought
the<00:03:28.210> hair<00:03:28.420> around<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:29.290> twisted<00:03:29.890> it<00:03:29.980> around

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
the hair around and twisted it around

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:43.960 
the hair around and twisted it around
itself<00:03:30.640> until<00:03:31.060> it<00:03:31.150> formed<00:03:31.720> a<00:03:31.840> nut

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.160 

like<00:03:44.970> so<00:03:47.150> after<00:03:48.150> that<00:03:48.330> I<00:03:48.510> used<00:03:48.720> a<00:03:48.840> cup<00:03:49.020> of

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
like so after that I used a cup of

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.650 
like so after that I used a cup of
really<00:03:49.560> really<00:03:49.830> hot<00:03:50.040> water<00:03:50.370> and<00:03:50.700> I<00:03:51.240> dipped<00:03:51.480> in

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
really really hot water and I dipped in

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.990 
really really hot water and I dipped in
that<00:03:51.840> into<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.350> water<00:03:52.560> for<00:03:52.890> about<00:03:52.980> 15<00:03:53.520> seconds

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
that into the water for about 15 seconds

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.430 
that into the water for about 15 seconds
and<00:03:54.300> right<00:03:54.600> here<00:03:54.780> you<00:03:54.870> have<00:03:55.020> to<00:03:55.110> be<00:03:55.140> super

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
and right here you have to be super

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.470 
and right here you have to be super
careful<00:03:55.740> on<00:03:56.070> this<00:03:56.190> part<00:03:56.490> so<00:03:56.700> you<00:03:57.030> don't<00:03:57.180> end<00:03:57.360> up

careful on this part so you don't end up

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.520 
careful on this part so you don't end up
burning<00:03:57.630> yourself<00:03:59.810> after<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.930> hair<00:04:01.140> is<00:04:01.260> dry<00:04:01.440> I
