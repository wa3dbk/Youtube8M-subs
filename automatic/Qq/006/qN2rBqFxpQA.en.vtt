do in the days of TIE fighter it's even
harder<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.780> do<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:09.960> now<00:01:10.350> because<00:01:10.500> for<00:01:10.619> flight

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
harder to do so now because for flight

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.859 
harder to do so now because for flight
models<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.460> much<00:01:11.610> more<00:01:11.760> sophisticated<00:01:12.299> if

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
models and so much more sophisticated if

you have a joystick he'll fare much
better

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
better

the<00:01:15.240> problem<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.630> most<00:01:15.780> joysticks<00:01:16.020> aren't

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
the problem is most joysticks aren't

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.109 
the problem is most joysticks aren't

done they're welcome logistic support so

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:23.420 
done they're welcome logistic support so
what's<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.920> alternative
