the<00:00:52.329> ones<00:00:52.540> that<00:00:52.690> we<00:00:52.780> need<00:00:52.899> a<00:00:52.960> jumper<00:00:53.350> are<00:00:53.530> here

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
the ones that we need a jumper are here

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.209 
the ones that we need a jumper are here
on<00:00:53.890> the<00:00:53.980> lower<00:00:54.190> left<00:00:54.280> and<00:00:54.730> the<00:00:54.880> lower<00:00:55.000> center<00:00:55.480> I

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
on the lower left and the lower center I

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.830 
on the lower left and the lower center I
took<00:00:57.219> a<00:00:57.399> paper<00:00:57.700> clip<00:00:57.910> and<00:00:58.210> I<00:00:58.300> bent<00:00:58.480> it<00:00:58.600> into<00:00:58.660> a

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
took a paper clip and I bent it into a

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.959 
took a paper clip and I bent it into a
u-shape<00:00:59.320> this<00:01:00.100> will<00:01:00.250> serve<00:01:00.430> to<00:01:00.550> jumper<00:01:00.850> the

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
u-shape this will serve to jumper the

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.020 
u-shape this will serve to jumper the
terminals<00:01:01.420> now<00:01:01.950> I'm<00:01:02.950> going<00:01:03.100> to<00:01:03.160> put<00:01:03.309> it<00:01:03.399> in<00:01:03.610> the

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
terminals now I'm going to put it in the

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.990 
terminals now I'm going to put it in the
two<00:01:04.210> terminals<00:01:04.629> that<00:01:04.690> I<00:01:04.780> mentioned<00:01:05.170> the<00:01:06.000> first

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
two terminals that I mentioned the first

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.760 
two terminals that I mentioned the first
time<00:01:07.420> requires<00:01:07.810> a<00:01:07.899> pretty<00:01:08.140> good<00:01:08.289> push<00:01:08.530> but

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
time requires a pretty good push but

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.670 
time requires a pretty good push but
after<00:01:08.979> that<00:01:09.130> they<00:01:09.250> get<00:01:09.399> easier<00:01:09.670> to<00:01:09.759> work<00:01:09.910> with

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
after that they get easier to work with

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.109 
after that they get easier to work with
so<00:01:11.680> you<00:01:11.740> can<00:01:11.890> see<00:01:12.130> that's<00:01:12.310> the<00:01:12.520> lower<00:01:12.700> left<00:01:12.970> and

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
so you can see that's the lower left and

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.960 
so you can see that's the lower left and
lower<00:01:13.210> center<00:01:13.660> terminals<00:01:14.170> now<00:01:14.640> let's<00:01:15.640> move<00:01:15.759> on

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
lower center terminals now let's move on

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.830 
lower center terminals now let's move on

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
because the strobe timing light doesn't

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.670 
because the strobe timing light doesn't

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
always line up perfectly with the frame

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.310 
always line up perfectly with the frame
rate<00:02:27.920> of<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.100> camera<00:02:28.780> but<00:02:29.780> anyway<00:02:30.110> you<00:02:30.170> get

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
rate of the camera but anyway you get

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.320 
rate of the camera but anyway you get
the<00:02:30.470> general<00:02:30.560> idea<00:02:30.800> you're<00:02:31.400> seeing<00:02:31.670> a<00:02:31.850> mark

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
the general idea you're seeing a mark

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.650 
the general idea you're seeing a mark
it<00:02:32.390> is<00:02:33.320> against<00:02:33.890> a<00:02:34.040> scale<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:34.610> you<00:02:35.120> want<00:02:35.330> it<00:02:35.450> to

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
it is against a scale and you want it to

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.180 
it is against a scale and you want it to
be<00:02:35.900> right<00:02:36.560> at<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:37.580> number-8<00:02:38.090> mark<00:02:39.160> which<00:02:40.160> is

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
be right at the number-8 mark which is

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.670 
be right at the number-8 mark which is
the<00:02:40.370> mark<00:02:40.640> before<00:02:40.820> the<00:02:41.120> ten<00:02:41.360> what<00:02:42.260> you'll<00:02:42.470> do

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
the mark before the ten what you'll do

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.490 
the mark before the ten what you'll do
is<00:02:42.920> adjust<00:02:43.459> the<00:02:43.850> distributor<00:02:44.450> until<00:02:45.170> you<00:02:45.290> get

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
is adjust the distributor until you get

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.500 
is adjust the distributor until you get
it<00:02:45.650> exactly<00:02:46.070> on<00:02:46.520> that<00:02:46.550> mark<00:02:46.940> you're<00:02:47.300> going<00:02:47.420> to

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
it exactly on that mark you're going to

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.990 
it exactly on that mark you're going to
turn<00:02:47.720> it<00:02:47.870> one<00:02:48.080> way<00:02:48.110> or<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.440> other<00:02:48.530> if<00:02:49.430> you<00:02:49.730> turn

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
turn it one way or the other if you turn

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.650 
turn it one way or the other if you turn
it<00:02:50.150> towards<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.560> driver<00:02:52.010> you<00:02:52.340> will<00:02:52.660> expanse

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
it towards the driver you will expanse

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.660 
it towards the driver you will expanse
the<00:02:53.989> timing<00:02:54.470> that<00:02:54.770> means<00:02:55.070> you<00:02:55.310> will<00:02:55.489> have<00:02:55.520> a

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
the timing that means you will have a

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.160 
the timing that means you will have a
higher<00:02:55.970> number<00:02:56.239> it<00:02:56.480> will<00:02:56.600> go<00:02:56.720> more<00:02:56.870> towards

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
higher number it will go more towards

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.380 
higher number it will go more towards
the<00:02:57.230> ten<00:02:57.440> or<00:02:57.620> even<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.920> twenty<00:02:58.250> if<00:02:58.459> you<00:02:59.120> turn

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
the ten or even the twenty if you turn

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.660 
the ten or even the twenty if you turn
it<00:02:59.570> towards<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.380> front<00:03:00.620> of<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:00.770> car<00:03:00.980> you<00:03:01.550> will

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
it towards the front of the car you will

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.940 
it towards the front of the car you will
have<00:03:01.820> a<00:03:02.090> retarded<00:03:02.660> timing<00:03:03.320> which<00:03:03.590> will<00:03:03.770> bring

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
have a retarded timing which will bring

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.449 
have a retarded timing which will bring
it<00:03:04.070> towards<00:03:04.370> zero<00:03:04.700> if<00:03:05.440> you<00:03:06.440> did<00:03:06.680> not<00:03:06.890> jumper

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
it towards zero if you did not jumper

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.330 
it towards zero if you did not jumper
the<00:03:07.610> wire<00:03:07.820> you<00:03:08.390> will<00:03:08.540> get<00:03:08.720> a<00:03:08.900> timing<00:03:09.680> reading

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
the wire you will get a timing reading

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.100 
the wire you will get a timing reading
more<00:03:10.670> like<00:03:10.820> this<00:03:11.000> I'm<00:03:11.360> about<00:03:11.660> to<00:03:11.780> unplug<00:03:12.049> the

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
more like this I'm about to unplug the

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.990 
more like this I'm about to unplug the
wire<00:03:12.790> now<00:03:13.790> it's<00:03:14.000> up<00:03:14.150> around<00:03:14.709> almost<00:03:15.709> 20<00:03:16.400> I'd

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
wire now it's up around almost 20 I'd

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.390 
wire now it's up around almost 20 I'd
say<00:03:17.299> that's<00:03:17.540> 16<00:03:18.350> degrees<00:03:18.650> advance<00:03:18.980> timing

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
say that's 16 degrees advance timing

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.070 
say that's 16 degrees advance timing
right<00:03:19.489> now<00:03:19.549> that's<00:03:20.180> why<00:03:20.390> we<00:03:20.570> have<00:03:20.690> to<00:03:20.780> jump<00:03:20.989> for

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
right now that's why we have to jump for

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.810 
right now that's why we have to jump for
that<00:03:21.140> one<00:03:21.620> connector<00:03:22.070> tells<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.459> computer

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
that one connector tells the computer

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.720 
that one connector tells the computer
not<00:03:22.940> to<00:03:23.090> do<00:03:23.180> anything<00:03:24.310> once<00:03:25.310> you've<00:03:25.459> got<00:03:25.610> the

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
not to do anything once you've got the

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.699 
not to do anything once you've got the
distributor<00:03:26.330> properly<00:03:26.810> set<00:03:27.049> tighten<00:03:27.650> the

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
distributor properly set tighten the

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.380 
distributor properly set tighten the
torques<00:03:27.980> screws<00:03:28.040> back<00:03:28.430> down<00:03:28.700> disconnect

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
torques screws back down disconnect

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.300 
torques screws back down disconnect
everything<00:03:29.540> take<00:03:30.320> the<00:03:30.440> jumper<00:03:30.709> wire<00:03:30.739> out<00:03:31.160> and

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
everything take the jumper wire out and

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.440 
everything take the jumper wire out and
you're<00:03:31.880> good<00:03:32.000> to<00:03:32.090> go

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
you're good to go
