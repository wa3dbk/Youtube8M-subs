is<00:05:01.530> probably<00:05:01.860> different<00:05:02.190> in<00:05:02.520> what<00:05:03.120> we<00:05:03.360> are

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
is probably different in what we are

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.080

defining<00:05:03.930> this<00:05:04.200> game<00:05:04.440> to<00:05:04.680> be<00:05:04.860> our<00:05:05.460> goal<00:05:05.730> was<00:05:05.940> to

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
defining this game to be our goal was to

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.730 
defining this game to be our goal was to
really<00:05:06.270> do<00:05:06.480> something<00:05:06.750> unexpected<00:05:07.620> and

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
really do something unexpected and

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.620 
really do something unexpected and
that's<00:05:07.920> really<00:05:08.430> along<00:05:08.880> the<00:05:09.030> lines<00:05:09.240> of<00:05:09.450> these

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
that's really along the lines of these

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.300 
that's really along the lines of these
different<00:05:09.840> gameplay<00:05:10.440> modes<00:05:10.710> and<00:05:10.950> deception

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
different gameplay modes and deception

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.730 
different gameplay modes and deception
i'm<00:05:11.520> most<00:05:11.670> excited<00:05:11.850> about<00:05:12.290> how<00:05:13.290> many<00:05:13.500> old

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
i'm most excited about how many old

i'm most excited about how many old
characters<00:05:14.250> were<00:05:14.400> bringing<00:05:14.730> back<00:05:14.940> we're

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
characters were bringing back we're

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.540 
characters were bringing back we're
bringing<00:05:15.960> back<00:05:15.990> characters<00:05:16.770> that<00:05:17.040> people

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
bringing back characters that people

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.219 
bringing back characters that people
have<00:05:17.640> been<00:05:17.730> asking<00:05:17.910> for<00:05:18.360> for<00:05:18.630> quite<00:05:19.470> a<00:05:19.530> while

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:24.420 

but<00:05:23.229> I<00:05:23.259> think<00:05:23.470> all<00:05:23.620> the<00:05:23.770> characters<00:05:24.160> actually

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
but I think all the characters actually

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.760 
but I think all the characters actually
look<00:05:24.669> better<00:05:24.699> than<00:05:25.270> ever<00:05:25.539> we<00:05:26.289> learned<00:05:26.530> a<00:05:26.650> lot

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
look better than ever we learned a lot
