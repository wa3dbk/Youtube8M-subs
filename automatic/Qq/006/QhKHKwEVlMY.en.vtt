00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.649
 Hi, I'm the Yeti and today I wanted to teach 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.480
 the protagonism loosen, I'm going to 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.880
 teach how to build our own 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.880
 city and all pastilla 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:25.250
 The first thing we have to do is a 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:27.050
 sketch and then we do good either 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.660
 you need so much detail you do not feel 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.820
 what I'm talking about the next step 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.190
 is to flatten an area of 9,000 by 9000 what 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.960
 which is once we have the whole area 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.420
 flattened we have to change it by 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.970
 land the next step is to delimit the 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.350
 area to build roads like this 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.810
 that we make some lines to imagine 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.000
 where will they be today in memories 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.000
 I split my house in half 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.250
 seriously going on 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.660
 Later we will go to the 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.830
 construction of buildings 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.480
 materials that we need to 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.900
 build the buildings is uninhibited 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:11.050
 softened stone brick this man is 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.700
 crazily sand is very difficult to build 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.760
 a city and for this I will have 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.570
 All friends, I present you to paca muerte 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.790
 and hello 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.710
 I like neoclassical architecture 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.000
 even some historians call 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.190
 the period of neoclassical architecture 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.500
 of the first half of the 19th century as 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.050
 Romanesque classicism when adding certain 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.970
 expressiveness and exalted spirit to the 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.150
 simplicity and clarity of the sculptures 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.280
 classical Greco-Roman to me simply 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.330
 I like to build buildings with sand 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.330

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.130
