it's been doing a pretty good job for me
and<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.270> really<00:00:21.510> thought<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:21.930> was<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.170> answer

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
and I really thought this was the answer

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.480 
and I really thought this was the answer
the<00:00:24.150> mall<00:00:24.390> had<00:00:24.570> gotten<00:00:24.900> quite<00:00:25.140> dull<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.740> did

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
the mall had gotten quite dull and I did

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.880 
the mall had gotten quite dull and I did
I<00:00:26.519> did<00:00:26.910> take<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.119> little<00:00:27.330> bit<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.599> time<00:00:27.890> to

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
I did take a little bit of time to

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.600 
I did take a little bit of time to
sharpen<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.369> up<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.760> few<00:00:30.300> days<00:00:30.449> back<00:00:31.489> you<00:00:32.489> can

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
sharpen it up a few days back you can

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.080 
sharpen it up a few days back you can
see<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.050> but<00:00:34.520> you<00:00:35.520> know<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.640> really<00:00:35.910> thought

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
see that but you know I really thought

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.340 
see that but you know I really thought
this<00:00:36.239> was<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.809> greatest<00:00:37.020> thing<00:00:37.320> since

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
very lightweight so it's no problem to

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.270 
very lightweight so it's no problem to
pick<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.200> up<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.530> repeat<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.100> know<00:01:14.220> you

and<00:01:46.799> we'll<00:01:47.369> just<00:01:47.520> see<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:48.149> know<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:49.350> can<00:01:49.530> tell

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
and we'll just see you know you can tell

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.130 
and we'll just see you know you can tell
me<00:01:49.860> how<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.130> looks<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.579> know<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.479> lot<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.840> people

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
me how it looks I know a lot of people

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.359 
me how it looks I know a lot of people
have<00:01:52.229> said<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> lot<00:01:52.590> about<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.009> Fisker

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
have said a lot about the Fisker

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.340 
have said a lot about the Fisker
splitting<00:01:53.820> malls<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.329> I'm<00:01:54.810> pretty<00:01:54.990> sure<00:01:55.200> this

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
splitting malls and I'm pretty sure this

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.770 
splitting malls and I'm pretty sure this
is<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.530> same<00:01:55.799> idea<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:57.270> know<00:01:57.360> maybe<00:01:57.540> my

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
is the same idea and you know maybe my

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.990 
is the same idea and you know maybe my
next<00:01:57.840> Maul<00:01:58.259> be<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.530> Fiskars<00:01:59.040> but<00:02:00.710> basically

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
next Maul be a Fiskars but basically

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.190 
next Maul be a Fiskars but basically
I've<00:02:03.000> just<00:02:03.060> learned<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.810> know<00:02:03.990> maybe

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
I've just learned that you know maybe

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.080 
I've just learned that you know maybe
it's<00:02:04.380> not<00:02:04.439> about<00:02:04.740> having<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.189> biggest<00:02:05.790> mall

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
it's not about having the biggest mall

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.119 
it's not about having the biggest mall
in<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.299> block<00:02:06.540> it's<00:02:06.810> it's<00:02:07.229> not<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.530> size<00:02:07.860> the

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
in a block it's it's not the size the

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.910 
in a block it's it's not the size the
mall<00:02:08.310> it's<00:02:08.580> it's<00:02:08.789> how<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:08.970> use<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.420> but<00:02:10.229> let's

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
mall it's it's how you use it but let's

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.350 
mall it's it's how you use it but let's
just<00:02:11.099> move<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.610> camera<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.030> show<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.239> how

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
just move the camera and show you how

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.420 
just move the camera and show you how
they<00:02:12.480> work

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
they work

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.449 
they work
so<00:02:14.420> we'll<00:02:14.599> start<00:02:14.840> with<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.170> big<00:02:15.349> mall<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:15.950> I

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
so we'll start with the big mall and I

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.750 
so we'll start with the big mall and I
you<00:02:16.819> know<00:02:16.909> I<00:02:16.939> don't<00:02:17.180> see<00:02:17.239> any<00:02:17.480> problems

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
you know I don't see any problems

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.289 
you know I don't see any problems
splitting<00:02:19.760> wood<00:02:19.909> with<00:02:20.150> it<00:02:20.920> it's<00:02:21.920> certainly<00:02:22.299> it

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
splitting wood with it it's certainly it

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:45.220 
splitting wood with it it's certainly it
certainly<00:02:23.750> gets<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.200> job<00:02:24.409> done<00:02:43.810> that's<00:02:44.810> a

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
certainly gets the job done that's a

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:53.379 
certainly gets the job done that's a
that's<00:02:45.859> a<00:02:46.129> nice<00:02:46.310> seasoned<00:02:46.849> oak<00:02:52.030> but<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.180> nice

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:53.389 
that's a nice seasoned oak but the nice

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:55.449 
that's a nice seasoned oak but the nice
thing<00:02:53.690> with<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.930> smaller<00:02:54.290> one<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:54.650> you<00:02:55.340> know

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
thing with the smaller one and you know

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.030 
thing with the smaller one and you know
I'm<00:02:55.579> fresh<00:02:55.909> I'm<00:02:56.090> not<00:02:56.269> tired<00:02:56.540> yet<00:02:56.870> but<00:02:57.769> with<00:02:57.920> the

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
I'm fresh I'm not tired yet but with the

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.369 
I'm fresh I'm not tired yet but with the
smaller<00:02:58.340> one<00:02:58.639> here<00:02:59.000> it's<00:02:59.239> just<00:02:59.420> that<00:02:59.689> much

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.339 

it's<00:03:03.379> just<00:03:03.590> that<00:03:03.769> much<00:03:03.920> easier<00:03:04.310> to<00:03:04.639> pick<00:03:04.819> it<00:03:05.000> up

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
it's just that much easier to pick it up

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:19.960 
it's just that much easier to pick it up
and<00:03:07.000> keep<00:03:08.000> going<00:03:08.030> and<00:03:18.129> I'm<00:03:19.129> pretty<00:03:19.430> sure<00:03:19.519> that

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
and keep going and I'm pretty sure that

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.240 
and keep going and I'm pretty sure that
they<00:03:20.120> both<00:03:20.329> split<00:03:21.049> the<00:03:21.290> wood<00:03:21.440> just<00:03:21.680> as<00:03:21.889> quick

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.649 

but<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.760> smaller<00:03:26.120> one<00:03:26.449> the<00:03:26.690> four<00:03:26.900> pound<00:03:27.169> head

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:28.659 
but the smaller one the four pound head

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.589 
but the smaller one the four pound head
was<00:03:29.659> definitely<00:03:30.049> left<00:03:30.260> this<00:03:30.560> work<00:03:31.449> now<00:03:32.449> this

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
was definitely left this work now this

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.149 
was definitely left this work now this
is<00:03:32.780> a<00:03:32.810> piece<00:03:33.079> of<00:03:33.109> unseasoned<00:03:33.769> oak<00:03:33.889> it's<00:03:34.129> a

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159 
is a piece of unseasoned oak it's a

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.089 
is a piece of unseasoned oak it's a
little<00:03:34.340> bit<00:03:34.430> bigger<00:03:34.669> and<00:03:35.680> let's<00:03:36.680> see<00:03:36.859> how<00:03:36.980> this

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
little bit bigger and let's see how this

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.899 
little bit bigger and let's see how this
one<00:03:37.310> works<00:03:38.139> so<00:03:39.139> we'll<00:03:39.290> try<00:03:39.500> to<00:03:39.530> do<00:03:39.829> the<00:03:40.099> take<00:03:40.879> a

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:40.909 
one works so we'll try to do the take a

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:47.290 
one works so we'll try to do the take a
piece<00:03:41.180> off<00:03:41.359> the<00:03:41.510> side<00:03:41.750> here

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:04:06.700 

and<00:03:48.300> we'll<00:03:49.170> do<00:03:49.650> that<00:03:49.680> a<00:03:49.800> couple<00:03:49.860> more<00:03:50.190> times

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:06.710 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.650 

so<00:04:07.710> that's<00:04:07.980> working<00:04:08.250> perfectly<00:04:08.790> fine<00:04:09.060> it's

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
so that's working perfectly fine it's

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.320 
so that's working perfectly fine it's
you<00:04:10.260> know<00:04:10.350> quite<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.620> bit<00:04:10.710> of<00:04:10.920> effort<00:04:11.060> to<00:04:12.060> get<00:04:12.240> it

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
you know quite a bit of effort to get it

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.360 
you know quite a bit of effort to get it
in<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.510> air<00:04:12.690> but<00:04:12.990> now<00:04:13.890> we<00:04:13.950> move<00:04:14.190> to<00:04:14.280> the

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
in the air but now we move to the

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.920 
in the air but now we move to the
smaller<00:04:14.640> mall<00:04:14.940> and<00:04:15.150> I<00:04:15.210> can<00:04:15.360> pretty<00:04:15.510> much<00:04:15.600> do

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
smaller mall and I can pretty much do

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.170 
smaller mall and I can pretty much do
the<00:04:16.109> same<00:04:16.140> thing<00:04:16.590> I<00:04:19.670> definitely<00:04:20.670> do<00:04:20.850> end<00:04:21.060> up

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
the same thing I definitely do end up

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.710 
the same thing I definitely do end up
swinging<00:04:21.540> a<00:04:22.880> little<00:04:23.880> bit<00:04:24.000> faster<00:04:24.510> with<00:04:24.690> a

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
swinging a little bit faster with a

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:35.780 
swinging a little bit faster with a
smaller<00:04:25.110> one<00:04:33.650> but<00:04:34.650> now<00:04:34.860> when<00:04:35.070> it<00:04:35.160> gets<00:04:35.340> time<00:04:35.580> to

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
smaller one but now when it gets time to

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.250 
smaller one but now when it gets time to
break<00:04:35.970> up<00:04:36.150> these<00:04:36.300> smaller<00:04:36.600> pieces<00:04:36.840> let<00:04:37.170> me

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
break up these smaller pieces let me

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.570 
break up these smaller pieces let me
move<00:04:37.380> this<00:04:39.590> when<00:04:40.590> it<00:04:40.680> gets<00:04:40.860> time<00:04:41.100> to<00:04:41.250> break<00:04:41.400> up

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
move this when it gets time to break up

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.659 
move this when it gets time to break up
these<00:04:41.730> smaller<00:04:42.030> pieces<00:04:42.330> I<00:04:43.040> mean<00:04:44.040> it's<00:04:44.370> it's

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
these smaller pieces I mean it's it's

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.170 
these smaller pieces I mean it's it's
right<00:04:44.880> oak<00:04:45.030> it<00:04:45.240> splits<00:04:45.540> very<00:04:45.720> nicely<00:04:45.960> once<00:04:46.290> you

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
right oak it splits very nicely once you

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:56.420 
right oak it splits very nicely once you
once<00:04:48.180> you<00:04:48.300> break<00:04:48.510> the<00:04:48.690> big<00:04:48.870> piece<00:04:54.440> and<00:04:55.440> I<00:04:56.370> don't

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
once you break the big piece and I don't

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:02.110 
once you break the big piece and I don't
even<00:04:56.669> have<00:04:56.850> to<00:04:57.030> take<00:04:57.240> full<00:04:57.450> swings<00:04:59.030> so<00:05:00.030> it's<00:05:00.360> um

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
even have to take full swings so it's um

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.460 

the<00:05:22.370> big<00:05:22.610> one<00:05:22.850> I<00:05:23.210> mean<00:05:23.360> it<00:05:23.450> certainly<00:05:23.840> works<00:05:24.200> it

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
the big one I mean it certainly works it

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:25.990 
the big one I mean it certainly works it
does<00:05:24.620> the<00:05:24.770> job<00:05:25.010> there's<00:05:25.340> nothing<00:05:25.550> wrong<00:05:25.700> with

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
does the job there's nothing wrong with

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.300 
does the job there's nothing wrong with
it<00:05:26.120> I<00:05:26.300> just<00:05:27.110> wonder<00:05:27.740> you<00:05:27.770> know<00:05:27.980> if<00:05:28.160> you're

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
it I just wonder you know if you're

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.650 
it I just wonder you know if you're
moving<00:05:28.430> that<00:05:28.700> much<00:05:28.880> weight<00:05:29.090> I<00:05:29.150> think<00:05:29.330> it's

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
moving that much weight I think it's

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:30.970 
moving that much weight I think it's
you're<00:05:29.960> tiring<00:05:30.290> yourself<00:05:30.350> out<00:05:30.680> a<00:05:30.740> lot<00:05:30.950> quicker

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:30.980 
you're tiring yourself out a lot quicker

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.460 
you're tiring yourself out a lot quicker
and<00:05:31.550> I<00:05:32.360> think<00:05:32.570> you<00:05:32.630> got<00:05:32.720> a<00:05:32.780> better<00:05:33.020> chance<00:05:33.320> of

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
and I think you got a better chance of

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.440 
and I think you got a better chance of
injury<00:05:33.770> because<00:05:34.640> once<00:05:34.850> this<00:05:35.000> gets<00:05:35.240> out<00:05:35.420> of

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
injury because once this gets out of

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.240 
injury because once this gets out of
control<00:05:35.630> if<00:05:36.020> you<00:05:36.110> miss<00:05:36.260> that<00:05:36.410> log<00:05:36.620> I<00:05:36.920> mean<00:05:37.100> who

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
control if you miss that log I mean who

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:43.300 
control if you miss that log I mean who
knows<00:05:37.400> where<00:05:37.640> it's<00:05:37.730> going<00:05:37.850> to<00:05:37.910> end<00:05:38.000> up<00:05:38.920> so<00:05:42.310> you

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
knows where it's going to end up so you

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.890 
knows where it's going to end up so you
know<00:05:43.430> if<00:05:43.550> you<00:05:43.640> go<00:05:43.760> by<00:05:43.940> Lowe's<00:05:44.240> this<00:05:44.600> is<00:05:44.720> where<00:05:44.870> I
