00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
be the VirtualBox you have to download

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.279

it<00:00:28.580> because<00:00:29.580> I'm<00:00:30.000> running<00:00:30.300> android<00:00:31.050> in

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
it because I'm running android in

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.670 
it because I'm running android in
VirtualBox<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.880> second<00:00:33.239> link<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.680> the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
VirtualBox and the second link is the

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.889 
VirtualBox and the second link is the
android<00:00:35.399> OS<00:00:35.550> for<00:00:36.000> VirtualBox

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899

files extract anywhere then if you

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:12.679 
files extract anywhere then if you
install<00:01:07.250> VirtualBox<00:01:08.810> so<00:01:09.810> now<00:01:11.270> in<00:01:12.270> VirtualBox

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
install VirtualBox so now in VirtualBox

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.850 
install VirtualBox so now in VirtualBox
don't<00:01:13.229> go<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.100> new<00:01:14.430> go<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.850> file<00:01:15.439> and<00:01:16.439> go<00:01:16.470> to
