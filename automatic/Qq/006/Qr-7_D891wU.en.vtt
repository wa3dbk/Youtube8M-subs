00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.220
 I would think there times we all 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:37.610
 fundamental texts third establishes 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:41.320
 but also with that is loud developer 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.320
 build there is 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:49.250
 Oberhausen Sterkrade Tor made the saw 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:53.510
 Looked that way and that was the same 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.840
 heavy industry coal and steel as in 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.840
 us 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.950
 it's all a limit 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.390
 that's this layer that's the one 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.009
 entrance to the site 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.799
 Syria is on the other side of the 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:19.119
 cola but I'm with a bit 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:25.369
 Israel Israel and whose suspicions you may suspect 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:29.119
 that is a shabby mother and 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:31.930
 stepfather israel for deliver but in the 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:38.800
 Of course, summer is at home 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.800
 it is sealed so it has nothing to do with grant 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:52.679
 as a photographer I am a traveler than 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.049
 I am a photographer who is everything he is 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.840
 needs to have it yourself too 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.700
 can handle everything from the hand 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.679
 So it really is the truest 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:07.289
 sense of the word a craft I like it 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:10.560
 if I can perform the camera to the eye 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:13.230
 to my body, it can also even I 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.880
 Kathrin also needed it practically 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.090
 not to know my phone already know 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.500
 I know how it works and lifting 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.829
 again the picture looks like 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.319
 that is very instinctive and out of the 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:29.160
 belly out and I think that has it 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:33.540
 to do that already in the earliest 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.340
 Youth has learned what a picture is because of me 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.930
 not because I knew photos or too 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.510
 not before to not at all before the movies 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.510
 but knew because I knew painting 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.959
 I'm at a very specific 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.609
 time I became color photography 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.170
 have my whole childhood over one 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.420
 photographed black and white then I have too 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.930
 in the sixteen seventeen years 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:05.810
 photographed and have at one time 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:09.409
 for the very first time made color photos 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.870
 because I wanted to understand how in the 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:14.260
 American West the light 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.430
 works like that so garish and 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.439
 Health insurances can and the colors like that 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.010
 can be primary as you actually are 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:22.400
 only known from the cinema or from 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.650
 kodachrome 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.680
 but it was really that way and me 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.470
 had the greatest respect and 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.790
 wanted to suspend with that 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.220
 For the first time in my life, one 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.060
 bought color film then you have three 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.919
 for months a whole leash photo wise 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.870
 made through the west criss-cross 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:46.189
 I was on every dust road and up 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:49.220
 every sacred hp of the power seen and 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:51.019
 I just took pictures and that's when I did 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.560
 nothing else but colors 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.560
 understand 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.060
 i am not a landscape photographer myself 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.400
 not interested in the landscape as 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.210
 such but I'm interested in that 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.730
 story 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.560
 I'm interested in the narration of this 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:42.340
 I'm interested in the landscape 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.320
 sign that I see the overall something 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.320
 tell stories either stories 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:51.550
 or a big story the big one 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:54.250
 History and landscapes take place like that 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.850
 a lot of signs and traces that they have when 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:02.280
 you only so far a one looks 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.280
 can tell stories and history 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.990
 that was also an intense moment because 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:14.100
 I'm down there in the valley of this place 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:16.390
 has seen like a little magician 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.390
 and the text I wrote about it 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:21.240
 the climbing still has everything because I 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:26.800
 I think you have to know that 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:30.090
 so you understand the magic too 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:34.000
 is the small city in the south of japan 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:38.830
 where it turned around so the trip to tokyo 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:43.510
 has to go back to ono with 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:45.030
 In the evening, the feeling was holy ground 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:50.250
 to enter 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:50.250
 the area of ​​a lost paradise
