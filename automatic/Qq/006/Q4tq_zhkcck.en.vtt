00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.660 

you<00:01:52.080> also<00:01:52.290> need<00:01:52.650> to<00:01:52.830> take<00:01:53.040> off<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:53.430> cover

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
you also need to take off this cover

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.360 
you also need to take off this cover
here<00:01:54.110> which<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.590> seven<00:01:55.920> mills<00:01:56.070> down<00:01:56.250> the

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
here which is to seven mills down the

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.010 
here which is to seven mills down the
bottom<00:01:56.670> each<00:01:56.850> side<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.510> it<00:01:57.600> will<00:01:57.690> just<00:01:57.840> pop

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
bottom each side and it will just pop

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.350 
bottom each side and it will just pop
off<00:01:58.260> and<00:01:58.710> then<00:01:59.190> take<00:01:59.400> the<00:01:59.520> bottom<00:01:59.640> shroud<00:02:00.090> off

off and then take the bottom shroud off
it<00:02:00.930> has<00:02:01.110> three<00:02:01.670> Torx<00:02:02.670> bits<00:02:02.970> sizes<00:02:03.900> t20<00:02:04.590> and

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
it has three Torx bits sizes t20 and

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.850 
it has three Torx bits sizes t20 and
then<00:02:05.370> that<00:02:05.490> will<00:02:05.580> come<00:02:05.760> off<00:02:07.280> underneath<00:02:08.280> is

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
then that will come off underneath is

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:16.640 
then that will come off underneath is
two<00:02:10.860> plugs<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:13.580> white<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.790> yellow<00:02:15.000> one<00:02:15.650> pop

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
two plugs a white and yellow one pop

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.910 
two plugs a white and yellow one pop
them<00:02:16.890> out<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:18.750> will<00:02:18.900> pull<00:02:19.080> up<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.530> that

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
them out and that will pull up and that

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:28.840 
them out and that will pull up and that
goes<00:02:20.130> into<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.460> clock<00:02:20.640> spring

it's<00:02:47.240> in<00:02:47.300> the<00:02:47.390> center<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:47.930> can<00:02:48.080> do<00:02:48.200> that<00:02:48.320> by

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
it's in the center you can do that by

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:55.140 
it's in the center you can do that by
counting<00:02:48.770> the<00:02:48.950> turns

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150

you've<00:03:24.620> centralized<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.190> clocks<00:03:25.430> clock

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
you've centralized the clocks clock

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.309 
you've centralized the clocks clock
spring<00:03:26.090> and<00:03:26.810> you've<00:03:26.930> got<00:03:27.110> all<00:03:27.200> your

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
spring and you've got all your

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.510 
spring and you've got all your
diagnostic<00:03:28.010> tools<00:03:29.830> with<00:03:30.830> you<00:03:31.040> that<00:03:31.250> we<00:03:31.370> should

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
diagnostic tools with you that we should

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:39.500 
diagnostic tools with you that we should
have<00:03:31.640> soon<00:03:33.820> inside<00:03:34.820> there's<00:03:35.570> a<00:03:35.690> little<00:03:35.959> gear

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.800 

now<00:03:40.319> that's<00:03:40.680> what<00:03:41.220> is<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.180> steering<00:03:42.450> angle

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
now that's what is the steering angle

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.229 
now that's what is the steering angle
sensor<00:03:43.230> as<00:03:44.159> you<00:03:44.430> can<00:03:44.610> see<00:03:44.819> when<00:03:45.060> I<00:03:45.090> move<00:03:45.180> that

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
sensor as you can see when I move that

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.210 
sensor as you can see when I move that
steering<00:03:48.239> angle<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:49.049> percentage<00:03:49.590> and<00:03:50.040> the

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
steering angle the percentage and the

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.140 
steering angle the percentage and the
right<00:03:50.400> there<00:03:51.500> will<00:03:52.500> change

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:04.369 

the<00:03:56.150> main<00:03:56.360> aim<00:03:56.569> is<00:03:56.870> to<00:03:56.930> get<00:03:57.230> it<00:03:57.379> on<00:03:58.330> zero

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.069 

it's<00:04:04.799> really<00:04:05.099> fiddly<00:04:05.459> sometimes<00:04:05.909> you<00:04:06.599> get

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
it's really fiddly sometimes you get

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.649 
it's really fiddly sometimes you get
there<00:04:07.639> now<00:04:08.639> when<00:04:08.849> you<00:04:08.969> pop<00:04:09.180> in<00:04:09.329> the<00:04:09.450> clock

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:09.659 
there now when you pop in the clock

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:16.460 
there now when you pop in the clock
spring<00:04:09.930> back<00:04:10.139> in<00:04:12.379> it<00:04:13.379> is<00:04:13.439> geared<00:04:14.989> so<00:04:15.989> it'll

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
spring back in it is geared so it'll

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.960 
spring back in it is geared so it'll
turn<00:04:16.739> occasionally<00:04:17.699> I<00:04:19.669> normally<00:04:20.669> set<00:04:20.880> it

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.420 
turn occasionally I normally set it
about<00:04:21.150> 6.5<00:04:21.780> and<00:04:22.320> then<00:04:22.530> put<00:04:22.770> and<00:04:22.949> then<00:04:23.099> pop<00:04:23.280> the
