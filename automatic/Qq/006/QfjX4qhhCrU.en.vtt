00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.570
 because this is a speed test 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:16.849
 between printers 110 x and 4 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.849
 zm 400 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.710
 zte 230 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:29.490
 and a small desk a girl 420 t 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.360
 we will send each one of them 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:37.240
 the same template 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.240
 and the same number of labels 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.360
 so 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.290
 in the account of three 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.290
 We are going to send you 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.260
 these templates and 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:16.330
 let's visualize the speed and the 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:16.330
 difference between each of them 1 2 3 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.420
 but not 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.820
 two 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.890
 here we have 5 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.700
 6 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.189
 10 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.640
 and 14 inches of speed 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.640
 respectively
