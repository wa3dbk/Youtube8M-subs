 convince the coaches to the public 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:18.569
 that is seeing them very well to know 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.219

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.170
 standing coaches we go directly to 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:28.489

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.409

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.409

 speaking that way about him that's the 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.739
 truth is so real that it moves you from one 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.019
 way long ago and I never compare anything 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.329
 but a while ago we saw a person doubt 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.980
 say if I was in love or not if I had 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.319
 in love I do not doubt it 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.720
 and you do not doubt it, many can not see it 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.430
 they do not believe in him but you stop and say 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.230

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.359

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:08.480
 I wish I really have the world 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.879

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.019

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:14.720

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.519
