a extra pair of white laces but my

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.840 
a extra pair of white laces but my
opinion<00:02:35.960> I<00:02:36.110> think<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.590> Grail<00:02:36.890> asses<00:02:37.340> look<00:02:37.730> a

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
opinion I think the Grail asses look a

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.740 
opinion I think the Grail asses look a
lot<00:02:38.000> better<00:02:38.590> probably<00:02:39.590> do<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.770> white<00:02:39.950> laces

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
lot better probably do the white laces

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.730 
lot better probably do the white laces
when<00:02:41.750> there's<00:02:41.930> a<00:02:41.960> kind<00:02:42.050> of<00:02:42.170> a<00:02:42.320> game<00:02:42.590> or
