00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
bottle like this and four to five months

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.390 
bottle like this and four to five months
it<00:04:41.810> depends<00:04:42.230> on<00:04:42.290> how<00:04:42.500> much<00:04:42.710> you<00:04:42.860> need<00:04:42.890> to<00:04:43.220> cover

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
it depends on how much you need to cover

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.460 
it depends on how much you need to cover
your<00:04:43.580> face<00:04:43.640> and<00:04:44.570> if<00:04:44.690> you're<00:04:44.810> using<00:04:44.990> it<00:04:45.230> twice<00:04:45.380> a

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
your face and if you're using it twice a

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.860 
your face and if you're using it twice a

so I really really like these two
products<00:05:49.790> and<00:05:50.000> and<00:05:50.330> like<00:05:50.810> I<00:05:50.930> said<00:05:50.990> they<00:05:51.230> are

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.980 
products and and like I said they are
expensive<00:05:51.890> but<00:05:52.490> I<00:05:52.820> think<00:05:53.419> they<00:05:53.540> are<00:05:53.690> worth<00:05:53.960> the

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
expensive but I think they are worth the

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.930 
expensive but I think they are worth the
investment<00:05:54.230> most<00:05:55.190> of<00:05:55.310> these<00:05:55.370> products<00:05:55.760> pretty

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
investment most of these products pretty

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.430 
investment most of these products pretty
much<00:05:56.180> any<00:05:56.419> of<00:05:56.510> the<00:05:56.630> products<00:05:56.930> that<00:05:56.990> I<00:05:57.080> have<00:05:57.140> it

much any of the products that I have it

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.090 
much any of the products that I have it
takes<00:05:57.710> me<00:05:57.980> a<00:05:58.480> good<00:05:59.480> four<00:06:00.050> to<00:06:00.080> five<00:06:00.380> months<00:06:00.590> in

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.100

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.950
