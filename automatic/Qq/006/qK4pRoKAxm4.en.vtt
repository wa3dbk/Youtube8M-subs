order for the sync to work but there we

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.810 
order for the sync to work but there we

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
go to devices completely in sync again I

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.780 
go to devices completely in sync again I
can<00:02:27.820> reorder<00:02:28.380> these<00:02:29.380> items<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.250> that<00:02:30.370> helps
