00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.320
 lately many people have 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.140
 interested in acquiring a camera 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.199
 digital SLR camera maybe with 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.869
 the memory of the analog SLR 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.400
 that they used scrolls that were very 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.109
 Sophisticated really any 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.300
 person can buy this type of 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.460
 cameras but they have now 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.649
 appeared on the market some equipment that 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.079
 they occupy an interesting place among 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.210
 small digital compact cameras and 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.640
 the SLR professionals that's why 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.760
 we recommend evaluating before buying 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.010
 some issues that make the subject if 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.320
 We are not going to dedicate ourselves professionally to 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.160
 the photograph the equipment called 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.350
 semi-pro are a good option for 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.230
 fact that teams reflection 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.930
 scalable is to say we can go 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.540
 buying peripheral accessories like 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.910
 different types of lenses and flash 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.700
 our needs is born my prost 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.740
 They have fixed lenses that is to say that they do not 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.620
 they admit other optics than those that bring 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.000
 which is also fixed but keep in mind 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.660
 that many of these cameras come 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.390
 provided with more than 30 x zoom and large 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:28.020
 angular incorporated below them 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.760
 I show the panasonic fct to 70 that covers 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.600
 almost the entire spectrum of an amateur 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.600
 advanced 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.930
 Y 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.880
 optical zoom of 60 x that gives like 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:27.030
 result a record focal length of 20 mm to 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:31.860
 1,200 millimeters with a luminosity of 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.570
 2 859 for those photographers who do not 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.210
 they look for complications they want 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.390
 have a powerful camera the fct a 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:42.210
 70 can be a good option very for 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.420
 keep in mind the zoom is an authentic 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.610
 optical engineering work of 14 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.120
 elements with 6 special lenses that 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.330
 account 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.410
 with nine spherical surfaces and three 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.260
 low chromatic dispersion lenses 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.240
 the approach factor is very 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.120
 versatile and the stabilization system 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.220
 active optics or jesse that results 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.250
 essential in this type of objectives 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.860
 It is very effective to achieve photos without 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.810
 trepidation features a full hd video 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.620
 also has an advanced microphone 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.710
 oversized with reduction of 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.770
 noises and anti wind screen that 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:24.920
 combines the lcd screen with a vf viewer 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.980
 of 200 as mentioned earlier 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.320
 this type of equipment is very versatile and 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.690
 practical if we want to manage with little 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.910
 equipment and we also avoid 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.520
 embark on a major investment 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.650
 of money that would require buying other 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.080
 accessories that maybe not 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.620
 we need for the functionality that 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.620
 We are gonna give
