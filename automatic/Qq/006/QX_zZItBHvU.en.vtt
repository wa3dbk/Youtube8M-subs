00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.660
 hello youtube people that the team leave 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:20.400
 with one more video I'm here with the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:25.189
 My call, I'm going to start my series. 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.060
 chamack a little under flame restoration is 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:32.399
 elemental not to talk about 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.920
 because it's kind of complicated 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.239
 I've played a lot with him before. 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.500
 but now it's for me more certain and 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.530
 I got the equipment they are 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.690
 totally different from emmental apple 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.690
 ii restoration 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:57.530
 so I will not talk about 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:01:01.469
 perfected only elementary and 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.049
 and how can you see me 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:17.280
 main expertise and restoration 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:21.000
 I'm reread to look for my set based 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:25.040
 in intellect mastery and rightness 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:34.079
 and it's the same set that I use to 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:37.380
 dpf I use to river even 7 that use the 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:40.530
 two then it 's even easier for me 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.659
 I'm here with this transmoc here 's a 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.100
 shield that one takes in one of the 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.470
 first ray of the agent 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.540
 ax also think that in the second haiti 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.820
 said no one in the 717 ps normal 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:01.710
 Heroic hero, what are you going to do? 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:04.560
 in this set of csi or hitler that I 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.439
 it depended more on the critical hit 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.119
 intellect and odiler gives more spirit and 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.910
 but three if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.640
 hence the happy name just to record those 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.380
 videos 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.050

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.770

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:26.000
