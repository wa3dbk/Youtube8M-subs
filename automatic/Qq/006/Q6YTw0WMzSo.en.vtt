00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
design was sort of interesting a little

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.490 
design was sort of interesting a little
bit<00:01:09.630> different<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:11.130> also<00:01:11.310> has<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> garden<00:01:12.270> and

any sort of a garden of any size even a
small<00:01:15.990> one<00:01:16.080> like<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.850> in<00:01:17.850> Japan<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.509> real

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
small one like that in Japan is a real

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.190 
small one like that in Japan is a real
bonus<00:01:19.200> because<00:01:19.680> it's<00:01:20.070> rare<00:01:20.720> even<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.780> country

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
bonus because it's rare even in country

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.080 
bonus because it's rare even in country
towns<00:01:22.409> like<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.680> one<00:01:23.009> because<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.909> houses

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
towns like this one because the houses

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.140 
towns like this one because the houses
tend<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.630> be<00:01:24.750> on<00:01:25.100> 200<00:01:26.100> square<00:01:26.369> meter<00:01:26.549> blocks<00:01:26.909> is

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
tend to be on 200 square meter blocks is

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.969 
tend to be on 200 square meter blocks is
about<00:01:27.420> average<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:28.049> this<00:01:28.140> particular<00:01:28.530> town

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
about average in this particular town

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.120 
about average in this particular town
150<00:01:29.939> square<00:01:30.150> meter<00:01:30.450> blocks<00:01:30.689> not<00:01:30.900> unusual<00:01:31.439> so

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
150 square meter blocks not unusual so

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.230 
150 square meter blocks not unusual so
really<00:01:32.759> small<00:01:33.320> here's<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.409> good<00:01:34.590> example

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
really small here's a good example

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.719 
really small here's a good example
there's<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.329> two-story<00:01:36.810> house<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.470> that's<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
there's a two-story house and that's the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.170 
there's a two-story house and that's the
entire<00:01:39.119> garden<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.500> can<00:01:40.710> see<00:01:40.920> there<00:01:41.189> and

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
entire garden that you can see there and

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.230 
entire garden that you can see there and
once<00:01:42.390> again<00:01:42.720> that's<00:01:43.170> unusual<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.820> get<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.030> house

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
once again that's unusual to get a house

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.149 
once again that's unusual to get a house
with<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.479> duff<00:01:45.689> garden<00:01:46.110> like<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.320> that's

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
with a duff garden like that that's

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.010 
with a duff garden like that that's
pretty<00:01:47.520> good<00:01:47.729> compared<00:01:48.540> with<00:01:48.630> lot<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.869> the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
pretty good compared with lot of the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.600 
pretty good compared with lot of the
others<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.560> it's<00:01:49.680> got<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:49.890> garden

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
others so it's got that garden

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.639
