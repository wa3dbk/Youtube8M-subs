00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.279 
of the original one the original one
takes<00:00:15.769> is<00:00:16.280> quite<00:00:16.850> easy<00:00:17.120> to<00:00:17.240> do<00:00:17.510> I<00:00:17.540> like<00:00:17.960> doing

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
takes is quite easy to do I like doing

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.140 
takes is quite easy to do I like doing
it<00:00:18.410> but<00:00:18.619> sometimes<00:00:19.130> it<00:00:19.310> can<00:00:19.430> become<00:00:19.760> really

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
it but sometimes it can become really

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.689 
it but sometimes it can become really
messy<00:00:20.510> and<00:00:20.539> not<00:00:20.869> that<00:00:21.140> pretty<00:00:21.920> and<00:00:22.189> it<00:00:22.490> just

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
messy and not that pretty and it just

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.130 
messy and not that pretty and it just
takes<00:00:22.910> a<00:00:23.000> lot<00:00:23.090> more<00:00:23.330> time<00:00:23.510> than<00:00:23.539> this<00:00:23.869> one<00:00:24.109> does

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
takes a lot more time than this one does

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.640 
takes a lot more time than this one does
and<00:00:24.760> it<00:00:25.760> looks<00:00:26.029> exactly<00:00:26.210> like<00:00:26.570> a<00:00:27.050> fishtail

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650

like so and then you're gonna pull it

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.980 
like so and then you're gonna pull it
down<00:01:39.980> again<00:01:41.530> and<00:01:42.880> open<00:01:43.880> it<00:01:43.970> again<00:01:44.090> and<00:01:44.479> loop<00:01:44.840> it

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
down again and open it again and loop it

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.600 
down again and open it again and loop it
again<00:01:45.340> like<00:01:46.340> that<00:01:47.890> and<00:01:48.890> you<00:01:49.010> might<00:01:49.190> need<00:01:49.370> to<00:01:49.430> do

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
again like that and you might need to do

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.540 
again like that and you might need to do
it<00:01:49.729> three<00:01:50.030> or<00:01:50.870> however<00:01:51.050> many<00:01:51.710> times<00:01:51.800> your<00:01:52.280> hair

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
it three or however many times your hair

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.130 
it three or however many times your hair
needs<00:01:53.150> it<00:01:53.330> so<00:01:54.020> I<00:01:54.050> did<00:01:54.350> mine<00:01:54.560> three<00:01:54.920> loops<00:01:56.140> and

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
needs it so I did mine three loops and

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.780 
needs it so I did mine three loops and
that's<00:01:57.440> how<00:01:57.590> it<00:01:57.740> turns<00:01:57.950> out<00:01:58.190> and<00:01:58.430> you<00:01:58.490> can<00:01:58.610> also

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
that's how it turns out and you can also

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.850 
that's how it turns out and you can also
just<00:01:59.450> like<00:01:59.600> style<00:01:59.930> your<00:02:00.140> bangs<00:02:00.320> or<00:02:00.560> whatever

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
just like style your bangs or whatever

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.850 
just like style your bangs or whatever
and<00:02:01.240> that's<00:02:02.240> how<00:02:02.510> it<00:02:02.630> looks<00:02:02.870> and<00:02:03.110> I<00:02:03.470> think<00:02:03.710> this

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
and that's how it looks and I think this

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.760 
and that's how it looks and I think this
is<00:02:04.040> really<00:02:04.250> easy<00:02:04.400> to<00:02:04.909> do<00:02:05.090> and<00:02:05.450> it<00:02:05.540> really<00:02:06.260> fix<00:02:06.560> a

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
is really easy to do and it really fix a

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.740 
is really easy to do and it really fix a
fist<00:02:07.400> out<00:02:07.580> really<00:02:07.820> easily<00:02:08.060> I<00:02:08.330> hope<00:02:08.509> you<00:02:08.629> guys
