00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.740
 teachers are also beginning to be 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.290
 part of the characters of the uv of 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.420

 project that recently started the 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.310
 university and that surely already 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.370
 will begin to make news because it is 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.980
 using what previously or other 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.800
 companies scraps a project that has 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.719
 by name high product design 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.180
 social and environmental impact 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.860
 and you are already 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.750
 looking surely behind us 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.280
 It has to do with a park that we are going to 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.390
 donate or that linked gustiniano will 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.320
 donate soon to a school not 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.179
 Do not waste materials in the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.670
 invitation that program 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:02.309
 industrial engineering that are not for 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.530
 vote that are not to burn that are 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.159
 to play welcome to the characters 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.159
 of the water 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.250
 and we greet you from our beautiful 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.960
 university facilities 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.610
 Augustinian our green zone where 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.500
 surely you have already seen it or 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.630
 otherwise, we take advantage and tell them 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.250

 until the justinian nail we salute to 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.490
 our teacher he is part of 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.940
 industrial engineering program that 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.320
 llama henry hernández profe welcome 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.510
 It's good that I'm here too 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.930
 I go through the characters of the many 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.490
 thanks a surprise for me background 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.650
 we are seeing part of what 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.560
 you are going to donate soon because 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.360
 they decide to take advantage of all these 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.800
 resources that we see here that man that 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.930
 they reject that you are today 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.060
 turning into a playground 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.610
 industrial engineering is a subject 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.200
 that you can not see far from the 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.820
 corporate social responsibility 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.360
 Augustinian University has just opened 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.790
 a space for this very important topic 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.590
 and he works very hard on that aspect in 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.700
 the matter of product design and 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.410
 processes this idea was generated and the 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.230
 thanks to the students also that 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.570
 they collaborated a lot got this 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.850
 product that soon as you 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.610
 fact will be donated by the 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.530
 university profe so many things can be 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.690
 do with the tires in this case by 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.459
 example we are seeing a park how 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.959
 it was all that process because also 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.690
 we understand that the students 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.400
 participated are protagonists of a 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.959
 idea that arises basically from its 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.030
 classic if I from the point of view of 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.850
 the subject I wanted to take it out a bit of the 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.430
 theory and make it more practical to do that 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.200
 the students not only practiced 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.570
 what you see the matter but what 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.390
 made them achieve it but in addition to 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.760
 that create an impact 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.230
 that it was a product that would 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:17.450
 something more than just show 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.300
 we work a subject that is called goes to 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.550
 design for the five senses and in 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:26.060
 this case we designed for the game to 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.250
 the sight for touch and especially 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.190
 for a subject that personally I 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.750
 it is very interesting that it is childhood and 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.850
 in addition it is also helping the environment 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.440
 environment not now we said this 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.080
 tire usually burn them throw them 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.570
 out there and what they produce is from some 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.220
 way to say it upset for one's own 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.560
 planet you from the engineering 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.019
 are also contributing to the 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.480
 improvement of the earth I and I arrived 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:53.690
 almost every day by bus 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.239
 avenue cali to the university and I see with 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.130
 sadness when it arrived and when I leave 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.790
 number of tires that leave thrown 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:04.010
 down the avenue so leave between the idea 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.130
 that I ever had the photos that 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:10.310
 they come on the internet and these tires said 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.650
 I have to do something and that something came up 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.260
 this effect and I proposed to the 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.290
 boys collect the tires 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.660
 and I did not buy it they went out to the 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:24.590
 they picked them up and took her 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.900
 your vehicles or even taxiing 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.120
 to their places where they could 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.010
 work and this is the result from 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.630
 there because we are engaged in the 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.270
 unne gustina also with commitment 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.860
 with the social responsibility of 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.680
 Bogotá mainly and obviously 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.600
 impacts the rest of the planet joys 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.789
 games smiles better said you 're going 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.830
 to deliver many feelings and 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:48.169
 emotions to these children up to where 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.129
 Briefly, how far will you go? 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.649
 this project 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:55.860
 the university the university 

00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:58.649
 Augustinian has a very big vision 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.419
 this project will reach as far as 

00:04:58.649 --> 00:05:02.639
 same people allow it this is a 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:05.309
 gift we will continue 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:08.189
 developing in the design class of 

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:10.889
 products products of this size 

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:13.080
 this mood and logical product of 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:15.929
 technological we think we get to 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.089
 develop even robotic arms in 

00:05:15.929 --> 00:05:20.399
 go ahead let's see how far 

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:22.589
 we arrived then thank you very much for 

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:24.959
 accompany us hopefully we get very 

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:26.789
 far that's the most important thing the

 gustiniano or in our social networks 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:24.840
 on university facebook agustiniana and 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:27.060
 on twitter arroba an already taste reminds 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.590
 which ends between next week we
