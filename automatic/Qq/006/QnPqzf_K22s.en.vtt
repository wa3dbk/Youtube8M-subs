muscle out of exercise like this you
need<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.210> keep<00:00:48.360> your<00:00:48.510> time<00:00:48.780> under<00:00:49.050> tension<00:00:49.079> at

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
need to keep your time under tension at

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.740 
need to keep your time under tension at
its<00:00:50.219> maximum<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.940> want<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.149> keep<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.390> muscle

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
its maximum you want to keep the muscle

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.830 
its maximum you want to keep the muscle
under<00:00:52.020> tension<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.590> entire<00:00:52.860> time<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:54.420> lot

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
under tension the entire time so a lot

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.750 
under tension the entire time so a lot
of<00:00:54.960> guys<00:00:55.079> will<00:00:55.379> make<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.530> mistake<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.250> resting

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
of guys will make a mistake of resting

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.580 
of guys will make a mistake of resting
at<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.879> bottom<00:00:57.140> so<00:00:58.140> when<00:00:58.320> you're<00:00:58.440> lifting

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
at the bottom so when you're lifting

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.680 
at the bottom so when you're lifting
here<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.309> we're<00:00:59.489> going<00:00:59.670> down<00:00:59.879> clasp<00:01:00.180> your

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
here and we're going down clasp your

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.020 
here and we're going down clasp your
muscle<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.109> hardly<00:01:01.440> under<00:01:01.649> tension<00:01:02.010> at<00:01:02.129> all<00:01:02.219> so

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
muscle is hardly under tension at all so

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.920 
muscle is hardly under tension at all so
this<00:01:03.890> isn't<00:01:04.890> really<00:01:05.100> doing<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.489> whole<00:01:05.610> lot<00:01:05.930> now

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
this isn't really doing a whole lot now

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.500 
this isn't really doing a whole lot now
when<00:01:07.860> Phil<00:01:08.100> Heath<00:01:08.340> does<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:08.729> exercise<00:01:09.240> he'll

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
when Phil Heath does this exercise he'll

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.990 
when Phil Heath does this exercise he'll
actually<00:01:09.659> work<00:01:10.020> out<00:01:10.170> one<00:01:10.470> arm<00:01:10.710> at<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.920> time

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
actually work out one arm at a time

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.460 
actually work out one arm at a time
he'll<00:01:12.000> never<00:01:12.210> rest<00:01:12.630> he'll<00:01:12.869> never<00:01:12.990> lock<00:01:13.260> at<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
he'll never rest he'll never lock at the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.750 
he'll never rest he'll never lock at the
bottom<00:01:13.770> will<00:01:13.950> keep<00:01:14.070> his<00:01:14.220> time<00:01:14.490> under<00:01:14.640> tension

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
bottom will keep his time under tension

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.420 
bottom will keep his time under tension
at<00:01:15.240> its<00:01:15.390> maximum<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.500> ho<00:01:16.619> go<00:01:16.740> nice<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.220> slow

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
at its maximum so ho go nice and slow

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.219 
at its maximum so ho go nice and slow
and<00:01:17.460> controlled<00:01:17.689> help<00:01:18.689> keep<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.020> weight<00:01:19.200> in

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
and controlled help keep the weight in

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.149 
and controlled help keep the weight in
motion<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.770> whole<00:01:19.799> time<00:01:20.570> just<00:01:21.570> like<00:01:21.780> that

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
motion the whole time just like that

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.620 
motion the whole time just like that
this<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.340> completely<00:01:23.909> different<00:01:24.060> than<00:01:24.540> doing

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
this is completely different than doing

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.679 
this is completely different than doing
it<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.930> other<00:01:25.020> way<00:01:26.960> switch<00:01:27.960> arms<00:01:29.570> squeeze<00:01:30.570> the

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
it the other way switch arms squeeze the

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.830 
it the other way switch arms squeeze the
bicep<00:01:31.110> at<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.320> top<00:01:32.119> everything<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.420> slow<00:01:33.689> and

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
bicep at the top everything is slow and

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:43.679 
bicep at the top everything is slow and
controlled<00:01:34.100> under<00:01:35.100> tension<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.520> entire<00:01:35.850> time

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.389 

another<00:01:44.689> tip<00:01:44.990> that<00:01:45.020> pro<00:01:45.409> bodybuilders<00:01:46.009> use<00:01:46.070> is

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
another tip that pro bodybuilders use is

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.219 
another tip that pro bodybuilders use is
I<00:01:46.520> incorporate<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.149> concept<00:01:47.329> of<00:01:47.750> muscle

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
I incorporate the concept of muscle

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.169 
I incorporate the concept of muscle
confusion<00:01:48.380> a<00:01:48.920> lot<00:01:49.280> of<00:01:49.369> people<00:01:49.579> think<00:01:49.789> muscle

confusion a lot of people think muscle

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:52.090 
confusion a lot of people think muscle
confusion<00:01:50.329> is<00:01:50.780> a<00:01:50.810> bunch<00:01:51.110> of<00:01:51.229> BS<00:01:51.380> but<00:01:51.860> this

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
confusion is a bunch of BS but this
