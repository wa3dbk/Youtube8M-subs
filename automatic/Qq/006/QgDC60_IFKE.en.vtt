00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.619

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:28.029
 Here you can charge the fertilizer 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:31.210
 for the lager camp we are 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.630
 here in schÃ¶ffelding in the place have 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.630
 you this one 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.220
 Landhandel here could load fertilizer 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.170
 and since people have complained 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.390
 dignified thread and they could 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.940
 no fertilizer load yes I want to 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.940
 show you how to do it today 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.720
 I have this mod with this theme 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.760
 ticks the downloadlink I will 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.410
 look at the video description 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:05.930
 use that on you 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:08.300
 so I can download so I stop 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.260
 with the wheel loader and the fertilizer bags 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:16.380
 the fertilizer huber 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:22.899
 individually in the trailer 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:28.659
 so easily tipped her easy 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:31.200
 there is another one out there 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.200
 motto 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.710
 and that is that 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:43.900
 this pendant is here this your skin 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.710
 a little easier and yes I think so 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.710
 not now 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.320
 how do I say 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.070
 not so yes it is not so 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.070
 real, then 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.880
 who wants to play it more real that 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.350
 I recommend these big packs and these 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.060
 Trailer can be directly to the student 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.929
 drive and just press loaded 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.050
 and then he gets it with fertilizer 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.390
 So I think this big packs is that 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.760
 it makes it more fun 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.379
 so you can stop 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.569
 They are then on this trek drive 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.770
 just he and then forms the 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.160
 hangers also with fertilizer 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.160
 sid 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.640
 Then I had a question 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.440
 in fact 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.320
 have some people they complained 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.210
 could 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.480
 do not buy the box 42 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.640
 I can do that for you 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.650
 also like to show where to get that 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:53.220
 can buy so here we are so here 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:57.620
 is the sale of the new fields, the 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.700
 to get the time left are fields 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.879
 legal cases euro as you can see 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:06.780
 until field 41 so you think so great 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:08.849
 shit where it goes 442 year 442 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.599
 just a floor higher in this room 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:14.129
 and there is field 42 lonely and alone 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:17.280
 in this beautiful huge room 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.810
 Here you can watch the buy Sun 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.750
 I have 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.680
 I hope I got you something 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.959
 was fast in my yard and load here 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.380
 fertilizer from then also see the back where 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.590
 you have to tilt the rhine so have here 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.590
 we the 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.680
 the fertilizer 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.790
 the Roman camp 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.790
 there you can have a look 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:49.819
 stefan roth that works only with 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:51.290
 can charge the phone so yes, the fertilizer 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.620
 first the trailer was to get in 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.760
 Now the greater challenge so 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.519
 That's why I have you the little one 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.349
 video made here you can do it 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.410
 really use every trailer 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:06.590
 For example, fertilizer can be loaded by 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.959
 surf effect from the tannenhof web 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.420
 you also have to work 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:18.150
 fill with the big bags and this one 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:21.040
 the only one close is the one that holds 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.400
 fertilizer directly loads 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.400
 so 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.370
 Let's see if I'm right here on the 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.599
 carrier on it 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.320
 nothing right 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.800
 now 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:48.070
 so it has to be up close 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.680
 of fertilizer here in our 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.350
 oh well very 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.720
 He does not hit but it gets here 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:59.270
 stored 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:03.200
 then you can with euro 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:06.190
 what am I doing here today if so 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.190
 you then dumped 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.460
 we wait again until it is as far 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.090
 can you with your fertilizer machine 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.090
 Under these 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.800
 drive this cargo carrier and then 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.650
 Eidinger 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.189
 since filled can not equal from 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.189
 make out of here 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:44.979
 so now I have to have that 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:50.059
 now cut because I myself 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:51.229
 despair how it works 

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:55.819
