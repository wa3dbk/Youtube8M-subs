00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
let up a little on the channel so we're

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.420 
let up a little on the channel so we're
gonna<00:01:39.960> go<00:01:40.170> directly<00:01:40.710> underneath<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.100> third

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
gonna go directly underneath the third

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.100 
gonna go directly underneath the third
one<00:01:42.380> again<00:01:43.380> pulling<00:01:44.009> up<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.250> down<00:01:44.899> you<00:01:45.899> want

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
diamond we're gonna skip a hole here

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:01.080 
diamond we're gonna skip a hole here
again<00:01:55.829> another<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.250> lock

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090

and now right here is we're gonna get

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.730 
and now right here is we're gonna get
the<00:02:03.530> low<00:02:03.740> chanting<00:02:05.500> because<00:02:06.500> we're<00:02:06.619> gonna

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
the low chanting because we're gonna

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.199 
the low chanting because we're gonna
double<00:02:07.040> up<00:02:07.310> here<00:02:07.549> so<00:02:07.759> we're<00:02:07.880> going<00:02:08.060> over<00:02:08.830> and

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
double up here so we're going over and

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.010 
double up here so we're going over and
over<00:02:11.209> again<00:02:11.510> so<00:02:13.360> kind<00:02:14.360> of<00:02:14.480> looks<00:02:14.630> like<00:02:14.690> this

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
over again so kind of looks like this

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.550 
over again so kind of looks like this
nice<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:15.800> clean<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:16.340> flush<00:02:17.260> we're<00:02:18.260> gonna<00:02:18.380> go

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
nice and clean and flush we're gonna go

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.229 
nice and clean and flush we're gonna go
directly<00:02:18.800> underneath<00:02:19.400> even<00:02:19.880> though<00:02:20.000> it's<00:02:20.180> a

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
directly underneath even though it's a

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.160
