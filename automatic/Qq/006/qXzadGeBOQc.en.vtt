 computer based on a m d for 25 thousand 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.830
 rubles and so let's move on to the build 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:17.600

 just a 4 gigabyte ddr3 flop 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:37.620
 kingston and since we have a budget cut and 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:43.170
 and if there were 2, this is no longer 25 thousand 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:45.300
 rubles we all understand so hard disk 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.700

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.500
 sata3 in digital countries here I added 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.710
 thermal grease in the rest of the assembly and has not been 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.530
 and some asked that's why type 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.390
 forgotten time to add thermal grease 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.809
 Yes guys agree with this plow legs 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.020
