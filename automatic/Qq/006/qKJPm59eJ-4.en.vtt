00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
know what I'm doing and copy this code

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.060 
know what I'm doing and copy this code
now<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:49.650> just<00:02:49.800> copy<00:02:50.600> paste<00:02:51.740> make<00:02:52.740> sure<00:02:52.920> that

now you just copy paste make sure that
the<00:02:53.220> same<00:02:53.460> position<00:02:53.820> of<00:02:53.910> pause<00:02:54.210> at<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.480> bottom

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
the same position of pause at the bottom

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.500 
the same position of pause at the bottom
and<00:02:54.780> such<00:02:55.020> and<00:02:55.460> this<00:02:56.460> bit<00:02:56.760> here<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:57.120> very

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
and such and this bit here is very

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.900 
and such and this bit here is very
important<00:02:58.050> make<00:02:58.350> sure<00:02:58.380> that<00:02:59.010> CraftBukkit<00:02:59.790> the

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
important make sure that CraftBukkit the

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.260 
important make sure that CraftBukkit the
same<00:03:00.120> disename<00:03:00.540> here<00:03:01.550> it's<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.730> same<00:03:02.970> as<00:03:03.000> this

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
same disename here it's the same as this

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.540 
same disename here it's the same as this
name<00:03:03.510> so<00:03:03.690> you<00:03:04.110> can<00:03:04.290> either<00:03:04.440> change<00:03:04.860> this<00:03:05.250> to

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
name so you can either change this to

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.970 
name so you can either change this to
CraftBukkit<00:03:06.150> or<00:03:06.330> change<00:03:07.080> this<00:03:07.470> to<00:03:07.710> what<00:03:07.830> is

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
CraftBukkit or change this to what is

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.620 
CraftBukkit or change this to what is
this<00:03:08.100> course<00:03:08.280> so<00:03:08.460> we<00:03:08.790> have<00:03:09.210> both<00:03:09.450> of<00:03:09.570> these

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
this course so we have both of these

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.060 
this course so we have both of these
things<00:03:09.810> for<00:03:10.050> CraftBukkit<00:03:10.500> now<00:03:10.590> so<00:03:10.800> they<00:03:10.920> can

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
things for CraftBukkit now so they can

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.190 
things for CraftBukkit now so they can
interact<00:03:11.240> just<00:03:12.240> leave<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.510> door<00:03:12.630> ajar<00:03:12.690> at<00:03:13.080> the
