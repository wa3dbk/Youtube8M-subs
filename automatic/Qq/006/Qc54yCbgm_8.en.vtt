couple of our products first of all

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.420 
couple of our products first of all
we've<00:00:15.000> got<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.240> RP<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.660> thousand<00:00:16.260> which<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:17.100> a

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
we've got the RP a thousand which is a

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.359 
we've got the RP a thousand which is a
world<00:00:17.789> first<00:00:17.880> turntable<00:00:18.680> first<00:00:19.680> middy

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
world first turntable first middy

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.359 
world first turntable first middy
integrated<00:00:21.320> turntable<00:00:22.320> what<00:00:22.980> we've<00:00:23.100> done<00:00:23.220> is

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
integrated turntable what we've done is

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.460 
integrated turntable what we've done is
we've<00:00:23.519> looked<00:00:23.640> at<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.000> classic<00:00:24.869> turntable

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
we've looked at the classic turntable

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.589 
we've looked at the classic turntable
and<00:00:25.619> overworked<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.369> so<00:00:26.849> first<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.420> all<00:00:27.480> the

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
and overworked it so first of all the

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:28.910 
and overworked it so first of all the
classic<00:00:27.900> turntable<00:00:28.380> used<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.619> have<00:00:28.740> around

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
classic turntable used to have around

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.269 
classic turntable used to have around
one<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.310> half<00:00:29.369> kg<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:30.769> torque<00:00:31.769> we<00:00:31.980> now<00:00:32.099> have

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
one and a half kg of torque we now have

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.310 
one and a half kg of torque we now have
a<00:00:32.309> four<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.790> half<00:00:32.820> kg<00:00:33.180> motor<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:33.780> there<00:00:33.899> so

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
a four and a half kg motor in there so

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.900 
a four and a half kg motor in there so
three<00:00:34.620> times<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.070> amount<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.370> torque<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.790> the

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
three times the amount of torque of the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.869 
three times the amount of torque of the
original<00:00:36.270> or<00:00:36.420> classic<00:00:36.780> turntable<00:00:37.730> we<00:00:38.730> have

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
original or classic turntable we have

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.750

the highest resolution pitch fader on

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.869 
the highest resolution pitch fader on
the<00:00:41.879> market<00:00:42.350> 0.02<00:00:43.350> percent<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.190> we<00:00:44.670> have<00:00:44.789> the

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
the market 0.02 percent and we have the

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.459 
the market 0.02 percent and we have the

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
digital display with that as well so you

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.790 
digital display with that as well so you
can<00:00:46.590> get<00:00:46.680> really<00:00:46.860> accurate<00:00:47.430> beat-matching<00:00:47.780> 8

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
can get really accurate beat-matching 8

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.860 
can get really accurate beat-matching 8

section<00:01:12.299> probably<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.720> most<00:01:12.840> exciting<00:01:13.290> part

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
section probably the most exciting part

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.929 
section probably the most exciting part
of<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.479> q<00:01:15.479> loop<00:01:15.840> sample<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.830> user<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.460> set<00:01:17.700> for

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
of it q loop sample and user is set for

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.420 
of it q loop sample and user is set for
serato<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.450> roll<00:01:18.960> as<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.680> said<00:01:19.890> plug<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.310> play

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
serato to roll as I said plug and play

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.730 
serato to roll as I said plug and play
directly<00:01:20.850> with<00:01:21.090> serato<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.259> can<00:01:22.409> have<00:01:22.590> up

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
directly with serato and you can have up

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.469 
directly with serato and you can have up
to<00:01:22.770> four<00:01:23.130> turn<00:01:23.400> tables<00:01:23.880> set<00:01:24.420> up<00:01:24.479> in<00:01:24.810> series<00:01:25.259> now

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
to four turn tables set up in series now

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.929 
to four turn tables set up in series now
running<00:01:27.479> with<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> link<00:01:28.619> with<00:01:28.890> one<00:01:29.159> USB<00:01:29.520> through

running with a link with one USB through

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.580 
running with a link with one USB through
so<00:01:30.090> you're<00:01:30.210> not<00:01:30.270> having<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.600> set<00:01:31.259> up<00:01:31.350> for

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
so you're not having to set up for

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.560 
so you're not having to set up for
different<00:01:31.920> USBs<00:01:32.310> into<00:01:32.640> your<00:01:32.850> computer<00:01:33.450> or
