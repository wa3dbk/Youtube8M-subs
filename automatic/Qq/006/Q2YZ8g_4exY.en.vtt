of<00:00:51.780> twitch<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.410> Italy<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.860> same

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
of twitch in Italy in the same

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.590 
of twitch in Italy in the same
composition<00:00:53.370> because<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.969> just<00:00:54.120> can't<00:00:54.180> see

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
composition because you just can't see

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.760 
composition because you just can't see
each<00:00:54.690> with<00:00:54.899> twitch<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.379> that's<00:00:55.530> what<00:00:55.710> in

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
each with twitch and that's what in

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.860 
each with twitch and that's what in
Italy<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.070> best<00:00:56.309> at<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:56.789> basically<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.719> have

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
Italy is best at so basically you have

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.310 
Italy is best at so basically you have
to<00:00:57.899> set<00:00:58.230> up<00:00:58.350> for<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.980> hard<00:00:59.760> CC<00:01:00.359> onto<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.050> target

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
to set up for a hard CC onto a target

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.900 
to set up for a hard CC onto a target
zone<00:01:01.739> Italy<00:01:02.010> can<00:01:02.160> hit<00:01:02.280> with<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.520> sphere<00:01:02.789> and

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
zone Italy can hit with the sphere and

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.640 
zone Italy can hit with the sphere and
then<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.120> can<00:01:03.270> set<00:01:03.420> up<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.570> pink<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.049> think

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
then you can set up the pink I think

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.340 
then you can set up the pink I think
here<00:01:05.040> also<00:01:05.280> link<00:01:06.210> did<00:01:06.510> get<00:01:06.659> an<00:01:06.750> advantage<00:01:07.110> in

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
here also link did get an advantage in

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.719 
here also link did get an advantage in
length<00:01:07.590> because<00:01:07.860> she<00:01:08.070> young<00:01:08.220> didn't<00:01:08.549> play

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
length because she young didn't play

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.969 
length because she young didn't play
that<00:01:08.760> well<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.750> laning<00:01:09.960> phase<00:01:10.320> but

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
that well in the laning phase but

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.950 
that well in the laning phase but
twisted<00:01:11.729> fate<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.360> think<00:01:12.659> would<00:01:12.750> have<00:01:12.869> been

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
twisted fate I think would have been

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.510 
twisted fate I think would have been
much<00:01:13.170> better<00:01:13.229> for<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:13.740> composition<00:01:14.100> because

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
much better for this composition because

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.850 
much better for this composition because
you<00:01:14.909> want<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.390> split<00:01:15.659> bushier<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.560> want<00:01:16.770> to

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
you want to split bushier you want to

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.440 
you want to split bushier you want to
create<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.159> pics<00:01:17.460> with<00:01:17.640> twitch<00:01:17.880> in<00:01:18.000> jax<00:01:18.270> of

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
create the pics with twitch in jax of

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.020 
create the pics with twitch in jax of
the<00:01:18.540> sidelines<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.580> they<00:01:20.580> could<00:01:20.759> have<00:01:20.850> used

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
the sidelines and they could have used

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.730 
the sidelines and they could have used
that<00:01:21.150> Twisted<00:01:21.540> Fate<00:01:21.720> mobility<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.560> just

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
that Twisted Fate mobility to just

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.920 
that Twisted Fate mobility to just
continually<00:01:23.130> pick<00:01:23.430> up<00:01:23.549> kills<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.000> never<00:01:24.600> even

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
continually pick up kills and never even

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.830

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
I think within this composition she was

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.090 
I think within this composition she was
a<00:02:16.690> good<00:02:16.990> pick<00:02:17.170> because<00:02:17.320> they<00:02:17.590> desperately

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
a good pick because they desperately

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.860 
a good pick because they desperately
needed<00:02:18.370> a<00:02:18.520> disengage<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:19.030> ideally<00:02:19.630> what<00:02:19.750> you

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
needed a disengage and ideally what you

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.440 
needed a disengage and ideally what you
want<00:02:20.080> is<00:02:20.170> whenever<00:02:20.320> an<00:02:21.160> overly<00:02:21.580> shyvana<00:02:22.060> jumps

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
want is whenever an overly shyvana jumps

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.030 
want is whenever an overly shyvana jumps

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
immediately the only exception is that

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.830 
immediately the only exception is that
which<00:02:33.130> is<00:02:33.250> actually<00:02:33.400> pretty<00:02:33.730> good<00:02:33.940> at<00:02:34.000> dealing

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
got on top of twitch there's nothing he

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.999 
got on top of twitch there's nothing he
can<00:05:38.330> do<00:05:38.449> they<00:05:38.599> can<00:05:38.720> just<00:05:38.840> collapse<00:05:39.440> onto<00:05:39.680> him

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:40.009 
can do they can just collapse onto him

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:41.409 
can do they can just collapse onto him
and<00:05:40.130> just<00:05:40.610> kill<00:05:40.759> him<00:05:40.820> and<00:05:40.880> we<00:05:41.030> saw<00:05:41.150> it<00:05:41.240> here

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
and just kill him and we saw it here

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.749

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:43.759 
sneaky slightly out of position I think

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:45.580 
sneaky slightly out of position I think
we<00:05:43.849> can<00:05:43.969> safely<00:05:44.509> say<00:05:44.690> and<00:05:45.020> then<00:05:45.320> as<00:05:45.409> soon<00:05:45.440> as

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
we can safely say and then as soon as

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:46.930 
we can safely say and then as soon as
the<00:05:45.650> snowball<00:05:45.949> was<00:05:46.009> on<00:05:46.159> him<00:05:46.280> he<00:05:46.699> was<00:05:46.789> dead

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
the snowball was on him he was dead

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
watching these compositions is the

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.850 
watching these compositions is the

whoo<00:05:56.000> and<00:05:56.389> then<00:05:56.599> we<00:05:56.690> can<00:05:56.719> chase<00:05:56.960> really<00:05:57.229> easy

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
whoo and then we can chase really easy

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.649 
whoo and then we can chase really easy
slow<00:05:57.650> people<00:05:57.919> down<00:05:57.949> but<00:05:58.550> the<00:05:59.030> biggest<00:05:59.270> factor

00:05:59.649 --> 00:05:59.659 
slow people down but the biggest factor

slow people down but the biggest factor
I<00:05:59.690> mean<00:05:59.900> why<00:06:00.050> these<00:06:00.110> team<00:06:00.409> fights<00:06:00.590> go<00:06:00.710> so

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:55.220 
do it I would do it well here's the

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.680 
do it I would do it well here's the
other<00:06:55.340> thing<00:06:55.430> though<00:06:55.790> is<00:06:56.060> that<00:06:56.090> coming<00:06:56.570> into

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:56.690 
other thing though is that coming into

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.210 
other thing though is that coming into
the<00:06:56.810> game<00:06:56.930> they<00:06:57.080> are<00:06:57.110> on<00:06:57.350> red<00:06:57.560> sides<00:06:57.830> so

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:58.220 
the game they are on red sides so

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.010 
the game they are on red sides so
basically<00:06:59.030> they'll<00:06:59.180> have<00:06:59.360> that<00:06:59.540> last<00:06:59.750> ban

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:00.020 
basically they'll have that last ban

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.750 
basically they'll have that last ban
option<00:07:00.470> and<00:07:00.590> they<00:07:00.650> may<00:07:00.800> be<00:07:00.860> able<00:07:01.070> to<00:07:01.190> psych<00:07:01.520> out

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:01.760 
option and they may be able to psych out
