00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:14.459 

today<00:00:13.329> we're<00:00:13.509> going<00:00:13.719> to<00:00:13.900> be<00:00:13.990> talking<00:00:14.410> about

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:14.469 
today we're going to be talking about

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.240 
today we're going to be talking about
the<00:00:14.740> first<00:00:15.039> step<00:00:15.490> that<00:00:16.119> you<00:00:16.660> do<00:00:16.990> prior<00:00:17.620> to<00:00:17.650> any

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.250 
the first step that you do prior to any

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.190 
the first step that you do prior to any
painting<00:00:18.970> I<00:00:19.210> have<00:00:20.020> this<00:00:20.200> red<00:00:20.710> bowl<00:00:20.980> and<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.960> has

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.200 
painting I have this red bowl and it has

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.740 
painting I have this red bowl and it has
been<00:00:23.410> cleaned<00:00:23.800> and<00:00:24.280> we're<00:00:25.060> going<00:00:25.330> to<00:00:25.360> go<00:00:25.600> ahead

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
been cleaned and we're going to go ahead

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.200 
been cleaned and we're going to go ahead
and<00:00:26.320> seal<00:00:26.830> it<00:00:27.040> the<00:00:27.220> reason<00:00:27.430> that<00:00:27.880> you<00:00:28.030> would

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
and seal it the reason that you would

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.669 
and seal it the reason that you would
seal<00:00:28.570> anything<00:00:29.380> is<00:00:29.680> because<00:00:31.320> many<00:00:32.320> of<00:00:32.439> these

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:32.679 
seal anything is because many of these

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:36.060 
seal anything is because many of these
are<00:00:32.949> dyed<00:00:33.219> or<00:00:33.850> stained<00:00:34.329> and<00:00:34.809> they<00:00:35.499> will<00:00:35.679> bleed

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
are dyed or stained and they will bleed

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.270 
are dyed or stained and they will bleed
through<00:00:36.460> most<00:00:37.179> paints<00:00:37.719> so<00:00:38.469> you<00:00:38.920> can<00:00:39.070> use<00:00:39.249> a

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
through most paints so you can use a

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.880 
through most paints so you can use a
number<00:00:39.670> of<00:00:39.760> things<00:00:39.969> to<00:00:40.449> seal<00:00:40.989> it<00:00:41.260> I<00:00:41.350> like

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
number of things to seal it I like

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.660 
number of things to seal it I like
shellac<00:00:42.850> because<00:00:43.600> it's<00:00:44.170> probably<00:00:45.039> the<00:00:45.550> most

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
shellac because it's probably the most

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.910 
shellac because it's probably the most
benign<00:00:47.069> it<00:00:48.069> does<00:00:48.370> have<00:00:48.699> an<00:00:48.969> alcohol<00:00:49.749> base<00:00:50.019> so

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
benign it does have an alcohol base so

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.770 
benign it does have an alcohol base so
that's<00:00:51.609> why<00:00:51.819> I'm<00:00:51.909> wearing<00:00:52.120> gloves<00:00:52.449> because

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
that's why I'm wearing gloves because

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.569 
that's why I'm wearing gloves because
you<00:00:53.140> don't<00:00:53.319> want<00:00:53.469> to<00:00:53.559> absorb<00:00:53.739> it<00:00:54.129> into<00:00:54.339> your

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
you don't want to absorb it into your

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.840 
you don't want to absorb it into your
skin<00:00:54.969> so<00:00:57.870> if<00:00:58.870> it<00:00:59.109> is<00:00:59.260> a<00:00:59.289> nice<00:00:59.649> day<00:01:00.069> you<00:01:00.519> could

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
skin so if it is a nice day you could

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.130 
skin so if it is a nice day you could
certainly<00:01:01.949> use<00:01:02.949> a<00:01:02.979> spray<00:01:03.489> shellac<00:01:03.839> but<00:01:04.839> I'm

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
certainly use a spray shellac but I'm

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.170 
certainly use a spray shellac but I'm
going<00:01:05.500> to<00:01:06.299> brush<00:01:07.299> it<00:01:07.360> on<00:01:07.659> and<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:09.700> open<00:01:10.030> your

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
going to brush it on and you open your

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.060 
going to brush it on and you open your
slack<00:01:10.509> you<00:01:10.840> want<00:01:11.200> to<00:01:11.290> make<00:01:11.409> sure<00:01:11.439> that<00:01:11.890> it's

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
slack you want to make sure that it's

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.289 
slack you want to make sure that it's
stirred<00:01:12.430> up<00:01:12.610> you<00:01:12.759> don't<00:01:12.969> shake<00:01:13.390> it<00:01:15.149> take<00:01:16.149> your

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
stirred up you don't shake it take your

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:24.370 
stirred up you don't shake it take your
bowl<00:01:16.509> and<00:01:16.810> you<00:01:16.899> just<00:01:17.079> make<00:01:17.320> nice<00:01:17.590> even<00:01:18.280> strokes

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.250 

only<00:01:25.190> dip<00:01:25.400> your<00:01:25.610> brush<00:01:25.970> in<00:01:26.270> about<00:01:26.570> Oh<00:01:26.840> a<00:01:26.870> third

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
only dip your brush in about Oh a third

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.620 
only dip your brush in about Oh a third
of<00:01:27.440> the<00:01:27.560> way<00:01:30.250> and<00:01:31.250> you<00:01:31.640> can<00:01:31.790> see<00:01:32.030> it's<00:01:32.180> because

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
of the way and you can see it's because

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.650 
of the way and you can see it's because
of<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:32.990> alcohol<00:01:33.200> it<00:01:33.950> dries<00:01:34.250> very<00:01:34.520> quickly<00:01:35.180> you

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
of the alcohol it dries very quickly you

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:42.280 
of the alcohol it dries very quickly you
don't<00:01:35.810> need<00:01:36.140> to<00:01:36.820> make<00:01:37.820> sure<00:01:37.880> it's<00:01:38.240> smooth<00:01:41.290> I'm

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
don't need to make sure it's smooth I'm

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:57.310 
don't need to make sure it's smooth I'm
gonna<00:01:42.530> turn<00:01:42.950> it<00:01:43.100> over<00:01:43.250> and<00:01:44.090> do<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.270> back

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.130 

and<00:01:58.100> we're<00:01:58.970> going<00:01:59.120> to<00:01:59.210> let<00:01:59.360> it<00:01:59.390> dry<00:01:59.660> and<00:02:00.080> then

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
and we're going to let it dry and then

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:23.559 
and we're going to let it dry and then
go<00:02:00.350> on<00:02:00.650> to<00:02:00.770> painting
