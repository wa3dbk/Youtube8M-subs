00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.700
 the canyon is considered a sport 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.520
 extreme in what consists in the 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.200
 Descent of waterfalls and streams through 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.080
 after finding months that a team 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.850
 specialized takes in chile more or less 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.669
 15 years here in the commune 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.290
 about 10 years the cannon go is 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.150
 very similar to the rappel now the 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.480
 difference of the cannon is that it is done in 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:40.000
 a natural environment such as waterfalls and 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.160
 the canyons the level of difficulty is 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.220
 much bigger because you're with water and 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.740
 height that is the difference and always 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.690
 there are worlds you can always slip and 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.940
 you have to take good care of the measures of 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.010
 security in this type of sport there 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.190
 canyon and that can be from 2 meters 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.800
 up to 60 meters cannons that this 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.380
 waterfall is called the twin are already two 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.989
 Similar waterfalls are very pretty 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.520
 entertaining and also very slippery 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.740
 this first waterfall has 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.299
 approximately six meters high you 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.189
 you have the necessary equipment that 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.409
 you need that is the suit as you 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.930
 explained the harness the helmet you have a 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.240
 carabiner with insurance if you realize 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.450
 turn if you turn it to the side 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.400
 left opens completely and you can 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.120
 take out the 8 which is what you are going to use 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.220
 you're going to maneuver this in rappel the 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.320
 rope is dry and hot but here 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.600
 it's cold and it slides super fast 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.350
 so what are we going to do we are going to 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.159
 put with both hands after 18 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.579
 open legs 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.649
 well open and what we are going to do 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:47.719
 we get to the point where the height like this 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.700
 will notice here let's take the 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:53.509
 correct position of the barrel in which is 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.969
 This'm going to sit in the harness I 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.579
 sitting on the walk I'm in the air already 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:01.700
 I have to form an n with my body and 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:05.119
 the wall and let's move step by step 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.810
 a step here a step there a step here 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.250
 very slowly now if at some point 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.349
 back up because it can happen that subtracts 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.780
 it's going to be because your knees are 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.970
 rolled up what you have to do is 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.069
 just stretch your knees and you 're going to 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.069
 be back in the correct position 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.880
 we are at the end of the world and water 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.650
 It is always cooler because we are at a 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.900
 couple of meters of the mountain range and the 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.700
 snow from the thaws the canyons and 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.440
 general does not come to sunlight 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.440
 it means there is a lot of moss 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.230
 stretch your knee assist the knees 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.239
 perfect 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.720
 in italy it was the first time I started 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.730
 to do cannon and 13 years ago 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.709
 also as an apprentice with others 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.940
 conditions the conditions were over 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:03:00.390
 heat with less with less height too 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.950
 and more more places to back it up is 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.040
 another type of street where it is already done 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.370
 but good here in futaleufÃº I've already been 10 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.319
 years doing it and like as a hobby and 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.829
 professionally already working they will be 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.829
 three years
