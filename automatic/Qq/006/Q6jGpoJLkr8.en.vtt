00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.940
 giving time is a year you protect the facades I can not hurt in the 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.069
 world and no frost and this time no major damage 

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:15.569
 like this 

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:18.569
 so far also about which there will be no difference anymore 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:22.230
 well done 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.320
 the entire process can be divided into three phases 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.099
 applying disarmament free that is this 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.440
 a 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.320
 First of all, it is important that the insulation boards are leveled 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.720
 to become 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.720
 sopot profiles are used for this 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.830
 at which the apartment building will be profiled the 4 100 millimeters below the 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.830
 floor of the first tree the 68 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.930
 the substrate must be flat before the insulation boards are installed 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.880
 the 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.650
 the live registration plates are created 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.650
 and loose-fitting surfaces were removed 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.590
 just before fixing the insulation boards, sokol profiles become 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.590
 cleaned up 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.690
 lies the insulation boards sony is that they can not damage it or woman 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:52.870
 to become 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.870
 treated other building materials carefully 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.790
 to grab 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:13.359
 then the plates are recorded 

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:24.559
 the ground is first completely covered with glue 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:31.429
 the forging surfaces are partially covered 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:40.189
 other drug against the neighborhood, we must cover half of the surface here 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:43.189
 zuidplein 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:47.859
 the plates on this ball place are cut with a tape-cutting device 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:00.219
 points plates on their half-brick connection 

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:06.229
 time and again they are placed in the outer corners 

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:15.629
 when connecting to other components such as water, strokes and frames 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.899
 compressing band used 

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:20.899
 this ensures that there is no more water through the anp 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:26.449
 regularly check whether the plates are level 

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:29.869
 please note that there are no cracks offline the remains are between the plates 

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:42.949
 samuel the insulation boards ready it can blow our country firmly 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.549
 anchoring points have become more than 10 meters high 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.739
 time applied na facades with insufficient bearing capacity, sometimes also lower 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:06.269
 according to him, the teams are fitted with a pattern determined by the manufacturer 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:08.559
 excellent 

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:11.689
 and then they are not beaten in the insulation material 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:21.539
 angle profiles are used to get the straight and impact-resistant corners 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.539
 that job are put to use 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:32.599
 just like the first phase of the entire process 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.020
 with an exciting row I am continuing layers 

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:20.889
 the weapon is not rushed to size and pressed into the mortar folder 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:40.680
 the different strips of reinforcement skates we must have at least 100 each other 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.680
 millimeter overlap 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:51.430
 there are great tensions on the books of frames 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.430
 therefore, a community service order is applied 

00:05:59.749 --> 00:06:04.099
 after applying a thin second layer of porto morto enough for one 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:07.099
 better adhesion with the finishing strokes 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.499
 That 

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:20.509
 and this was the second phase of scarce reinforcement 

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:48.999
 ensure a good connection with material applied to cans 

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:51.999
 beaten and stijn beaten when occur 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.050
 the finishing of the tories is done by hand 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.319
 after the finishing layer has been slightly hardened sport kicked out 

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:21.180
 in order to get an even structure, this is done by purchasing preferably 

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.180
 by one person 

00:07:24.939 --> 00:07:26.070
 h 

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.449
 that was it 

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:30.419
 these buildings can withstand that for the time being 

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:33.419
 make first 

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.699
 the systems often differ 

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:42.240
 about the things you can't do everything about 

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.240
 the sps business board has more information about this 

00:07:45.889 --> 00:07:46.889
 for me 

00:07:46.889 --> 00:07:47.440
 Goodluck
