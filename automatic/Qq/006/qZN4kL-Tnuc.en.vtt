00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.330 

maybe<00:02:57.560> a<00:02:57.739> few<00:02:58.219> where<00:02:59.469> and<00:03:00.469> how<00:03:00.709> that<00:03:00.920> we<00:03:01.069> made

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
maybe a few where and how that we made

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.369 
maybe a few where and how that we made
something<00:03:01.640> I<00:03:02.030> don't<00:03:02.209> know<00:03:02.269> it<00:03:02.420> is<00:03:02.659> a<00:03:02.930> little

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
something I don't know it is a little

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.979 
something I don't know it is a little
ball<00:03:03.620> of<00:03:03.650> light<00:03:04.069> that<00:03:04.430> is<00:03:05.150> going<00:03:05.209> straight<00:03:05.840> to

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
ball of light that is going straight to

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:25.510 
ball of light that is going straight to
Wars

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:31.550 

over<00:03:26.520> there<00:03:26.730> yeah<00:03:29.360> hey<00:03:30.360> something<00:03:30.810> John<00:03:31.080> okay

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
over there yeah hey something John okay

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.910 
over there yeah hey something John okay
oh<00:03:34.490> there's<00:03:35.490> something<00:03:36.560> flashing<00:03:37.560> on<00:03:37.830> the

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
oh there's something flashing on the

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:50.810 
oh there's something flashing on the
ground<00:03:38.160> I<00:03:48.500> would<00:03:49.500> imagine<00:03:49.710> that<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.280> second

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
ground I would imagine that the second

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.140 
ground I would imagine that the second
helicopter<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.690> large<00:03:51.900> gazelle<00:03:52.590> is<00:03:53.150> radio

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
helicopter the large gazelle is radio

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.820 
helicopter the large gazelle is radio
communication<00:03:54.870> and<00:03:55.020> he's<00:03:55.110> probably<00:03:55.380> signed

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
communication and he's probably signed

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.510 
communication and he's probably signed
at<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.100> sky<00:03:56.840> it's<00:03:57.840> behind<00:03:58.140> you<00:03:58.410> because<00:03:58.830> you

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
at the sky it's behind you because you

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.100 
at the sky it's behind you because you
can<00:03:59.760> see<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.360> reason<00:04:00.480> I<00:04:00.660> say<00:04:00.840> that<00:04:00.870> is<00:04:01.020> that

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
can see the reason I say that is that

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.470 
can see the reason I say that is that
the<00:04:01.290> ball<00:04:02.190> of<00:04:02.310> light<00:04:02.430> is<00:04:02.520> gone<00:04:02.700> it<00:04:03.180> was<00:04:03.300> in

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
the ball of light is gone it was in

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.180 
the ball of light is gone it was in
front<00:04:03.630> of<00:04:03.720> them<00:04:03.840> it's<00:04:04.200> no<00:04:04.290> we<00:04:04.620> can<00:04:04.800> see<00:04:04.980> and

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
front of them it's no we can see and

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.430 
front of them it's no we can see and
we're<00:04:05.310> filming<00:04:05.640> it<00:04:05.850> it's<00:04:06.000> behind<00:04:06.360> him<00:04:06.570> but<00:04:07.320> the

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
we're filming it it's behind him but the

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.920 
we're filming it it's behind him but the
helicopter<00:04:07.590> begins<00:04:08.580> to<00:04:08.700> back<00:04:08.880> up<00:04:09.120> so<00:04:09.630> he's<00:04:09.750> got
