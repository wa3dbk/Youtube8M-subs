00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
that taters gonna go for 14 sec again I

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.420 
that taters gonna go for 14 sec again I
would<00:01:00.180> assume<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.690> mean<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.930> can<00:01:01.430> can

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
would assume I mean you can can

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.369 
would assume I mean you can can
technically<00:01:03.030> do<00:01:03.210> damage<00:01:03.570> i<00:01:03.690> guess<00:01:03.870> if<00:01:04.170> they<00:01:04.260> go

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
technically do damage i guess if they go

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.920 
technically do damage i guess if they go
for<00:01:04.559> one<00:01:04.589> rock<00:01:04.890> expand<00:01:05.390> especially<00:01:06.390> with

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
for one rock expand especially with

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.859 
for one rock expand especially with
marines<00:01:07.350> but<00:01:07.860> i<00:01:08.250> think<00:01:09.180> it's<00:01:09.270> cuz<00:01:09.510> Tate<00:01:09.780> has

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
marines but i think it's cuz Tate has

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.350 
marines but i think it's cuz Tate has
been<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.140> greedy<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.560> last<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.890> games<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.369> don't

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
been so greedy to last you games I don't

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.170 
been so greedy to last you games I don't
think<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.750> bad<00:01:12.990> move<00:01:13.350> though<00:01:14.060> if<00:01:15.060> you

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
think this is a bad move though if you

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.450 
think this is a bad move though if you
decisis<00:01:15.630> super<00:01:16.020> invest<00:01:16.320> into<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.950> there

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
decisis super invest into this and there

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.190 
decisis super invest into this and there
is<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.850> awkward<00:01:18.210> wall<00:01:18.450> down<00:01:18.659> then<00:01:18.869> yeah<00:01:19.020> he

that's really bad latarian well for the

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.979 
that's really bad latarian well for the
sake<00:03:32.260> of<00:03:32.290> tasia<00:03:32.620> i<00:03:33.099> mean<00:03:33.340> i<00:03:33.489> can<00:03:34.449> see<00:03:34.569> a<00:03:34.599> bunker

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
sake of tasia i mean i can see a bunker

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.300 
sake of tasia i mean i can see a bunker
coming<00:03:35.260> up<00:03:35.349> he's<00:03:35.680> really<00:03:35.889> worried<00:03:36.129> about<00:03:36.159> a

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
coming up he's really worried about a

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.069 
coming up he's really worried about a
follow-up<00:03:36.669> but<00:03:36.849> socks<00:03:37.449> he's<00:03:37.659> not<00:03:37.840> falling

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
follow-up but socks he's not falling

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.569 
follow-up but socks he's not falling
this<00:03:38.229> up<00:03:38.409> with<00:03:38.500> a<00:03:38.530> big<00:03:38.650> bailing<00:03:38.979> attack<00:03:39.280> he's

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
this up with a big bailing attack he's

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.099 
this up with a big bailing attack he's
he's<00:03:39.940> actually<00:03:40.150> measuring<00:03:40.599> out<00:03:40.780> of<00:03:40.870> this<00:03:40.959> and

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
he's actually measuring out of this and

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:42.330 
he's actually measuring out of this and
i<00:03:41.169> think<00:03:41.319> this<00:03:41.409> is<00:03:41.470> really<00:03:41.739> smart<00:03:41.949> choice<00:03:42.159> to

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
i think this is really smart choice to

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.369 
i think this is really smart choice to
extend<00:03:42.639> his<00:03:42.760> lead<00:03:43.000> rather<00:03:43.720> than<00:03:43.870> risk<00:03:44.260> a

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:44.379 
extend his lead rather than risk a

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:46.349 
extend his lead rather than risk a
dedicated<00:03:44.709> all<00:03:44.949> in<00:03:45.129> he<00:03:45.729> already<00:03:46.150> called

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
dedicated all in he already called

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.270 
dedicated all in he already called
flipped<00:03:46.659> once<00:03:46.900> and<00:03:47.109> it<00:03:47.169> came<00:03:47.260> up<00:03:47.379> heads<00:03:47.560> you

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
flipped once and it came up heads you

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:56.820 
flipped once and it came up heads you
know<00:03:48.340> why<00:03:49.000> risk<00:03:49.239> it<00:03:49.389> again<00:03:52.500> pretty<00:03:53.500> well

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.290 

what<00:03:57.580> did<00:03:57.670> he<00:03:57.700> just<00:03:57.760> canceled<00:03:58.210> CC<00:03:59.880> wasn't<00:04:00.880> ICC

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
what did he just canceled CC wasn't ICC

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.880 
what did he just canceled CC wasn't ICC

part of me Cisse cc's right here yeah
sure<00:04:08.400> okay<00:04:09.400> so<00:04:09.760> yeah<00:04:10.150> realizing<00:04:10.690> i<00:04:10.750> guess<00:04:10.870> that

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
sure okay so yeah realizing i guess that

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.300 
sure okay so yeah realizing i guess that
i<00:04:11.050> wasn't<00:04:11.230> gonna<00:04:11.350> be<00:04:11.530> a<00:04:11.560> baneling<00:04:11.770> bust<00:04:11.920> would

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
i wasn't gonna be a baneling bust would

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.550 
i wasn't gonna be a baneling bust would
already<00:04:12.460> would<00:04:13.000> have<00:04:13.030> happened<00:04:13.510> maybe<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:14.470> N

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
already would have happened maybe the N

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.920 
already would have happened maybe the N
chances<00:04:15.010> the<00:04:15.070> bunker<00:04:15.370> Helens<00:04:16.000> will<00:04:16.510> be<00:04:16.810> able

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
chances the bunker Helens will be able

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.280 
chances the bunker Helens will be able
to<00:04:17.140> bust<00:04:18.010> out<00:04:18.549> of<00:04:18.940> the<00:04:19.299> base<00:04:19.600> especially<00:04:19.930> since

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
to bust out of the base especially since

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.530 
to bust out of the base especially since
they<00:04:20.380> are<00:04:20.560> not<00:04:20.739> speedlings<00:04:21.489> by<00:04:22.090> late<00:04:22.360> what

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
they are not speedlings by late what

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.740 
they are not speedlings by late what
only<00:04:22.960> one<00:04:23.110> helene<00:04:23.470> for<00:04:23.650> now<00:04:24.270> what<00:04:25.270> did<00:04:25.420> he<00:04:25.480> stop

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
only one helene for now what did he stop

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.260 
only one helene for now what did he stop
it's<00:04:26.650> like<00:04:29.550> they<00:04:30.550> have<00:04:30.670> better<00:04:30.820> things<00:04:31.030> that

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
it's like they have better things that

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.660 
it's like they have better things that
do<00:04:31.390> Rifkin<00:04:31.870> he's<00:04:32.470> faking<00:04:32.860> up<00:04:32.980> that<00:04:33.130> rocket<00:04:33.490> tag

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
do Rifkin he's faking up that rocket tag

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.400 
do Rifkin he's faking up that rocket tag
he<00:04:33.880> wants<00:04:34.150> to<00:04:34.270> easy<00:04:34.360> to<00:04:34.510> think<00:04:34.780> i'm<00:04:35.020> taking<00:04:35.350> the

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
he wants to easy to think i'm taking the

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.080 
he wants to easy to think i'm taking the
rocks<00:04:35.620> down<00:04:35.950> but<00:04:36.190> sweet<00:04:37.180> he's<00:04:37.720> actually<00:04:37.930> not<00:04:38.290> i

rocks down but sweet he's actually not i

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.130 
rocks down but sweet he's actually not i
guess<00:04:40.090> you<00:04:40.210> know<00:04:40.300> that<00:04:40.330> Helens<00:04:40.690> gonna<00:04:40.810> be<00:04:41.020> out

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
guess you know that Helens gonna be out

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.480 
guess you know that Helens gonna be out
last<00:04:41.530> thing<00:04:41.710> you<00:04:41.770> want<00:04:41.920> to<00:04:41.980> do<00:04:42.130> is<00:04:42.250> just<00:04:42.280> give

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
last thing you want to do is just give

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.550 
last thing you want to do is just give
up<00:04:42.640> the<00:04:42.790> bling<00:04:43.300> yeah<00:04:43.600> his<00:04:43.810> speed<00:04:44.050> timing<00:04:44.260> is<00:04:44.410> so

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
up the bling yeah his speed timing is so

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.170 
up the bling yeah his speed timing is so
far<00:04:44.770> away<00:04:44.860> so<00:04:44.950> that<00:04:45.250> part<00:04:45.490> wasn't<00:04:45.640> gonna<00:04:45.820> into

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
far away so that part wasn't gonna into

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.160 
far away so that part wasn't gonna into
well<00:04:46.300> actually<00:04:46.480> this<00:04:46.690> is<00:04:46.840> a<00:04:46.870> little<00:04:47.080> bit

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
well actually this is a little bit

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.540 
well actually this is a little bit
worrisome<00:04:47.410> because<00:04:47.590> if<00:04:47.800> tasia<00:04:47.980> just<00:04:48.220> rushes

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
worrisome because if tasia just rushes

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.950 
worrisome because if tasia just rushes
couplings<00:04:49.000> across<00:04:49.210> the<00:04:49.300> NAP<00:04:49.450> you<00:04:49.480> might<00:04:49.870> be

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
couplings across the NAP you might be

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.330 
couplings across the NAP you might be
able<00:04:50.020> to<00:04:50.140> get<00:04:50.230> a<00:04:50.290> couple<00:04:50.440> of<00:04:50.620> drone<00:04:50.800> kills<00:04:51.040> and

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
able to get a couple of drone kills and

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.220 
able to get a couple of drone kills and
start<00:04:52.180> buying<00:04:52.390> his<00:04:52.570> way<00:04:52.690> back<00:04:52.840> into<00:04:53.050> the<00:04:53.200> game

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
start buying his way back into the game

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.050 
start buying his way back into the game
a<00:04:53.350> bit<00:04:53.560> now<00:04:53.770> I<00:04:53.800> mean<00:04:54.340> it's<00:04:54.550> gonna<00:04:54.700> take<00:04:54.910> an

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
a bit now I mean it's gonna take an

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.520 
a bit now I mean it's gonna take an
excessive<00:04:55.510> Metatron<00:04:55.900> kills<00:04:56.080> to<00:04:56.200> get<00:04:56.320> ahead

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
excessive Metatron kills to get ahead

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.730 
excessive Metatron kills to get ahead
but<00:04:57.660> let<00:04:58.660> me<00:04:58.870> just<00:04:58.930> catch<00:04:59.110> in<00:04:59.290> the<00:04:59.350> slow<00:04:59.530> legs

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
but let me just catch in the slow legs

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.000 
but let me just catch in the slow legs
over<00:04:59.890> here<00:05:00.040> it's<00:05:00.130> gonna<00:05:00.190> be<00:05:00.310> kind<00:05:00.460> of<00:05:00.490> nice

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
over here it's gonna be kind of nice

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.210 
over here it's gonna be kind of nice
yeah<00:05:03.780> tries<00:05:04.780> to<00:05:04.810> pull<00:05:05.110> away<00:05:05.230> to<00:05:05.380> link<00:05:05.860> those<00:05:06.160> a

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
yeah tries to pull away to link those a

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.670 
yeah tries to pull away to link those a
