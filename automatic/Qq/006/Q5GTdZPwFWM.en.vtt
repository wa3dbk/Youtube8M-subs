next okay I stretched this piece of
fence<00:00:25.859> here<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.720> when<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:27.779> was<00:00:27.930> putting<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.260> up

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
fence here and when I was putting it up

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.259 
fence here and when I was putting it up

facing<00:00:30.720> up<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.109> set<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.439> down<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:32.040> was<00:00:32.940> thinking

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
facing up and set it down I was thinking

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.400 
facing up and set it down I was thinking
oh<00:00:33.239> it's<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.450> different<00:00:33.540> kind<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.930> fence<00:00:34.140> no

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
oh it's a different kind of fence no

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.870 
oh it's a different kind of fence no
it's<00:00:34.559> not<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.739> got<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.070> upside<00:00:35.340> down<00:00:35.399> the

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
it's not I got it upside down the

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.090 
it's not I got it upside down the
twisted<00:00:36.329> edges<00:00:36.630> here<00:00:36.840> go<00:00:37.170> down<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:38.210> these<00:00:39.210> are

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
twisted edges here go down and these are

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.770 
twisted edges here go down and these are
sort<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.460> prevent<00:00:41.850> someone<00:00:42.239> jumping<00:00:42.570> over

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
sort of to prevent someone jumping over

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.690 
sort of to prevent someone jumping over
the<00:00:42.870> fence<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.559> sharp<00:00:43.860> edges<00:00:44.040> will<00:00:44.340> get<00:00:44.489> to

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
the fence so the sharp edges will get to

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.090 
the fence so the sharp edges will get to

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
I'm just going to use it to pull that

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.920 
I'm just going to use it to pull that
Vince<00:01:27.580> tight<00:01:27.850> so<00:01:28.060> I<00:01:28.120> can<00:01:28.300> connect<00:01:28.570> it<00:01:28.660> to<00:01:28.720> that

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
Vince tight so I can connect it to that

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.020 
Vince tight so I can connect it to that
pole<00:01:29.140> I<00:01:29.410> know<00:01:30.340> it'll<00:01:30.520> stretch<00:01:30.790> that<00:01:30.970> far

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
pole I know it'll stretch that far

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.420 
pole I know it'll stretch that far
because<00:01:31.330> it<00:01:31.660> was<00:01:31.870> stretched<00:01:32.350> a<00:01:32.500> few<00:01:33.160> minutes

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
because it was stretched a few minutes

00:01:33.430 --> 00:02:03.190 
because it was stretched a few minutes
ago<00:01:33.550> so<00:01:34.180> here<00:01:34.780> we<00:01:34.870> go

what's a hole that Charlie can get out
for<00:03:50.330> I<00:03:50.709> might<00:03:51.709> try<00:03:51.890> dropping<00:03:52.400> this<00:03:52.519> in<00:03:52.580> down

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
for I might try dropping this in down

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.199 
for I might try dropping this in down
down<00:03:53.750> here<00:03:54.170> I<00:03:54.519> think<00:03:55.519> my<00:03:55.610> fence<00:03:55.849> is<00:03:56.030> will

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
down here I think my fence is will

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.300 
down here I think my fence is will
taller<00:03:56.510> than<00:03:56.750> the<00:03:56.840> poles<00:03:57.110> on<00:03:57.380> this<00:03:57.590> end<00:03:57.860> but<00:03:58.190> if

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
taller than the poles on this end but if

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.470 
taller than the poles on this end but if
I<00:03:58.400> took<00:03:58.459> a<00:03:58.610> shovel

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
I took a shovel

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.750 
I took a shovel
did<00:04:00.440> a<00:04:00.470> little<00:04:00.620> digging<00:04:00.769> right<00:04:01.160> along<00:04:01.370> it<00:04:01.519> here

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
did a little digging right along it here

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.039 
did a little digging right along it here
and<00:04:01.880> I<00:04:01.940> could<00:04:02.090> probably<00:04:02.299> ease<00:04:02.599> that<00:04:02.810> down

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
and I could probably ease that down

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.470 
and I could probably ease that down
where<00:04:03.290> it<00:04:03.380> would<00:04:03.500> match<00:04:03.970> I'd<00:04:04.970> make<00:04:05.209> it<00:04:05.329> look<00:04:05.450> a

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
where it would match I'd make it look a

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.020 
where it would match I'd make it look a
little<00:04:05.630> better<00:04:05.810> so<00:04:06.680> I'm<00:04:07.670> not<00:04:07.819> gonna<00:04:07.940> worry

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
little better so I'm not gonna worry

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.809 
little better so I'm not gonna worry
about<00:04:08.060> that<00:04:08.239> right<00:04:08.599> now<00:04:09.459> I'll<00:04:10.459> just<00:04:10.640> keep

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
about that right now I'll just keep

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:12.910 
about that right now I'll just keep
moving<00:04:11.180> along<00:04:11.269> okay<00:04:12.260> I<00:04:12.290> said<00:04:12.530> I<00:04:12.590> wasn't<00:04:12.769> gonna

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
moving along okay I said I wasn't gonna

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.800 
moving along okay I said I wasn't gonna
do<00:04:13.069> it<00:04:13.099> but<00:04:13.220> I<00:04:13.370> did<00:04:13.610> I<00:04:13.819> went<00:04:13.970> ahead<00:04:14.090> and<00:04:14.329> just

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
do it but I did I went ahead and just

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.990 
do it but I did I went ahead and just
dug<00:04:15.019> a<00:04:15.049> little<00:04:15.260> trench<00:04:15.620> on<00:04:15.799> the<00:04:15.950> end<00:04:16.130> to<00:04:16.880> get

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
dug a little trench on the end to get

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.789 
dug a little trench on the end to get
this<00:04:17.150> wire<00:04:17.389> to<00:04:17.570> come<00:04:17.750> down<00:04:17.959> so<00:04:18.200> that<00:04:18.320> these<00:04:18.530> two

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
this wire to come down so that these two

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.610 
this wire to come down so that these two
kind<00:04:19.280> of<00:04:19.340> match<00:04:19.519> up<00:04:19.989> it<00:04:20.989> would<00:04:21.109> be<00:04:21.139> very<00:04:21.380> easy

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
kind of match up it would be very easy

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.030 
kind of match up it would be very easy
if<00:04:21.889> I<00:04:22.040> need<00:04:22.310> to<00:04:22.580> well<00:04:23.150> not<00:04:23.360> that<00:04:23.389> easy<00:04:23.750> but<00:04:24.050> if<00:04:24.889> I

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
if I need to well not that easy but if I

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.409 
if I need to well not that easy but if I
went<00:04:25.220> all<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.370> way<00:04:25.460> around<00:04:25.760> this<00:04:25.880> fence<00:04:26.210> and

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
went all the way around this fence and

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:27.969 
went all the way around this fence and
dug<00:04:26.630> a<00:04:26.750> little<00:04:26.870> bit<00:04:27.139> like<00:04:27.350> that<00:04:27.380> and<00:04:27.680> then

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
dug a little bit like that and then

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:30.760 
dug a little bit like that and then
filled<00:04:28.250> it<00:04:28.370> in<00:04:28.460> with<00:04:28.490> dirt<00:04:29.139> to<00:04:30.139> keep<00:04:30.320> Charlie

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
filled it in with dirt to keep Charlie

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.940 
filled it in with dirt to keep Charlie
from<00:04:30.889> digging<00:04:31.100> out<00:04:32.289> that<00:04:33.289> may<00:04:33.470> be<00:04:33.530> something<00:04:33.830> I

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
from digging out that may be something I

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.529 
from digging out that may be something I
have<00:04:34.039> to<00:04:34.160> do<00:04:34.340> I'm<00:04:34.639> going<00:04:34.760> to<00:04:34.880> we're<00:04:35.330> going<00:04:35.450> to

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
have to do I'm going to we're going to

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:37.840 
have to do I'm going to we're going to
kind<00:04:35.630> of<00:04:35.720> see<00:04:35.950> how<00:04:36.950> much<00:04:37.130> of<00:04:37.310> a<00:04:37.400> digger<00:04:37.610> he

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
kind of see how much of a digger he

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.550 
kind of see how much of a digger he
turns<00:04:38.060> out<00:04:38.270> to<00:04:38.419> be<00:04:38.570> if<00:04:38.780> it<00:04:38.900> turns<00:04:39.080> out<00:04:39.260> he<00:04:39.440> is

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
turns out to be if it turns out he is

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.170 
turns out to be if it turns out he is
digging<00:04:39.770> and<00:04:40.010> trying<00:04:40.250> to<00:04:40.400> escape<00:04:40.580> then<00:04:41.030> we'll

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
digging and trying to escape then we'll

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.629 
digging and trying to escape then we'll
have<00:04:41.300> to<00:04:41.389> take<00:04:41.539> measures<00:04:42.010> such<00:04:43.010> as<00:04:43.039> that<00:04:43.430> and

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
have to take measures such as that and

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:45.340 
have to take measures such as that and
maybe<00:04:43.729> other<00:04:44.000> things<00:04:44.270> too<00:04:44.539> to<00:04:44.780> keep<00:04:44.930> them<00:04:45.110> in

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
maybe other things too to keep them in

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.060 
maybe other things too to keep them in
but<00:04:45.789> we'll<00:04:46.789> see<00:04:46.910> how<00:04:46.940> it<00:04:47.090> goes<00:04:47.180> so<00:04:48.070> that's

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
but we'll see how it goes so that's

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.890 
but we'll see how it goes so that's
pretty<00:04:49.280> good<00:04:49.460> been<00:04:49.639> offensive<00:04:49.910> vintage<00:04:50.539> done

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
pretty good been offensive vintage done

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.320 
pretty good been offensive vintage done
there<00:04:51.169> I<00:04:51.200> think
