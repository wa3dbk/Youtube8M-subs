00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
know it's a lot of people might think

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.120

there's no padding on the top but it's a

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.950 
there's no padding on the top but it's a
very<00:01:21.960> lightweight<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:22.740> like<00:01:22.920> very

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
very lightweight it's just like very

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.700 
very lightweight it's just like very
lightweight<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.170> it's<00:01:25.500> not<00:01:25.680> gonna<00:01:27.530> be<00:01:28.530> that

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
lightweight so it's not gonna be that

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.190 
lightweight so it's not gonna be that
much<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.189> strain<00:01:29.430> on<00:01:29.549> your<00:01:29.670> head<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.420> also

much of a strain on your head and also

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.679 
much of a strain on your head and also
just<00:01:31.619> fully<00:01:31.950> adjustable<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.759> says<00:01:33.210> Xbox

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
just fully adjustable and says Xbox

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.819 
just fully adjustable and says Xbox
right<00:01:33.869> here<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.200> I'll<00:01:34.290> show<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.409> see<00:01:34.650> that

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
right here and I'll show you see that

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.920 
right here and I'll show you see that
and<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.939> know<00:01:36.060> it's<00:01:36.270> actually<00:01:36.570> made<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.810> some

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
and you know it's actually made of some

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.109 
and you know it's actually made of some
pretty<00:01:37.049> strong<00:01:37.290> plastic<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.220> have<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.430> try

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
pretty strong plastic so you have to try

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.510 
pretty strong plastic so you have to try
to<00:01:39.180> break<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.810> they<00:01:40.619> do<00:01:40.680> rotate<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.460> little

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
to break it and they do rotate a little

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.249 
to break it and they do rotate a little
bit<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.240> I'm<00:01:42.299> not<00:01:42.390> sure<00:01:42.450> if<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.689> see<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:43.020> and

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
bit so I'm not sure if you see that and

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.100 
bit so I'm not sure if you see that and
it's<00:01:43.979> also<00:01:44.310> Mike<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:45.000> fully<00:01:45.240> adjustable<00:01:45.390> or

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
it's also Mike is fully adjustable or

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.350 
it's also Mike is fully adjustable or
you<00:01:46.320> can<00:01:46.439> also<00:01:46.560> just<00:01:46.799> put<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.159> up<00:01:47.310> if<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:48.030> are

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360

one of my friends tell me I didn't sound

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
that great on the microphone are of all

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.840 
that great on the microphone are of all
my<00:01:57.689> tests<00:01:57.990> talking<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.500> my<00:01:58.680> friends<00:01:59.159> they<00:01:59.640> told

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
my tests talking to my friends they told

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.899 
my tests talking to my friends they told
me<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.000> sound<00:02:00.270> pretty<00:02:00.630> clear<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.790> that<00:02:02.790> was

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
me I sound pretty clear and that was

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.639 
me I sound pretty clear and that was
pretty<00:02:03.119> much<00:02:03.270> all<00:02:03.570> theirs<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.140> what<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.409> could

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
pretty much all theirs and what I could

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.170 
pretty much all theirs and what I could
hear<00:02:04.799> from<00:02:04.890> them<00:02:05.130> was<00:02:05.430> it's<00:02:05.820> gonna<00:02:05.969> be<00:02:06.149> a

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
hear from them was it's gonna be a

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.990 
hear from them was it's gonna be a
regular<00:02:06.570> quality<00:02:07.079> for<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.920> headphone<00:02:08.520> or

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
regular quality for a headphone or

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.029 
regular quality for a headphone or
headset<00:02:09.840> it's<00:02:10.200> going<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.500> be<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.679> same

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
headset it's going to be the same

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.589 
headset it's going to be the same
quality<00:02:11.489> so<00:02:11.670> if<00:02:11.730> they<00:02:11.879> have<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.030> bad<00:02:12.180> mic<00:02:12.390> it's

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
quality so if they have a bad mic it's

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.370 
quality so if they have a bad mic it's
gonna<00:02:12.720> produce

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
gonna produce

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.560 
gonna produce
if<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:14.010> good<00:02:14.250> mics<00:02:14.460> can<00:02:14.700> produce<00:02:14.850> good<00:02:15.240> audio

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
if that good mics can produce good audio

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.870 
if that good mics can produce good audio
so<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:16.140> think<00:02:16.440> this<00:02:16.740> really<00:02:16.800> does<00:02:17.250> get<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.640> job

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
so I think this really does get the job

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.120 
so I think this really does get the job
done<00:02:18.120> here<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.630> if<00:02:19.350> you're<00:02:19.530> just<00:02:19.560> looking<00:02:19.830> for

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
done here and if you're just looking for

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.640 
done here and if you're just looking for
a<00:02:20.160> voice<00:02:20.460> communication<00:02:21.240> headset<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.410> you

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
a voice communication headset and you

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.650

don't<00:02:22.800> want<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.040> game<00:02:23.220> sound<00:02:23.600> this<00:02:24.600> is

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
don't want the game sound this is

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.140 
don't want the game sound this is
definitely<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.290> good<00:02:25.440> way<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.650> go<00:02:26.150> probably

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
definitely a good way to go probably

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
definitely a good way to go probably
