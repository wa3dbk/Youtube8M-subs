00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
official stance is that this whole

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.910 
official stance is that this whole
venture<00:00:11.219> is<00:00:12.679> dumb<00:00:13.679> because<00:00:14.809> as<00:00:15.809> far<00:00:15.870> as<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.289> as

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
a little risky you take a 120 and a

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.690 
a little risky you take a 120 and a
worldwide<00:02:13.630> stout<00:02:13.930> and<00:02:14.230> deep<00:02:14.800> or<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.160> ones

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
worldwide stout and deep or the ones

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.350 
worldwide stout and deep or the ones
yeah<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.120> 120<00:02:16.600> is<00:02:16.720> poured<00:02:17.050> first<00:02:17.410> know<00:02:18.360> the

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
yeah the 120 is poured first know the

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.210 
yeah the 120 is poured first know the
style<00:02:19.630> is<00:02:19.810> for<00:02:20.020> first<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.650> status<00:02:21.040> board

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
style is for first the status board

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.190 
style is for first the status board
first<00:02:21.459> yes<00:02:22.890> right<00:02:23.890> no<00:02:24.610> maybe<00:02:25.000> not<00:02:25.090> now<00:02:25.570> the<00:02:25.630> 120

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
first yes right no maybe not now the 120

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.380 
first yes right no maybe not now the 120
is<00:02:26.290> port<00:02:26.560> first<00:02:26.770> okay<00:02:27.160> 120<00:02:27.940> sports<00:02:28.120> that's

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
is port first okay 120 sports that's

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.000 
is port first okay 120 sports that's
right<00:02:28.600> because<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.840> 120<00:02:29.230> state<00:02:29.410> is<00:02:29.650> supposed

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
right because the 120 state is supposed

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.710 
right because the 120 state is supposed
to<00:02:30.160> stay<00:02:30.340> on<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.520> bottom<00:02:30.820> but<00:02:30.940> it's<00:02:31.090> really

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
to stay on the bottom but it's really

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.920 
to stay on the bottom but it's really
difficult<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:33.430> what<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.820> 120<00:02:34.330> is<00:02:34.420> port<00:02:34.690> first

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
difficult so what the 120 is port first

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.660 
difficult so what the 120 is port first
about<00:02:35.140> half<00:02:35.350> a<00:02:35.440> bottle<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:35.920> then<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.489> world

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
about half a bottle and then the world

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.240 
about half a bottle and then the world
wide<00:02:36.940> stout<00:02:37.209> is<00:02:37.269> poured<00:02:37.810> gently<00:02:38.470> on<00:02:38.620> top<00:02:38.650> of<00:02:39.070> it

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
wide stout is poured gently on top of it

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.400 
wide stout is poured gently on top of it
and<00:02:39.370> if<00:02:40.090> you're<00:02:40.209> good<00:02:40.480> you<00:02:40.720> can<00:02:40.750> usually<00:02:41.080> get

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
and if you're good you can usually get

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.470 
and if you're good you can usually get
about<00:02:41.470> that<00:02:42.070> much<00:02:42.280> of<00:02:42.459> separation<00:02:43.120> where<00:02:43.330> the

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
about that much of separation where the

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.500 
about that much of separation where the
bottom<00:02:43.810> is<00:02:43.900> just<00:02:44.110> pure<00:02:44.410> or<00:02:44.769> up<00:02:45.040> here<00:02:45.180> 120<00:02:46.180> right

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
bottom is just pure or up here 120 right

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.240 
bottom is just pure or up here 120 right
this<00:02:46.720> is<00:02:46.810> black<00:02:46.959> and<00:02:47.080> tan<00:02:47.260> yeah<00:02:47.650> it's<00:02:47.890> a<00:02:48.010> black

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
this is black and tan yeah it's a black

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.530 
this is black and tan yeah it's a black
and<00:02:48.459> tan<00:02:48.630> but<00:02:49.630> because<00:02:50.350> because<00:02:51.100> their

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
and tan but because because their

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.300 
and tan but because because their
chemical<00:02:52.540> compositions<00:02:53.170> are<00:02:53.380> so<00:02:53.560> close<00:02:53.860> it's

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
chemical compositions are so close it's

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.660 
chemical compositions are so close it's
so<00:02:54.730> difficult<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.360> get<00:02:55.630> them<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:56.380> layer

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
so difficult to get them to layer

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.009 
so difficult to get them to layer
correctly<00:02:57.670> and<00:02:57.820> apparently<00:02:58.660> there's<00:02:58.840> like<00:02:58.989> a

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
correctly and apparently there's like a

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.270 
correctly and apparently there's like a
special<00:02:59.380> swimming<00:02:59.739> you<00:02:59.830> can<00:02:59.890> do<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.190> I'm
