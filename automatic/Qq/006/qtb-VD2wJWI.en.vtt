00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
some chaos bolts so let's test it out

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.080 
some chaos bolts so let's test it out
like<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.290> said<00:01:46.350> give<00:01:46.829> me<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:47.009> second<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.729> get<00:01:47.880> my
