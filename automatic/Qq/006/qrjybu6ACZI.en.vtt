00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello everyone I find you 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.779
 today for a new video that 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.370
 will be very short and I apologize already 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.010
 for brightness because I am 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.509
 in front of my window I find it just 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.360
 atrocious of this short video will be a 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.720
 little bonus on Tuesday to tell you about 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.550
 squat challenge in 30 days so what is 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.130
 what it is it is a sporting challenge 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.439
 like the top 10 she plays except that this 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.750
 challenge you only do squats 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.570
 so what is squad 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.920
 that's when you're standing up and that's 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.020
 you do a bending with your legs 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.130
 until you sit down as if you're going 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.719
 sit on a chair 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.879
 so I hope I did well 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.100
 understand after there are others 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.540
 squats like squat sumos where this 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.910
 this time it's really very legs 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.890
 spread out and you get off like 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.969
 if you go sit down and after I 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.140
 believe there are other small 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.940
 variants after I will leave you 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.199
 watch videos on the internet on 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.449
 how to do squats well and all 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.100
 since the purpose of my video is not 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.899
 all talking about that had told us that 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.480
 I was against all and sports challenge 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.370
 and so I find that really 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.729
 can and finally it's something that 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.630
 annoys me to see that youtube to 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.400
 children a fashion 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.330
 I wanted to try this challenge because 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.770
 I still found him a little bit 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.840
 different from the others since you did not 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.460
 that squats and that me my goal this 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.140
 was not working and necessarily everything 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.869
 what was belly arm and all that I 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.400
 really wanted to work but actually 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.810
 via the hero bitumen base of this 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.909
 challenge is to give a pretty shape 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.350
 to your buttocks so to reassemble them from 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.689
 the hÃ©rault bombay where looks but 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.009
 slightly as well as muscling your 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.780
 thighs 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.869
 so I stopped after 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.079
 16 days I think or finally anyway 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.329
 end it was over 157 between 150 and 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.799
 170 watts then what you need to know 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.320
 is that the first day that began 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.259
 at 50 cold and the last day you 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.229
 must finish at 250 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:51.360
 you have a rest day every 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.340
 three days it seems to me so I you 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.170
 upload the card to a photo don for 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.530
 see how it goes at the level of 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.530
 squats 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.390
 I will warn you that this challenge 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.189
 is not suitable for anyone I 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.410
 think a girl who has never done 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.060
 sports or who has since stopped super 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.650
 long live not want to start 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.599
 by 50 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.370
 or then you try yourself started 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.629
 maybe by ten the next day is finally going 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.120
 to lengthen it because it's 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.920
 impossible to start with 50 from the 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.180
 start it's really going to make you tired 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.220
 will hurt us and you go 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.180
 want to give up you'll crack 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.069
 much faster 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.470
 so in fact at least which I'm not 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.750
 a sporty but not at all that 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.920
 I had done that is only two weeks 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.560
 before I actually did little 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.870
 cardio exercises that I had found 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.579
 on youtube and so in there was 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.739
 a lot of two squats and then suddenly 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:44.450
 it took me a little bit and suddenly 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.209
 I could start the challenge without 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.829
 worry gu10 fight killer my body got 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.840
 quickly used to this challenge it was 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:53.120
 still nice enough since the 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.680
 I did not want to stop or what 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.049
 I was really happy 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.250
 even there at more than 100 hp per day 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.230
 it did not bother me at all 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.540
 except that I decided to stop so 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.630
 why because I realized 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.329
 account that yes one already in a fortnight 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.299
 I already had thighs well muscled 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.950
 so that I was super super happy 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.359
 as well as the holy effect took a 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.620
 prettier shape than before patiently 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.970
 I really had no form of fes 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.680
 I really had the buttocks very very 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.700
 flat and today I find that it's 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.500
 much prettier 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.910
 except that I stopped because of my 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.709
 thighs because yes but thigh was 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.670
 hard and muscular except they started 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.350
 to grow 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.450
 since the muscle is heavier 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.859
 that greece has already been seen on the 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.840
 balance and also it was seen in my 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.730
 pants that is to say that I had 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.200
 wrong to get in but my thighs in my 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.079
 pants that at first I did not understand 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.730
 no I thought I was thin I had to take 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.410
 of weight in which I did not understand a 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.180
 refuge on the scale I saw that it 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.859
 was going a little bit up so I 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.450
 start to worry then after I 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.099
 spoke to my entourage and was told 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.530
 that yes indeed it was the squats 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:53.599
 who had increased my volume 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.280
 thigh so yes it's much more 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.370
 muscular is less an aggressor 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.170
 it's prettier but my goal was not 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.030
 of sailing to have you take a 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.209
 size above jill so suddenly 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.560
 I decided to stop the challenge but 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.840
 I did not stop the squats 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.850
 because that I think it's just awesome 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.739
 since it works really well for 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.560
 buttocks and here I have thighs in 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.910
 concrete sayah going on too but so you 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.889
 to avoid having them learn in 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:23.210
 volume what to do is instead 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:24.919
 to make more than 100 150 200 it serves 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.630
 really nothing to do with it instead of doing it 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.690
 as much as I decided to do just 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.930
 25 by evening and there honestly I am 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.210
 super satisfied results so for 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.790
 girls who are not looking to see that's 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.430
 to see what happened to me does not do 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.860
 this challenge is more like a cellar 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.470
 50 squat after that really depends 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.330
 until you want to go and you 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.900
 do it every night instead of in 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:53.210
 do 250 just for 30 days 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.650
 you make 25 every night and everything 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.419
 throughout the year so of course we 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.000
 could take breaks for example the 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.110
 weekend I do not do it and there I 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.030
 find that it will really be effective 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.590
 plus it really does not hurt and 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.990
 honestly it's super fast to do 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.450
 25 it takes me two minutes I believe 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.430
 all fart and that's me here I have no 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.260
 aches after I see there I find 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.700
 it's still nice enough after 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.160
 me my goal is not doing sports 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.900
 before exhausting myself I do not like it too much 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.030
 that's basically so the goal is not to 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.800
 mercury and no longer I'm just doing what 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.300
 I like what I need points 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.100
 positive that I found with this 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.900
 challenge so even if I do not have 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.780
 held to the end so for me that was 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.860
 not its part archer but it's the 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.350
 motivational side 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.180
 already if you get to do the 1st to 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.120
 Thirtieth day I tell you hat because 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.770
 than to type the 250 squat at the end I 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.630
 mean it's really strong is 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.010
 really really motivated and there I say 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.810
 a big congratulations to the people who are going 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.880
 hold to the end even if I find 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.370
 that the level of efficiency and 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.520
 made it useless because if you 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.080
 stop like that you spend 250 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.940
 the next day you definitely stop 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.030
 I think you will lose windows 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.289
 the muscular effect that you have won and 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:02.289
 cleverly will not even be pretty 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:03.879
 after that then that's the level of 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:05.710
 results should know that I have when 

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:08.259
 even lost one or two centimeters of 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.659
 thigh turn so I measured down 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:12.310
 from my thigh to mid- thigh and bone and 

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:14.349
 honestly I had really lost 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.449
 so it was still quite effective 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:18.879
 and I find that for the buttocks or if 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:20.620
 it was not bad because you do not have too much 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:22.449
 rely on the photos you see before 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.060
 after the figures of the flat pranks and 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:27.520
 30 days after the facts this super bomb 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.080
 and super g but that's not true and 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.639
 also girls who after 30 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.740
 days there is no result on the 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:35.800
 buttocks and that I think it depends 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.210
 maybe deposit of muscle people 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.770
 your way of doing squats 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.330
 since you can also hurt them 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.490
 and you do back pain sometimes and 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.199
 all this so I advise you to go 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.270
 see videos on youtube 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:48.460
 two sports coaches or pro who you 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:51.699
 shows how to do squats well and 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.409
 do not hesitate to change not to 

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:55.630
 do that classic squats of the times 

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:57.219
 to go to sumo squats or what since 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.810
 in addition to the heavens at squat that really 

00:06:57.219 --> 00:07:00.639
 at the bottom, toning the inside of the thighs 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:01.569
 so that was not bad it's this 

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:04.330

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:07.630

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:18.270
