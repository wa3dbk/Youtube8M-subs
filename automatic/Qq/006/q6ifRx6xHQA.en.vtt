00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello everyone with you shrimp today we 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.299
 consider a stunning mod which 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.150
 adds here are such funny chests with 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.219
 help that survive in minecraft 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.049
 will become much easier and let's get started 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.240
 the very first chest which 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.520
 called network chest it works by 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.470
 same principle as ender chest but 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.750
 in contrast, this chest can 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.430
 split into multiple networks and to this 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.769
 do we just need to ask 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.810
 identical names to these chests for example 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.090
 put two chests and give them a name 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.759
 the usual number 1 and next put another 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.770
 one chest on the already named 2 and now 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.960
 put in the chest the numbers one any 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.640
 subject for example ordinary sticks like 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.860
 see when opening another chest 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.020
 figure one there are our supposed 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.440
 shelves and if we open the chest with the number 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.719
 2 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.239
 there will be empty well just because we 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.129
 all with number 2 did not give anything like that 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.170
 way you can create a multitude 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.329
 chests networks put them any 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.280
 items by the way the chest is not necessary 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.230
 denote numbers as you can 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.059
 please the main thing that they coincided with 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.550
 other chests you want 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.769
 connect the next chest is called 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.420
 he works like a chest 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.549
 but there is a chest in it 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.200
 extra cell if placed in 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.400
 this cell is broken weapon or 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.470
 some tool 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.299
 then this item will gradually begin 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.460
 let's recover for example 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.439
 put this broken cell in this cell 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.630
 stone shovel now we have left 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.549
 one could only wait 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.159
 cheat because by the time it is 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.650
 the shovel will be repaired for very long 3 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.840
 the chest is called arrest as you see here 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.460
 there is also an extra cell with 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.560
 using this chest you can 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.600
 melt a bunch of ore for example let's 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.280
 we put in this chest a stack of iron and 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.590
 gold ore and also in this 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.509
 an extra seagull will place coal and 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.369
 now after a while all ore 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.090
 perry melt and stay in it 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.530
 the chest 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.570
 This chest is convenient because 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.460
 melts all the ores that are 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.560
 in this chest and you will not have to 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.060
 queues to put the ore into remelting as 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.189
 for example in a conventional oven 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.829
 and also the chest is simultaneously 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.899
 perfect friend girlfriend next 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.119
 a chest called grabbird with that 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.860
 translated as chest sinks when 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.439
 first opportunity he will try 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.899
 absorb all the things that lie next to 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.810
 for example we throw him some sticks 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.120
 and as you can see all these sticks he's under 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.470
 wanted and they ended up in such a chest 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.569
 The chest is perfect for 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.980
 use of any mechanisms 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.020
 for example for some farm 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.760
 reeds but not for the usual experiences 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.640
 crushers in general you just need to turn on 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.680
 fantasy next casket called bold 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.319
 sticking osd it works just like 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.180
 3 chests called about 1 hour only 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.670
 This chest can melt such 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.950
 things like sand cobble clay well and the 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.200
 like, well, the very last chest 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.180
 called desam chanting with 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.370
 whom you can disappoint your 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.590
 weapon unfortunately the recipe is crafting this 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.030
 I did not find the chest, maybe it just did not 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.100
 finalized for example you have 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.350
 some enchanted sword in my 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.930
 The case is such a diamond from heaven 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.910
 punishment 5 put this sword a chest and then 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.190
 we put a special extra seagull 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.019
 usual empty bottle and already through 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.030
 some time our spellbound 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.130
 diamond sword turn into ordinary 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.440
 why disappoint things in return for nothing 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.569
 don't get it i still don't understand but maybe 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.060
 this chest is just for a change 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.069
 Well, that's all you need to download and 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.840
 set this mod to survive in 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.940
