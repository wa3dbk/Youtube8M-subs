so obviously you can only do this in the
gym<00:04:08.420> when<00:04:08.540> it's<00:04:08.690> quiet<00:04:08.870> because<00:04:09.260> you<00:04:09.410> got<00:04:09.650> to

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
gym when it's quiet because you got to

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.100 
gym when it's quiet because you got to
set<00:04:09.860> your<00:04:09.890> stations<00:04:10.430> up<00:04:10.640> so<00:04:11.450> you<00:04:11.510> see<00:04:11.989> the

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
set your stations up so you see the

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.559 
set your stations up so you see the
tricep<00:04:12.500> pushdown<00:04:12.980> shoulder<00:04:13.580> width<00:04:13.760> grip<00:04:13.940> then

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
tricep pushdown shoulder width grip then

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.680 
tricep pushdown shoulder width grip then
we<00:04:14.720> go<00:04:14.840> into<00:04:15.019> overhead<00:04:15.620> tricep<00:04:16.100> dumbbells

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
we go into overhead tricep dumbbells

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.330 
we go into overhead tricep dumbbells
then<00:04:17.690> I'm<00:04:17.870> going<00:04:18.109> into<00:04:18.290> like<00:04:18.769> a<00:04:18.799> skull<00:04:19.160> crusher

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340
