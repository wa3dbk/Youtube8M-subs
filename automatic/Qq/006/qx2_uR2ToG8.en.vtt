00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:36.800
 lindner line tracks 90 the first 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.800
 standard tractor have an axle 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.300
 Directional rear sound mode 4 wheels 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.880
 motor allows him to display a 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.220
 turning diameter of 7 meters ie 2 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.230
 m less than with the heavens fixed this 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.930
 option also allows to have a 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.670
 fashion crabs steering pivots 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.489
 back are made with an alloy 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.320
 special allowing or rear of 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.500
 have a steering angle of 20 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.449
 degrees so it becomes more manageable and 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.530
 is intended, of course, for 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.880
 polyculture farms breeding the 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.790
 line stalking is equipped with an engine 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.830
 perkins 4 cylinders of 3.4 liters of 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.659
 displacement developing a power of 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.190
 102 horses 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:20.590
 it is equipped with a particulate filter 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.590
 for the respect of the stage iiib standard 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.580
 for the first time the builder 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.690
 Austrian incorporates a transmission to 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.780
 continuous variation 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.100
 on one of the tractors in its range 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:35.329
 developed in close collaboration with 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.759
 gdf the tnt 09 and even rewarded in 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.469
 the framework of the list of innovation 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.570
 a silver medal for the little 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:42.649
 size of its hydraulic motor 45 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.020
 cubic centimeters 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.969
 the builder also explains that a 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.049
 most of the power is 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:50.049
 mechanically transmitted 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.860
 in the cabin it's the new system 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.350
 drive that manages the 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.570
 transmission different modes of 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.729
 driving are available from the simplest 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.340
 or the accelerator pedal is used to 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.340
 the tractor's progress to the management of 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.500
 the speed via the central wheel the 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.360
 she drives also offers many 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.070
 shortcuts to activate different 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.770
 functions like blocking 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.650
 differential the regulator and the speed 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.930
 creeping the hallway also hosts a 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.590
 multifunction joystick integrating 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.300
 the reverse gear inverter 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.519
 useful for ordering a charger there 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:38.730
 offers management of the 3rd and 4th 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:42.239
 functions the maximum hydraulic flow 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.050
 is 88 liters minute ensured by a 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:48.150
 variable displacement pump 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.430
 comfort side the cabin is suspended and 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.830
 the seat with air suspension 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.600
 it will nevertheless be necessary to wait until 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.630
 next fall to see it in 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.630
 la France
