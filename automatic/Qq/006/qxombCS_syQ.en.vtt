00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.350 
about okay you've got a level of power
so<00:02:30.280> you're<00:02:30.430> going<00:02:30.610> to<00:02:30.700> assert<00:02:30.970> that<00:02:31.030> one

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
so you're going to assert that one

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.060 
so you're going to assert that one
person<00:02:31.690> has<00:02:31.810> power<00:02:32.050> of<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.350> other<00:02:32.500> that's<00:02:32.800> not

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
person has power of the other that's not

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.190 
person has power of the other that's not
equal<00:02:33.310> well<00:02:34.210> equal<00:02:34.570> playing<00:02:34.780> ground<00:02:35.080> is

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
equal well equal playing ground is

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.380 
equal well equal playing ground is
harder<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.590> develop<00:02:35.940> than<00:02:36.940> something<00:02:37.240> that's

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
harder to develop than something that's

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.680 
harder to develop than something that's
a<00:02:37.780> little<00:02:38.590> off<00:02:38.860> balance<00:02:39.310> so<00:02:39.580> always<00:02:40.270> in<00:02:40.630> the

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
a little off balance so always in the

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.570 
a little off balance so always in the
past<00:02:40.930> we've<00:02:41.230> relied<00:02:41.530> on<00:02:41.590> women

all that events and in my mind I

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.479 
all that events and in my mind I
automatically<00:03:07.900> thought<00:03:08.260> that<00:03:09.250> I<00:03:09.280> was

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
automatically thought that I was

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.660

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
Chapin on that and I automatically

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.580 
Chapin on that and I automatically
thought<00:03:15.430> oh<00:03:15.640> well<00:03:15.850> she's<00:03:16.840> a<00:03:16.870> woman<00:03:17.020> so<00:03:17.470> no

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
thought oh well she's a woman so no

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.930 
thought oh well she's a woman so no
matter<00:03:17.769> what<00:03:17.950> kind<00:03:18.070> of<00:03:18.190> shape<00:03:18.400> she's<00:03:18.640> in<00:03:18.670> I'm

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.420 
matter what kind of shape she's in I'm
throwing<00:03:19.150> she's<00:03:19.800> because<00:03:20.800> that's<00:03:21.100> the

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
throwing she's because that's the

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.030 
throwing she's because that's the
mentality

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
but it's built in because the center of

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.620 
but it's built in because the center of
our<00:03:48.500> brain<00:03:48.800> is<00:03:49.069> there<00:03:49.190> a<00:03:49.220> plan<00:03:49.610> a<00:03:50.060> piece<00:03:50.450> of

our brain is there a plan a piece of
brain<00:03:50.870> that<00:03:51.200> taught<00:03:51.890> us<00:03:52.099> from<00:03:52.340> the<00:03:52.459> beginning

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
brain that taught us from the beginning

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.640 
brain that taught us from the beginning
of<00:03:53.209> time<00:03:53.239> how<00:03:54.080> to<00:03:54.140> survive<00:03:54.620> but<00:03:55.549> we<00:03:55.790> have

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
of time how to survive but we have

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.070 
of time how to survive but we have
electronics<00:03:57.650> now<00:03:57.860> we<00:03:58.819> don't<00:03:59.030> have<00:03:59.360> to<00:03:59.630> care

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
electronics now we don't have to care

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.680 
electronics now we don't have to care
who's<00:04:00.709> stronger<00:04:01.040> than<00:04:01.280> the<00:04:01.400> other<00:04:01.549> I<00:04:01.850> don't<00:04:02.269> do

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
who's stronger than the other I don't do

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.420 
who's stronger than the other I don't do
this<00:04:02.810> because<00:04:02.930> I'm<00:04:03.170> stronger<00:04:03.680> I<00:04:04.190> don't<00:04:04.340> even

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
this because I'm stronger I don't even

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.940 
this because I'm stronger I don't even
think<00:04:04.549> I<00:04:04.819> am<00:04:05.000> more<00:04:05.239> strong<00:04:05.750> than<00:04:05.780> you<00:04:06.200> I<00:04:06.470> think

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
think I am more strong than you I think

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.250 
think I am more strong than you I think
I<00:04:07.010> did<00:04:07.220> this<00:04:07.370> for<00:04:07.430> her<00:04:07.730> for<00:04:08.060> a<00:04:08.269> look<00:04:08.569> for<00:04:09.019> I

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
I did this for her for a look for I

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.589 
I did this for her for a look for I
sculpted<00:04:09.950> my<00:04:10.099> body<00:04:10.340> because<00:04:11.030> I'm<00:04:11.150> artistic

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
sculpted my body because I'm artistic

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.410 
sculpted my body because I'm artistic
I'm<00:04:12.380> creative<00:04:12.980> and<00:04:13.250> I<00:04:13.519> care<00:04:13.819> about<00:04:14.060> my<00:04:14.209> hygiene

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
I'm creative and I care about my hygiene

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.580 
I'm creative and I care about my hygiene
so<00:04:15.290> I<00:04:15.319> decided<00:04:15.830> it<00:04:16.100> a<00:04:16.280> long<00:04:16.729> time<00:04:17.000> ago<00:04:17.239> that

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
so I decided it a long time ago that

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.170 
so I decided it a long time ago that
bodybuilding<00:04:18.590> has<00:04:19.340> more<00:04:19.700> benefits

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
bodybuilding has more benefits

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.110 
bodybuilding has more benefits
than<00:04:21.329> disadvantages<00:04:22.310> and<00:04:23.310> I'd<00:04:23.490> rather<00:04:23.790> live

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
than disadvantages and I'd rather live

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.390 
than disadvantages and I'd rather live
my<00:04:24.270> life<00:04:24.479> with<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:24.870> body<00:04:25.139> that<00:04:25.440> holds<00:04:25.830> up<00:04:26.130> over

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
my life with the body that holds up over

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.810 
my life with the body that holds up over
time<00:04:26.639> than<00:04:27.509> one<00:04:27.780> that<00:04:27.930> doesn't<00:04:28.430> isn't<00:04:29.430> about

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
time than one that doesn't isn't about

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.600 
time than one that doesn't isn't about
strength<00:04:30.210> or<00:04:31.199> making<00:04:31.650> you<00:04:31.830> feel<00:04:32.009> less<00:04:32.310> than<00:04:32.340> a

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
woman see I ran that problem

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.770 
woman see I ran that problem
well<00:04:56.070> it's<00:04:56.340> she's<00:04:56.729> recording<00:04:57.210> samples<00:04:57.660> a

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
well it's she's recording samples a

men<00:05:08.010> and<00:05:08.130> women<00:05:08.190> now<00:05:08.520> and<00:05:08.550> I<00:05:08.789> thought<00:05:08.970> we

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
men and women now and I thought we

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.379 
men and women now and I thought we
talking<00:05:09.419> about<00:05:09.479> yes<00:05:10.910> but<00:05:11.910> you<00:05:12.030> must<00:05:12.150> remember

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
talking about yes but you must remember

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:17.000 
talking about yes but you must remember
each<00:05:12.690> other<00:05:12.870> because<00:05:13.620> a<00:05:13.949> man<00:05:14.580> is<00:05:16.010> conditioned

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
each other because a man is conditioned

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.850 
each other because a man is conditioned
to<00:05:17.639> feel<00:05:17.940> and<00:05:18.210> think<00:05:18.389> differently<00:05:18.720> and<00:05:19.259> we<00:05:19.770> are

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
to feel and think differently and we are

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.550 
to feel and think differently and we are
also<00:05:20.070> conditioned<00:05:20.940> by<00:05:21.090> nature<00:05:21.630> because<00:05:22.139> you

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
also conditioned by nature because you

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.490 
also conditioned by nature because you
know<00:05:22.740> you're<00:05:23.580> just<00:05:23.910> you<00:05:24.210> you<00:05:24.750> carry<00:05:25.110> the<00:05:25.260> baby

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
be done so that that's one thing that

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.089
