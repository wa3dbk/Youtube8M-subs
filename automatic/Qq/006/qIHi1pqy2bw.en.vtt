00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.780
 our final conclusion 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.860
 small but oh that meets with the 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.330
 Panasonic Lumix Gf1 the nail on the 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.410
 head 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.119
 Panasonic has with the gm 1 one 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.189
 mirrorless system camera on the market 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.449
 brought the problems new standards in 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.880
 sitting at different points 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.949
 never could an image sensor in aps c 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.599
 format in such a small housing with 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.100
 interchangeable lens connection housed 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.850
 become 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.890
 Accordingly high is the quality 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.750
 she moves on the usual mft 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.699
 level and only just below the ABC 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.040
 models at speed 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.379
 gm achieved a solid as well as a 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.820
 also a sharp moderate result with 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.379
 five images per second can be 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.120
 also moving motives still relatively good 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.260
 document if you jpeg pictures 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.579
 is absorbed only by the 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.680
 speed and size of 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.000
 Memory card limited significantly 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.949
 faster is the cache at raw 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.500
 pictures filled 8 shots are but 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.640
 quite a good result 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.339
 truly outstanding work 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.500
 autofocus with 0 09 seconds becomes quasi 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.970
 without waiting sharp who the 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.619
 Camera starts and the first picture 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.649
 only wants to record 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.970
 wait a little over a second 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.710
 Videos records the gm 1 in full hd 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.539
 resolution only with 50 fields 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.130
 per second on image quality 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:20.690
 but still high and the video mode 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.950
 can also be because of his manual 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.050
 see options 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.700
 despite the small dimensions it has 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.349
 Panasonic at the gm 1 as well 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.539
 managed one with small smears 

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:31.459
 to allow comfortable operation 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.110
 this is mainly due to the high-resolution 

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:35.569
 and very good touchscreen display at 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.239
 that buttons and would be optimally supplemented 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:40.670
 also the kit lens lumix g vario 12 

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:42.349
 to 32 mm white to please 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.940
 it makes for its extremely small 

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:45.649
 dimensions and the very light weight 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.630
 very good from owns a quiet and 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.099
 extremely fleet focus motor and also the 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.610
 Processing gives no reason to 

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:51.770
 criticism 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.390
 Only one's own focus ring could be 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.099
 miss and also that the camera 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.580
 is not possible to start objectively 

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:58.009
 what a shame 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.750
 who has a digital camera as small as possible 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.979
 with a large image sensor 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.470
 which can be changed objectively 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:07.989
 gets in with the panasonic lumix g1 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.989
 for this size excellent overall package 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.890
 the idea camera the test judgments to 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.890
 camera
