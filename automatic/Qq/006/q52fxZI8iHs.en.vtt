00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
buddy is one over 4800 you have the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:24.520 
buddy is one over 4800 you have the
cards<00:01:09.710> already<00:01:10.810> so<00:01:11.810> then<00:01:22.750> it<00:01:23.750> started<00:01:24.319> like

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
cards already so then it started like

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:41.789 
cards already so then it started like
this<00:01:24.560> and<00:01:25.330> on<00:01:26.330> the<00:01:26.539> back<00:01:26.720> of<00:01:26.750> it<00:01:27.020> that<00:01:27.850> easily

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:51.510 

yes

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:02:12.870 

put<00:01:52.520> the<00:01:52.609> maker<00:01:52.850> or<00:02:09.280> good

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.230 

and<00:02:13.880> another<00:02:14.180> after<00:02:14.450> story<00:02:16.030> you<00:02:17.030> got<00:02:17.150> the

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
and another after story you got the

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.809 
and another after story you got the
probability<00:02:17.780> of<00:02:17.810> this<00:02:18.020> is<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.680> over<00:02:18.860> 16<00:02:19.340> so<00:02:19.550> we

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
probability of this is to over 16 so we

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:31.320 
probability of this is to over 16 so we
will<00:02:20.060> get<00:02:20.720> to

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.990 

actually<00:02:32.260> this<00:02:32.380> figure<00:02:32.710> is<00:02:32.890> larger<00:02:33.790> than

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
actually this figure is larger than

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.140 
actually this figure is larger than
three<00:02:34.210> times<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:36.190> they<00:02:36.640> have<00:02:36.820> a<00:02:36.850> lot<00:02:37.120> of

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
three times and they have a lot of

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.010 
three times and they have a lot of
accessories<00:02:37.600> yeah<00:02:38.290> pretty<00:02:38.800> good<00:02:39.780> smell<00:02:40.780> of

new<00:02:41.230> graph<00:02:41.530> I<00:02:41.740> huh<00:02:45.930> ok<00:02:48.390> Bo<00:02:49.390> buddies<00:02:51.660> blue<00:02:54.390> I

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
new graph I huh ok Bo buddies blue I

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.660 
new graph I huh ok Bo buddies blue I
could<00:02:57.100> get<00:02:57.310> double<00:02:57.730> for<00:02:58.140> some<00:02:59.140> reason<00:02:59.620> we<00:03:00.460> get

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
could get double for some reason we get

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.530 
could get double for some reason we get
double<00:03:00.970> pack<00:03:01.150> this<00:03:01.300> level<00:03:01.840> higher<00:03:02.560> cut<00:03:02.800> back

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
double pack this level higher cut back

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.290 
double pack this level higher cut back
so<00:03:04.540> far<00:03:05.250> they<00:03:06.250> will<00:03:06.310> free<00:03:06.610> your<00:03:06.730> name<00:03:07.030> of<00:03:07.210> the
