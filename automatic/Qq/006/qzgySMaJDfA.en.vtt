00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
through the costume again giving it a

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.360 
through the costume again giving it a
little<00:00:07.109> bit<00:00:07.290> of<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:07.440> closer<00:00:07.710> look

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
little bit of a closer look

little bit of a closer look
piece<00:00:08.760> by<00:00:08.790> piece<00:00:09.000> here<00:00:09.590> right<00:00:10.590> now<00:00:10.679> I'm<00:00:10.830> in<00:00:11.070> the

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
piece by piece here right now I'm in the

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.870 
piece by piece here right now I'm in the
main<00:00:11.429> shell<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.750> I<00:00:12.809> also<00:00:13.340> why<00:00:14.340> would<00:00:14.549> normally

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
main shell and I also why would normally

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.840 
main shell and I also why would normally
make<00:00:15.059> my<00:00:15.240> legs<00:00:15.920> independent<00:00:16.920> I'd<00:00:17.130> have<00:00:17.609> four

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
make my legs independent I'd have four

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.769 
make my legs independent I'd have four
pieces<00:00:18.560> for<00:00:19.560> two<00:00:19.710> legs<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:20.330> decided<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.480> attach

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
pieces for two legs I decided to attach

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.300 
pieces for two legs I decided to attach
them<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.230> shell<00:00:22.439> just<00:00:22.680> because<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.220> the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
them to the shell just because of the

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.640 
them to the shell just because of the
way<00:00:23.630> they<00:00:24.630> look<00:00:24.900> they<00:00:25.109> look<00:00:25.140> like<00:00:25.380> they're

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
way they look they look like they're

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.460 
way they look they look like they're
going<00:00:25.800> up<00:00:25.980> into<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.550> shell<00:00:26.789> now<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.660> if<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.260> had

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
going up into the shell now and if I had

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.959 
going up into the shell now and if I had
attached<00:00:28.859> them<00:00:29.160> they<00:00:30.090> probably<00:00:30.300> would<00:00:30.990> have

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:31.969 
attached them they probably would have

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.209 
attached them they probably would have
taken<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.350> would<00:00:34.350> add<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.500> little<00:00:34.890> bit<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.160> a

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
taken a would add a little bit of a

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.709 
taken a would add a little bit of a
different<00:00:35.520> look<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.820> like<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.000> lipping<00:00:36.390> lip

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
different look I like the lipping lip

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:37.069 
different look I like the lipping lip
here

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
here

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.510 
here
the<00:00:37.320> only<00:00:37.440> issues<00:00:37.710> it's<00:00:37.890> really<00:00:37.950> hard<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.370> get

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
the only issues it's really hard to get

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.639 
the only issues it's really hard to get
into<00:00:38.899> I<00:00:39.899> kind<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.800> do<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.570> chair<00:00:42.570> chair<00:00:43.320> dip

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
into I kind of do a chair chair dip

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.250 
into I kind of do a chair chair dip
while<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.100> put<00:00:45.090> my<00:00:45.210> legs<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:45.539> there<00:00:45.690> but<00:00:46.079> that's

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
while I put my legs in there but that's

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.799 
while I put my legs in there but that's
this<00:00:46.469> piece<00:00:47.300> will<00:00:48.300> give<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.539> look<00:00:48.660> at<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
this piece will give you a look at the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.229 
this piece will give you a look at the
size<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.680> know

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
size you know

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.420 
size you know
350<00:00:51.239> run<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.570> into<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:52.140> shell<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.399> shell

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
350 run it into the shell and the shell

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.930 
350 run it into the shell and the shell
is<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.390> bunch<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.809> patterns<00:00:55.340> flat<00:00:56.340> leaves<00:00:56.610> that

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
is a bunch of patterns flat leaves that

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.650 
is a bunch of patterns flat leaves that
we<00:00:57.030> put<00:00:57.210> together<00:00:58.399> it<00:00:59.399> has<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.609> couple<00:00:59.910> dips<00:01:00.359> and

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
we put together it has a couple dips and

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.900 
we put together it has a couple dips and
things<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.260> don't<00:01:02.070> look<00:01:02.250> perfect<00:01:02.760> I

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
things in it that don't look perfect I

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.340 
things in it that don't look perfect I
think<00:01:03.000> it's<00:01:03.239> pretty<00:01:03.420> cool

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
think it's pretty cool

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.990 
think it's pretty cool
and

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.550 

what<00:01:10.000> I<00:01:10.030> would<00:01:10.210> do<00:01:10.330> next<00:01:10.510> to<00:01:10.810> get<00:01:10.900> in<00:01:11.050> is<00:01:11.170> I<00:01:11.290> put

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
what I would do next to get in is I put

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.030 
what I would do next to get in is I put
both<00:01:12.010> my<00:01:12.040> feet

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
both my feet

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.690 
both my feet
in<00:01:14.270> that's<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.510> separate<00:01:15.960> piece<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.920> bottom

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
in that's a separate piece as the bottom

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.530 
in that's a separate piece as the bottom
of<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.810> knee<00:01:18.960> pad<00:01:19.230> look<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.890> then<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:21.060> barrel

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
of the knee pad look and then a barrel

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.080 
of the knee pad look and then a barrel

foot<00:01:27.600> wrap<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:28.410> my<00:01:28.530> field<00:01:28.770> going<00:01:29.100> next<00:01:29.630> then

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.490 
foot wrap so my field going next then
I'm<00:01:31.350> going<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.590> put<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:31.830> my<00:01:31.980> upper<00:01:32.340> arms

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500

extra 262 seen here these will go into

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.550 
extra 262 seen here these will go into
my<00:01:57.920> sides<00:01:58.220> of<00:01:58.580> the<00:01:59.300> help<00:01:59.540> of<00:01:59.660> assistant<00:02:00.320> just

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
my sides of the help of assistant just

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.780 
my sides of the help of assistant just
to<00:02:00.830> keep<00:02:01.340> my<00:02:02.170> my<00:02:03.170> arms<00:02:03.470> from<00:02:04.070> flying<00:02:04.580> all

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790

replaced not totally necessary I just

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.260

usually<00:02:07.400> like<00:02:07.550> a<00:02:07.580> little<00:02:07.850> extra<00:02:08.119> stability

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
usually like a little extra stability

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.450

started on to make two triangles in
which<00:04:35.030> I<00:04:35.150> pressure<00:04:35.510> fit<00:04:35.810> three<00:04:36.080> 50s<00:04:36.580> to<00:04:37.580> make

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
which I pressure fit three 50s to make

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.840 
which I pressure fit three 50s to make
the<00:04:37.880> hand<00:04:38.150> and<00:04:38.420> then<00:04:39.230> here<00:04:39.500> is<00:04:39.650> a<00:04:39.980> thumb<00:04:40.670> I

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
attached down towards the base of where

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.360 
attached down towards the base of where
I<00:04:43.310> start<00:04:44.060> stop<00:04:44.360> doing<00:04:44.780> the<00:04:44.870> full<00:04:45.050> barrel<00:04:45.380> and

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
I start stop doing the full barrel and

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.760 
I start stop doing the full barrel and
then<00:04:46.580> my<00:04:46.760> favorite<00:04:47.150> piece<00:04:47.600> is<00:04:48.730> my<00:04:49.730> right<00:04:50.000> hand

same<00:04:51.770> deal<00:04:52.010> with<00:04:52.160> the<00:04:52.280> hand<00:04:52.490> except<00:04:52.940> this<00:04:53.060> time

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
same deal with the hand except this time

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.740 
same deal with the hand except this time
I<00:04:53.390> left<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:54.110> knots<00:04:54.980> on<00:04:55.730> the<00:04:55.910> end<00:04:56.060> of<00:04:56.150> the<00:04:56.210> 350

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
I left the knots on the end of the 350

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.659 
I left the knots on the end of the 350
as<00:04:56.840> opposed<00:04:57.140> to<00:04:57.230> using<00:04:57.350> the<00:04:57.500> clean<00:04:57.770> end<00:04:57.980> so

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
as opposed to using the clean end so

00:04:58.669 --> 00:04:59.800 
as opposed to using the clean end so
that<00:04:58.700> I<00:04:58.850> could<00:04:59.030> tie<00:04:59.180> them<00:04:59.300> all<00:04:59.390> together<00:04:59.510> and

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
that I could tie them all together and

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.260 
that I could tie them all together and
make<00:04:59.870> a<00:04:59.960> fist<00:05:00.350> and<00:05:00.669> in<00:05:01.669> the<00:05:01.850> fist

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
make a fist and in the fist

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.900 
make a fist and in the fist
I<00:05:02.390> put<00:05:02.660> the<00:05:03.380> nunchucks<00:05:03.950> the<00:05:04.220> nunchucks<00:05:04.700> are

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
I put the nunchucks the nunchucks are

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.980 
I put the nunchucks the nunchucks are
made<00:05:05.090> by<00:05:05.990> spiral<00:05:06.770> twisting<00:05:07.280> of<00:05:07.790> 260<00:05:08.480> and<00:05:08.750> then

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
made by spiral twisting of 260 and then

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.800 
made by spiral twisting of 260 and then
stuffing<00:05:09.680> it<00:05:09.830> into<00:05:10.220> a<00:05:10.250> 646<00:05:11.120> and<00:05:11.360> popping<00:05:11.720> the

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
stuffing it into a 646 and popping the

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.310 
stuffing it into a 646 and popping the
646<00:05:12.530> so<00:05:13.280> that<00:05:13.400> it<00:05:13.520> makes<00:05:13.790> that<00:05:14.320> really

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
646 so that it makes that really

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.780 
646 so that it makes that really
cool-looking<00:05:15.650> shape<00:05:16.070> to<00:05:16.220> it<00:05:16.250> then<00:05:16.460> I<00:05:16.550> just

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
cool-looking shape to it then I just

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.320 
cool-looking shape to it then I just
took<00:05:17.000> a<00:05:17.090> 260<00:05:17.780> orange<00:05:18.710> and<00:05:19.040> did<00:05:19.820> some<00:05:20.090> ear

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
took a 260 orange and did some ear

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.440 
took a 260 orange and did some ear
twists<00:05:20.780> and<00:05:20.930> then<00:05:21.260> ran<00:05:21.860> it<00:05:22.010> over<00:05:22.070> top<00:05:22.450> so

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
twists and then ran it over top so

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:24.969 
twists and then ran it over top so
there's<00:05:23.600> a<00:05:23.660> little<00:05:23.870> gap<00:05:24.110> here<00:05:24.169> then<00:05:24.530> I<00:05:24.620> popped

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
there's a little gap here then I popped

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:33.190 
there's a little gap here then I popped
just<00:05:25.880> one<00:05:26.180> puff<00:05:26.419> of<00:05:26.540> air<00:05:26.720> of<00:05:29.650> 350<00:05:31.990> Silver's<00:05:32.990> and

just one puff of air of 350 Silver's and

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.409 
just one puff of air of 350 Silver's and
then<00:05:33.830> I<00:05:33.890> just<00:05:34.040> tied<00:05:34.310> them<00:05:34.460> in<00:05:34.640> links<00:05:35.120> and<00:05:35.300> it

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:39.020 
then I just tied them in links and it
just<00:05:35.570> makes<00:05:35.750> a<00:05:35.930> really<00:05:37.000> really<00:05:38.000> cool

00:05:57.499 --> 00:05:57.509 
can take a little bit but without that

00:05:57.509 --> 00:05:59.939 
can take a little bit but without that
you<00:05:58.509> know<00:05:58.630> aside<00:05:58.900> from<00:05:59.110> using<00:05:59.320> ten<00:05:59.680> balloons

00:05:59.939 --> 00:05:59.949 
you know aside from using ten balloons

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:02.700 
you know aside from using ten balloons
to<00:06:00.669> make<00:06:00.850> everything<00:06:01.120> with<00:06:01.419> the<00:06:01.870> chain<00:06:02.139> it's

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
to make everything with the chain it's

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.999 
to make everything with the chain it's
not<00:06:02.979> it's<00:06:03.370> not<00:06:03.490> a<00:06:03.550> hard<00:06:04.350> weapon<00:06:05.350> to<00:06:05.440> make<00:06:05.590> and

so really fun the the using 350s for the
chain<00:06:10.570> and<00:06:10.840> using<00:06:11.530> the<00:06:11.710> 646<00:06:12.580> add<00:06:12.789> some<00:06:13.090> hat<00:06:13.270> to

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:13.449 
chain and using the 646 add some hat to

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:15.900 
chain and using the 646 add some hat to
it<00:06:13.599> so<00:06:13.780> you<00:06:13.840> really<00:06:14.139> can<00:06:14.349> swing<00:06:14.650> around<00:06:14.910> but
