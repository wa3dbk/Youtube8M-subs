00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
because they're just placed in the most

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:11.340 
because they're just placed in the most
random<00:01:09.700> spots<00:01:10.119> but<00:01:10.780> yeah<00:01:10.899> that's<00:01:11.140> something

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
random spots but yeah that's something

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.020 
random spots but yeah that's something
that's<00:01:11.499> been<00:01:11.710> quite<00:01:12.039> good<00:01:12.219> about<00:01:12.369> 143<00:01:12.729> not

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.749 
is kill confirmed kill go home is pretty
much<00:01:32.259> the<00:01:32.319> only<00:01:32.499> thing<00:01:33.219> I<00:01:33.280> played<00:01:33.520> when<00:01:33.729> I

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
much the only thing I played when I

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.840 
much the only thing I played when I
played<00:01:33.850> public<00:01:34.509> on<00:01:34.780> 143<00:01:35.530> it's<00:01:35.889> the<00:01:36.490> best<00:01:36.670> game

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
played public on 143 it's the best game

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.249 
played public on 143 it's the best game
tight<00:01:37.149> because<00:01:37.179> you<00:01:37.569> actually<00:01:37.719> have<00:01:38.049> to<00:01:38.170> run

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
tight because you actually have to run

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.289 
tight because you actually have to run
around<00:01:38.409> a<00:01:38.889> bit<00:01:39.310> more<00:01:39.399> than<00:01:39.609> if<00:01:39.939> you're<00:01:40.119> playing

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
around a bit more than if you're playing

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.809 
around a bit more than if you're playing
other<00:01:40.539> game<00:01:40.780> types<00:01:41.049> less<00:01:41.469> campus<00:01:41.950> less<00:01:42.520> being

00:01:42.809 --> 00:01:42.819 
other game types less campus less being

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:44.819 
other game types less campus less being
a<00:01:42.909> keyword<00:01:43.299> there's<00:01:43.719> still<00:01:44.079> lots<00:01:44.229> of<00:01:44.409> campus

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
a keyword there's still lots of campus

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.919 
a keyword there's still lots of campus
but<00:01:45.100> I<00:01:45.340> still<00:01:45.999> think<00:01:46.240> it's<00:01:46.359> really<00:01:46.569> great<00:01:46.659> game

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
but I still think it's really great game

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:48.510 
but I still think it's really great game
type<00:01:47.200> so<00:01:47.469> that's<00:01:47.649> pretty<00:01:47.859> much<00:01:47.979> the<00:01:48.369> only

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
type so that's pretty much the only

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.099 
type so that's pretty much the only
things<00:01:48.969> that<00:01:49.119> I'm<00:01:49.209> going<00:01:49.389> to<00:01:49.479> miss<00:01:49.749> I<00:01:49.959> can

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:50.109 
things that I'm going to miss I can

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:51.899 
things that I'm going to miss I can
pretty<00:01:50.229> much<00:01:50.319> speak<00:01:50.679> for<00:01:50.889> everyone<00:01:51.159> and<00:01:51.639> I<00:01:51.700> say

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
pretty much speak for everyone and I say

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.609 
pretty much speak for everyone and I say
that<00:01:52.090> probably<00:01:52.240> not<00:01:52.899> going<00:01:53.049> to<00:01:53.109> be<00:01:53.229> going<00:01:53.350> back

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
that probably not going to be going back

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.410 
that probably not going to be going back

just sitting in one spot it actually

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.020 
just sitting in one spot it actually
only<00:02:14.320> works<00:02:14.590> if<00:02:14.800> you're<00:02:14.950> leaving<00:02:15.310> so<00:02:15.490> that's

much better than 143 no more if I three

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.989 
much better than 143 no more if I three
there's<00:02:29.950> lots<00:02:30.159> of<00:02:30.310> little<00:02:30.459> things<00:02:30.549> you<00:02:30.909> can

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:30.999 
there's lots of little things you can

there's lots of little things you can
get<00:02:31.120> stuck<00:02:31.389> on<00:02:31.569> I<00:02:31.749> know<00:02:32.260> I<00:02:32.590> found<00:02:33.159> trying<00:02:33.519> to

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
get stuck on I know I found trying to

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.220 
get stuck on I know I found trying to
run<00:02:33.670> away<00:02:33.700> from<00:02:33.879> Emory<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:34.480> then<00:02:34.629> I've<00:02:34.780> just

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
run away from Emory and then I've just

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.800 
run away from Emory and then I've just
run<00:02:36.040> into<00:02:36.189> a<00:02:36.340> doorway<00:02:36.790> or<00:02:37.030> something<00:02:37.480> anodes

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
run into a doorway or something anodes

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.089 
run into a doorway or something anodes
from<00:02:38.019> the<00:02:38.079> day<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.590> next<00:02:38.709> thing<00:02:38.950> I'm<00:02:39.069> looking

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
from the day the next thing I'm looking

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.429 
from the day the next thing I'm looking
forward<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.790> playing<00:02:39.939> is<00:02:40.299> the<00:02:40.510> multi<00:02:40.900> team<00:02:41.200> get

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:41.439 
forward to playing is the multi team get

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:43.259 
forward to playing is the multi team get
back<00:02:41.650> so<00:02:41.889> that's<00:02:42.040> where<00:02:42.849> you<00:02:42.969> can<00:02:43.090> actually

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
back so that's where you can actually

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.199 
back so that's where you can actually
play<00:02:43.810> in<00:02:44.260> teams<00:02:44.889> or<00:02:45.069> for<00:02:45.280> whatever<00:02:45.489> against

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
play in teams or for whatever against

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.869 
play in teams or for whatever against
three<00:02:46.810> teams<00:02:47.079> so<00:02:47.409> that's<00:02:48.010> pretty<00:02:48.189> exciting<00:02:48.430> to

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
three teams so that's pretty exciting to

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.879 
three teams so that's pretty exciting to
see<00:02:49.060> I<00:02:49.090> reckon<00:02:49.540> it<00:02:49.629> will<00:02:49.719> be<00:02:49.870> chaos<00:02:50.109> that<00:02:50.620> I

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:50.889 
see I reckon it will be chaos that I

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:52.979 
see I reckon it will be chaos that I
think<00:02:51.400> that<00:02:51.519> will<00:02:51.639> be<00:02:51.669> quite<00:02:51.879> fun<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.209> try<00:02:52.780> at

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
think that will be quite fun to try at

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.259 
think that will be quite fun to try at
least<00:02:53.200> so<00:02:53.829> that's<00:02:53.980> it<00:02:54.189> for<00:02:54.219> me<00:02:54.519> i'm<00:02:54.730> aiming<00:02:55.090> to

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
least so that's it for me i'm aiming to

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.599 
least so that's it for me i'm aiming to
release<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.689> video<00:02:55.900> each<00:02:56.290> friday<00:02:56.829> so<00:02:57.010> make<00:02:57.579> sure
