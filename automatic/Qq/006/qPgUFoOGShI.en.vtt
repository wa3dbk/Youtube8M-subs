00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.300
 the picking we started crossed 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.280
 well nobody's going 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.670
 be long 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.670
 we go 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.469
 well we really played a game of 89 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.850
 minutes is extraordinary 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.850
 congratulate my soccer player 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.770
 respecting our rival congratulate 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.420
 a game proposal like that of lightning 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.670
 brave brave 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.790
 I think he ended up paying the 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.549
 physical effort of the previous match that 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.470
 it cost us in a minute the game we 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:19.390
 could have cost the party 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.630
 luckily we reacted very fast and 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.720
 we play a football of a very high flight 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.490
 with a great physical predisposition a 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.689
 great pressure in rival field we do not receive 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.600
 no danger and it seems to me that 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:38.470
 we round out an 89- minute performance 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.220
 closest to our best version 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.220
 that we can 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:53.420
 I did not expect them to put together a defense of 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.820
 three central or playing a 3-3-1-3 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.460
 I think that later surpassed by the 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.369
 speed of our bands 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.780
 reconvert to the line of four but 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.149
 either of the two proposals also 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.350
 sometimes interpretation to execution 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.660
 It has nothing to do with the drawing but with 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.020
 the night that you have because later still 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.780
 changing his drawing the beam received more 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.319
 goals with the previous one so I think 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.239
 that our attack speed our 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:23.540
 association in attack with very performances 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.790
 good from our attackers and with a 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.550
 great pressure adjusted from the rest of the 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:33.819
 team we solidify we build a 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.819
 round performance in a performance that 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.310
 a priori or before the game was very 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:41.019
 hard to imagine because a very rival 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.050
 hard the lightning that puts you in trouble 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:48.640
 with the minimum distraction that you commit 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:51.849
 today we committed the start of the game and 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:56.459
 then in 89 minutes we reconverted that 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.459
 minute in with a phenomenal performance 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:13.460
 I've been thinking about answering that 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.350
 question but basically we have always 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.110
 imagined winning the next game 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:21.170
 say one can dream big when 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.230
 small dreams are fulfilling and 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.380
 stomp firmly win the eibar in his field 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.600
 it's a difficult task and we plan the 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.130
 match or we prepare the match for 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:36.340
 always win it so what 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:39.430
 my biggest goal is to beat the next one and 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.710
 after continually win see 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.380
 where it leaves us I hope the performance of 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.540
 today I really liked me has 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.969
 liked my players 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.310
 receive a goal from the locker room and 

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:54.400
 get back on top like the other day 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.400
 speaks of a team proud of itself 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.930
 who believes in that line does not move away and goes 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.590
 behind her looking for the rival arch 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:06.730
 with determination and today was a clear 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:10.829
 shows that the team plays at 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.829
 certain way and it does very well 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.820
 I think he rounded off a performance with a goal 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.280
 that generally sant and have these 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.500
 insinuations of constant danger 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.960
 today I add an absolute effectiveness 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:30.960
 in their situations and that for a 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.960
 forward is a formidable news 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.210
 suppose 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.069
 that can convert a lot when the 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.530
 unchecks they make leave it face 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:45.210
 to the goal but without those unmarked 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.819
 Goal situations would not have happened 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.639
 I think Santi is a footballer who 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:52.979
 you have to vary or mix unchecks to 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.900
 foot with breaks and when 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.629
 he breaks exploiting his great speed 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.900
 he is a lethal jurist when he transforms 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:05.169
 when he transforms his game into vertical and 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:07.569
 today to everything you des frame 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:10.650
 so I think I bought a performance 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:10.650
 very good 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:15.409
 good night maybe thanks
