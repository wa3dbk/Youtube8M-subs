 way I went down a ladder and I 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:55.900
 crossed a trainer who told me she 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:56.199

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.229

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.920

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.000
 for 150 years fucking the delirium I 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.319
 did not know what to do 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.400
 no matter where I went I could not 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.349
 to leave life there was a wall 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.730
 invisible that was blocking the door I 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.400
 could not go out by the south I can 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.510
 not go out from the north then I got 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.049
 said that there might have been a 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.459
 solution rather to the east when we loved 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.709
 go bastille where the little girl is 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.880
 weird because whore fucking whore 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:16.049
 quickly a beat to the whore I am 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.040
 saved I was reassured I took my husband 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.150
 because in arms because that's the 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.599
 only pokemon that I could take in 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.530
 my arms when a low blow while the blow 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.549
 I could no longer take him in my arms 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.319
 then I told myself that when an exit 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.860
 maybe I'd get out of this shit and 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.190
 I was right 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.769
 but I knew very well that I had to 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.829
 come back to this city briefly I was going 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.829
 in China 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.760
 if he returns one day I will make him the 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.110
 afraid of his life 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.110
