00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:07.660
 what I am going to teach you how 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:10.690
 set up the 32 inch lcd 30 l 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.780
 330 although as we can see we download 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.519
 files with strange sounds 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.220
 we need a control no matter what 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.900
 kind, we just need the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.930
 led identifier to do this I 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.330
 in my case I used a cable with some 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.210
 lizards to make the bridge between the 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:31.510
 connection we use a stereo cable or 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.359
 monkey successively we connect it to the 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:37.870
 departure port of the head set 

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:39.339
 we played immediately 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.579
 sound frequencies are going to produce a 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.579
 menu 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.090
 If we have technical failures 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.219
 there they are as you can see, the 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.970
 options menu as I have it in 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:20.460
 original control 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.830
 lcd uses its own universal control 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.350
 is set to everything on the TV 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.230
 hear the password that in this case 0000 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.030
 in this case the television shows me no 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.820
 It shows me how the forums say 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.080
 option your stress what I did was enter 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.270
 to the option tool 2 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.580
 as you can be marked here and between 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.530
 option that says I was at zero 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.780
 to change it is simply given to the 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.060
 arrow as it says here or it is given to 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.940
 the right that says off or to the left 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:54.380
 there in that case the one on the left 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:56.780
 I give ok ok to leave if I enter the menu that 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.510
 appears wii is villa or that now 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.720
 I just come looking for the usb in this 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:05.720
 case this is all obsolete the 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.149
 connect to the transmit part the emitter 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.250
 he says loading youtube 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.959
 it seems to me to see how in that bag 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.239
 I only have images 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.239
 let's use photo lists 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.620
 and images 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.910
 these 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.879
 As you can see, you can go 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.980
 changing the images successively not 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:42.319
 I've tried with audio and with video yet 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:45.480
 because I have not put audio to the device 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.879
 but as you can see it is not any 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:53.099
 type or nothing can observe model my 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:54.989
 television here 32 l of 330 that I hope 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.920
 make it Serbian statute many 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:02.390
