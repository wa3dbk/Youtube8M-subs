definitely choose the aloe vera gel the

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.630 
definitely choose the aloe vera gel the
aloe<00:05:09.080> vera<00:05:09.200> gel<00:05:09.500> is<00:05:09.680> multi-purpose<00:05:10.010> I

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
aloe vera gel is multi-purpose I

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.390 
aloe vera gel is multi-purpose I
actually<00:05:11.060> use<00:05:11.480> it<00:05:11.660> as<00:05:11.810> a<00:05:11.870> shaving<00:05:12.410> gel<00:05:12.620> it<00:05:12.860> also

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
actually use it as a shaving gel it also

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.430 
actually use it as a shaving gel it also
helps<00:05:13.820> with<00:05:13.940> moisture<00:05:14.419> retention<00:05:14.750> because<00:05:15.140> it

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
helps with moisture retention because it

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.560 
helps with moisture retention because it
forms<00:05:15.860> like<00:05:15.950> a<00:05:16.100> protective<00:05:16.640> barrier<00:05:17.030> around

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
light hold but it doesn't flake but I

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.010 
light hold but it doesn't flake but I
will<00:05:25.010> say<00:05:25.280> that<00:05:25.310> the<00:05:25.550> eco<00:05:25.790> styler<00:05:26.030> gel<00:05:26.120> revives

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
will say that the eco styler gel revives

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.470 
will say that the eco styler gel revives
better<00:05:27.650> and<00:05:28.040> that<00:05:28.250> is<00:05:28.280> so<00:05:28.669> important<00:05:29.150> to<00:05:29.300> me

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
better and that is so important to me

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.480 
better and that is so important to me
because<00:05:30.050> I<00:05:30.169> like<00:05:30.350> my<00:05:30.560> washing<00:05:30.770> girls<00:05:31.100> to<00:05:31.250> last

a lot longer

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.020 
a lot longer
risky<00:05:36.410> eco<00:05:36.650> styler<00:05:36.890> gel<00:05:36.980> then<00:05:37.520> with<00:05:37.760> the<00:05:37.850> aloe

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
risky eco styler gel then with the aloe

vera<00:05:38.150> gel<00:05:38.480> for<00:05:38.720> that<00:05:38.870> reason<00:05:39.290> alone<00:05:39.470> and<00:05:40.100> I

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.790 
vera gel for that reason alone and I

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.120 
vera gel for that reason alone and I
feel<00:05:41.090> it<00:05:41.240> has<00:05:41.419> a<00:05:41.450> lot<00:05:41.660> to<00:05:41.690> do<00:05:41.990> with<00:05:42.230> it<00:05:42.590> defining

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
feel it has a lot to do with it defining

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:52.569
