were both released in the fourth quarter
of<00:00:17.039> 2009<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.260> they're<00:00:19.260> virtually<00:00:19.680> identical

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
of 2009 and they're virtually identical

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.540 
of 2009 and they're virtually identical
to<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.939> Ocarina<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.750> Time<00:00:22.050> link<00:00:22.340> the<00:00:23.340> green

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
video they they're actually completely

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.070 
video they they're actually completely
identical<00:00:30.029> there<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.420> nothing<00:00:30.869> different

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
identical there is nothing different

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.380

there<00:00:56.570> what<00:00:57.570> was<00:00:57.660> odd<00:00:57.870> about<00:00:58.199> these<00:00:58.410> two

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
there what was odd about these two

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.779 
there what was odd about these two
statues<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.489> that<00:01:00.020> they<00:01:01.020> they<00:01:01.980> were<00:01:02.010> released

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
statues is that they they were released

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.130 
statues is that they they were released
like<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.090> said<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.480> fourth<00:01:03.719> quarter<00:01:03.930> of

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
like I said in the fourth quarter of

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.030 
like I said in the fourth quarter of
2009<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:05.580> was<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.790> full<00:01:06.470> basically<00:01:07.470> two<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.010> a

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
2009 this was a full basically two and a

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.300 
2009 this was a full basically two and a
half<00:01:08.280> years<00:01:08.909> after<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:10.140> previous<00:01:10.920> statue

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
half years after the previous statue

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.469 
half years after the previous statue
which<00:01:11.610> was<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.939> Sheikh<00:01:12.150> statue<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:14.090> it<00:01:15.090> was<00:01:15.240> it

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
which was the Sheikh statue so it was it

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.499 
which was the Sheikh statue so it was it
was<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.630> pretty<00:01:16.080> long<00:01:16.619> gap<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.280> between<00:01:17.509> there

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
was a pretty long gap in between there

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.390 
was a pretty long gap in between there
was<00:01:18.630> actually<00:01:18.960> originally<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.799> different

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
was actually originally a different

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.140 
was actually originally a different
design<00:01:20.970> for<00:01:21.000> both<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.720> Goron<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.549> Zora<00:01:23.549> tunic

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
design for both the Goron and Zora tunic

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.600 
design for both the Goron and Zora tunic
link<00:01:24.420> however<00:01:25.320> they<00:01:25.590> ended<00:01:26.100> up<00:01:26.250> going<00:01:26.460> with

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
link however they ended up going with

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.200 
link however they ended up going with
the<00:01:26.820> exact<00:01:27.600> same<00:01:27.900> design<00:01:28.740> as<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.490> Ocarina<00:01:30.180> of

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
the exact same design as the Ocarina of

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.990 
the exact same design as the Ocarina of
Time<00:01:30.509> link<00:01:30.650> I'm<00:01:31.650> just<00:01:31.799> gonna<00:01:31.920> toss<00:01:32.610> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
Time link I'm just gonna toss the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.810 
Time link I'm just gonna toss the
Ocarina<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.720> Time<00:01:33.990> link<00:01:34.020> 1<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.799> here<00:01:35.460> as<00:01:35.579> well

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
Ocarina of Time link 1 in here as well

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.090 
Ocarina of Time link 1 in here as well
just<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.420> can<00:01:36.540> see<00:01:37.470> all<00:01:37.619> three<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.979> these

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
just so you can see all three of these

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.289 
just so you can see all three of these
babies<00:01:38.490> next<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.909> each<00:01:39.060> other<00:01:40.189> see<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.579> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
babies next to each other see the the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.569 
babies next to each other see the the
Ocarina<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.810> Time<00:01:43.049> link<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.500> green<00:01:43.979> tunic<00:01:44.399> one

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
Ocarina of Time link the green tunic one

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.639 
Ocarina of Time link the green tunic one
he<00:01:45.390> originally<00:01:46.079> only<00:01:46.259> had<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> run<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:47.689> 2,500<00:01:48.689> so

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
he originally only had a run of 2,500 so

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.069 
he originally only had a run of 2,500 so
when<00:01:50.520> they<00:01:50.670> were<00:01:50.729> making<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.210> Goron<00:01:51.570> tunic<00:01:51.930> in

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
when they were making the Goron tunic in

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.340 
when they were making the Goron tunic in
Zora<00:01:52.829> tunic<00:01:53.220> they<00:01:54.030> collectively<00:01:54.689> had<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.049> run

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
Zora tunic they collectively had a run

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.870 
Zora tunic they collectively had a run
of<00:01:55.490> 2,500<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:56.640> each<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:56.850> these<00:01:57.229> only<00:01:58.229> go<00:01:58.409> up<00:01:58.439> to

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
of 2,500 so each of these only go up to

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.929 
of 2,500 so each of these only go up to
1250<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:01.040> despite<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.159> fact<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.430> there<00:02:02.759> are

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
1250 so despite the fact that there are

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.700 
1250 so despite the fact that there are
there<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:03.360> basically<00:02:03.479> there's<00:02:03.960> only<00:02:04.170> half<00:02:04.530> the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
there so basically there's only half the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.219 
there so basically there's only half the
amount<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:05.040> goron<00:02:05.430> tunic<00:02:05.790> links<00:02:06.119> as<00:02:06.270> regular

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
amount of goron tunic links as regular

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.999 
amount of goron tunic links as regular
tunic<00:02:08.009> lengths<00:02:08.310> despite<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.450> fact<00:02:10.009> these

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
tunic lengths despite that fact these

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.520 
tunic lengths despite that fact these
are<00:02:11.069> not<00:02:11.370> nearly<00:02:11.910> as<00:02:12.209> expensive

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
are not nearly as expensive

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.730 
are not nearly as expensive
they're<00:02:13.860> all<00:02:14.010> sold<00:02:14.340> out<00:02:14.490> even<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:15.120> green<00:02:15.360> one

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
they're all sold out even the green one

myself for the rest of you guys these

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.390 
myself for the rest of you guys these
are<00:04:08.850> probably<00:04:09.180> just<00:04:09.360> best<00:04:09.750> left<00:04:10.350> for<00:04:10.739> Internet

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
are probably just best left for Internet

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.449 
are probably just best left for Internet
videos<00:04:11.760> like<00:04:12.090> these<00:04:12.269> but<00:04:13.170> that's<00:04:13.709> it<00:04:13.920> for<00:04:13.950> this

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
videos like these but that's it for this

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.520 
videos like these but that's it for this
video<00:04:14.640> and<00:04:15.000> I<00:04:15.570> will<00:04:15.630> continue<00:04:16.230> my<00:04:16.470> journey

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
video and I will continue my journey

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.870 
video and I will continue my journey
through<00:04:16.919> the<00:04:17.400> first<00:04:18.120> 4<00:04:18.390> figure<00:04:18.810> collection

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
through the first 4 figure collection

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.060 
through the first 4 figure collection
with<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:21.510> next<00:04:21.720> statue<00:04:21.930> probably<00:04:22.890> in<00:04:22.979> a<00:04:23.039> few

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
with the next statue probably in a few

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.360 
with the next statue probably in a few
videos<00:04:23.610> so<00:04:23.940> this<00:04:24.930> was<00:04:25.140> probably<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.560> last<00:04:25.860> I

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
videos so this was probably the last I

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.650 
videos so this was probably the last I
think

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
think

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.830 
think
this<00:04:26.750> was<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.080> exactly<00:04:27.380> the<00:04:27.500> last<00:04:27.740> one<00:04:28.840> up

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
this was the exactly the last one up

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.870 
this was the exactly the last one up
into<00:04:30.200> the<00:04:30.350> darunia<00:04:30.680> first<00:04:31.400> four<00:04:31.610> figures

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
into the darunia first four figures

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.060 
into the darunia first four figures
statue<00:04:32.120> that<00:04:32.930> they<00:04:33.170> were<00:04:33.230> actually<00:04:33.440> this<00:04:33.830> size

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
statue that they were actually this size

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.600 
statue that they were actually this size
after<00:04:34.670> this<00:04:35.120> we<00:04:35.390> started<00:04:35.870> to<00:04:36.140> get

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
after this we started to get

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.820 
after this we started to get
significantly<00:04:37.610> larger<00:04:38.240> statues<00:04:38.780> for<00:04:39.650> better

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
significantly larger statues for better

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.830 
significantly larger statues for better
for<00:04:40.070> worse<00:04:40.130> I<00:04:40.550> personally<00:04:41.120> like<00:04:41.300> these<00:04:41.540> sized

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
for worse I personally like these sized

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.290 
for worse I personally like these sized
ones<00:04:42.140> since<00:04:42.440> they<00:04:42.710> are<00:04:42.980> kind<00:04:43.640> convenient<00:04:44.120> for

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
ones since they are kind convenient for

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.540 
ones since they are kind convenient for
display<00:04:44.630> purposes<00:04:45.050> although<00:04:45.950> the<00:04:46.190> larger

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
display purposes although the larger

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.190 
display purposes although the larger
ones<00:04:46.760> they<00:04:46.970> have<00:04:47.150> their<00:04:47.330> positives<00:04:47.870> as<00:04:48.020> well

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
ones they have their positives as well

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.980 
ones they have their positives as well
so<00:04:48.550> well<00:04:49.550> join<00:04:50.090> me<00:04:50.240> next<00:04:50.360> time<00:04:50.510> when<00:04:50.840> we'll

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
so well join me next time when we'll

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.300 
so well join me next time when we'll
take<00:04:51.200> a<00:04:51.260> look<00:04:51.500> at<00:04:51.590> more<00:04:51.770> items<00:04:52.070> in<00:04:52.160> my
