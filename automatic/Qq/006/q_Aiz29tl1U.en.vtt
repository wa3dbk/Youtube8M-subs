00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.810
 barbar natcho immediately after defeating 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.639
 Sanji on cisco congratulations on this 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.190
 uneasy and victoria what do you say about 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.049
 match yes indeed to us 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.610
 lucky we scored very quickly 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.800
 in the third minute we already opened an account and 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.840
 led and further we had several 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.910
 100% wonderful moments we 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.720
 could increase our advantage and already 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.789
 in the first half guests remove all questions in 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.320
 We could not develop a burning match 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.900
 our advantage but in such matches 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.399
 when you have 10 and you can't 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.309
 neither can you score your moments 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.079
 it is necessary to be able to save 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.460
 this advantage and finish the match with 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.190
 the minimum score that we managed 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.219
 make mariu fernandez victorious 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.539
 goal especially appreciated your pass will tell 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.969
 how the Volga managed such a transfer 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.399
 make everyone know that marie is very good 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.500
 It turns out to attack and and support our 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.480
 attacking actions and i also that episode 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.399
 I saw that also shifted to the center and 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.280
 defender go for the same so than I 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.680
 I saw Maria 1 and gave him Samara 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.690
 took this ball and and already actually myself 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.150
 product gate and he decided to retreat 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.070
 Zod, I think it does not matter who scores I 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.500
 I think that the most important team should 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.570
 to win at that moment it seemed that 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.909
 it will be the only goal in this match 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.710
 nonetheless happened so became 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.840
 the only thing that prevented even score 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.880
 Today, we have scored a goal and then later in 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.830
 musa had two more moments and one moment 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.390
 also that there are three iron points we have 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.729
 was still in the first half after scoring 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.310
 goals and we had to win but this 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.390
 did not happen but as I said not 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.579
 every game 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.960
 football players can score so very 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.930
 it was important to keep the mine 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.060
 advantage and here's the result 10 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.070
 bring to the bitter end from the podium 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.140
 it seemed that in a match with sparta that 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.390
 today there were sometimes breaks pretty 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.270
 big midfield players 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.700
 Did not have time to go back it 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.619
 this is your way by bros and 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.250
 how physically the team feels 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.050
 if a 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.000
 all the players we go on the attack 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.870
 Of course, and all supporting such if 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.150
 Of course, there are no people left behind 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.729
 here you are right but if we look three 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.369
 goals three matches we played and no 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.610
 the goal did not miss it accordingly 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.940
 explains this here in many ways 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.520
 what 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.230
 protection of our forces all right what 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.280
 concerns physical condition when i can 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.050
 say that physical 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.230
 unsatisfactory good see how 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.450
 the team runs and and almost to the end 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.770
 the match keeps a good pace what mood 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.600
 will be on sparta 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.340
 the whole team can have you somehow 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.070
 try to rehabilitate for not 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.959
 score penalty know give up report 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.570
 how important is this match to us 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.370
 how to win 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.959
 Of course the last match we have is not very 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.660
 it turned out we achieved that result 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.070
 which we wanted and so now on 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.450
 the upcoming match we need very much 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.390

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.440
