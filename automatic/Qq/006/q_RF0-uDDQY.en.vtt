00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.899 
this one I say I'm gonna do the unboxing
so<00:01:03.300> you've<00:01:03.420> cut<00:01:03.570> open<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.840> sides<00:01:04.850> this<00:01:05.850> is

so you've cut open the sides this is

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.609 
so you've cut open the sides this is
also<00:01:06.270> really<00:01:06.810> heavy<00:01:07.229> quality<00:01:09.320> construction

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.399 

it's<00:01:13.619> not<00:01:13.799> cardboard<00:01:14.549> but<00:01:14.700> it's<00:01:14.909> plastic<00:01:15.840> it

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
it's not cardboard but it's plastic it

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.460 
it's not cardboard but it's plastic it
so<00:01:16.710> it's<00:01:16.860> very<00:01:17.009> heavy<00:01:17.430> duty<00:01:17.939> which<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.470> good

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
so it's very heavy duty which is good

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.410 
so it's very heavy duty which is good
because<00:01:19.680> means<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.460> probably<00:01:20.610> isn't

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
because means that it probably isn't

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.300 
because means that it probably isn't
broken<00:01:21.930> when<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.200> bought<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.409> made<00:01:23.130> sense

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
broken when you bought it made sense

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.969 
broken when you bought it made sense
that<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:24.150> took<00:01:24.450> time<00:01:24.750> nor<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.320> make<00:01:25.439> this<00:01:25.619> then

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
that it took time nor to make this then

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.850 
that it took time nor to make this then
just<00:01:26.310> throw<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.270> package<00:01:28.200> together<00:01:28.530> that

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
just throw a package together that

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.830 
just throw a package together that
pushed<00:01:29.070> up<00:01:29.189> time<00:01:32.000> now<00:01:33.000> picture<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.450> Ox<00:01:33.600> way<00:01:33.780> to
