00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:15.930
 So folks, I use this one here. 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:18.270
 put away is the plastic foot have this 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.000
 opening was called pacelli because 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.420
 It is closed here. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:30.440
 he is what I do now is to get a 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.440
 sulphite sheet I'm going to fit film 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.040
 I like to fit the right stuff. 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:41.140
 Upstairs at the top of the hill for me. 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.949
 have to cut it and always fails to 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.309
 out 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:48.550
 this part that is the part that you take 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.870
 priest here and this part that always has 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.210
 a brand logo 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.879
 so leave it out because I'm going 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.500
 cut here because it occurs because I 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.690
 I'm going to print the size of a 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.730
 sulfite I can not put there 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.320
 folder size printer 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.430
 so it's very simple now I'm going to cut 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:09.450
 Here and then I'll open this 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.450
 that it is closed 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.659
 And as you could see I cut it well. 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:24.310
 yields to the leaf the best thing is to place 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.909
 inside her because she does not have 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.950
 error 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:32.729
 now just take the sheet inside and 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.729
 cut here 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:42.000
 and now she is ready 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.280
 Can you pass on our mix so much? 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.110
 on one side as on the other does 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.420
 and to pass the products in pacha I 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.850
 I like to use a brush like that 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.650
 here it is basic but may be another 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.420
 brush, but the important thing is that 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.760
 they are made of synthetic bristles 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.250
 will not absorb the product and will be 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.920
 easier to clean after I do 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.770
 a video of how to clean the brush 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.240
 You'll then pick up my side pass there. 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.580
 that you want 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.500
 and then we'll see with the base here I 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.480
 use this one's big for me was that 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.780
 more worked out and she's super cheap 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.020
 here someone 120 ml and I paid 6 and 50 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.209
 so pay me a lot for you here ok 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.580
 more than half I've used enough I 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.800
 I like to spill over the paste 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.280
 then I'll spread and tips as well 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.280
 a little 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.750
 Look, it was a little bit because if I 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:40.260
 I need more I do not need 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.620
 interesting to have too much and that's it 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.620
 spread 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.120
 And look, I've been through it all now. 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.590
 you can see the brightness and the 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.210
 And now I'll wait to dry to be able to 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.710
 even now pass the next step of the 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.630
 misturinha and for those who have not seen in 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.740
 my other video will do here again 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.100
 for you 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.610
 so I use 4 spoons to have molina 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.610
 milky 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:38.359
 two of varnish craquelÃª many people me 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:40.310
 ask if you can change the ingredients 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:43.010
 of this mixture 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.409
 I do not say because I've even changed 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.260
 just the brand and did not work 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:50.540
 I'm going to make a bumper sticker 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.620
 nails for you with another type of 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.599
 So, wait a minute, wait a minute. 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.560
 for this mix I'm going to use only one 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:59.560
 spoon of water 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.190
 and then just mix everything 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.510
 and then people like to mix it up 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.390
 sign on this spot indicates draft 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.209
 mayonnaise knows why it stays there 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:21.340
 closed wine and when I need I 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.080
 use this not to spend it all with sweat and 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.200
 Now I just have to spend in my house. 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:30.340
 where I had passed base is the game 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:37.570
 just as I played the base and already comes with 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:39.370
 the brush spread at the beginning will stay 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.400
 this little bit but as it goes 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:51.820
 drying it spreads and the next one 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:54.070
 Calling is gonna be much better now Let's go 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.110
 for the second layer then it is 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:59.260
 basically so I make my own 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.150
 it's worth remembering that each layer 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.740
 of the product I'm going through in the folder 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.930
 I cleaned my brush 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.210
 I did not put in this video how to clean 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.850
 the celso was not going to get too long boring 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.760
 watching the next video will be 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.710
 the step by step of how clean in heaven and 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.930
 I really hope you enjoyed it. 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.610
 I liked it a lot and liked it. 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.610
