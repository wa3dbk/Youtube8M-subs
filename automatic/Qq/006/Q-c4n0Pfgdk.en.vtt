00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.440 

this<00:00:06.050> time<00:00:06.230> I<00:00:06.440> put<00:00:07.430> some<00:00:07.580> option<00:00:07.910> part<00:00:08.120> 4<00:00:08.330> d8

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:10.450 
this time I put some option part 4 d8

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:16.060 
this time I put some option part 4 d8
the<00:00:11.450> long<00:00:12.040> longer<00:00:13.040> shock<00:00:14.020> this<00:00:15.020> is<00:00:15.200> a<00:00:15.230> 10

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
the long longer shock this is a 10

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.680 
the long longer shock this is a 10
millimeters<00:00:16.520> longer<00:00:16.850> than<00:00:17.060> standard<00:00:17.180> shocks

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
millimeters longer than standard shocks

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.230 
millimeters longer than standard shocks
and<00:00:17.900> standard<00:00:18.860> stock<00:00:19.369> kids<00:00:19.610> have<00:00:19.820> a<00:00:19.850> same

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
and standard stock kids have a same

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.120 
and standard stock kids have a same
shock<00:00:20.449> front<00:00:20.720> in<00:00:20.840> the<00:00:20.960> air<00:00:21.020> so<00:00:21.560> same<00:00:21.740> side<00:00:21.950> from

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
shock front in the air so same side from

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.840 
shock front in the air so same side from
linear<00:00:22.430> so<00:00:23.860> sometime<00:00:24.860> like<00:00:25.010> the<00:00:25.160> big<00:00:25.340> jumps<00:00:25.670> in

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:25.850 
linear so sometime like the big jumps in

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.420 
linear so sometime like the big jumps in
a<00:00:26.080> little<00:00:27.080> bumpy<00:00:27.350> section<00:00:27.500> I<00:00:27.890> think<00:00:28.250> longer

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.430 
a little bumpy section I think longer

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.670 
a little bumpy section I think longer
shocks<00:00:28.790> is<00:00:28.910> better<00:00:29.090> and<00:00:29.330> this<00:00:29.720> is<00:00:29.840> already<00:00:30.530> a

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.680 
shocks is better and this is already a

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.479 
shocks is better and this is already a
bit<00:00:30.830> of<00:00:30.920> a<00:00:31.010> market<00:00:31.280> like<00:00:31.430> a<00:00:32.140> couple<00:00:33.140> months<00:00:33.290> ago

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
bit of a market like a couple months ago

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:39.280 
bit of a market like a couple months ago
in<00:00:35.230> the<00:00:36.230> long<00:00:36.410> shock<00:00:36.710> with<00:00:38.079> longer<00:00:39.079> shock

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
in the long shock with longer shock

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.050 
in the long shock with longer shock
towers<00:00:39.500> also<00:00:40.070> shocked<00:00:40.250> I<00:00:40.370> was<00:00:40.400> like<00:00:40.579> more<00:00:40.820> like

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.060 
towers also shocked I was like more like

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.650 
towers also shocked I was like more like
higher<00:00:41.840> positions<00:00:42.350> chart<00:00:43.070> is<00:00:43.220> a<00:00:43.450> both<00:00:44.450> same

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
higher positions chart is a both same

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.460 
higher positions chart is a both same
times<00:00:45.370> and<00:00:46.370> if<00:00:47.150> long<00:00:47.480> shock<00:00:47.780> can<00:00:48.320> make<00:00:48.590> more

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
times and if long shock can make more

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.240 
times and if long shock can make more
down<00:00:51.470> trouble<00:00:51.860> so<00:00:52.310> if<00:00:53.149> going<00:00:53.480> up<00:00:53.690> and<00:00:54.250> running

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
down trouble so if going up and running

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.299 
down trouble so if going up and running
jump<00:00:55.780> have<00:00:56.780> a<00:00:56.809> more<00:00:57.050> capacity<00:00:57.320> so<00:00:57.829> easy<00:00:58.100> to

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
jump have a more capacity so easy to

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.540 
jump have a more capacity so easy to
drive<00:00:58.460> this<00:00:59.390> is<00:00:59.510> one<00:00:59.840> biggest<00:01:00.170> point<00:01:00.550> option

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
drive this is one biggest point option

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.510 
drive this is one biggest point option
parts<00:01:01.820> and<00:01:02.570> also<00:01:02.960> are<00:01:03.699> the<00:01:04.699> main<00:01:04.879> chest<00:01:05.149> is<00:01:06.520> the

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
parts and also are the main chest is the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.340 
parts and also are the main chest is the
more<00:01:07.700> lightweight<00:01:07.909> type<00:01:08.299> like<00:01:08.659> more<00:01:08.899> cut<00:01:09.140> like

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
more lightweight type like more cut like

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.940 
more lightweight type like more cut like
like<00:01:09.890> this<00:01:10.070> and<00:01:10.540> this<00:01:11.540> is<00:01:11.690> like<00:01:11.900> about<00:01:12.440> like<00:01:12.710> 80

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
like this and this is like about like 80

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.610 
like this and this is like about like 80
grams<00:01:13.220> more<00:01:13.549> lighter<00:01:13.729> than<00:01:13.940> stock<00:01:14.630> ones<00:01:14.840> so

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
grams more lighter than stock ones so

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.430 
grams more lighter than stock ones so
it's<00:01:15.740> like<00:01:15.860> kind<00:01:15.890> of<00:01:16.220> more<00:01:16.760> quick<00:01:17.000> response<00:01:17.510> in

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
it's like kind of more quick response in

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.280 
it's like kind of more quick response in
a<00:01:18.500> more<00:01:18.799> high<00:01:18.920> jump<00:01:19.159> and<00:01:19.990> this<00:01:20.990> is<00:01:21.080> like<00:01:21.260> a

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
a more high jump and this is like a

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.740 
a more high jump and this is like a
second<00:01:21.940> second<00:01:22.940> half<00:01:23.110> yeah<00:01:24.110> different<00:01:25.750> income

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
second second half yeah different income

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.210 
second second half yeah different income
like<00:01:26.930> a<00:01:27.280> few<00:01:28.280> small<00:01:28.820> aluminum<00:01:29.180> parts<00:01:30.220> like

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
like a few small aluminum parts like

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.390 
like a few small aluminum parts like
that<00:01:31.760> shop<00:01:32.000> I<00:01:32.299> don't<00:01:33.020> I'd<00:01:33.110> say<00:01:33.260> how<00:01:33.470> to<00:01:34.100> call

a stock one is still but this is a

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.590 
a stock one is still but this is a
Luminum<00:01:39.470> so<00:01:40.070> the<00:01:40.130> lightweight<00:01:40.580> its<00:01:41.180> most<00:01:41.420> like

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
Luminum so the lightweight its most like

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.969 
Luminum so the lightweight its most like
small<00:01:41.900> parts<00:01:43.689> like<00:01:44.689> inside<00:01:45.380> standing<00:01:45.650> post

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
small parts like inside standing post

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.670 
small parts like inside standing post
and<00:01:47.740> it's<00:01:48.740> unlike<00:01:49.040> like<00:01:49.369> wafers<00:01:49.759> small<00:01:50.330> ones

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
and it's unlike like wafers small ones

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.620 
and it's unlike like wafers small ones
and<00:01:51.680> at<00:01:52.009> this<00:01:52.130> time<00:01:52.189> we<00:01:52.670> bring<00:01:52.880> to<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.240> new<00:01:53.420> dog
