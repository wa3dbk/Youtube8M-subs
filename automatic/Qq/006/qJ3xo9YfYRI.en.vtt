with a cure eyes ballistics it offers

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:35.439 
with a cure eyes ballistics it offers
more<00:00:33.590> range<00:00:33.950> without<00:00:34.250> losing<00:00:34.850> anything<00:00:35.090> else

more range without losing anything else

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:37.689 
more range without losing anything else
compared<00:00:36.379> to<00:00:36.469> the<00:00:36.559> field<00:00:36.829> choke<00:00:37.129> which<00:00:37.430> gives

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
compared to the field choke which gives

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:39.790 
compared to the field choke which gives
slightly<00:00:38.090> more<00:00:38.300> range<00:00:38.540> but<00:00:39.110> significantly

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
slightly more range but significantly

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.430 
slightly more range but significantly
reduces<00:00:40.460> the<00:00:40.579> already<00:00:40.970> low<00:00:41.180> stability<00:00:41.750> next

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
reduces the already low stability next

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.350 
reduces the already low stability next
we<00:00:42.530> have<00:00:42.590> persistence<00:00:43.220> this<00:00:43.760> weapon<00:00:44.090> grows

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
we have persistence this weapon grows

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.600 
we have persistence this weapon grows
more<00:00:44.600> accurate<00:00:45.020> the<00:00:45.110> longer<00:00:45.440> it's<00:00:45.560> fired<00:00:45.890> now

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
more accurate the longer it's fired now

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.920 
more accurate the longer it's fired now
usually<00:00:46.790> it<00:00:47.030> would<00:00:47.149> be<00:00:47.270> a<00:00:47.300> pretty<00:00:47.630> helpful

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
usually it would be a pretty helpful

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.110 
usually it would be a pretty helpful
perk<00:00:48.260> for<00:00:48.440> machine<00:00:48.829> gun<00:00:49.010> mostly<00:00:49.730> because<00:00:49.850> they

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
perk for machine gun mostly because they

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.030 
perk for machine gun mostly because they
have<00:00:50.270> so<00:00:50.510> many<00:00:50.570> bullets<00:00:51.020> so<00:00:51.320> the<00:00:51.470> gun<00:00:51.649> is<00:00:51.829> fired

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
have so many bullets so the gun is fired

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.069 
have so many bullets so the gun is fired
longer<00:00:52.610> in<00:00:52.760> turn<00:00:53.120> making<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.600> perk<00:00:53.809> very

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
longer in turn making the perk very

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.830 
longer in turn making the perk very
useful<00:00:54.590> however<00:00:55.250> against<00:00:55.820> all<00:00:55.970> odds<00:00:56.180> has<00:00:56.540> very

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
useful however against all odds has very

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.260 
useful however against all odds has very
low<00:00:57.020> stability<00:00:57.559> and<00:00:57.739> a<00:00:57.920> very<00:00:58.190> small<00:00:58.610> mag<00:00:58.940> size

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
low stability and a very small mag size

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.540 
low stability and a very small mag size
meaning<00:01:00.050> you<00:01:00.140> wouldn't<00:01:00.440> necessarily<00:01:00.550> benefit

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
meaning you wouldn't necessarily benefit

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.370 
meaning you wouldn't necessarily benefit
from<00:01:01.730> firing<00:01:02.090> this<00:01:02.300> gun<00:01:02.510> for<00:01:02.750> long<00:01:02.930> periods<00:01:02.960> of

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.380 
from firing this gun for long periods of

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.130 
from firing this gun for long periods of
time<00:01:03.500> because<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:04.610> recoil<00:01:05.030> be<00:01:05.180> crazy<00:01:05.479> and<00:01:05.810> you

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
time because the recoil be crazy and you

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.450 
time because the recoil be crazy and you
would<00:01:06.290> quickly<00:01:06.530> find<00:01:06.860> yourself<00:01:07.219> with<00:01:07.369> an

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
would quickly find yourself with an

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.670 
would quickly find yourself with an
empty<00:01:07.700> magazine<00:01:07.969> but<00:01:08.810> even<00:01:08.960> though<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:09.469> low

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
empty magazine but even though the low

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.739 
empty magazine but even though the low
stability<00:01:10.280> had<00:01:10.429> me<00:01:10.549> cautious<00:01:11.060> at<00:01:11.209> first<00:01:11.240> it

00:01:11.739 --> 00:01:11.749 
stability had me cautious at first it

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:13.749 
stability had me cautious at first it
turns<00:01:12.289> out<00:01:12.469> that<00:01:12.530> it's<00:01:12.829> not<00:01:13.009> as<00:01:13.280> big<00:01:13.490> as<00:01:13.670> an

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
turns out that it's not as big as an

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:15.760 
turns out that it's not as big as an
issue<00:01:13.880> as<00:01:14.209> you<00:01:14.359> would<00:01:14.479> think<00:01:14.560> this<00:01:15.560> gun<00:01:15.740> has

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
issue as you would think this gun has

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.069 
issue as you would think this gun has
the<00:01:16.039> highest<00:01:16.369> range<00:01:16.759> out<00:01:17.090> of<00:01:17.299> all<00:01:17.569> machine

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:18.079 
the highest range out of all machine

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:20.410 
the highest range out of all machine
guns<00:01:18.259> in<00:01:18.350> the<00:01:18.439> game<00:01:18.709> but<00:01:19.340> originally<00:01:19.850> I<00:01:19.909> feared

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
guns in the game but originally I feared

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.879 
guns in the game but originally I feared
that<00:01:20.659> the<00:01:20.810> range<00:01:21.020> wouldn't<00:01:21.409> see<00:01:21.560> its<00:01:21.679> full

00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:21.889 
that the range wouldn't see its full

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:24.010 
that the range wouldn't see its full
potential<00:01:22.249> because<00:01:22.789> of<00:01:23.179> the<00:01:23.299> low<00:01:23.450> stability

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
potential because of the low stability

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.139 
potential because of the low stability
however<00:01:24.829> I<00:01:24.950> found<00:01:25.219> that<00:01:25.429> if<00:01:25.549> you<00:01:25.670> fire<00:01:25.939> this

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
however I found that if you fire this

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.209 
however I found that if you fire this
gun<00:01:26.359> like<00:01:26.630> a<00:01:26.659> scout<00:01:27.139> rifle<00:01:27.350> it<00:01:27.859> actually

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.219 
gun like a scout rifle it actually

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:31.419 
gun like a scout rifle it actually
performs<00:01:29.029> very<00:01:29.479> well<00:01:29.600> at<00:01:30.020> long<00:01:30.319> range<00:01:30.649> if<00:01:31.009> you

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
performs very well at long range if you

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:33.760 
performs very well at long range if you
pulse<00:01:31.759> or<00:01:31.939> burst<00:01:32.209> fire<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:32.990> low<00:01:33.170> stability

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
pulse or burst fire the low stability

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.249 
pulse or burst fire the low stability
will<00:01:34.009> take<00:01:34.219> over<00:01:34.609> but<00:01:35.179> if<00:01:35.329> you<00:01:35.420> fire<00:01:35.719> one<00:01:35.990> shot

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
will take over but if you fire one shot

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.949 
will take over but if you fire one shot
at<00:01:36.889> a<00:01:36.920> time<00:01:37.249> you'll<00:01:37.909> have<00:01:38.119> no<00:01:38.359> problem<00:01:38.810> taking

00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:38.959 
at a time you'll have no problem taking

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:41.379 
at a time you'll have no problem taking
your<00:01:39.229> enemies<00:01:39.469> down<00:01:39.679> and<00:01:40.009> this<00:01:40.609> is<00:01:40.849> due<00:01:41.090> to<00:01:41.119> the

00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:41.389 
your enemies down and this is due to the

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:44.349 
your enemies down and this is due to the

just<00:02:26.540> said<00:02:26.870> this<00:02:27.020> gun<00:02:27.230> has<00:02:27.260> a<00:02:27.440> very<00:02:27.770> small<00:02:28.040> mag

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
just said this gun has a very small mag

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.760 
just said this gun has a very small mag
of<00:02:28.310> 24<00:02:29.000> but<00:02:29.450> with<00:02:29.570> field-scale<00:02:29.990> it<00:02:30.260> bumps<00:02:30.650> it

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
of 24 but with field-scale it bumps it

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.280 
of 24 but with field-scale it bumps it
to<00:02:30.950> 50<00:02:31.430> and<00:02:31.820> even<00:02:32.240> though<00:02:32.330> that's<00:02:32.600> still<00:02:32.900> small

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
to 50 and even though that's still small

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.320 
to 50 and even though that's still small
for<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.560> machine<00:02:33.680> gun<00:02:34.100> it<00:02:34.280> really<00:02:34.580> goes<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.000> long

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
for a machine gun it really goes a long

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.420 
for a machine gun it really goes a long
way<00:02:35.600> like<00:02:36.290> I<00:02:36.320> mentioned<00:02:36.470> earlier<00:02:36.800> it<00:02:37.250> only

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
way like I mentioned earlier it only

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.340 
way like I mentioned earlier it only
takes<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:37.790> maximum<00:02:38.360> of<00:02:38.480> four<00:02:38.840> bullets<00:02:39.260> that

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
takes a maximum of four bullets that

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.680 
takes a maximum of four bullets that
kill<00:02:39.560> someone<00:02:39.890> in<00:02:39.980> PvP<00:02:40.490> so<00:02:41.060> even<00:02:41.330> when<00:02:41.420> you<00:02:41.540> got

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
kill someone in PvP so even when you got

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.390 
kill someone in PvP so even when you got
eight<00:02:41.900> shots<00:02:42.290> left<00:02:42.530> you<00:02:42.709> can<00:02:42.860> be<00:02:42.950> confident

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
eight shots left you can be confident

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.130 
eight shots left you can be confident
with<00:02:43.550> this<00:02:43.640> gun<00:02:43.850> in<00:02:43.940> your<00:02:44.030> hand<00:02:44.240> I<00:02:44.510> think

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
with this gun in your hand I think

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.900 
with this gun in your hand I think
that's<00:02:45.260> what<00:02:45.380> makes<00:02:45.590> this<00:02:45.709> gun<00:02:45.890> so<00:02:46.220> awesome<00:02:46.790> in

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
that's what makes this gun so awesome in

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.640 
that's what makes this gun so awesome in
the<00:02:47.030> crucible<00:02:47.350> because<00:02:48.350> you're<00:02:48.470> often

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
the crucible because you're often

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.710 
the crucible because you're often
scavenging<00:02:49.430> for<00:02:49.550> bits<00:02:49.820> of<00:02:50.030> heavy<00:02:50.300> ammo

knowing that you can potentially get

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.850

three kills with just nine shots is very

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.280 
three kills with just nine shots is very

of<00:03:29.750> seven<00:03:30.080> kills<00:03:30.320> it<00:03:30.530> takes<00:03:31.040> five<00:03:31.430> and

very<00:03:44.030> easily<00:03:44.450> be<00:03:45.110> the<00:03:45.260> best<00:03:45.530> machine<00:03:45.980> gun

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
very easily be the best machine gun

very easily be the best machine gun
possible<00:03:46.700> at<00:03:46.790> this<00:03:46.910> point<00:03:47.000> in<00:03:47.239> the<00:03:47.329> game<00:03:47.360> and

possible at this point in the game and
extremely<00:03:48.620> Opie<00:03:49.100> I<00:03:49.340> think<00:03:50.090> against<00:03:50.360> a<00:03:50.450> lot<00:03:50.630> is

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
extremely Opie I think against a lot is

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.180 
extremely Opie I think against a lot is
already<00:03:51.200> one<00:03:51.380> of<00:03:51.440> the<00:03:51.560> best<00:03:51.739> machine<00:03:52.040> guns

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
already one of the best machine guns

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.880 
already one of the best machine guns
around<00:03:52.280> especially<00:03:53.120> for<00:03:53.510> PvP<00:03:53.930> it<00:03:54.140> has<00:03:54.620> a<00:03:54.650> high

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
around especially for PvP it has a high

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.160 
around especially for PvP it has a high
crazy<00:03:55.430> impact<00:03:55.940> and<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.299> highest<00:03:56.510> range<00:03:56.989> in

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
crazy impact and the highest range in

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.560 
crazy impact and the highest range in
class<00:03:57.440> on<00:03:57.769> top<00:03:58.310> of<00:03:58.489> that<00:03:58.610> the<00:03:58.850> low<00:03:59.000> stability

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.840 
class on top of that the low stability
is<00:03:59.690> very<00:03:59.959> manageable<00:04:00.470> because<00:04:01.220> of<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.670> low

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
is very manageable because of the low

is very manageable because of the low
rate<00:04:02.299> of<00:04:02.450> fire<00:04:02.750> it<00:04:03.019> feels<00:04:03.590> very<00:04:03.920> steady<00:04:04.310> when

rate of fire it feels very steady when
shooting<00:04:04.730> it's<00:04:05.450> like<00:04:05.630> the<00:04:05.780> series<00:04:06.230> of<00:04:06.530> machine

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860

guns<00:04:06.890> the<00:04:07.519> high<00:04:07.700> impact<00:04:08.150> more<00:04:08.450> than

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
guns the high impact more than

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.660 
guns the high impact more than
compensates<00:04:09.140> for<00:04:09.230> the<00:04:09.380> low<00:04:09.590> fire<00:04:09.890> rate<00:04:09.920> you

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
compensates for the low fire rate you

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.000 
compensates for the low fire rate you
can<00:04:10.820> drop<00:04:11.030> opponents<00:04:11.570> very<00:04:11.900> quickly<00:04:12.260> you<00:04:12.890> can

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
can drop opponents very quickly you can

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.530 
can drop opponents very quickly you can
see<00:04:13.250> here<00:04:13.459> that<00:04:13.489> even<00:04:13.730> the<00:04:13.970> mighty<00:04:14.239> blade

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
see here that even the mighty blade

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.210 
see here that even the mighty blade
dancer<00:04:14.930> will<00:04:15.170> fall<00:04:15.470> to<00:04:15.650> the<00:04:15.739> power<00:04:15.950> of<00:04:16.100> this

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
dancer will fall to the power of this

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.580 
dancer will fall to the power of this
gun<00:04:16.459> it<00:04:17.090> can<00:04:17.269> be<00:04:17.390> compared<00:04:17.840> closely<00:04:18.350> to<00:04:18.470> the

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
gun it can be compared closely to the

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.409 
gun it can be compared closely to the
jeweler's<00:04:18.950> hammer<00:04:19.220> but<00:04:19.790> I<00:04:19.820> think<00:04:20.090> the<00:04:20.209> best

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
jeweler's hammer but I think the best

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.210 
jeweler's hammer but I think the best
part<00:04:20.720> of<00:04:20.870> against<00:04:21.140> all<00:04:21.260> odds<00:04:21.470> is<00:04:21.680> that<00:04:22.100> it's

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
part of against all odds is that it's

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.460 
part of against all odds is that it's
much<00:04:22.490> easier<00:04:22.669> to<00:04:23.150> obtain<00:04:23.300> you<00:04:24.140> can<00:04:24.260> simply

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
much easier to obtain you can simply

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.529 
much easier to obtain you can simply
purchase<00:04:24.800> from<00:04:25.070> the<00:04:25.190> crucible<00:04:25.790> quartermaster

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
purchase from the crucible quartermaster

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:28.450 
purchase from the crucible quartermaster
and<00:04:26.720> you<00:04:27.050> don't<00:04:27.229> need<00:04:27.380> to<00:04:27.530> slave<00:04:27.800> away<00:04:27.979> in<00:04:28.160> the

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
and you don't need to slave away in the

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.370 
and you don't need to slave away in the
iron<00:04:28.610> banner<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.660> only<00:04:29.900> downside<00:04:30.110> is

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
iron banner the only downside is

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.020 
iron banner the only downside is
extremely<00:04:31.190> slow

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
extremely slow

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.030 
extremely slow
load<00:04:32.180> time<00:04:32.450> I<00:04:32.690> put<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.050> timer<00:04:33.350> to<00:04:33.470> it<00:04:33.800> and<00:04:33.950> it

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
load time I put the timer to it and it

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.310 
load time I put the timer to it and it
takes<00:04:34.220> roughly<00:04:34.490> five<00:04:35.060> seconds<00:04:35.690> to<00:04:35.840> reload<00:04:36.110> the

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.110 
takes roughly five seconds to reload the
gun<00:04:36.500> this<00:04:36.980> means<00:04:37.220> the<00:04:37.310> area<00:04:37.640> will<00:04:37.790> have<00:04:37.910> to<00:04:38.030> be

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
gun this means the area will have to be

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.150

fairly<00:04:38.420> clear<00:04:38.840> in<00:04:39.050> order<00:04:39.380> for<00:04:39.560> you<00:04:39.620> to<00:04:39.650> attempt

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
to reload but it shouldn't be too bad if

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.620 
to reload but it shouldn't be too bad if
