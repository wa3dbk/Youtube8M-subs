for<00:00:44.910> baking<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.780> gives<00:00:46.050> me<00:00:46.200> more<00:00:46.230> aviation<00:00:47.100> is

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
for baking it gives me more aviation is

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:57.080 
for baking it gives me more aviation is
going<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.489> blend<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:47.940> easily

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090

as you can see my sugar has really
nicely<00:01:00.090> blended<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.530> that's<00:01:01.740> the<00:01:01.860> reason<00:01:02.190> I

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
nicely blended it so that's the reason I

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.220
