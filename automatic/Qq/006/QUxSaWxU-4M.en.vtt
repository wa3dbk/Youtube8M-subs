00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
hand and I just blow out like kind of

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.810 
hand and I just blow out like kind of
making<00:01:48.990> bubbles<00:01:49.530> with<00:01:49.890> my<00:01:50.040> nose<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.700> just

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
making bubbles with my nose so I just

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.880 
making bubbles with my nose so I just
sounds<00:01:51.450> like<00:01:52.310> yeah<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:54.200> that<00:01:55.200> really<00:01:55.380> helps

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
sounds like yeah and that really helps

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.609 
sounds like yeah and that really helps
also<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.880> guess<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.299> gets<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.840> little<00:01:58.200> soap<00:01:58.439> in

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
also I guess it gets that little soap in

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.870 
also I guess it gets that little soap in
there<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:58.950> because<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.310> soap<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.729> it

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
there and because the soap is it

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.359 
there and because the soap is it
unscented<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:00.930> everything<00:02:01.409> it's<00:02:02.100> not<00:02:02.189> going

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
unscented and everything it's not going

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.870 
unscented and everything it's not going
