00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.260
 well guys here we go are my adventures 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.370
 with Marc and Sara 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.860
 guys how can you see we're like 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.830
 we will be able to go that is the new map of 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.500
 zombies of good rather as he said of 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.900
 zombies from the revenge pack or 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.779
 revenge that I imagine those of xbox already 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.149
 will be up to beat the game this 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.130
 model where but not play 3 then 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:32.750
 soon they will play it so do not wait 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.510
 Boys 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.810
 but as you will notice we are super novices in 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.670
 zombies, that's right, we're very novice 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.870
 in this game so that's why it was 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.239
 I came up with the name zombie 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.130
 adventures since with this mind I do not know 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.070
 how are you going to let us wait for us to go 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.350
 very well that we can get to that 10 11 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.660
 I do not know how many rounds but that's why it was 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.120
 that I said are adventures because they're going to 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.580
 be clearer an adventure do not you think if 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.230
 it's a challenge because to achieve so 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.660
 Unless we do not kill chairs and it is 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.269
 a great challenge for me and for both 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.070
 in fact 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:12.630
 now you gave me 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:16.620
 and you are like a I think that character 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.630
 it is common is that they are yes no if I am not 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.340
 wrong unless unless other 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.810
 guys pressure I'm wrong there 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.810
 four characters in zombies 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.340
 is the one that you have that is a like 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.340
 I'm old, I'm black, that's black 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.600
 yes without the other 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.600
 is the girl and been 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.689
 as I said at the beginning we are in buried 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.580
 and but if you would like it because 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.049
 let's say this series this is going to be about 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.490
 zombies because they were not asking 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.280
 both in the comment like 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.539
 we made this that we were zombies sorry 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.659
 of black ops we all said that we were going to 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:59.670
 play zombies from other games that do not 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.899
 sean kolo tourÃ© but in this case then 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.970
 let's make a small series of 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.590
 zombies because they were asking like this 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.820
 that we are in burger but if it happens 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.860
 another map just leave it in the 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.440
 comment and vote comments 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.209
 also to guide us and others and so 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:17.330
 know if they want us to play better with 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.330
 that gives you transit and I think there are others 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.540
 and we have for the magic box 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.019
 please please magical weapon to 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:31.019
 unknown magic 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.840
 or not 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.940
 I do not know what it is but it looks super father 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:50.720
 but it looks great without finishing 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.610
 Well, if it appears to you, it did not touch others 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.260
 this thing 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:03:02.730
 this person that I said I'm going to do 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:04.350
 with this but for reasons not to be 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.560
 I'm done because it 's so amazing 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.720
 friends the talents the talents thousand 033 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.210
 that dies the breath 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.350
 Hello 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.630
 concluded is more window 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.790
 today I would be talking about the comment 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.280
 current that we did, I have to say how 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.840
 he was surprised with the square rabbit and 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.569
 all because you see that we had talked 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.749
 that he does not know how 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.249
 we saw we were like that super 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:33.569
 happy with after that we did 

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:36.599
 because we had not noticed how well 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.670
 we get along and so forth but suddenly it 's 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:44.040
 that if we walk that if we give clouds 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:46.139
 etcetera and then the truth seems very 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.849
 curious because they do not give him more was in a 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:50.340
 video but use videos 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:54.780
 absolutely agent was yes all like this 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:57.090
 like that uaw super weird is also that 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.519
 we want to transmit something else and I do not know 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.810
 terms transmitting something else 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.810
 totally different 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.209
 i 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.180
 also also 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:26.470
 sometimes as high or that thing 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:30.490
 give you more I love something of that I hope not 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:37.000
 I want to leave in fact that I know the color 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:38.770
 white because he has explained that yes 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.360
 it means that the zombies are going to come 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.400
 for me first the place to hunt 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.960
 police power before and exactly they are 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.610
 here ordered by colors you are the 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.920
 white let's say that white has more 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:52.560
 sport sicuani hierarchy 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.560
 so that under the structure 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.820
 liberating the giant 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.800
 the fox 2 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:10.970
 and where is 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:19.430
 and while I give him this type of drink 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.430
 but I do not look 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:23.009
 two 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.660

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.230
