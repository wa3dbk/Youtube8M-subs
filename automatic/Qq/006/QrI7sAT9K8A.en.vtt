00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
the film was made after they decided

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.770 
the film was made after they decided
that<00:02:09.910> they<00:02:10.720> wanted<00:02:11.319> a<00:02:11.410> more<00:02:11.620> upbeat<00:02:12.270> story<00:02:13.270> and

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
that they wanted a more upbeat story and

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:20.009 
that they wanted a more upbeat story and
more<00:02:14.530> action<00:02:15.040> less<00:02:15.069> less<00:02:15.970> drama<00:02:16.769> so<00:02:17.769> it<00:02:18.160> in<00:02:19.120> my

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
more action less less drama so it in my

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.410 
more action less less drama so it in my
estimation<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:20.739> was<00:02:20.890> less<00:02:21.340> strong<00:02:22.030> less

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
estimation it was less strong less

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.020 
estimation it was less strong less
powerful<00:02:22.750> but<00:02:23.620> from<00:02:23.980> I<00:02:24.310> supposed<00:02:24.880> to<00:02:25.000> a

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
powerful but from I supposed to a

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.610 
powerful but from I supposed to a
merchandising<00:02:25.600> point<00:02:25.930> of<00:02:26.019> view<00:02:26.170> it<00:02:26.260> was<00:02:26.410> more

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
merchandising point of view it was more

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.030 
merchandising point of view it was more
effective<00:02:27.130> at<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.090> way<00:02:28.420> it<00:02:28.540> was<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:29.890> your

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
effective at the way it was so your

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:37.470 
effective at the way it was so your
producer<00:02:30.510> tells<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.959> other<00:02:32.110> one<00:02:32.620> yes

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.940 

micro<00:02:38.480> watching<00:02:38.780> as<00:02:38.870> a<00:02:38.900> kid

micro watching as a kid

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.059 
micro watching as a kid
so

in didn't really want to push those
films<00:03:11.439> very<00:03:11.650> much<00:03:11.859> because<00:03:12.099> they<00:03:12.189> have<00:03:12.310> their

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
films very much because they have their

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.099 
films very much because they have their
own<00:03:12.489> agenda<00:03:13.060> they<00:03:13.150> had<00:03:13.269> their<00:03:13.450> own<00:03:13.480> films<00:03:13.930> they

own agenda they had their own films they
wanted<00:03:14.379> to<00:03:14.499> do<00:03:14.650> so<00:03:15.370> it<00:03:15.519> got<00:03:15.669> lost<00:03:15.879> in<00:03:16.209> that

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
wanted to do so it got lost in that

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.140 
wanted to do so it got lost in that
vortex<00:03:16.719> there<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:17.530> it<00:03:17.680> it<00:03:18.129> did<00:03:18.340> not<00:03:18.549> do<00:03:18.819> very

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
vortex there and it it did not do very

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.659 
vortex there and it it did not do very
well<00:03:19.599> theatrically<00:03:20.230> they<00:03:21.010> didn't<00:03:21.280> put<00:03:21.430> very

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:21.669 
well theatrically they didn't put very

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:25.530 
well theatrically they didn't put very
much<00:03:21.879> marketing<00:03:22.689> money<00:03:22.840> behind<00:03:23.079> it<00:03:23.430> but<00:03:24.540> then

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
much marketing money behind it but then

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.849 
much marketing money behind it but then
later<00:03:25.780> on<00:03:25.930> in<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:27.730> video<00:03:28.269> and<00:03:28.419> DVD<00:03:28.620> it<00:03:29.620> did<00:03:29.829> very

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
later on in a video and DVD it did very

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.740 
later on in a video and DVD it did very
well<00:03:30.159> and<00:03:30.519> they<00:03:30.730> released<00:03:30.969> it<00:03:31.209> the<00:03:31.359> absolutely

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
well and they released it the absolutely

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.589 
well and they released it the absolutely
a<00:03:31.840> couple<00:03:32.109> of<00:03:32.199> times<00:03:32.379> and<00:03:32.939> so<00:03:33.939> it's<00:03:34.239> just<00:03:34.389> one

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
a couple of times and so it's just one

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.929 
a couple of times and so it's just one
of<00:03:34.629> those<00:03:34.719> it<00:03:35.139> did<00:03:35.530> eventually<00:03:35.769> do<00:03:36.159> fine<00:03:36.459> but

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:36.939 
of those it did eventually do fine but

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:41.399 
of those it did eventually do fine but
nowhere<00:03:37.900> near<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:39.430> numbers<00:03:39.879> that<00:03:40.199> that<00:03:41.199> you

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:41.409 
nowhere near the numbers that that you

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:43.470 
nowhere near the numbers that that you
would<00:03:41.590> expect<00:03:41.709> for<00:03:42.219> a<00:03:42.549> large<00:03:42.969> picture<00:03:43.329> at<00:03:43.419> that

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
would expect for a large picture at that

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.509 
would expect for a large picture at that
time<00:03:43.810> this<00:03:44.620> was<00:03:44.859> a<00:03:44.889> lot<00:03:45.069> of<00:03:45.129> those<00:03:45.310> to

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
time this was a lot of those to

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:46.940 
time this was a lot of those to
eventually<00:03:45.909> find

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
eventually find

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.369 
eventually find
the<00:03:47.910> ancillary<00:03:48.420> market<00:03:48.780> is<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:48.930> big<00:03:49.170> help

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
the ancillary market is a big help

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.110 
the ancillary market is a big help
because<00:03:49.500> they're<00:03:50.160> there<00:03:50.610> are<00:03:50.760> quite<00:03:50.970> a<00:03:51.030> few

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
because they're there are quite a few

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.350 
because they're there are quite a few
films<00:03:51.690> that<00:03:51.959> do<00:03:52.400> good<00:03:53.400> box<00:03:53.640> office<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.239> then

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
films that do good box office and then

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.660 
films that do good box office and then
don't<00:03:54.660> do<00:03:54.840> well<00:03:55.050> in<00:03:55.349> the<00:03:55.590> answering<00:03:56.129> markets

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
don't do well in the answering markets

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.009 
don't do well in the answering markets
and<00:03:56.910> there<00:03:57.239> are<00:03:57.300> others<00:03:57.480> that<00:03:57.510> are<00:03:57.750> just<00:03:57.959> the

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
and there are others that are just the

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.140 
and there are others that are just the
reverse<00:03:58.170> that<00:03:58.680> they<00:03:59.160> don't<00:03:59.430> open<00:03:59.730> very<00:03:59.940> well

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
reverse that they don't open very well

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.900 
reverse that they don't open very well
at<00:04:00.239> all<00:04:00.420> and<00:04:00.720> although<00:04:01.680> their<00:04:02.129> income<00:04:02.550> comes

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
at all and although their income comes

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.820 
at all and although their income comes
from<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.300> ancillary<00:04:03.780> markets<00:04:03.930> but<00:04:04.709> they

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
from the ancillary markets but they

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.080 
from the ancillary markets but they
still<00:04:05.069> do<00:04:05.250> fine<00:04:06.050> I<00:04:07.050> think<00:04:07.560> a<00:04:07.590> film<00:04:07.800> that<00:04:07.860> was

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
still do fine I think a film that was

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:17.780 
still do fine I think a film that was
was<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.269> doctors<00:04:10.170> for<00:04:10.410> its<00:04:11.130> much<00:04:11.370> love

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.590 

that<00:04:18.790> was<00:04:18.880> probably<00:04:19.030> one<00:04:19.329> of<00:04:19.359> the<00:04:19.480> most

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
that was probably one of the most

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.840 
that was probably one of the most
difficult<00:04:20.019> films<00:04:20.680> that<00:04:20.829> ever<00:04:21.130> worked<00:04:21.459> on<00:04:21.639> ever

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
difficult films that ever worked on ever

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.409 
difficult films that ever worked on ever
produced<00:04:22.270> because<00:04:23.520> using<00:04:24.520> animatronics

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
produced because using animatronics

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.600 
produced because using animatronics
there<00:04:25.660> was<00:04:25.840> everything<00:04:26.169> was<00:04:26.530> live<00:04:26.800> on<00:04:27.160> the<00:04:27.370> set

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
there was everything was live on the set

there was everything was live on the set
there<00:04:28.000> was<00:04:28.180> no<00:04:28.620> there<00:04:29.620> was<00:04:29.710> no<00:04:29.889> CGI<00:04:30.400> work<00:04:30.760> then

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
there was no there was no CGI work then

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.080 
there was no there was no CGI work then
and<00:04:32.020> the<00:04:32.380> only<00:04:32.530> visual<00:04:33.250> effects<00:04:33.550> that<00:04:33.790> we<00:04:33.910> had

and the only visual effects that we had

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.020 
and the only visual effects that we had
an<00:04:34.419> optical<00:04:35.200> effects<00:04:35.620> were<00:04:35.860> a<00:04:36.130> few<00:04:36.850> matte

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
an optical effects were a few matte

puppeteers<00:04:48.340> working<00:04:48.910> at<00:04:49.570> the<00:04:49.750> same<00:04:49.930> time<00:04:50.200> so

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
puppeteers working at the same time so

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.730 
puppeteers working at the same time so
to<00:04:50.620> coordinate<00:04:51.190> all<00:04:51.340> that<00:04:51.639> was<00:04:52.530> really<00:04:53.530> time

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
to coordinate all that was really time

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.770 
to coordinate all that was really time
consuming<00:04:53.770> so<00:04:54.520> we<00:04:54.970> would<00:04:55.120> get<00:04:55.270> very<00:04:55.330> little

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
consuming so we would get very little

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.080 
consuming so we would get very little
done<00:04:56.110> during<00:04:56.410> certain<00:04:56.770> days<00:04:57.040> could<00:04:57.760> spend<00:04:57.970> an

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
done during certain days could spend an

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.090 
done during certain days could spend an
entire<00:04:58.240> day<00:04:58.450> rehearsing<00:04:58.810> and<00:04:59.320> not<00:04:59.889> shoot

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
entire day rehearsing and not shoot

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.760 
entire day rehearsing and not shoot
anything<00:05:00.430> so<00:05:01.000> it<00:05:01.570> was<00:05:01.690> a<00:05:01.720> long<00:05:01.990> schedule<00:05:02.500> on

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
anything so it was a long schedule on

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.240 
anything so it was a long schedule on
that<00:05:03.010> I<00:05:03.820> seriously<00:05:04.240> doubt<00:05:04.660> if<00:05:04.840> anyone<00:05:05.250> tries

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
that I seriously doubt if anyone tries

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.530 
that I seriously doubt if anyone tries
to<00:05:06.430> make<00:05:06.550> a<00:05:06.580> film<00:05:06.820> like<00:05:06.940> that<00:05:07.240> anymore

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
to make a film like that anymore

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.950 
to make a film like that anymore
partially<00:05:08.200> because<00:05:08.729> we<00:05:09.729> have<00:05:09.880> CGI<00:05:10.270> now<00:05:10.540> and<00:05:10.780> so

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
partially because we have CGI now and so

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.129 
partially because we have CGI now and so
easy<00:05:11.139> to<00:05:11.350> use<00:05:11.760> but<00:05:12.760> also<00:05:13.450> because<00:05:14.940> the

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
easy to use but also because the

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.900 
easy to use but also because the
technical<00:05:17.139> people<00:05:17.530> who<00:05:17.919> do<00:05:18.100> animatronics

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
technical people who do animatronics

small<00:05:52.010> more<00:05:52.760> intimate<00:05:53.150> films<00:05:53.650> similar<00:05:54.650> to

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
small more intimate films similar to

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.230 
small more intimate films similar to
what<00:05:54.980> we<00:05:55.130> did<00:05:55.160> with<00:05:55.310> American<00:05:55.820> Graffiti<00:05:55.910> I

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
what we did with American Graffiti I

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.240 
what we did with American Graffiti I
think<00:05:56.600> that<00:05:56.720> would<00:05:56.810> be<00:05:57.020> that<00:05:57.350> would<00:05:57.410> be<00:05:57.680> good

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
think that would be that would be good

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.330 
think that would be that would be good
for<00:05:58.490> him<00:05:58.550> if<00:05:58.940> he<00:05:59.060> did<00:05:59.240> that<00:05:59.270> and<00:05:59.630> I<00:05:59.990> think<00:06:00.590> he

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340 
for him if he did that and I think he

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.940 
for him if he did that and I think he
probably<00:06:01.370> feels<00:06:02.150> a<00:06:02.390> bit<00:06:02.510> trapped<00:06:02.900> by<00:06:03.380> the<00:06:03.440> Star

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:03.950 
probably feels a bit trapped by the Star

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.790 
probably feels a bit trapped by the Star
Wars<00:06:04.190> phenomena<00:06:04.850> and<00:06:05.270> having<00:06:06.200> to<00:06:06.350> spend<00:06:06.620> so

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
Wars phenomena and having to spend so

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.200 
Wars phenomena and having to spend so
much<00:06:06.950> time<00:06:07.010> with<00:06:07.490> it<00:06:07.640> yeah<00:06:08.470> and<00:06:09.850> so<00:06:10.850> I<00:06:10.880> think<00:06:11.000> it

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
much time with it yeah and so I think it

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.760 
much time with it yeah and so I think it
is<00:06:11.240> good<00:06:11.600> that<00:06:11.630> he's<00:06:11.930> talking<00:06:12.380> now<00:06:12.740> about

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
is good that he's talking now about

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.410 
is good that he's talking now about
retiring<00:06:13.490> handing<00:06:14.420> over<00:06:14.510> the<00:06:14.840> Star<00:06:15.440> Wars

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:16.420 
retiring handing over the Star Wars

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.310 
retiring handing over the Star Wars
merchandising<00:06:17.420> business<00:06:17.720> really<00:06:17.930> to

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:18.320 
merchandising business really to

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.010 
merchandising business really to
somebody<00:06:18.680> else<00:06:18.860> and<00:06:19.180> go<00:06:20.180> back<00:06:20.360> to<00:06:20.570> doing<00:06:20.720> in

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
somebody else and go back to doing in

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.750 
somebody else and go back to doing in
smaller<00:06:21.290> films<00:06:21.560> I<00:06:21.860> think<00:06:22.070> he<00:06:22.130> that's<00:06:22.490> what<00:06:22.640> he

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:22.760 
smaller films I think he that's what he

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.190 
smaller films I think he that's what he
really<00:06:22.970> liked<00:06:23.270> doing<00:06:23.600> in<00:06:23.810> the<00:06:23.870> first<00:06:24.020> place
