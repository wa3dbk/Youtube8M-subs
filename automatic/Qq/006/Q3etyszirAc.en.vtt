left drop step open to the left is going

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:53.309 
left drop step open to the left is going
to<00:02:43.000> be<00:02:43.060> a<00:02:43.090> little<00:02:43.269> faster<00:02:44.160> drop<00:02:45.160> step<00:02:51.060> as<00:02:52.319> you

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
to be a little faster drop step as you

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.750 
to be a little faster drop step as you
brake<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:53.769> don't<00:02:53.950> want<00:02:54.069> to<00:02:54.130> take<00:02:54.310> too<00:02:54.579> many

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
brake you don't want to take too many

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.460 
brake you don't want to take too many
steps<00:02:55.829> because<00:02:56.829> if<00:02:57.040> you<00:02:57.100> take<00:02:57.250> too<00:02:57.489> many<00:02:57.609> steps

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
steps because if you take too many steps

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.559 
steps because if you take too many steps
then<00:02:59.470> the<00:03:00.430> chance<00:03:00.670> of<00:03:00.790> you<00:03:00.910> making<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.239> play<00:03:01.389> on

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
then the chance of you making a play on

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.500 
then the chance of you making a play on
that<00:03:01.720> receiver<00:03:02.049> are<00:03:02.620> slim<00:03:02.950> to<00:03:02.980> none<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:04.450> you

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
that receiver are slim to none so you

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.599 
that receiver are slim to none so you
want<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:04.810> make<00:03:04.959> sure<00:03:05.280> you're<00:03:06.280> getting<00:03:06.459> your

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
want to make sure you're getting your

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.370 
want to make sure you're getting your
foot<00:03:06.910> in<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.090> ground<00:03:07.269> you're<00:03:07.870> planting<00:03:08.290> as

foot in the ground you're planting as

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.349 
foot in the ground you're planting as
hard<00:03:08.590> as<00:03:08.680> you<00:03:08.769> can<00:03:08.980> and<00:03:09.310> drive<00:03:09.910> them<00:03:10.060> back<00:03:10.209> in

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
hard as you can and drive them back in

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.599 
hard as you can and drive them back in
the<00:03:10.450> opposite<00:03:10.750> direction<00:03:11.160> as<00:03:12.160> fast<00:03:12.430> as

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
the opposite direction as fast as

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:17.250 
the opposite direction as fast as
possible<00:03:13.260> so<00:03:14.260> part<00:03:14.500> of<00:03:14.560> that<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:15.600> critical<00:03:16.600> to

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
possible so part of that and critical to

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.780 
possible so part of that and critical to
doing<00:03:17.500> that<00:03:17.620> being<00:03:17.859> successful<00:03:17.950> with<00:03:18.400> that<00:03:18.430> is

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
doing that being successful with that is

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.509 
doing that being successful with that is
staying<00:03:19.540> low<00:03:19.840> all<00:03:20.769> your<00:03:21.010> power<00:03:21.250> is<00:03:21.340> going<00:03:21.430> to

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
staying low all your power is going to

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.660 
staying low all your power is going to
come<00:03:21.670> from<00:03:21.790> your<00:03:21.940> hips<00:03:22.180> your<00:03:22.450> claws<00:03:22.769> and<00:03:23.769> your

cast down so as you're turning in your
running<00:03:27.690> you<00:03:28.690> get<00:03:28.900> that<00:03:29.109> position<00:03:29.670> you<00:03:30.670> stay

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
running you get that position you stay

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:31.520
