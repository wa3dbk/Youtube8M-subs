00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
handrails that go around the corners

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.580 
handrails that go around the corners
here<00:02:29.560> are<00:02:29.769> quite<00:02:30.100> a<00:02:30.160> challenge<00:02:31.320> when<00:02:32.320> you<00:02:32.440> get

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
here are quite a challenge when you get

here are quite a challenge when you get
that<00:02:32.769> far

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.850 

this<00:02:37.500> ladder<00:02:37.769> up<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.190> side<00:02:38.459> and<00:02:39.379> the<00:02:40.379> air<00:02:40.560> pipe

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
this ladder up the side and the air pipe

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
doorway is also quite a challenge to get

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:46.970 
doorway is also quite a challenge to get
everything<00:02:45.900> back<00:02:46.260> together<00:02:46.440> once<00:02:46.830> you've

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
painted a locomotive you have to remove

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.100 
painted a locomotive you have to remove
that<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:49.200> don't<00:02:49.379> glue<00:02:49.560> it<00:02:49.680> in<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:51.480> get<00:02:51.599> the<00:02:51.720> cab

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
that so don't glue it in to get the cab

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.770 
that so don't glue it in to get the cab
back<00:02:52.379> on<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:52.980> getting<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.790> cab<00:02:54.000> back<00:02:54.269> on<00:02:54.540> and

back on and getting the cab back on and

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.809 
back on and getting the cab back on and
this<00:02:55.170> is<00:02:55.590> a<00:02:55.650> whole<00:02:55.890> different<00:02:55.920> ballgame<00:02:56.400> I

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
this is a whole different ballgame I

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.520 
this is a whole different ballgame I
don't<00:02:57.480> know<00:02:57.569> if<00:02:57.659> it'll<00:02:57.810> show<00:02:57.989> up<00:02:58.110> in<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.379> video

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
don't know if it'll show up in the video

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.160 
don't know if it'll show up in the video
but<00:02:59.040> uh<00:02:59.099> of<00:02:59.879> course<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.360> inside<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.930> cab

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
but uh of course the inside of the cab

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.940 
but uh of course the inside of the cab
is<00:03:01.909> painted<00:03:02.909> kind<00:03:03.150> of<00:03:03.299> a<00:03:03.480> zinc<00:03:04.170> chromate<00:03:04.620> green

which is kind of a color that they used

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.819 
which is kind of a color that they used
to<00:03:06.959> use<00:03:07.140> in<00:03:07.409> those<00:03:07.560> days<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:09.690> locomotive<00:03:10.680> is<00:03:10.799> a

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
to use in those days the locomotive is a

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.119 
to use in those days the locomotive is a
is<00:03:11.220> an<00:03:11.400> extremely<00:03:11.819> simple<00:03:12.180> paint<00:03:12.780> job<00:03:13.129> and

is an extremely simple paint job and

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:15.890 
is an extremely simple paint job and
just<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.609> detailing<00:03:15.030> really<00:03:15.480> needs<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:15.780> be

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
just the detailing really needs to be

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.199 
just the detailing really needs to be
done<00:03:16.310> like<00:03:17.310> I<00:03:17.430> said<00:03:17.640> though<00:03:17.790> there<00:03:17.940> is<00:03:18.060> an

awful lot of parts to be removed one of
the<00:03:21.030> things<00:03:21.269> that<00:03:21.420> I<00:03:21.480> might<00:03:21.690> say<00:03:21.900> about<00:03:21.930> doing

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
the things that I might say about doing

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:28.009 
the things that I might say about doing
this<00:03:23.099> locomotive<00:03:23.459> is<00:03:23.940> that<00:03:25.310> Atlas<00:03:26.540> does<00:03:27.540> kind

turns out it pops right off it does it's

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.900 
turns out it pops right off it does it's
it's<00:04:01.049> a<00:04:01.230> like<00:04:01.680> an<00:04:01.799> Elmer's<00:04:02.129> glue<00:04:02.579> or<00:04:02.639> something

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
it's a like an Elmer's glue or something

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.580 
it's a like an Elmer's glue or something
that<00:04:03.120> doesn't<00:04:03.269> stick<00:04:03.629> real<00:04:03.870> well<00:04:04.109> to<00:04:04.440> the

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
that doesn't stick real well to the

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.319 
that doesn't stick real well to the
plastic<00:04:05.069> which<00:04:05.250> is<00:04:05.280> a<00:04:05.430> good<00:04:05.639> thing<00:04:05.669> because<00:04:06.060> it

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
plastic which is a good thing because it

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:07.729 
plastic which is a good thing because it
allows<00:04:06.510> you<00:04:06.660> to<00:04:06.750> disassemble<00:04:07.379> it<00:04:07.440> and<00:04:07.470> paint

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
allows you to disassemble it and paint

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.300 
allows you to disassemble it and paint
it<00:04:08.000> but<00:04:09.000> as<00:04:09.690> far<00:04:10.019> as<00:04:10.049> running<00:04:10.410> characteristics

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
it but as far as running characteristics

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.009 
it but as far as running characteristics
there's<00:04:11.489> no<00:04:11.669> change<00:04:12.060> of<00:04:12.269> course<00:04:12.510> from<00:04:12.840> what

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
there's no change of course from what

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.110 
there's no change of course from what
you've<00:04:13.199> seen<00:04:13.379> in<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:13.620> first<00:04:13.769> video<00:04:14.220> but<00:04:14.519> this

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
you've seen in the first video but this

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.150 
you've seen in the first video but this
is<00:04:15.329> just<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:15.660> finished<00:04:15.959> product<00:04:16.380> and<00:04:16.590> overall
