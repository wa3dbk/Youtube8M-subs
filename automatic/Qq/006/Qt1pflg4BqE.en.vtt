00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
and it looked a little weird so I just

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.080 
and it looked a little weird so I just
wasn't<00:00:43.530> interested<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.370> then<00:00:44.670> my<00:00:44.820> friend

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
wasn't interested and then my friend

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.690 
wasn't interested and then my friend
told<00:00:45.270> me<00:00:45.360> how<00:00:45.510> much<00:00:45.570> she<00:00:45.719> liked<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.200> books<00:00:46.700> so

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
told me how much she liked the books so

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.670 
told me how much she liked the books so
I<00:00:47.730> went<00:00:47.940> ahead<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.450> bought<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:49.110> set<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.500> them

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
I went ahead and bought the set of them

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.520 
I went ahead and bought the set of them
and<00:00:49.969> I<00:00:51.230> really<00:00:52.230> am<00:00:52.320> glad<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.590> did<00:00:52.969> they<00:00:53.969> are

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
and I really am glad I did they are

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.459 
and I really am glad I did they are
about<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.219> future<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:57.050> basically<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
about the future and basically the

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.619 
about the future and basically the
future<00:00:58.829> seems<00:00:59.789> pretty<00:01:00.059> horrible<00:01:00.920> in<00:01:01.920> America

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
future seems pretty horrible in America

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:09.080 
future seems pretty horrible in America
basically<00:01:04.970> we've<00:01:05.970> been<00:01:06.210> confined<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:07.310> I<00:01:08.310> think

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
basically we've been confined to I think

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.320 
basically we've been confined to I think
basically<00:01:09.869> 13<00:01:10.619> states<00:01:11.010> there<00:01:11.700> are<00:01:11.729> 12

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
basically 13 states there are 12

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.240 
basically 13 states there are 12
districts<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.080> one<00:01:13.290> capital<00:01:13.860> which<00:01:14.070> I'm

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
districts and one capital which I'm

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.429 
districts and one capital which I'm
guessing<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.700> basically<00:01:15.540> another<00:01:15.750> state<00:01:16.200> and

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
guessing is basically another state and

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.260 
guessing is basically another state and
you're<00:01:16.920> constricted<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.670> your<00:01:17.790> state<00:01:18.090> you

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
you're constricted to your state you

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.590 
you're constricted to your state you
can't<00:01:18.540> really<00:01:18.780> leave<00:01:19.340> unless<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:21.150> are<00:01:21.240> asked

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
can't really leave unless you are asked

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.429 
can't really leave unless you are asked
to<00:01:21.630> leave<00:01:22.189> and<00:01:23.570> punishments<00:01:24.570> are<00:01:24.750> severe<00:01:25.320> and

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
to leave and punishments are severe and

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.490 
to leave and punishments are severe and
each<00:01:26.159> state<00:01:26.490> has<00:01:26.939> like<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.330> different<00:01:28.170> focal

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
each state has like a different focal

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.310 
each state has like a different focal
point<00:01:28.740> once<00:01:28.950> one<00:01:29.729> state<00:01:30.000> they<00:01:30.689> do<00:01:30.750> all<00:01:31.140> the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
point once one state they do all the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.490 
point once one state they do all the
coal<00:01:31.500> mining<00:01:31.770> one<00:01:32.159> state<00:01:32.520> they<00:01:33.140> is<00:01:34.140> an

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
coal mining one state they is an

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.560 
coal mining one state they is an
agricultural<00:01:35.220> state<00:01:35.340> I'm<00:01:35.729> just<00:01:36.420> different

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
agricultural state I'm just different

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.800 
agricultural state I'm just different
states<00:01:36.990> have<00:01:37.079> different<00:01:37.229> purposes<00:01:37.950> and

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
states have different purposes and

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.190 
states have different purposes and
basically<00:01:40.490> it's<00:01:41.490> not<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.759> future<00:01:42.240> like<00:01:42.479> with<00:01:42.869> I

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
basically it's not a future like with I

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.530 
basically it's not a future like with I
guess<00:01:43.619> there<00:01:43.950> are<00:01:44.070> still<00:01:44.490> hovercraft<00:01:45.240> things

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
guess there are still hovercraft things

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.749 
guess there are still hovercraft things
like<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.020> would<00:01:46.170> expect<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.799> future<00:01:46.829> but

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
like you would expect in the future but

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.190 
like you would expect in the future but
it<00:01:47.880> seems<00:01:48.149> like<00:01:48.450> as<00:01:48.600> almost<00:01:48.840> we<00:01:49.020> went

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
it seems like as almost we went

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.520 
it seems like as almost we went
backwards<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.920> time<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:51.020> one<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.259> things

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
backwards in time and one of the things

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.520 
backwards in time and one of the things
that<00:01:52.680> they<00:01:52.979> do<00:01:53.040> each<00:01:53.670> year<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:55.259> Hunger

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
that they do each year is the Hunger

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.010 
that they do each year is the Hunger
Games<00:01:55.740> which<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.520> an<00:01:57.000> event<00:01:57.420> where<00:01:57.659> they

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
Games which is a an event where they

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.080 
Games which is a an event where they
take<00:01:58.290> two<00:01:58.649> children<00:01:59.219> from<00:01:59.430> each<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.969> the

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
take two children from each of the
