try<00:00:11.600> it<00:00:11.660> out<00:00:11.750> you<00:00:11.900> go<00:00:12.020> first

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.630 

but<00:00:16.630> yeah<00:00:16.870> that<00:00:17.140> was<00:00:17.230> that<00:00:17.560> was<00:00:17.740> not<00:00:17.950> bad<00:00:18.369> I

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
but yeah that was that was not bad I

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.120 
but yeah that was that was not bad I
have<00:00:18.850> DRS<00:00:19.330> CRS<00:00:19.960> look<00:00:20.290> I'm<00:00:20.500> putting<00:00:20.770> my<00:00:20.890> wings

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
have DRS CRS look I'm putting my wings

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.890 
have DRS CRS look I'm putting my wings
up<00:00:21.340> that<00:00:21.760> doesn't<00:00:22.029> look<00:00:22.119> that<00:00:22.150> great<00:00:22.360> check<00:00:22.810> it

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
up that doesn't look that great check it

a button in the cockpit and he can open
this<00:01:05.530> flap<00:01:05.740> which<00:01:06.700> reduces<00:01:07.659> the<00:01:07.840> drag

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
this flap which reduces the drag

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.740 
this flap which reduces the drag
generated<00:01:09.130> by<00:01:09.310> the<00:01:09.369> rear<00:01:09.700> wing<00:01:10.210> on<00:01:10.390> the<00:01:10.540> car

generated by the rear wing on the car
significantly<00:01:11.619> to<00:01:12.159> the<00:01:12.250> point<00:01:12.490> where<00:01:12.760> it

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
significantly to the point where it

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.789 
significantly to the point where it
makes<00:01:13.060> overtaking<00:01:13.869> the<00:01:13.990> car<00:01:14.200> in<00:01:14.320> front<00:01:14.500> an

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
makes overtaking the car in front an

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.890 
makes overtaking the car in front an
awful<00:01:15.340> lot<00:01:15.460> easier<00:01:15.490> the<00:01:16.150> way<00:01:16.270> you<00:01:16.330> use<00:01:16.600> it<00:01:16.630> is

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
awful lot easier the way you use it is

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.139 
awful lot easier the way you use it is
that<00:01:17.080> you<00:01:17.590> get<00:01:17.710> a<00:01:17.770> beep<00:01:18.040> which<00:01:18.579> tells<00:01:18.969> you<00:01:19.119> that

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
that you get a beep which tells you that

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:20.700 
that you get a beep which tells you that
you<00:01:19.359> now<00:01:19.479> you're<00:01:19.719> allowed<00:01:19.930> to<00:01:20.109> activate<00:01:20.560> it

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
you now you're allowed to activate it

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.859 
you now you're allowed to activate it
when<00:01:21.219> you're<00:01:21.369> within<00:01:21.670> one<00:01:21.850> second<00:01:22.270> of<00:01:22.479> the<00:01:22.689> car

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
when you're within one second of the car

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.170 
when you're within one second of the car
in<00:01:22.930> front<00:01:22.990> and<00:01:23.680> so<00:01:23.979> then<00:01:24.130> you<00:01:24.280> wait<00:01:24.490> until<00:01:24.850> you

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
in front and so then you wait until you

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.789 
in front and so then you wait until you
get<00:01:25.299> to<00:01:25.359> the<00:01:25.600> white<00:01:25.810> line<00:01:26.020> when<00:01:26.530> you<00:01:26.590> get<00:01:26.710> to

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
get to the white line when you get to

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.109 
get to the white line when you get to
the<00:01:26.890> white<00:01:27.039> line<00:01:27.219> you<00:01:27.549> can<00:01:27.700> push<00:01:27.880> the<00:01:28.000> button

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
the white line you can push the button

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.419 
the white line you can push the button
that<00:01:28.780> puts<00:01:29.020> down<00:01:29.200> your<00:01:29.380> rear<00:01:29.530> wing<00:01:29.770> and<00:01:30.009> gives

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
that puts down your rear wing and gives

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:31.950 
that puts down your rear wing and gives
you<00:01:30.520> extra<00:01:30.880> top<00:01:31.030> speed<00:01:31.329> to<00:01:31.479> overtake<00:01:31.780> the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
you extra top speed to overtake the

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.109 
you extra top speed to overtake the
person<00:01:32.259> in<00:01:32.350> front<00:01:32.469> the<00:01:33.100> DRS<00:01:33.520> when<00:01:33.789> you<00:01:33.939> engage

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
person in front the DRS when you engage

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.060 
person in front the DRS when you engage
it<00:01:34.420> it's<00:01:34.570> like<00:01:34.719> a<00:01:34.750> boost<00:01:35.049> like<00:01:35.500> pressing

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
it it's like a boost like pressing

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.069 
it it's like a boost like pressing
curves<00:01:36.369> it's<00:01:36.880> the<00:01:37.000> same<00:01:37.240> feeling<00:01:37.659> as<00:01:37.810> curves

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
curves it's the same feeling as curves

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:39.749 
curves it's the same feeling as curves
so<00:01:38.500> when<00:01:38.619> you<00:01:38.710> press<00:01:38.859> curves<00:01:39.250> you<00:01:39.369> get<00:01:39.520> one

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
so when you press curves you get one

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.279 
so when you press curves you get one
boost<00:01:40.000> and<00:01:40.210> then<00:01:40.299> you<00:01:40.359> press<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.600> DRS<00:01:41.049> you<00:01:41.170> get

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
boost and then you press the DRS you get

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.450 
boost and then you press the DRS you get
another<00:01:41.500> one<00:01:41.979> almost<00:01:42.549> exactly<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:42.969> same<00:01:44.460> the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
another one almost exactly the same the

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.520 
another one almost exactly the same the
issue<00:01:45.609> of<00:01:45.969> reducing<00:01:46.119> drag<00:01:46.719> on<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.140> Formula
