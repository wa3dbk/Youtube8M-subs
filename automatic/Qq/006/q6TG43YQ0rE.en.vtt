00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:31.319

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
on their own courts the pace though and

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.790 
on their own courts the pace though and
an<00:01:15.180> obvious<00:01:15.720> trend<00:01:16.020> here<00:01:16.320> when<00:01:16.440> they<00:01:16.560> play<00:01:16.740> in

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
an obvious trend here when they play in

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.740 
an obvious trend here when they play in
Indiana<00:01:17.280> these<00:01:17.460> teams<00:01:17.700> play<00:01:17.880> fast<00:01:18.120> yeah<00:01:18.510> and<00:01:18.690> I

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
Indiana these teams play fast yeah and I

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.600 
Indiana these teams play fast yeah and I
don't<00:01:18.810> know<00:01:19.020> why<00:01:19.170> because<00:01:19.409> Indiana<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.130> a

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
don't know why because Indiana is a

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.730 
don't know why because Indiana is a
defensive<00:01:21.330> minded<00:01:21.659> team<00:01:21.840> especially<00:01:22.229> at<00:01:22.560> home

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
defensive minded team especially at home

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.260 
defensive minded team especially at home
you<00:01:22.920> would<00:01:23.040> think<00:01:23.190> that<00:01:23.310> they<00:01:23.520> slow<00:01:23.940> that<00:01:24.090> pace

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
you would think that they slow that pace

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.520 
you would think that they slow that pace
down<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.780> being<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.020> playoffs<00:01:25.380> you'd

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
down that is being the playoffs you'd

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.380 
down that is being the playoffs you'd
expect<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.130> little<00:01:26.460> bit<00:01:26.670> slower<00:01:26.850> pace<00:01:27.120> here

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
expect a little bit slower pace here

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.450 
expect a little bit slower pace here
generally<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.440> playoffs<00:01:28.800> these<00:01:29.159> teams

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
generally in the playoffs these teams

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.480 
generally in the playoffs these teams
don't<00:01:29.610> get<00:01:29.820> up<00:01:29.940> and<00:01:30.120> down<00:01:30.240> as<00:01:30.450> much<00:01:31.080> but<00:01:31.740> you

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
don't get up and down as much but you

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.130 
don't get up and down as much but you
know<00:01:32.580> you<00:01:32.640> look<00:01:32.850> at<00:01:32.970> Atlanta<00:01:33.390> on<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.930> road

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
know you look at Atlanta on the road

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.110 
know you look at Atlanta on the road
last<00:01:34.590> eight<00:01:34.890> games<00:01:34.920> seven<00:01:35.580> of<00:01:35.670> them<00:01:35.790> have<00:01:35.970> gone

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
last eight games seven of them have gone

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.539 
last eight games seven of them have gone
over<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.600> total<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.860> know<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.070> could<00:01:38.340> be

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
over the total so you know this could be

earlier<00:02:14.520> this<00:02:14.730> season<00:02:14.940> so<00:02:15.300> they<00:02:16.020> could<00:02:16.200> win

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380

earlier this season so they could win
one<00:02:16.650> game<00:02:16.680> but<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:17.430> don't<00:02:17.670> think<00:02:17.880> that<00:02:18.090> my

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
one game but I don't think that my

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.059 
one game but I don't think that my
amy<00:02:18.489> is<00:02:18.610> going<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.209> allow<00:02:19.510> too<00:02:20.409> much<00:02:20.620> more<00:02:20.890> than

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
amy is going to allow too much more than

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.339 
amy is going to allow too much more than
that<00:02:21.220> if<00:02:21.459> they<00:02:21.670> even<00:02:21.879> give<00:02:22.299> them<00:02:22.480> one<00:02:22.720> you<00:02:23.230> know

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
that if they even give them one you know

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.259 
that if they even give them one you know
Miami<00:02:23.680> at<00:02:23.830> home<00:02:23.860> lights<00:02:24.370> out<00:02:24.640> they've<00:02:25.150> been

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
Miami at home lights out they've been

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.119 
Miami at home lights out they've been
winning<00:02:25.510> consistently<00:02:25.930> without<00:02:26.590> their<00:02:26.950> guys

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
winning consistently without their guys

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:28.890 
winning consistently without their guys
in<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.459> lineup<00:02:27.640> they<00:02:28.150> took<00:02:28.390> all<00:02:28.569> these<00:02:28.690> guys

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
in the lineup they took all these guys

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.750 
in the lineup they took all these guys
out<00:02:29.110> rested<00:02:29.560> them<00:02:29.680> basically<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.220> last<00:02:30.430> month

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
out rested them basically the last month

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.190 
out rested them basically the last month
of<00:02:30.879> the<00:02:30.940> season<00:02:31.150> so<00:02:31.510> they<00:02:31.629> should<00:02:31.810> be<00:02:31.840> itching

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
of the season so they should be itching

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.229 
of the season so they should be itching
to<00:02:32.290> go<00:02:32.470> I'd<00:02:33.069> expect<00:02:33.190> them<00:02:33.489> to<00:02:33.580> hit<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:33.909> then

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
to go I'd expect them to hit and then

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.309 
to go I'd expect them to hit and then
walk<00:02:34.390> you<00:02:34.510> pretty<00:02:34.720> hard<00:02:34.780> here<00:02:35.019> in<00:02:35.140> Game<00:02:35.290> one

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
walk you pretty hard here in Game one

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.680 
walk you pretty hard here in Game one
and<00:02:35.650> I<00:02:35.739> think<00:02:35.950> what<00:02:36.220> we<00:02:36.400> saw<00:02:36.700> down<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.209> season

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
and I think what we saw down the season

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.449 
and I think what we saw down the season
even<00:02:37.840> though<00:02:37.989> during<00:02:38.769> the<00:02:38.829> playoffs<00:02:39.069> the

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
even though during the playoffs the

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.899 
even though during the playoffs the
bench<00:02:39.730> rotations<00:02:40.569> shorten<00:02:41.470> how<00:02:42.069> really<00:02:42.519> deep

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909 
bench rotations shorten how really deep

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.569 
bench rotations shorten how really deep

none of your stars are on the court and

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:55.800 
none of your stars are on the court and
you're<00:02:54.819> still<00:02:55.060> covering<00:02:55.450> spreads

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
you're still covering spreads

consistently that says a lot about that
bench<00:02:59.230> I<00:02:59.379> think<00:02:59.530> it<00:02:59.590> was<00:02:59.680> good<00:02:59.859> move<00:03:00.040> by

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
bench I think it was good move by

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.410 
bench I think it was good move by
Spoelstra<00:03:00.489> to<00:03:00.700> sit<00:03:00.910> down<00:03:01.060> some<00:03:01.239> of<00:03:01.269> these
