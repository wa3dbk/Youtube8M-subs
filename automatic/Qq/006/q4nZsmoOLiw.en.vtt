00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.130
 I'm Isabel Maria but we're in the house 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.110
 rural in windmills and 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.940
 then I will make a recipe 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.940
 of sirloin in almond sauce 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.050
 good to make this recipe we are going to 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:48.010
 need olive oil sirloin 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.080
 pork a slice of bread is 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.280
 here from the village of the bakery of 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:56.110
 town we're going to need almonds that 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.750
 they are from here from this mill house 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.420
 fresh organic almond wind 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.250
 caught that we are in full campaign of 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.450
 the almond harvest also 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.740
 we need garlic onion from the garden 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.509
 the orchards that we have here in the 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.130
 countryside of sherry 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:17.450
 we need some bay leaf and paprika 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.450
 and it came as I will not leave 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.329
 in a pan put oil and fry 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.310
 a slice of bread with about 50 grams 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:29.000
 about almond we remove 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.429
 of the oil we pepper the meat with 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.890
 salt and pepper in a pot put a 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:36.259
 little oil and we put the meat to 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.270
 brown golden brown when it is 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:43.270
 we remove it on a plate 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.170
 in the same oil we throw the onion and 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.580
 the garlic and a laurel leaf 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.790
 to put on a little 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.470
 When all chicks are already there, we add the 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.470
 almonds 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.930
 which has many properties and is very 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:03.040
 Good eating a handful of almonds to 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:05.410
 day because it has a lot of calcium iron and 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.740
 It does not get as fat as people say 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:12.130
 about an urban legend we leave them 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.860
 cook a little and we throw a glass of 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.900
 wine 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.120
 we let it boil a little so that the 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.310
 came loose the alcohol and reduce a 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.440
 little bit and add a teaspoon of 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.500
 paprika 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.780
 because not being a spicy dish does not 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.030
 let's put spicy moments on 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.880
 everything is to color it so you have 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.680
 other colors and you take prettier good 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.900
 Well, since it's all fried 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.530
 but we have to pass it to the blender and 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.530
 beat it well 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.379
 and we are adding water until 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.750
 we see that it has a texture of 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:58.030
 salsita that we like if we want it 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.840
 thicker or more claritas already depends on the 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.840
 taste of each 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.230
 we return the meat to the casserole 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.060
 the meat is already in the casserole and now 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:22.780
 we add the sauce on top and 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:26.490
 we let cook about 5 minutes so that the 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.490
 meat take all the flavor of the salsita 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:42.050
 Well, you have seen the salsita 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.910
 who has this after and is 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.460
 in the taste color 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.250
 and this is now ready to connect good 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.560
 this dish is already ready but we 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.450
 lack emplatar which may accompany 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.910
 Some potatoes or a baker 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.020
 of vegetables from our vegetables the 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.460
 Orchard 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.010
 In my case, I will accompany you 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.900
 Toasted almonds that is very good 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.250
 to give it more flavor is very rich 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.250
 and I recommend everyone to try it
