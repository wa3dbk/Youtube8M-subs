all right hey the phone has survived in
99<00:03:16.330> steps<00:03:16.599> that's<00:03:16.930> what<00:03:17.050> I'm<00:03:17.170> talking<00:03:17.650> about

so I think we can say that this test was
definitely<00:03:21.489> a<00:03:21.550> success<00:03:21.760> when<00:03:22.450> via<00:03:22.599> market<00:03:22.930> to
