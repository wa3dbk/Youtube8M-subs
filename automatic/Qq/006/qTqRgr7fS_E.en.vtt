00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
that was kind of a new experience I

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.880 
that was kind of a new experience I
realized<00:01:18.780> how<00:01:18.930> narrow<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.320> doors<00:01:19.500> are<00:01:19.710> which

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
realized how narrow the doors are which

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.100 
realized how narrow the doors are which
was<00:01:20.040> fun<00:01:20.220> but<00:01:20.790> it's<00:01:21.090> passable<00:01:21.509> but<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
was fun but it's passable but the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.480 
was fun but it's passable but the
biggest<00:01:22.259> problem<00:01:22.470> was<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.100> on<00:01:23.340> the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
biggest problem was that on the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.700 
biggest problem was that on the
carpeting<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.240> tires<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.630> have<00:01:24.780> are<00:01:25.080> terrain

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
carpeting the tires I have are terrain

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.920 
carpeting the tires I have are terrain
tires<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.250> they<00:01:26.369> grip<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.390> really<00:01:27.750> really

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
tires so they grip and so really really

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.420 
tires so they grip and so really really
hard<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.110> push<00:01:28.229> myself<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.619> it'll<00:01:29.220> be<00:01:29.280> nice<00:01:29.400> to

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
hard to push myself so it'll be nice to

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.760 
hard to push myself so it'll be nice to
have<00:01:29.549> some<00:01:29.790> indoor<00:01:30.060> tires<00:01:30.270> for<00:01:30.810> winter<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.710> I

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
have some indoor tires for winter so I

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.609 
have some indoor tires for winter so I
can<00:01:31.979> have<00:01:32.820> my<00:01:32.970> mobility<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:34.079> those<00:01:34.409> are<00:01:34.530> the

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
can have my mobility so those are the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.810 
can have my mobility so those are the
two<00:01:34.740> things<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.070> have<00:01:35.189> going<00:01:35.220> on

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
two things that I have going on

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.039 
two things that I have going on
I've<00:01:36.750> also<00:01:36.990> considered<00:01:37.799> possibly<00:01:38.780> using<00:01:39.780> my

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
I've also considered possibly using my

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.639 
I've also considered possibly using my
camcorder<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:41.130> record<00:01:41.430> my<00:01:42.420> tape<00:01:42.810> plot<00:01:42.990> games<00:01:43.229> I

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
camcorder to record my tape plot games I

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.499 
camcorder to record my tape plot games I
haven't<00:01:44.640> really<00:01:45.470> gone<00:01:46.470> into<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:46.920> very<00:01:47.009> much

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
haven't really gone into this very much

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
so I'm not sure how viable that is I

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.330 
so I'm not sure how viable that is I
have<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.630> really<00:01:51.990> really<00:01:52.320> nice<00:01:52.439> camcorder
