 if you ever thought it was yours 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.540
 Watching something is likely to be far away. 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.540
 not paranoia 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.420
 british industry association 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.759
 Security has calculated that in the country 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.580
 approximately 5 million cameras installed 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.210
 CCTV that is one by one for 15 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.730
 person 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.100
 do you go to the metro visit shopping 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.939
 center or go to school or hospital for 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.160
 you are being watched 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.599
 electronic spies in recent years in 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.550
 UK government address 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.710
 sounds a lot criticized due to so 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.600
 called mass slash komi in the country 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.800
 in the latest british report 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.780
 security industry associations 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.579
 it is argued that most 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.460
 installed cameras private and 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.930
 used for security association 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.480
 draws attention to the fact that the system 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.489
 observation is indispensable in identifying and 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.460
 crime detection and obtaining 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.170
 police evidence activists say 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.160
 what is currently the scope of systems 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.899
 video surveillance 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.360
 not enough legislation 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.190
 settled we talked about this topic 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.910
 with the head of the British human rights 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.519
 organization 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:07.260
 big brother watch private cameras 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.180
 CCTV installed much 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.890
 more than state but it's 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.450
 contrary to the statement that 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.659
 the role of big brother stands 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.030
 government don't i think that 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.140
 Now in the UK legislation 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.850
 there is a gap in this issue 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.070
 number of private systems 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.320
 CCTV has increased dramatically their 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.240
 more than public in society 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.009
 widespread delusions 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.900
 that these systems can prevent 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.820
 crime so after some 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.159
 state chamber time will become 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.820
 claimed people will start to install 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.740
 own 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.930
 but do not forget about extraordinary 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.030
 complex online technologies such as 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.590
 face recognition function some 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.149
 cameras can do it at a distance 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.369
 few kilometers 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.780
 I think the legislature should 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.610
 keep up with technology and 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.100
 regulate how and in what cases 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.720
 they can be applied because it is very 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.640
 advanced device with their help 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.850
 you can create an extremely detailed picture 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.579
 the privacy of every person and makar 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.590
 thank you very much for your new comment 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.420
 discussion of numerous private cameras 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.039
 observations turned against the law 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.470
 protection of freedoms taken by the government 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.540
 uk little 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.240
 more than a year ago according to this law 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.010
 authorities are obliged to reduce the base profiles 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.410
 dna and fingerprint 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.450
 information on the growth of private systems 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.160
 CCTV appeared almost immediately 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.870
 after official ruling 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.480
 regulatory use 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.460
 state chambers it all adds up 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.530
 oil on fire discussions caused 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:35.440
 recent edward revelations
