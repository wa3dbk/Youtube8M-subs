okay one of the things I've been playing

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:11.860 
okay one of the things I've been playing
with<00:00:11.110> a<00:00:11.139> little

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
with a little

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.960 
with a little
squirrel<00:00:12.440> traps<00:00:12.770> and<00:00:13.040> trap<00:00:13.430> and<00:00:13.610> score

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:13.970 
squirrel traps and trap and score

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.000 
squirrel traps and trap and score
and<00:00:15.070> what<00:00:16.070> I've<00:00:16.190> done<00:00:16.340> is<00:00:16.610> I've<00:00:17.150> modified<00:00:17.690> a

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.010 
and what I've done is I've modified a

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.430 
and what I've done is I've modified a
victor<00:00:19.010> rat<00:00:19.250> trap<00:00:19.520> this<00:00:19.700> is<00:00:19.760> just<00:00:19.970> your<00:00:20.060> basic

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:20.440 
victor rat trap this is just your basic

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.900 
victor rat trap this is just your basic
Victor<00:00:21.440> rat<00:00:21.619> trapping<00:00:22.100> bite<00:00:22.279> home<00:00:22.490> depot<00:00:22.880> or

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
Victor rat trapping bite home depot or

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.450 
Victor rat trapping bite home depot or
lowes<00:00:23.240> for<00:00:23.630> a<00:00:23.750> couple<00:00:24.200> of<00:00:24.260> bucks<00:00:24.470> two<00:00:25.130> dollars

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
lowes for a couple of bucks two dollars

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.960 
lowes for a couple of bucks two dollars
I<00:00:25.490> think<00:00:25.820> and<00:00:26.230> the<00:00:27.230> idea<00:00:27.590> is<00:00:27.680> we've<00:00:28.670> got<00:00:28.850> some

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
I think and the idea is we've got some

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.089 
I think and the idea is we've got some
pretty<00:00:29.119> big<00:00:29.330> grey<00:00:29.660> squirrels<00:00:30.050> around<00:00:30.560> here

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
pretty big grey squirrels around here

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:32.920 
pretty big grey squirrels around here
and<00:00:31.250> I<00:00:31.279> wanted<00:00:31.490> to<00:00:31.550> see<00:00:32.150> if<00:00:32.240> I<00:00:32.329> could<00:00:32.390> make<00:00:32.540> this

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
and I wanted to see if I could make this

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.140 
and I wanted to see if I could make this
trap<00:00:33.200> a<00:00:33.230> little<00:00:33.530> more<00:00:33.680> lethal<00:00:33.890> a<00:00:34.250> little<00:00:35.000> more

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150 
trap a little more lethal a little more

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.319 
trap a little more lethal a little more
reliable<00:00:35.510> and<00:00:36.430> so<00:00:37.430> what<00:00:37.550> I've<00:00:37.670> done<00:00:37.850> here<00:00:38.180> is

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
reliable and so what I've done here is

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.470 
reliable and so what I've done here is
I've<00:00:38.840> tried<00:00:38.960> to<00:00:39.260> mimic<00:00:39.829> basically<00:00:40.700> a<00:00:40.730> kind<00:00:41.360> of

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
I've tried to mimic basically a kind of

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.170 
I've tried to mimic basically a kind of
error<00:00:41.690> or<00:00:41.870> body<00:00:42.079> grip<00:00:42.320> trap<00:00:42.970> so<00:00:43.970> what<00:00:44.090> I've

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
error or body grip trap so what I've

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.680 
error or body grip trap so what I've
done<00:00:44.300> is<00:00:44.420> I've<00:00:44.540> taken<00:00:44.720> a<00:00:44.899> piece<00:00:45.050> of<00:00:45.290> wood<00:00:46.280> and

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
done is I've taken a piece of wood and

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.370 
done is I've taken a piece of wood and
I've<00:00:47.690> used<00:00:48.290> some<00:00:48.470> Brad's<00:00:48.830> and<00:00:49.190> tacked<00:00:49.430> it<00:00:49.610> down

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.380 
I've used some Brad's and tacked it down

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.830 
I've used some Brad's and tacked it down
just<00:00:51.380> inside<00:00:51.590> where<00:00:52.580> the<00:00:52.730> jaw<00:00:53.000> will<00:00:53.510> strike

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
just inside where the jaw will strike

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.440 
just inside where the jaw will strike
when<00:00:54.080> this<00:00:54.200> trap<00:00:54.440> fires<00:00:54.740> the<00:00:55.070> jaw<00:00:55.340> is<00:00:56.180> going<00:00:56.390> to

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
when this trap fires the jaw is going to

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.450 
when this trap fires the jaw is going to
strike<00:00:56.720> right<00:00:57.320> around<00:00:57.590> the<00:00:57.680> edge<00:00:57.800> of<00:00:57.980> this<00:00:58.130> and

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
strike right around the edge of this and

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.090 
strike right around the edge of this and
so<00:00:58.640> this<00:00:58.850> sort<00:00:59.120> of<00:00:59.210> you<00:00:59.810> can<00:00:59.930> see<00:01:00.140> will<00:01:00.410> pin<00:01:00.950> the

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
so this sort of you can see will pin the

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.960 
so this sort of you can see will pin the
animal's<00:01:01.520> neck<00:01:01.870> a<00:01:02.870> little<00:01:03.170> bit<00:01:03.320> better<00:01:03.970> the

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
animal's neck a little bit better the

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.060 
animal's neck a little bit better the
other<00:01:05.000> thing<00:01:05.299> I've<00:01:05.420> done<00:01:05.600> is<00:01:05.840> rather<00:01:06.799> than

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
other thing I've done is rather than

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.330 
other thing I've done is rather than
replace<00:01:07.549> the<00:01:07.759> springs<00:01:08.119> I<00:01:08.360> simply<00:01:09.130> added<00:01:10.130> some

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
replace the springs I simply added some

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.880 
replace the springs I simply added some
torque<00:01:10.610> to<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:10.880> springs<00:01:11.210> what<00:01:11.450> I<00:01:11.479> did<00:01:11.810> and<00:01:12.799> I

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
torque to the springs what I did and I

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.530 
torque to the springs what I did and I
hope<00:01:13.070> this<00:01:13.250> you<00:01:13.700> can<00:01:13.820> see<00:01:14.000> this<00:01:14.150> on<00:01:14.329> the<00:01:14.420> video

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
hope this you can see this on the video

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.090 
hope this you can see this on the video
is<00:01:14.900> I<00:01:15.560> pried<00:01:15.979> up<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:17.230> bottom<00:01:18.230> prongs<00:01:18.590> of<00:01:18.980> the

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
is I pried up the bottom prongs of the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.730 
is I pried up the bottom prongs of the
springs<00:01:19.659> placed<00:01:20.659> a<00:01:20.810> piece<00:01:20.990> of<00:01:21.140> wood<00:01:21.350> under<00:01:21.710> it

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
springs placed a piece of wood under it

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.070 
springs placed a piece of wood under it
and<00:01:21.980> then<00:01:22.430> tacked<00:01:22.760> them<00:01:22.909> down<00:01:23.180> with<00:01:23.690> some<00:01:23.870> wire

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
and then tacked them down with some wire

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.750 
and then tacked them down with some wire
Brad's<00:01:24.409> to<00:01:24.800> hold<00:01:24.980> it<00:01:25.100> in<00:01:25.220> place

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
Brad's to hold it in place

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.510 
Brad's to hold it in place
what<00:01:26.480> this<00:01:26.600> does<00:01:26.840> is<00:01:27.140> this<00:01:27.290> adds<00:01:27.620> some<00:01:28.370> extra

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
what this does is this adds some extra

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.410 
what this does is this adds some extra
force<00:01:29.030> to<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:29.540> springs<00:01:30.820> this<00:01:31.820> allows<00:01:32.120> you<00:01:32.300> to

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
force to the springs this allows you to

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.410 
force to the springs this allows you to
get<00:01:32.540> more<00:01:32.830> power<00:01:33.830> and<00:01:34.159> more<00:01:34.220> striking<00:01:35.150> force

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
get more power and more striking force

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.969 
get more power and more striking force
out<00:01:35.840> of<00:01:36.050> the<00:01:36.110> springs<00:01:36.470> than<00:01:36.710> you<00:01:36.800> normally

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
out of the springs than you normally

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.710 
out of the springs than you normally
would<00:01:37.280> it's<00:01:37.670> like<00:01:37.820> winding<00:01:38.240> them<00:01:38.390> up<00:01:38.510> a<00:01:38.600> little

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
would it's like winding them up a little

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.760 
would it's like winding them up a little
bit<00:01:38.870> extra<00:01:39.200> so<00:01:40.479> this<00:01:41.479> is<00:01:41.630> a<00:01:41.659> simple<00:01:42.590> way<00:01:42.740> to

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
bit extra so this is a simple way to

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.880 
bit extra so this is a simple way to
modify<00:01:43.220> a<00:01:43.880> rat<00:01:44.600> trap<00:01:44.930> any<00:01:45.260> time<00:01:45.500> you're<00:01:45.680> using

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
modify a rat trap any time you're using

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.430 
modify a rat trap any time you're using
them<00:01:46.130> a<00:01:46.280> rat<00:01:46.670> trap<00:01:47.000> this<00:01:47.690> is<00:01:47.900> a<00:01:47.930> good

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
them a rat trap this is a good

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.110 
them a rat trap this is a good
modification<00:01:49.159> to<00:01:49.220> do<00:01:49.340> it<00:01:49.460> doesn't<00:01:49.670> cost<00:01:49.820> any

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
modification to do it doesn't cost any

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.530 
modification to do it doesn't cost any
money<00:01:50.270> it<00:01:51.200> doesn't<00:01:51.500> hurt<00:01:51.620> the<00:01:51.770> trap<00:01:52.070> and<00:01:52.540> does

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
money it doesn't hurt the trap and does

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.469 
money it doesn't hurt the trap and does
nothing<00:01:53.870> but<00:01:53.990> make<00:01:54.049> it<00:01:54.320> hit<00:01:54.530> harder<00:01:54.890> and<00:01:55.450> hit<00:01:56.450> a

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
nothing but make it hit harder and hit a

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.210 
nothing but make it hit harder and hit a
little<00:01:56.600> bit<00:01:56.780> more<00:01:57.020> like<00:01:57.170> a<00:01:57.200> body<00:01:57.500> grip<00:01:57.799> and<00:01:58.100> one

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
little bit more like a body grip and one

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.340 
little bit more like a body grip and one
of<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.369> problems<00:01:58.820> that<00:01:58.909> I<00:01:59.030> ran<00:01:59.330> into<00:01:59.540> when<00:02:00.320> I

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
of the problems that I ran into when I

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.760 
of the problems that I ran into when I
started<00:02:01.250> trapping<00:02:01.490> squirrels<00:02:02.060> was<00:02:02.869> I<00:02:03.200> had<00:02:03.740> a

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
started trapping squirrels was I had a

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.910 
started trapping squirrels was I had a
lot<00:02:03.920> of<00:02:03.950> problems<00:02:04.460> with<00:02:04.700> non-target<00:02:05.630> species

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
lot of problems with non-target species

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.660 
lot of problems with non-target species
tripping<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:06.979> traps<00:02:07.599> or<00:02:08.599> taking<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.289> bait

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
tripping the traps or taking the bait

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.360 
tripping the traps or taking the bait
for<00:02:10.670> instance<00:02:10.970> if<00:02:11.120> I<00:02:11.239> used<00:02:11.569> a<00:02:12.110> trap<00:02:12.739> just<00:02:12.769> a<00:02:13.159> rat

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
for instance if I used a trap just a rat

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.119 
for instance if I used a trap just a rat
trap<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:13.849> I<00:02:14.599> attached<00:02:15.200> it<00:02:15.379> to<00:02:15.439> a<00:02:15.560> tree<00:02:15.980> and

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
trap and I attached it to a tree and

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.130 
trap and I attached it to a tree and
then<00:02:16.519> baited<00:02:16.939> the<00:02:17.090> trigger<00:02:17.659> with<00:02:17.840> peanut

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
then baited the trigger with peanut

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.110 
then baited the trigger with peanut
butter<00:02:18.349> a<00:02:18.620> lot<00:02:19.159> of<00:02:19.220> times<00:02:19.519> I<00:02:19.730> would<00:02:19.909> have

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
butter a lot of times I would have

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.059 
butter a lot of times I would have
raccoons<00:02:20.900> or<00:02:21.260> possums<00:02:21.790> that<00:02:22.790> would<00:02:22.910> climb<00:02:23.150> up

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
raccoons or possums that would climb up

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.239 
raccoons or possums that would climb up
a<00:02:24.209> couple<00:02:25.209> of<00:02:25.269> feet<00:02:25.450> up<00:02:25.569> the<00:02:25.689> tree<00:02:25.719> and<00:02:26.170> get<00:02:27.099> the

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:27.249 
a couple of feet up the tree and get the

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:29.009 
a couple of feet up the tree and get the
bait<00:02:27.430> triggered<00:02:27.849> the<00:02:27.909> trap<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.389> of<00:02:28.780> course

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
bait triggered the trap and of course

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.750 
bait triggered the trap and of course
the<00:02:29.469> rat<00:02:29.650> traps<00:02:29.950> not<00:02:30.129> going<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.340> hold<00:02:30.489> a<00:02:30.579> coon

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
the rat traps not going to hold a coon

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.459 
the rat traps not going to hold a coon
or<00:02:30.969> a<00:02:31.030> possum<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:33.480> what<00:02:34.480> what<00:02:34.870> I<00:02:34.900> wanted<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.290> do

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:35.469 
or a possum so what what I wanted to do

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:39.420 
or a possum so what what I wanted to do
was<00:02:35.799> to<00:02:36.749> eliminate<00:02:37.749> nine<00:02:38.319> target<00:02:38.799> catches<00:02:39.189> and

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
was to eliminate nine target catches and

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.179 
was to eliminate nine target catches and
I<00:02:39.549> wanted<00:02:39.849> to<00:02:39.999> direct<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.689> animal<00:02:41.189> directly

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:42.189 
I wanted to direct the animal directly

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:43.920 
I wanted to direct the animal directly
onto<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.639> trigger<00:02:42.879> so<00:02:43.209> they<00:02:43.450> couldn't<00:02:43.689> work

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
onto the trigger so they couldn't work

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.539 
onto the trigger so they couldn't work
the<00:02:44.109> set<00:02:44.349> from<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.590> side<00:02:44.920> they<00:02:45.159> couldn't<00:02:45.459> work

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
the set from the side they couldn't work

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.970 
the set from the side they couldn't work

weasels so I've adopted something
similar<00:03:08.590> for<00:03:09.340> squirrels<00:03:09.780> now<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:11.230> everything

lids they have joints where the lids

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.550 
lids they have joints where the lids
slide<00:03:27.699> in<00:03:27.939> and<00:03:28.120> out<00:03:28.209> not<00:03:29.019> even<00:03:29.079> want<00:03:29.349> to<00:03:29.379> fool

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
this is very simple there's nothing to

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.170 
this is very simple there's nothing to
buy<00:03:57.280> at<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.519> store<00:03:57.849> a<00:03:58.180> wire<00:03:59.019> is<00:03:59.290> cheap<00:03:59.650> and<00:04:00.180> you

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
buy at the store a wire is cheap and you

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.390 
buy at the store a wire is cheap and you
can<00:04:01.299> adjust<00:04:01.419> the<00:04:01.840> tension<00:04:02.049> on<00:04:02.349> this<00:04:02.560> real<00:04:03.370> easy

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
can adjust the tension on this real easy

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.159 
can adjust the tension on this real easy
you<00:04:03.909> can<00:04:04.060> make<00:04:04.090> it<00:04:04.359> very<00:04:04.540> tight<00:04:04.810> you<00:04:04.840> can<00:04:05.049> make

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:05.169 
you can make it very tight you can make

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:09.929 
you can make it very tight you can make
it<00:04:05.290> very<00:04:05.439> loose<00:04:06.209> something<00:04:07.209> like<00:04:07.389> that<00:04:08.939> but

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:09.939 
it very loose something like that but

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:12.629 
it very loose something like that but
set<00:04:10.329> this<00:04:10.479> trap<00:04:10.659> all<00:04:10.989> I<00:04:11.019> do<00:04:11.139> is<00:04:11.889> I<00:04:12.069> simply<00:04:12.310> put

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
set this trap all I do is I simply put

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.240 
set this trap all I do is I simply put
my<00:04:12.759> bait<00:04:12.969> in<00:04:13.209> the<00:04:13.359> back<00:04:13.569> and<00:04:13.989> usually<00:04:14.889> for<00:04:15.040> bait

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
my bait in the back and usually for bait

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.330 
my bait in the back and usually for bait
up<00:04:15.430> and<00:04:16.030> squirrels<00:04:16.479> what<00:04:16.719> I'm<00:04:16.810> using<00:04:17.049> is<00:04:17.340> some

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340

corn and some peanut butter back there

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:23.430 
corn and some peanut butter back there
and<00:04:20.799> I<00:04:20.859> slide<00:04:21.219> my<00:04:21.250> rat<00:04:21.669> trap<00:04:22.000> in<00:04:22.240> it<00:04:22.389> and<00:04:23.349> you

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
and I slide my rat trap in it and you

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.469 
and I slide my rat trap in it and you
can<00:04:23.560> see<00:04:23.740> this<00:04:23.889> is<00:04:24.039> my<00:04:24.190> lid<00:04:24.460> just<00:04:24.729> has<00:04:25.180> a<00:04:25.210> two

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
can see this is my lid just has a two

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:27.629 
can see this is my lid just has a two
inch<00:04:25.719> this<00:04:26.289> is<00:04:26.349> a<00:04:26.500> two<00:04:26.740> inch<00:04:26.919> hole<00:04:27.159> that<00:04:27.370> I<00:04:27.430> cut

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
inch this is a two inch hole that I cut

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.029 
inch this is a two inch hole that I cut
with<00:04:27.759> the<00:04:27.849> hole<00:04:28.000> saw<00:04:28.289> not<00:04:29.289> simply<00:04:29.620> put<00:04:29.830> it<00:04:29.919> in

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
with the hole saw not simply put it in

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.240 
with the hole saw not simply put it in
there<00:04:30.219> like<00:04:30.699> that<00:04:30.780> and<00:04:31.780> at<00:04:31.930> this<00:04:32.080> point<00:04:32.349> the

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
there like that and at this point the

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.450 
there like that and at this point the
trap<00:04:33.520> is<00:04:33.729> set<00:04:33.969> its<00:04:34.240> baited

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
trap is set its baited

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.930 
trap is set its baited
it's<00:04:35.850> ready<00:04:36.120> to<00:04:36.210> go<00:04:36.660> and<00:04:36.750> since<00:04:37.650> the<00:04:37.940> trigger

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
it's ready to go and since the trigger

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.930 
it's ready to go and since the trigger
is<00:04:39.180> just<00:04:39.480> inside<00:04:39.870> the<00:04:40.050> door<00:04:40.310> usually<00:04:41.310> when<00:04:41.820> you

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
is just inside the door usually when you

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.010 
is just inside the door usually when you
make<00:04:41.970> a<00:04:42.120> catch<00:04:42.420> you're<00:04:42.600> going<00:04:42.720> to<00:04:42.780> have<00:04:42.930> the

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
make a catch you're going to have the

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.520 
make a catch you're going to have the
squirrel<00:04:43.350> partially<00:04:44.340> in<00:04:44.520> and<00:04:44.700> partially<00:04:45.150> out

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
squirrel partially in and partially out

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.900 
squirrel partially in and partially out
so<00:04:46.530> it's<00:04:46.680> pretty<00:04:46.860> easy<00:04:46.980> to<00:04:47.310> tell<00:04:47.550> if<00:04:47.760> you've

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
so it's pretty easy to tell if you've

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.120 
so it's pretty easy to tell if you've
made<00:04:48.060> a<00:04:48.120> catch<00:04:48.390> on<00:04:48.630> a<00:04:48.660> on<00:04:49.320> grey<00:04:49.590> squirrel<00:04:49.950> or

made a catch on a on grey squirrel or

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.490 
made a catch on a on grey squirrel or
not<00:04:51.050> anyway<00:04:52.080> this<00:04:52.530> is<00:04:52.710> a<00:04:52.970> very<00:04:53.970> simple<00:04:54.500> very

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
not anyway this is a very simple very

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.710 
not anyway this is a very simple very
easy<00:04:55.560> to<00:04:55.800> make<00:04:56.750> very<00:04:57.750> safe<00:04:58.650> trap<00:04:59.520> and<00:05:00.120> it<00:05:00.480> works

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
easy to make very safe trap and it works

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.230 
easy to make very safe trap and it works
it's<00:05:01.680> putting<00:05:01.890> it<00:05:02.130> by<00:05:02.520> putting<00:05:02.730> it<00:05:02.910> inside<00:05:03.030> of

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
it's putting it by putting it inside of

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.120 
it's putting it by putting it inside of
a<00:05:03.390> weasel<00:05:03.570> box<00:05:03.900> I<00:05:04.080> don't<00:05:04.260> have<00:05:04.410> birds<00:05:04.650> landing

possums crawling all over it and setting
it<00:05:10.170> off<00:05:10.320> and<00:05:10.640> the<00:05:11.640> animal<00:05:12.000> has<00:05:12.030> only<00:05:12.540> one<00:05:13.110> and

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
one one and only one way to work the

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.880 
one one and only one way to work the
trapping<00:05:15.960> that's<00:05:16.110> from<00:05:16.290> the<00:05:16.380> front<00:05:16.560> and

you built the box a little bit bigger

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.810 
you built the box a little bit bigger
you<00:05:39.870> could<00:05:40.020> put<00:05:40.230> a<00:05:40.260> 110<00:05:40.740> Conibear<00:05:41.130> in<00:05:41.460> there

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
you could put a 110 Conibear in there

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.180 
you could put a 110 Conibear in there
and<00:05:41.970> use<00:05:42.120> it<00:05:42.270> for<00:05:42.480> one<00:05:42.690> ism<00:05:43.050> to<00:05:43.500> house<00:05:43.680> of<00:05:43.710> 110

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
and use it for one ism to house of 110

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.890 
and use it for one ism to house of 110
Conibear<00:05:44.520> it's<00:05:44.760> just<00:05:44.940> this<00:05:45.090> particular<00:05:45.450> box

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
Conibear it's just this particular box

Conibear it's just this particular box
is<00:05:46.620> not<00:05:46.830> quite<00:05:47.100> that<00:05:47.130> big<00:05:47.460> so<00:05:47.730> I<00:05:47.790> use<00:05:47.940> a<00:05:47.970> rat

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270
