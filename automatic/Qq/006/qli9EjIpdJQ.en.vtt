made<00:00:39.260> out<00:00:39.410> of<00:00:39.560> aluminum<00:00:40.070> so<00:00:40.340> it's<00:00:40.460> very

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
made out of aluminum so it's very

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.150 
made out of aluminum so it's very
lightweight<00:00:40.820> 4.1<00:00:41.690> kilograms<00:00:42.170> the<00:00:42.680> dimensions

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
lightweight 4.1 kilograms the dimensions

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.600 
lightweight 4.1 kilograms the dimensions
here<00:00:43.489> are<00:00:43.670> 3<00:00:43.970> 40<00:00:44.329> by<00:00:44.450> 3<00:00:44.690> 40<00:00:45.140> by<00:00:45.590> 3<00:00:45.920> 20<00:00:46.370> and<00:00:46.489> that's

here are 3 40 by 3 40 by 3 20 and that's
in<00:00:46.730> millimeters<00:00:47.090> so<00:00:47.239> it's<00:00:47.390> it's<00:00:47.870> almost<00:00:48.140> a

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
in millimeters so it's it's almost a

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.810 
in millimeters so it's it's almost a
cube<00:00:48.770> all<00:00:49.040> right<00:00:49.160> so<00:00:49.250> let's<00:00:49.399> talk<00:00:49.520> about<00:00:49.640> what

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820

there what's really holding the entire
case<00:01:14.479> together<00:01:14.659> without<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:15.590> side<00:01:15.950> panels<00:01:16.310> in

00:01:16.419 --> 00:01:16.429 
case together without the side panels in

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:17.889 
case together without the side panels in
there<00:01:16.579> there<00:01:16.789> there's<00:01:17.359> a<00:01:17.389> little<00:01:17.539> bit<00:01:17.630> of<00:01:17.689> play

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
there there there's a little bit of play

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:19.480 
there there there's a little bit of play
they're<00:01:18.139> not<00:01:18.439> flimsy<00:01:18.920> but<00:01:19.039> they<00:01:19.189> move<00:01:19.340> around

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
they're not flimsy but they move around

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.120 
they're not flimsy but they move around
quite<00:01:19.880> a<00:01:19.939> bit<00:01:20.030> so<00:01:20.630> those<00:01:21.200> are<00:01:21.350> there<00:01:21.499> but<00:01:22.009> you

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
quite a bit so those are there but you

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.620 
quite a bit so those are there but you
can<00:01:22.249> take<00:01:22.399> off<00:01:22.549> the<00:01:22.579> side<00:01:22.850> panels<00:01:23.240> so<00:01:23.450> anyway

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
can take off the side panels so anyway

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.779 
can take off the side panels so anyway
you<00:01:23.719> can<00:01:23.840> mount<00:01:23.959> to<00:01:24.499> 110<00:01:25.189> two<00:01:25.249> millimeter<00:01:25.579> fans

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
you can mount to 110 two millimeter fans

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:28.539 
you can mount to 110 two millimeter fans
on<00:01:26.090> either<00:01:26.479> side<00:01:26.779> of<00:01:26.810> this<00:01:26.959> there's<00:01:27.590> one<00:01:27.649> 120

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
on either side of this there's one 120

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.069 
on either side of this there's one 120
mounted<00:01:28.850> in<00:01:28.939> the<00:01:29.029> back<00:01:29.179> already<00:01:29.659> so<00:01:29.810> it<00:01:29.929> comes

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
mounted in the back already so it comes

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:31.769 
mounted in the back already so it comes
with<00:01:30.229> that<00:01:30.350> one<00:01:30.529> and<00:01:30.679> this<00:01:30.979> does<00:01:31.219> support<00:01:31.639> a

00:01:31.769 --> 00:01:31.779 
with that one and this does support a

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
with that one and this does support a
240<00:01:32.779> millimeter<00:01:33.499> water<00:01:34.399> cooling<00:01:34.729> unit<00:01:35.240> and

240 millimeter water cooling unit and
one<00:01:36.799> of<00:01:36.889> these<00:01:37.009> sides<00:01:37.249> it's<00:01:37.459> really<00:01:37.700> going<00:01:37.789> to

00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:37.849 
one of these sides it's really going to

one of these sides it's really going to
be<00:01:37.939> just<00:01:38.179> you<00:01:38.299> know<00:01:38.389> an<00:01:38.509> intake<00:01:38.899> or<00:01:39.139> like<00:01:39.340> you

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
be just you know an intake or like you

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.519 
be just you know an intake or like you
know<00:01:40.459> some<00:01:40.609> air<00:01:40.759> flow<00:01:41.090> going<00:01:41.209> on<00:01:41.749> for<00:01:42.109> your<00:01:42.259> for

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:42.529 
know some air flow going on for your for

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:44.739 
know some air flow going on for your for
your<00:01:42.649> GPU<00:01:43.009> or<00:01:43.369> whatever<00:01:43.909> or<00:01:44.179> if<00:01:44.509> you're<00:01:44.630> not

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:44.749 
your GPU or whatever or if you're not

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:46.419 
your GPU or whatever or if you're not
running<00:01:44.899> a<00:01:45.020> big<00:01:45.170> GPU<00:01:45.560> you<00:01:45.679> could<00:01:45.829> put<00:01:45.950> fans<00:01:46.189> on

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
running a big GPU you could put fans on

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.069 
running a big GPU you could put fans on
both<00:01:46.579> sides<00:01:46.819> have<00:01:47.060> a<00:01:47.090> an<00:01:47.420> air<00:01:47.630> tunnel<00:01:47.929> going

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
both sides have a an air tunnel going

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.830 
both sides have a an air tunnel going
that<00:01:48.380> way<00:01:48.560> that's<00:01:48.859> one<00:01:49.069> idea<00:01:49.419> the<00:01:50.419> other<00:01:50.539> idea

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
that way that's one idea the other idea

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.239 
that way that's one idea the other idea
is<00:01:50.899> to<00:01:50.990> use<00:01:51.020> a<00:01:51.139> tower<00:01:51.409> cooler<00:01:51.770> in<00:01:51.950> here<00:01:52.099> and

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:52.249 
is to use a tower cooler in here and

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:55.389 
is to use a tower cooler in here and
have<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:53.270> back<00:01:53.630> fan<00:01:53.959> used<00:01:54.289> as<00:01:54.619> an<00:01:54.770> output<00:01:55.159> or

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
have the back fan used as an output or

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.489 
have the back fan used as an output or
an<00:01:55.579> outtake<00:01:55.759> so<00:01:56.450> that<00:01:56.599> way<00:01:56.719> you've<00:01:57.109> got<00:01:57.139> kind

00:01:57.489 --> 00:01:57.499 
an outtake so that way you've got kind

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:59.649 
an outtake so that way you've got kind
of<00:01:57.619> a<00:01:57.709> push-pull<00:01:58.130> going<00:01:58.399> speaking<00:01:59.119> of<00:01:59.329> all

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
of a push-pull going speaking of all

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.019 
of a push-pull going speaking of all
that<00:01:59.869> kind<00:02:00.049> of<00:02:00.079> stuff<00:02:00.200> it<00:02:00.469> can<00:02:00.619> hold<00:02:00.889> a<00:02:01.159> 160

00:02:02.019 --> 00:02:02.029 
that kind of stuff it can hold a 160

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:04.269 
that kind of stuff it can hold a 160
millimeter<00:02:02.419> tall<00:02:02.719> tower<00:02:03.409> cooler<00:02:03.739> and<00:02:04.039> it<00:02:04.189> can

00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:04.279 
millimeter tall tower cooler and it can

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:07.059 
millimeter tall tower cooler and it can
all<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:04.489> 320<00:02:05.239> millimeter<00:02:05.569> graphics<00:02:06.349> card<00:02:06.560> all

here<00:02:51.870> on<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.019> side<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:52.440> it<00:02:52.590> will<00:02:52.800> I<00:02:53.010> guess<00:02:53.519> if

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
here on the side so it will I guess if

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.300 
here on the side so it will I guess if
that<00:02:54.180> fan<00:02:54.630> needs<00:02:54.840> air<00:02:55.410> it'll<00:02:55.709> come<00:02:56.070> in<00:02:56.160> right

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
that fan needs air it'll come in right

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.800 
that fan needs air it'll come in right
there<00:02:56.459> from<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.670> side<00:02:56.880> now<00:02:57.480> almost

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
there from the side now almost

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.330 
there from the side now almost
everything<00:02:58.440> can<00:02:58.590> be<00:02:58.680> removed<00:02:58.950> like<00:02:59.100> I<00:02:59.190> said
