muscle<00:02:13.890> definition<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.790> tail<00:02:15.350> you<00:02:16.350> can<00:02:16.410> see

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
muscle definition the tail you can see

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.940 
muscle definition the tail you can see
all<00:02:16.799> the<00:02:16.920> little<00:02:18.139> package<00:02:19.139> things<00:02:19.410> he<00:02:19.650> came

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
all the little package things he came

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.320 
all the little package things he came
with<00:02:20.220> you

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
with you

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.840 
with you
on<00:02:21.570> this<00:02:21.810> belt<00:02:22.080> as<00:02:22.410> you<00:02:22.560> will<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.010> utility<00:02:23.640> but<00:02:23.820> I

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
on this belt as you will a utility but I

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.330 
on this belt as you will a utility but I
guess<00:02:24.120> so<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.200> tail<00:02:25.380> is<00:02:25.470> pretty<00:02:25.620> cool<00:02:25.860> it<00:02:26.160> does

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
guess so the tail is pretty cool it does

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.380 
guess so the tail is pretty cool it does
not<00:02:26.490> go<00:02:26.760> back<00:02:27.000> it<00:02:27.270> only<00:02:27.450> goes<00:02:27.750> side<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.080> side<00:02:29.390> so

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
not go back it only goes side to side so

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.760 
not go back it only goes side to side so
it<00:02:30.540> can<00:02:30.750> go<00:02:31.020> through<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.320> restrictions<00:02:31.680> so

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
it can go through and restrictions so

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:32.960 
it can go through and restrictions so
you<00:02:31.830> can't<00:02:32.070> have<00:02:32.220> it<00:02:32.340> down<00:02:32.490> there<00:02:32.520> like<00:02:32.910> that

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
you can't have it down there like that

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.850 
you can't have it down there like that
and<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:33.840> actually<00:02:33.960> has<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:34.200> couple<00:02:34.500> points<00:02:34.800> of

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
and it actually has a couple points of

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.860 
and it actually has a couple points of
articulation<00:02:35.010> my<00:02:35.610> actual<00:02:35.940> tail<00:02:36.150> can<00:02:36.510> turn

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
articulation my actual tail can turn

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.660 
articulation my actual tail can turn
right<00:02:37.110> there<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:37.740> can<00:02:37.950> turn<00:02:38.220> right<00:02:38.430> here

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
right there and it can turn right here

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.030 
right there and it can turn right here
as<00:02:38.820> well<00:02:39.090> pretty<00:02:39.780> pretty<00:02:40.020> cool<00:02:40.260> pretty<00:02:40.800> pretty

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
as well pretty pretty cool pretty pretty

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.680 
as well pretty pretty cool pretty pretty
cool<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.550> doubled<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:41.970> up<00:02:42.090> right<00:02:42.270> there<00:02:42.480> yeah

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
cool I doubled it up right there yeah

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.010 
cool I doubled it up right there yeah
check<00:02:42.960> it<00:02:43.080> out<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.260> towel<00:02:43.470> roll<00:02:43.740> whatever<00:02:43.980> umm

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
check it out the towel roll whatever umm

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.840 
check it out the towel roll whatever umm
so<00:02:46.020> chest<00:02:46.350> articulation<00:02:47.100> it<00:02:47.460> can<00:02:47.670> move

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
so chest articulation it can move

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.940 
so chest articulation it can move
forward<00:02:48.120> a<00:02:48.150> little<00:02:48.180> bit<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.930> can't<00:02:49.260> turn<00:02:49.530> it's

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
forward a little bit it can't turn it's

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.350 
forward a little bit it can't turn it's
kind<00:02:50.130> of<00:02:50.220> just<00:02:50.490> there<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:50.970> know<00:02:51.060> what<00:02:51.150> I<00:02:51.210> mean

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
kind of just there you know what I mean

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.410 
kind of just there you know what I mean
but<00:02:52.020> uh<00:02:52.080> if<00:02:52.650> you<00:02:53.010> were<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:54.090> know<00:02:54.210> messing

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
but uh if you were you know messing

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.720 
but uh if you were you know messing
around<00:02:54.600> with<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:55.050> it<00:02:55.710> actually<00:02:55.860> would<00:02:56.370> improve

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
around with it it actually would improve

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.130 
around with it it actually would improve
the<00:02:56.880> articulation<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:57.660> it<00:02:57.750> moves<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:58.020> lot

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
the articulation so it moves a lot

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.160 
the articulation so it moves a lot
better<00:02:58.910> so<00:02:59.910> that's<00:03:00.090> pretty<00:03:00.300> cool<00:03:00.570> does<00:03:00.960> have<00:03:01.110> a

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
better so that's pretty cool does have a

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.860 
better so that's pretty cool does have a
ball<00:03:01.350> joint<00:03:01.620> right<00:03:01.830> here<00:03:02.360> just<00:03:03.360> go<00:03:03.510> up<00:03:03.720> and

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
ball joint right here just go up and

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.060 
ball joint right here just go up and
down<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.730> front<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:05.760> back<00:03:06.470> pretty<00:03:07.470> cool<00:03:07.710> up

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
down and front and back pretty cool up

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.390 
down and front and back pretty cool up
roof<00:03:09.060> dropped<00:03:09.630> him<00:03:09.860> it's<00:03:10.860> kind<00:03:11.070> of<00:03:11.100> heavy

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
roof dropped him it's kind of heavy

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.810 
roof dropped him it's kind of heavy
um<00:03:12.770> he<00:03:13.770> does<00:03:14.150> focus<00:03:15.150> he<00:03:15.330> does<00:03:15.570> have<00:03:16.460> upper<00:03:17.460> arm

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
um he does focus he does have upper arm

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.610 
um he does focus he does have upper arm
articulation<00:03:18.750> right<00:03:18.870> there<00:03:19.080> he<00:03:19.260> does<00:03:19.440> have

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
articulation right there he does have

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.860 
articulation right there he does have
one<00:03:19.830> joint<00:03:20.220> at<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.550> elbow<00:03:20.940> which<00:03:21.660> you<00:03:21.780> would

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
one joint at the elbow which you would

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.240 
one joint at the elbow which you would
think<00:03:21.900> for<00:03:22.110> a<00:03:22.350> figure<00:03:22.650> this<00:03:22.770> size<00:03:22.980> they<00:03:23.130> could

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
think for a figure this size they could

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.250 
think for a figure this size they could
easily<00:03:23.370> throw<00:03:23.610> into<00:03:23.820> joists<00:03:24.000> this<00:03:24.630> one<00:03:24.990> joint

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
easily throw into joists this one joint

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.440 
easily throw into joists this one joint
actually<00:03:25.590> works<00:03:25.739> a<00:03:25.950> lot<00:03:26.100> better<00:03:26.270> because<00:03:27.270> it

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
actually works a lot better because it

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.000 
actually works a lot better because it
looks<00:03:27.630> like<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:27.870> material<00:03:28.020> they<00:03:28.590> used<00:03:28.860> the

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
looks like the material they used the

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.949 
looks like the material they used the
type<00:03:29.190> of<00:03:29.310> plastic<00:03:29.700> they<00:03:29.820> used<00:03:30.000> for<00:03:30.180> this<00:03:30.360> it

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
type of plastic they used for this it

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.449 
type of plastic they used for this it
makes<00:03:31.170> it<00:03:31.350> flow<00:03:31.560> a<00:03:31.590> lot<00:03:31.830> easier<00:03:32.100> instead<00:03:32.370> of

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
makes it flow a lot easier instead of

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.340 
makes it flow a lot easier instead of
two<00:03:32.610> points<00:03:33.030> because<00:03:33.270> we<00:03:33.570> all<00:03:33.690> know<00:03:33.930> if<00:03:34.170> you've

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
two points because we all know if you've

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.550 
two points because we all know if you've
ever<00:03:34.500> had<00:03:34.830> a<00:03:35.100> figure<00:03:35.489> with<00:03:35.640> two<00:03:35.820> points<00:03:36.390> on<00:03:37.290> the

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
ever had a figure with two points on the

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.010 
ever had a figure with two points on the
elbows<00:03:37.950> of<00:03:38.100> the<00:03:38.190> knees<00:03:38.370> one<00:03:38.700> always<00:03:39.540> works<00:03:39.810> and

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
elbows of the knees one always works and

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.590 
elbows of the knees one always works and
one<00:03:40.230> usually<00:03:40.800> tends<00:03:41.190> not<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:41.459> work<00:03:41.910> as<00:03:42.090> well<00:03:42.300> as

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
one usually tends not to work as well as

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.300 
one usually tends not to work as well as
the<00:03:42.750> other<00:03:42.959> joint<00:03:43.290> on<00:03:43.470> there<00:03:43.650> so<00:03:43.950> if<00:03:44.070> we<00:03:44.190> had

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
the other joint on there so if we had

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.000 
the other joint on there so if we had
two<00:03:44.489> joints<00:03:45.140> most<00:03:46.140> the<00:03:46.290> time<00:03:46.500> ought<00:03:46.739> to<00:03:46.770> figure

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
two joints most the time ought to figure

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.220 
two joints most the time ought to figure
this<00:03:47.250> size<00:03:47.489> it<00:03:47.670> would<00:03:47.700> only<00:03:47.880> if<00:03:48.480> only<00:03:48.870> one<00:03:49.050> that

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
this size it would only if only one that

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.360 
this size it would only if only one that
one<00:03:49.410> of<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.560> joints<00:03:49.830> would<00:03:49.920> move<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:50.280> other

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
one of the joints would move the other

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.610 
one of the joints would move the other
one<00:03:50.520> would<00:03:50.700> just<00:03:50.730> get<00:03:50.970> stuck<00:03:51.360> so<00:03:52.260> that's<00:03:52.410> why

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
one would just get stuck so that's why

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.890 
one would just get stuck so that's why
on<00:03:52.830> the<00:03:52.920> bigger<00:03:53.100> figures<00:03:53.489> they<00:03:53.640> go<00:03:53.790> with<00:03:53.970> the

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
on the bigger figures they go with the

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.990 
on the bigger figures they go with the
single<00:03:55.200> joint<00:03:55.440> because<00:03:56.280> it's<00:03:56.459> just<00:03:56.640> simple

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
single joint because it's just simple

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.370 
single joint because it's just simple
the<00:03:57.270> bigger<00:03:57.450> joint<00:03:57.810> holds<00:03:58.170> it<00:03:58.260> together

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
the bigger joint holds it together

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.120 
the bigger joint holds it together
better<00:03:59.959> rather<00:04:00.959> than<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.350> little<00:04:01.620> ones<00:04:01.800> you

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
better rather than the little ones you

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.580 
better rather than the little ones you
know<00:04:02.640> what<00:04:02.730> I<00:04:02.790> mean<00:04:03.080> make<00:04:04.080> some<00:04:04.230> sense<00:04:04.440> so<00:04:04.500> you

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
know what I mean make some sense so you

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.490 
know what I mean make some sense so you
can<00:04:04.709> see<00:04:04.830> the<00:04:04.950> markings<00:04:05.370> on<00:04:06.060> his<00:04:06.870> hand<00:04:07.260> you

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
can see the markings on his hand you

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.100 
can see the markings on his hand you
know<00:04:07.560> his<00:04:07.830> stone<00:04:08.100> hand<00:04:08.459> really<00:04:08.940> cool<00:04:09.209> so<00:04:10.020> you

know his stone hand really cool so you

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.510 
know his stone hand really cool so you
can<00:04:10.230> see<00:04:10.350> the<00:04:10.470> Murphy<00:04:10.800> was<00:04:10.950> on<00:04:11.040> there<00:04:11.160> very

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
can see the Murphy was on there very

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.510 
can see the Murphy was on there very
very<00:04:11.940> nice<00:04:12.180> detail<00:04:12.780> very<00:04:13.560> nice<00:04:13.800> and<00:04:14.010> then<00:04:14.400> the

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
very nice detail very nice and then the

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.949 
very nice detail very nice and then the
articulation<00:04:15.090> in<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.239> hand<00:04:15.420> no<00:04:15.570> no<00:04:15.720> but

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
articulation in the hand no no but

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.720 
articulation in the hand no no but
reason<00:04:16.290> one<00:04:16.620> of<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.739> reasons<00:04:16.799> I<00:04:17.130> like<00:04:17.669> this

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
reason one of the reasons I like this

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.880 
reason one of the reasons I like this
Hellboy<00:04:18.209> compared<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:18.690> the<00:04:18.780> other<00:04:18.930> ones<00:04:19.169> is

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
Hellboy compared to the other ones is

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.050 
Hellboy compared to the other ones is
because<00:04:19.950> it<00:04:20.640> has<00:04:20.850> a<00:04:21.350> closed<00:04:22.350> fist<00:04:22.790> now<00:04:23.790> that<00:04:24.030> I

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
because it has a closed fist now that I

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.060 
because it has a closed fist now that I
have<00:04:24.600> yet<00:04:24.840> to<00:04:24.870> see<00:04:25.200> a<00:04:25.230> Hellboy<00:04:25.710> where<00:04:25.890> they've

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
have yet to see a Hellboy where they've

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.400 
have yet to see a Hellboy where they've
had<00:04:26.700> articulated<00:04:27.030> fingers<00:04:27.750> on<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.080> stone

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
had articulated fingers on the stone

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.250 
had articulated fingers on the stone
hand<00:04:29.180> usually<00:04:30.180> it's<00:04:30.300> just<00:04:30.360> poses<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:31.080> other

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
hand usually it's just poses the other

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.120

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.000 
been in like like poses like this and
this<00:04:40.890> and<00:04:41.310> this<00:04:41.960> not<00:04:42.960> a<00:04:42.990> closed<00:04:43.320> fit<00:04:43.620> so<00:04:43.830> it's

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
this and this not a closed fit so it's

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.200 
this and this not a closed fit so it's
really<00:04:44.280> nice<00:04:44.460> that<00:04:44.490> they<00:04:44.730> finally<00:04:45.060> have<00:04:45.150> a

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210

really nice that they finally have a
closed<00:04:45.480> fist<00:04:45.780> one<00:04:46.340> it's<00:04:47.340> very<00:04:47.520> nice<00:04:47.670> and<00:04:47.790> then

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
closed fist one it's very nice and then

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.610 
closed fist one it's very nice and then
you<00:04:48.000> can<00:04:48.120> see<00:04:48.330> looks<00:04:49.020> like<00:04:49.140> there's<00:04:49.320> a<00:04:49.410> ball

way<00:06:46.850> around<00:06:47.120> but<00:06:47.720> another<00:06:47.930> problem<00:06:48.170> is<00:06:48.650> that

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 
way around but another problem is that

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.210 
way around but another problem is that
these<00:06:50.960> Hellboy<00:06:51.440> legs<00:06:51.710> they<00:06:51.920> don't<00:06:52.100> move

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:52.220 
these Hellboy legs they don't move

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.120 
these Hellboy legs they don't move
forward<00:06:52.730> too<00:06:53.000> well<00:06:53.180> this<00:06:54.170> one<00:06:54.440> moves<00:06:54.710> forward

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.130 
forward too well this one moves forward

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.190 
forward too well this one moves forward
pretty<00:06:55.340> nicely<00:06:55.580> but<00:06:56.420> this<00:06:56.630> one<00:06:56.840> just<00:06:57.020> gets

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:57.200 
pretty nicely but this one just gets

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.630 
pretty nicely but this one just gets
hindered<00:06:57.590> for<00:06:57.770> some<00:06:57.950> reason<00:06:58.190> I'm<00:06:58.310> not<00:06:58.340> too

00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:58.640 
hindered for some reason I'm not too

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.310 
hindered for some reason I'm not too
sure<00:06:58.850> maybe<00:06:59.120> it's<00:06:59.300> all<00:06:59.420> the<00:06:59.450> way<00:06:59.660> up<00:06:59.690> it<00:06:59.960> can<00:07:00.140> go

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:00.320 
sure maybe it's all the way up it can go

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.440 
sure maybe it's all the way up it can go
or<00:07:01.040> something<00:07:01.310> along<00:07:01.610> those<00:07:01.760> lines<00:07:01.880> but<00:07:02.330> I've
