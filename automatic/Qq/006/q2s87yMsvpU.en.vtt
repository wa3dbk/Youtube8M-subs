00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.110 
with my flavor injector tool here so

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:52.080 
with my flavor injector tool here so
I'll<00:00:17.170> make<00:00:17.290> a<00:00:17.349> shell<00:00:17.739> first<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:51.550> we'll<00:00:51.940> let

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
I'll make a shell first so we'll let

00:00:52.090 --> 00:01:01.170 
I'll make a shell first so we'll let
that<00:00:52.120> cook<00:00:52.450> for<00:00:52.720> a<00:00:52.750> little<00:00:52.870> bit<00:00:59.970> so<00:01:00.970> we'll<00:01:01.090> let

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
that cook for a little bit so we'll let

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.210 
that cook for a little bit so we'll let
it<00:01:01.300> cook<00:01:01.450> so<00:01:01.630> that<00:01:01.780> the<00:01:02.050> outline<00:01:02.500> gets<00:01:02.739> darker

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
it cook so that the outline gets darker

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.670 
it cook so that the outline gets darker
than<00:01:03.610> the<00:01:03.790> innards<00:01:04.320> give<00:01:05.320> a<00:01:05.350> little<00:01:05.530> color

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
than the innards give a little color

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.899 
than the innards give a little color
variation<00:01:06.550> there<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.780> I<00:01:11.140> usually<00:01:11.290> wait<00:01:11.620> until

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
variation there and I usually wait until

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.010 
variation there and I usually wait until
it<00:01:12.909> looks<00:01:13.090> like<00:01:13.240> it's<00:01:13.390> completely<00:01:13.840> cooked

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
it looks like it's completely cooked

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.719 
it looks like it's completely cooked
because<00:01:14.320> then<00:01:14.440> I<00:01:14.530> know<00:01:14.590> it's<00:01:14.800> getting<00:01:15.100> pretty

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
because then I know it's getting pretty

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.969 
because then I know it's getting pretty
well<00:01:15.940> burned<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:17.350> we'll<00:01:17.440> just<00:01:17.560> come<00:01:17.680> back<00:01:17.799> and

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
well burned and we'll just come back and

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:34.860 
well burned and we'll just come back and
fill<00:01:18.220> in<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.460> center

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.210 

then<00:01:35.870> we're<00:01:36.290> gonna<00:01:36.380> let<00:01:36.590> that<00:01:36.680> cook<00:01:36.860> for<00:01:36.920> just

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
then we're gonna let that cook for just

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.280 
then we're gonna let that cook for just
the<00:01:37.580> minimum<00:01:38.090> amount<00:01:38.360> of<00:01:38.480> time<00:01:38.540> so<00:01:38.990> that<00:01:39.110> we

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
the minimum amount of time so that we

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.710 
the minimum amount of time so that we
have<00:01:39.440> the<00:01:39.560> lightest<00:01:39.920> color<00:01:40.270> so<00:01:41.270> as<00:01:41.330> soon<00:01:41.510> as

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
have the lightest color so as soon as

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.140 
have the lightest color so as soon as
bubbles<00:01:42.080> start<00:01:42.670> coming<00:01:43.670> up<00:01:43.790> here<00:01:46.000> then<00:01:47.000> it's

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
bubbles start coming up here then it's

00:01:47.150 --> 00:02:01.030 
bubbles start coming up here then it's
done<00:01:57.880> so<00:01:58.880> there's<00:01:59.060> a<00:01:59.120> turtle<00:01:59.450> shell<00:01:59.710> no<00:02:00.710> we're
