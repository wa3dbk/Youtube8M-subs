00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.330
 Jo Harlow is one like him for consumption 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.390
 Erich 16 at the end is already from the 7 

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.309
 or siblings or us changed now 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.140
 biggest one 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.629
 not moving I'm sure that 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:16.980
 that's just how it works or not 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.980
 the biggest could work but not 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:24.750
 while the old barracks lawyers change so the background 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.679
 like that looks up first 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:31.310
 via computer 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.660
 no data carrier 10 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.660
 Vilnius 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.990
 16 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.660
 32 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.660
 Berlin December to 16 32 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.270
 and then so many farmers h 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.470
 Popov 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.470
 the adventures 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.450
 Seer Obeidi like that 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.450
 Problem solved 14 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.240
 a steady example in the medium term 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.380
 recently 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.650
 folders 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.650
 goodwill is at an advantage 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.520
 just as lucky to find 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.590
 History repeats the rest put some folders in 9 9 at the Beckhams 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.110
 firmly 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.380
 So background from the English 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.140
 in the 17th 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.000
 You can see a mini-screen here, that's May with me 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.750
 Calculate something like that 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.060
 and then 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.060
 IDS takes care of Bettini what you want 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.460
 and important food - keep two things 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.880
 Entertain Melbourne 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.460
 note 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.460
 around 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.460
 each picture not larger than 200 branches 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.480
 yes be 254 kW 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.400
 and the picture has to play who is going now 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.700
 generates GMG 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.840
 to be away from the market for a while 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.790
 as not only is easy in PNG 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.950
 Shells be jay-tech 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.359
 and percent Lima 3 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:11.369
 it has to be the same as standing 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:13.859
 Bäcklund the woman lives 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:17.249
 Beckhams the sloths speak it is in English 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:20.309
 to be exact 

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:23.309
 and the Alevites are almost done 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:26.719
 go in search of 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:29.719
 Way circles Dr he explains 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:35.729
 TLZ 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:38.379
 to calculate the simple 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.379
 No to quote &amp; a 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.659
 according to the article 

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:50.189
 indexed and that though he did 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:52.069
 then completely under 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.829
 Andy Cès Microsoft 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.189
 the software Microsoft 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:00.189
 then whole wind down us 

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:03.499
 they are - almost 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:06.579
 because it's her talent who are 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.029
 collect 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:09.739
 the best animal 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.119
 Autohof 

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:12.090
 arbitrate 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.819
 Author quotes Chen 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.169
 Kerber would be tested at every one of it's one two three four-fifths 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.969
 a double game 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:24.609
 and then these euros 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.069
 Blaubeuren Mini 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.069
 that is not going away again 

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:36.519
 Beck it was just a double click Infects only hope 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.049
 erm 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:46.069
 that Airbus 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.969
 Neumarkt then she goes to Becker appeals 

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:50.939
 then happens the 9th 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:52.959
 unfortunately shows with new 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.569
 right 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.569
 the environment - more than 20 Mbit 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:02.349
 This shows the 32-bit if I have a lot of respect 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.319
 cured 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.919
 around the Reichelsheimer itself with as 20 bit the farmers would name 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.269
 as Dobrindt points out 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.370
 the discovery 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.469
 upper and lower case Jost be observed 

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:21.989
 how important 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.340
 he would be so tenant above 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.789
 hit twice 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.740
 and then happen below value 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.650
 Percent not just write in 10 1 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.840
 but Nokia third 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.249
 and percent 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:42.180
 8 Werder has to look like this 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.090
 so rest for an hour 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.420
 The brand had to be right with its value 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.770
 1 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.189
 that's all 

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:53.479
 what now 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:55.900
 because she does not look like me 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.920
 You see her in Berlin 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.589
 from a little video what 

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:03.479
 Rossmann is turned on 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.799
 Ladies on the program it does not really want to record 

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:11.559
 Manuel Schöbel also holds ten tons 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:15.529
 That's what it looks like on Dr 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:17.110
 and then 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.110
 it is her at this point, too 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.839
 to Soost 

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:41.839
 there 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.029
 they lie in these 

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:49.079
 every user alternate core of the stern 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.930
 on 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.539
 terrible 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:57.539
 that can ever be around this trend screen 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:03.080
 and r I could have seen it synonymous with the camera 4 nothing 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.279
 APA 

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:07.749
 as set 

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:08.930
 Etc 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.930
 certainly is a very good graphics 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:21.409
 not really piece 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:26.879
 intermediate place 

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:29.829
 and he has nothing St
