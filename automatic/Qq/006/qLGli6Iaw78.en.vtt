00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
we'll get a bit lucky there and then

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.190 
we'll get a bit lucky there and then

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
value is considering he's probably going

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.570

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
another bit on for him because I thought

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.450 
another bit on for him because I thought
it'd<00:04:25.690> be<00:04:25.840> a<00:04:25.870> pretty<00:04:26.140> pretty<00:04:26.620> decent<00:04:26.979> yeah

it'd be a pretty pretty decent yeah

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.760 
it'd be a pretty pretty decent yeah
prospect<00:04:28.000> it's<00:04:28.750> like<00:04:28.900> I<00:04:29.080> made<00:04:29.259> him<00:04:29.380> a<00:04:29.470> sporadic

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
prospect it's like I made him a sporadic

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.260 
prospect it's like I made him a sporadic
first<00:04:30.130> team<00:04:30.310> player<00:04:30.490> I'm<00:04:30.580> pretty<00:04:30.880> sure<00:04:31.090> that

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
first team player I'm pretty sure that

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.360 
first team player I'm pretty sure that
means<00:04:31.539> you<00:04:32.229> know<00:04:32.320> like<00:04:32.500> random<00:04:32.919> first<00:04:33.190> team

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
means you know like random first team

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.210 
means you know like random first team
action<00:04:33.970> but<00:04:34.270> I'm<00:04:34.330> not<00:04:34.419> sure<00:04:34.630> but<00:04:34.840> he<00:04:34.930> actually

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
action but I'm not sure but he actually

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.830 
action but I'm not sure but he actually
soo<00:04:36.220> so<00:04:36.460> then<00:04:36.669> declined<00:04:37.090> his<00:04:37.210> contract<00:04:37.690> I<00:04:37.720> was

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
soo so then declined his contract I was

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.680 
soo so then declined his contract I was
like<00:04:37.930> what<00:04:38.110> why<00:04:38.380> that's<00:04:38.740> a<00:04:38.970> bit<00:04:39.970> weird<00:04:40.509> isn't

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
like what why that's a bit weird isn't

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.260 
like what why that's a bit weird isn't
it<00:04:40.780> so<00:04:41.050> I<00:04:41.080> gave<00:04:41.710> him<00:04:41.949> an<00:04:42.340> important<00:04:42.940> first<00:04:43.120> team

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
it so I gave him an important first team

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.939 
it so I gave him an important first team
player<00:04:43.479> I<00:04:43.660> don't<00:04:44.110> think<00:04:44.259> he<00:04:44.320> was<00:04:44.410> happy<00:04:44.740> with

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949 
player I don't think he was happy with

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:47.310 
player I don't think he was happy with
being<00:04:45.220> a<00:04:45.430> future<00:04:46.150> so<00:04:46.449> he's<00:04:46.690> been<00:04:46.810> important

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
being a future so he's been important

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.600 
being a future so he's been important
because<00:04:47.560> it<00:04:47.680> actually<00:04:47.710> does<00:04:48.100> play<00:04:48.310> a<00:04:48.340> big<00:04:48.400> part

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
because it actually does play a big part

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.150 
because it actually does play a big part
in<00:04:48.940> my<00:04:49.150> plans<00:04:49.860> there's<00:04:50.860> a<00:04:50.889> pretty<00:04:51.100> decent

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270
