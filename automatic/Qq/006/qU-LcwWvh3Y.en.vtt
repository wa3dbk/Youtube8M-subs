00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.500
 hello friends of this activity today we are going 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:09.049
 to see a little bit of applied theory 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.119
 seventh chords let's suppress what 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:15.080
 which are the seventh and as an example 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:17.270
 let's take a mine if you know a little 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.350
 of sadistic music and seven notes of re my 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:24.020
 fa sol and 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.020
 if we take from the the we have 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:33.140
 my fa sun of the eight notes 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.350
 you counted on which is the seventh 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:41.010
 because the previous question which would 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:45.300
 in this case a sun then any 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.620
 the smaller one that has a sun in between 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.620
 is going to be a side in a seventh 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:57.219
 here we are letting this string sound 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.219
 to the air that as we all know 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:04.699
 all the minor with a sun there is going to be the 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.560
 seventh lower but the sun may be in 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:12.310
 other parts for example we put in the 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.310
 minor and this note here is also a sun 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.290
 we can even put it on the bass 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.570
 sound and a little different but the 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.060
 structure is the same one the least with 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.460
 a sun 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.170
 now that we already know this little 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.470
 theoretical question we can see the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.720
 real positions more used then in 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.509
 the case of elda and for all the chords 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.430
 with minors with tonic in the fifth 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.860
 we have this rope 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:46.620
 we have this 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.620
 we can also double the seventh 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.310
 then for cuts type my minor then what 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.890
 same in this case we are going to explain another 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.630
 of the theory with the minor we would have if 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:06.450
 we played the minor nor fa sustained sun the 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:10.200
 if not from the previous to the eighth to the 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.380
 seventh was then my youngest with a 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.380
 king 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.660
 in my seventh minor we can in this case 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.250
 also put the minor and this note before 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.960
 of the trust is a drive 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.670
 you do not have to learn the notes of everything 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.410
 the memory mast but there are times that 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.090
 with the practice you already get to know 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.780
 a few at least the most 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.780
 main 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.290
 then this position 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.240
 with the tonic here is very easily 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.720
 transportable that would be for example in 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.720
 king here 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.800
 Y 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:56.060
 and in the case of the min we have said or 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:58.220
 so let's put it in the would be like this 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.480
 supporting a little this to do pressure 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.190
 since the other finger is not there 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.700
 less pressure with your hand then we go 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.099
 to do so 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.790
 and if we want as we said that it 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.930
 I could put this one 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.930
 because we do so too 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.740
 what is the utility of the chords 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.350
 seventh minors since it has always been said 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:24.470
 a little bit that the major chords are the 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:27.770
 joy peace and minor chords the 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.000
 sadness, it's worth it, they take it away when 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.760
 the seventh takes away a bit of 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.710
 dramatism to minor chords no longer 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.930
 it's so pure minor there's a bit of 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.930
 hope in that I agreed something more 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:45.290
 and utilities then used used 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:48.130
 a lot of funky music for example a 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.130
 well-known song 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.990
 we're already doing a reset here and ma 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.880
 less 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.010
 with the very cool effect of playing first 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.580
 all and do 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.580
 no no 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.909
 and quite strum 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:17.010
 another very funky example is for this guy 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.930
 of chords when used here with the 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.709
 little finger here that would be like 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.709
 transport you're 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.400
 here on top of the seventh and 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.470
 with the sixth one that we are explaining 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.070
 but it is the previous note to the sixth and 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:42.030
 seventh 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:46.790
 so I hope you use many more 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.790
 in the seventh heaven of funk and see you
