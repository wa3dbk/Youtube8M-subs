for about 4 years now I think and it is
now<00:00:23.430> starting<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.180> give<00:00:25.050> way<00:00:25.230> on<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.500> bottom

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.429 
for me it is actually quite annoying to
wear<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:56.909> crossbody<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.810> if<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.110> back<00:01:58.259> up<00:01:58.409> a

wear this crossbody so if I back up a

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.260 
wear this crossbody so if I back up a
bit

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
bit

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.850 
bit
it's<00:02:00.270> just<00:02:00.570> it's<00:02:00.869> just<00:02:00.960> too<00:02:01.140> high<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.530> just

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
it's just it's just too high it just

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.109 
it's just it's just too high it just
looks<00:02:02.040> really<00:02:02.100> stupid<00:02:02.600> so<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.780> do<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:05.119> would

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
looks really stupid so I do I would

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.999 
looks really stupid so I do I would
worry<00:02:06.329> like<00:02:06.540> this<00:02:06.570> but<00:02:07.380> you've<00:02:07.500> also<00:02:07.649> got<00:02:07.799> the

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
worry like this but you've also got the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.100 
worry like this but you've also got the
option<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.520> taking<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.330> straps<00:02:09.629> off<00:02:09.840> and

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
option of taking the straps off and

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.110 
option of taking the straps off and
maybe<00:02:10.200> if<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.530> go<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.739> work<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.430> then<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:11.940> go

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
maybe if you go to work and then you go

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.920 
maybe if you go to work and then you go
straight<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.480> dinner

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
straight to dinner

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.300 
straight to dinner
you<00:02:13.290> could<00:02:13.439> turn<00:02:13.560> straps<00:02:13.859> off<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.040> use<00:02:14.189> it

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
you could turn straps off and use it

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.520 
you could turn straps off and use it
like<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.430> so<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.239> main<00:02:15.480> difference<00:02:15.510> is<00:02:16.230> is

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
like that so the main difference is is

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.649 
like that so the main difference is is
that<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:17.430> lever<00:02:17.849> is<00:02:18.239> coated<00:02:19.790> on<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.849> straps

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
that the lever is coated on the straps

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.970 
that the lever is coated on the straps
there<00:02:22.849> and<00:02:23.849> it<00:02:24.000> is<00:02:24.120> leather

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
there and it is leather

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.009 
there and it is leather
it's<00:02:25.980> cowhide<00:02:26.459> but<00:02:27.000> it's<00:02:27.120> coated<00:02:27.629> and<00:02:27.840> it's

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
it's cowhide but it's coated and it's

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.649 
it's cowhide but it's coated and it's
almost<00:02:28.439> like<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.769> plastic<00:02:29.189> II<00:02:29.370> kind<00:02:30.299> of<00:02:30.389> feel<00:02:30.450> to

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
almost like a plastic II kind of feel to

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.559 
almost like a plastic II kind of feel to

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
that the hardware is the silver color

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.170 
that the hardware is the silver color
rather<00:02:33.870> than<00:02:34.079> the<00:02:34.139> brass<00:02:34.349> color<00:02:35.000> which<00:02:36.000> I

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:58.069 
like a safe and water at the moment but
I<00:03:57.000> know<00:03:57.090> what<00:03:57.329> she's<00:03:57.449> done<00:03:57.569> to<00:03:57.750> it<00:03:57.840> so<00:03:57.959> I'm<00:03:58.049> a

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
I know what she's done to it so I'm a

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.559 
I know what she's done to it so I'm a
bit<00:03:58.370> this<00:03:59.370> bag<00:03:59.609> this<00:04:00.000> would<00:04:00.150> be<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.389> only

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
bit this bag this would be the only

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.789 
bit this bag this would be the only
comparison<00:04:01.349> that<00:04:01.530> I<00:04:02.400> have<00:04:02.849> and<00:04:03.299> it<00:04:03.989> is<00:04:04.139> shorter

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
comparison that I have and it is shorter

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.849 
comparison that I have and it is shorter
in<00:04:05.310> length<00:04:05.370> but<00:04:06.329> I<00:04:06.389> feel<00:04:06.810> because<00:04:07.530> of<00:04:07.739> the

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
in length but I feel because of the

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.770 
in length but I feel because of the
straps<00:04:08.280> with<00:04:08.699> the<00:04:08.790> over<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.359> over<00:04:09.389> the

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
shoulder one it actually probably holds

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.580 
shoulder one it actually probably holds
the<00:04:11.370> same<00:04:11.609> the<00:04:12.239> only<00:04:12.509> thing<00:04:12.659> is<00:04:12.810> that<00:04:12.840> I<00:04:13.049> put<00:04:13.439> a

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
glue on here but I'm sure that all dry

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:19.839 
glue on here but I'm sure that all dry
up<00:05:18.409> and<00:05:18.620> come<00:05:19.129> off<00:05:19.250> I<00:05:19.400> just<00:05:19.430> don't<00:05:19.669> want<00:05:19.789> to

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
up and come off I just don't want to

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:20.830 
up and come off I just don't want to
scratch<00:05:20.030> it<00:05:20.210> off<00:05:20.300> because<00:05:20.389> I<00:05:20.509> don't<00:05:20.629> want<00:05:20.780> to

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
scratch it off because I don't want to

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.170 
scratch it off because I don't want to
scratch<00:05:20.990> the<00:05:21.169> hard<00:05:21.349> way<00:05:21.560> so<00:05:22.250> the<00:05:22.639> NiO<00:05:22.849> is<00:05:23.150> a

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
scratch the hard way so the NiO is a

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.540 
scratch the hard way so the NiO is a
little<00:05:23.539> bit<00:05:23.659> more<00:05:23.810> expensive<00:05:24.199> than<00:05:24.560> the

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
little bit more expensive than the

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.689 
little bit more expensive than the
regular<00:05:25.940> lip<00:05:26.120> liege<00:05:26.509> I<00:05:27.409> think<00:05:27.919> Cleo's<00:05:28.460> when<00:05:28.639> I

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:28.699 
regular lip liege I think Cleo's when I

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:31.330 
regular lip liege I think Cleo's when I
bought<00:05:28.880> it<00:05:28.909> was<00:05:29.240> about<00:05:29.419> 60<00:05:29.930> euros<00:05:30.440> I<00:05:30.770> think

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
bought it was about 60 euros I think

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.999 
bought it was about 60 euros I think
they're<00:05:31.490> about<00:05:31.699> 65<00:05:32.330> pounds<00:05:32.630> now<00:05:33.110> and<00:05:33.650> this<00:05:33.830> was

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:34.009 
they're about 65 pounds now and this was

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:35.439 
they're about 65 pounds now and this was
