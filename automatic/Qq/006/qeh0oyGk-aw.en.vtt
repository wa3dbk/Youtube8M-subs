00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.610 
two kicks those two heavy kicks kill the
frames<00:02:14.690> so<00:02:15.690> we<00:02:15.810> see<00:02:15.930> some<00:02:16.140> spacing<00:02:16.470> in<00:02:16.530> the

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
frames so we see some spacing in the

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.949 
frames so we see some spacing in the
middle<00:02:16.770> here<00:02:16.910> we're<00:02:17.910> looking<00:02:17.940> broadly<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.720> see

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
middle here we're looking broadly to see

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.619 
middle here we're looking broadly to see
I<00:02:19.200> guess<00:02:19.470> hit<00:02:19.650> him<00:02:19.739> with<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.920> head<00:02:20.160> Wow<00:02:20.629> weeds

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
I guess hit him with a head Wow weeds

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.710 
I guess hit him with a head Wow weeds
the<00:02:22.290> UM<00:02:22.879> you<00:02:23.879> don't<00:02:24.030> even<00:02:24.090> need<00:02:24.270> to<00:02:24.390> read<00:02:24.599> it

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
the UM you don't even need to read it

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.150 
the UM you don't even need to read it
you<00:02:24.810> could<00:02:24.930> just<00:02:25.050> you<00:02:25.319> know<00:02:25.410> no<00:02:25.590> actually<00:02:25.950> the

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
you could just you know no actually the

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.130 
you could just you know no actually the
first<00:02:26.430> active<00:02:26.790> frames<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.450> exo<00:02:27.870> der<00:02:27.930> is

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
first active frames of the exo der is

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.720 
first active frames of the exo der is
not<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.440> fireball<00:02:28.890> invincible<00:02:29.370> so<00:02:29.520> it's<00:02:29.640> not

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
not a fireball invincible so it's not

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.160 
not a fireball invincible so it's not
like<00:02:29.879> each<00:02:30.000> screen<00:02:30.330> hand<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:30.660> you<00:02:30.720> can<00:02:30.870> do<00:02:31.050> it

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
like each screen hand that you can do it

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.869 
like each screen hand that you can do it
right<00:02:31.470> upon<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.370> had<00:02:32.519> to<00:02:32.580> do<00:02:32.670> it<00:02:32.760> really

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
right upon you had to do it really

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.250 
right upon you had to do it really
quickly<00:02:33.150> because<00:02:33.360> your<00:02:33.599> first<00:02:33.780> active<00:02:34.080> frames

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
quickly because your first active frames

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.910 
quickly because your first active frames
are<00:02:34.980> not<00:02:35.160> fireball<00:02:35.879> invincible<00:02:36.470> so<00:02:37.470> I<00:02:37.769> guess

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
are not fireball invincible so I guess

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.580 
are not fireball invincible so I guess
the<00:02:38.069> range<00:02:38.280> is<00:02:38.550> better<00:02:39.330> for<00:02:39.750> is<00:02:40.170> better<00:02:40.379> than

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
the range is better for is better than

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.619 
the range is better for is better than
the<00:02:40.739> extreme<00:02:41.160> hand<00:02:41.340> of<00:02:41.489> zangi<00:02:41.819> but<00:02:42.150> doesn't

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
the extreme hand of zangi but doesn't

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.240 
the extreme hand of zangi but doesn't
have<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.810> completing<00:02:43.170> disability<00:02:43.590> or<00:02:43.950> as<00:02:44.099> oh

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
have the completing disability or as oh

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.270 
have the completing disability or as oh
he<00:02:44.400> misses<00:02:44.670> his<00:02:44.730> combo<00:02:45.800> let's<00:02:46.800> groove<00:02:46.950> on<00:02:47.099> for

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
he misses his combo let's groove on for

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.390 
he misses his combo let's groove on for

meter<00:04:16.329> like<00:04:17.169> the<00:04:17.289> Energizer<00:04:17.829> Bunny<00:04:18.070> life<00:04:18.280> he's

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:18.909 
meter like the Energizer Bunny life he's

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:20.520 
meter like the Energizer Bunny life he's
about<00:04:19.090> against<00:04:19.359> gay<00:04:19.479> an<00:04:19.539> agent<00:04:19.870> anyways<00:04:20.229> yeah

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
about against gay an agent anyways yeah

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:21.569 
about against gay an agent anyways yeah
there's<00:04:20.739> like<00:04:20.829> the<00:04:20.919> next<00:04:21.159> hit<00:04:21.280> is<00:04:21.310> going<00:04:21.430> to

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
there's like the next hit is going to

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.060 
there's like the next hit is going to
begin<00:04:21.699> agian<00:04:21.909> so<00:04:22.360> look<00:04:23.259> at<00:04:23.349> that<00:04:23.470> it<00:04:23.680> probably

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
begin agian so look at that it probably

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.950 
begin agian so look at that it probably
does<00:04:24.340> not<00:04:24.490> play<00:04:24.849> with<00:04:25.180> incredible<00:04:25.630> patience

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
does not play with incredible patience

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.420 
does not play with incredible patience
and<00:04:26.139> good<00:04:26.259> defense<00:04:26.530> he's<00:04:26.710> going<00:04:26.949> to<00:04:27.009> get<00:04:27.130> lit

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
and good defense he's going to get lit

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.879 
and good defense he's going to get lit
up<00:04:27.460> but<00:04:28.000> I<00:04:28.060> think<00:04:28.240> Oh<00:04:28.449> think<00:04:28.960> I<00:04:29.139> go<00:04:29.320> mice<00:04:29.500> he's

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
up but I think Oh think I go mice he's

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:31.080 
up but I think Oh think I go mice he's
probably<00:04:30.070> save<00:04:30.400> it<00:04:30.490> for<00:04:30.610> the<00:04:30.639> next<00:04:30.699> scooter

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
probably save it for the next scooter

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.439 
probably save it for the next scooter
yeah<00:04:32.550> there's<00:04:33.550> a<00:04:33.639> object<00:04:33.789> yeah<00:04:34.150> that<00:04:34.330> is

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
yeah there's a object yeah that is

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:35.969 
yeah there's a object yeah that is
pretty<00:04:34.810> much<00:04:34.960> like<00:04:35.050> a<00:04:35.169> knob<00:04:35.320> to<00:04:35.500> select<00:04:35.650> in<00:04:35.919> the

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
pretty much like a knob to select in the

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:37.020 
pretty much like a knob to select in the
corner<00:04:36.250> that's<00:04:36.460> where<00:04:36.580> you<00:04:36.639> want<00:04:36.789> to<00:04:36.820> put<00:04:36.940> your

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
corner that's where you want to put your

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.390 
corner that's where you want to put your
opponent's<00:04:37.419> because<00:04:37.659> any<00:04:37.930> attempt<00:04:38.919> to<00:04:39.009> run

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
opponent's because any attempt to run

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.129 
opponent's because any attempt to run
away<00:04:39.610> it's<00:04:40.360> going<00:04:40.479> to<00:04:40.509> be<00:04:40.599> met<00:04:40.720> with<00:04:40.840> up<00:04:40.930> kicks

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
away it's going to be met with up kicks

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:42.510 
away it's going to be met with up kicks
and<00:04:41.320> the<00:04:41.380> reason<00:04:41.590> why<00:04:41.680> people<00:04:41.860> are<00:04:42.070> so<00:04:42.190> jumping

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
and the reason why people are so jumping

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.589 
and the reason why people are so jumping
in<00:04:42.639> the<00:04:42.729> corner<00:04:42.970> against<00:04:43.150> units<00:04:43.449> because

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:43.599 
in the corner against units because

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:45.240 
in the corner against units because
they're<00:04:43.810> really<00:04:44.020> afraid<00:04:44.470> of<00:04:44.650> the<00:04:44.800> command

his sleeve to get the hard knockdown

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.250 
his sleeve to get the hard knockdown
oftenly<00:05:36.889> and<00:05:37.490> maybe<00:05:37.669> like<00:05:38.000> whatever<00:05:38.300> trendy

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
oftenly and maybe like whatever trendy

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.409 
oftenly and maybe like whatever trendy
does<00:05:39.440> such<00:05:40.100> as<00:05:40.250> ax<00:05:40.580> pinning<00:05:40.880> bird<00:05:41.030> kick<00:05:41.210> like

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
does such as ax pinning bird kick like

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:42.790 
does such as ax pinning bird kick like
he<00:05:41.570> has<00:05:41.720> some<00:05:41.900> setup<00:05:42.139> that'll<00:05:42.320> be<00:05:42.410> all<00:05:42.530> of<00:05:42.650> it<00:05:42.770> I

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
he has some setup that'll be all of it I

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.960 
he has some setup that'll be all of it I
think<00:05:42.919> that<00:05:43.220> would<00:05:43.280> be<00:05:43.340> a<00:05:43.430> good<00:05:43.580> reasons<00:05:43.880> why

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
think that would be a good reasons why

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.240 
think that would be a good reasons why
