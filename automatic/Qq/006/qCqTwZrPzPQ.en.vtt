00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.030
 which you have to put yourself on 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:22.820
 Of course at the beginning of the year, but it is absolutely not 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:26.150
 fundamentally if you put and 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:29.990
 in the midst of entering these goals that is there even 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:32.750
 You can write specifically the terms, that is, here 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:37.400
 before such a number i have this 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:39.670
 let's go somewhere else you can 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.700

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.740
 categories include that is so you 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:48.450
 wanted to 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:53.590

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.300
 if you turned it into a plant you already 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:22.450
 trying to do at least something 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.700
