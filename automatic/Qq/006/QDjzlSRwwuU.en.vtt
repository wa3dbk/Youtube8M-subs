00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.890 
blasted so you stand in here and you
attract<00:03:19.040> all<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:19.250> mobs<00:03:19.669> whatnot<00:03:20.660> and<00:03:20.810> they

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
attract all the mobs whatnot and they

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.690 
attract all the mobs whatnot and they
fall<00:03:21.139> down<00:03:21.290> in<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.560> hole<00:03:21.709> here<00:03:23.169> then<00:03:24.700> come

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
fall down in the hole here then come

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.500 
fall down in the hole here then come
through<00:03:27.700> make<00:03:28.700> sure<00:03:28.730> all<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.120> doors<00:03:29.150> are

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
through make sure all the doors are

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.570 
through make sure all the doors are
closed

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:44.820 

okay<00:03:37.860> switch<00:03:40.950> and<00:03:41.950> then<00:03:42.069> you<00:03:42.190> drown<00:03:42.459> them<00:03:43.830> it's

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
okay switch and then you drown them it's

00:03:44.830 --> 00:04:00.060 
okay switch and then you drown them it's
basically<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.459> concept<00:03:58.020> so<00:03:59.020> you<00:03:59.530> just<00:03:59.709> go<00:03:59.950> up

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
basically the concept so you just go up

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.150 
basically the concept so you just go up
here<00:04:00.250> and<00:04:00.340> check<00:04:00.430> it<00:04:00.640> out<00:04:01.890> see<00:04:02.890> what<00:04:02.920> we've<00:04:03.130> got

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
here and check it out see what we've got

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.690 
here and check it out see what we've got
here<00:04:07.860> actually<00:04:08.860> couldn't<00:04:09.250> believe<00:04:09.430> it<00:04:09.550> worked

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
here actually couldn't believe it worked

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.050 
here actually couldn't believe it worked
i<00:04:09.910> just<00:04:10.120> started<00:04:10.390> building<00:04:10.750> in<00:04:10.900> and

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
i just started building in and

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.699 
i just started building in and
everything<00:04:13.060> just<00:04:13.090> started<00:04:13.450> to<00:04:13.540> work<00:04:13.720> out<00:04:13.900> so

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
everything just started to work out so

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.940 
everything just started to work out so
here's<00:04:14.860> the<00:04:14.980> top<00:04:15.160> level<00:04:16.320> or<00:04:17.320> the<00:04:17.350> middle<00:04:17.769> and

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
here's the top level or the middle and

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.200 
here's the top level or the middle and
then<00:04:20.040> here<00:04:21.040> are<00:04:21.160> the<00:04:21.250> sides<00:04:21.549> you<00:04:21.820> can<00:04:21.910> see<00:04:22.120> the

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
then here are the sides you can see the

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.120 
then here are the sides you can see the
sides<00:04:22.450> from<00:04:22.600> here<00:04:22.840> let's<00:04:23.620> just<00:04:25.950> there<00:04:26.950> are<00:04:27.040> the

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
sides from here let's just there are the

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.800 
sides from here let's just there are the
sides<00:04:27.370> and<00:04:28.200> it<00:04:29.200> all<00:04:29.350> operates<00:04:30.250> under<00:04:30.810> that

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
sides and it all operates under that

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.710 
sides and it all operates under that
