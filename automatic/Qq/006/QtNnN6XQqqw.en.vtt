in<00:00:01.650> this<00:00:01.890> tutorial<00:00:02.330> I'm<00:00:03.330> going<00:00:03.720> to<00:00:03.870> show<00:00:04.020> you

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
in this tutorial I'm going to show you

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.990 
in this tutorial I'm going to show you
how<00:00:05.100> to<00:00:05.160> do<00:00:05.490> a<00:00:05.790> 2x2<00:00:06.779> Rubik's<00:00:07.470> Cube<00:00:07.799> stand<00:00:08.160> with

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
how to do a 2x2 Rubik's Cube stand with

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.490 
how to do a 2x2 Rubik's Cube stand with
the<00:00:09.210> Rubik's<00:00:09.570> twist<00:00:11.780> now<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.840> reason<00:00:13.320> why<00:00:13.440> I

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
the Rubik's twist now the reason why I

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.029 
the Rubik's twist now the reason why I
called<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.160> 2x2<00:00:14.759> Rubik's<00:00:15.360> Cube<00:00:15.660> stand<00:00:16.039> is

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
called it a 2x2 Rubik's Cube stand is

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.080 
called it a 2x2 Rubik's Cube stand is
because<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.940> 3x3<00:00:18.420> might<00:00:19.380> be<00:00:19.590> too<00:00:19.800> heavy<00:00:20.090> for

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
because the 3x3 might be too heavy for

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.439 
because the 3x3 might be too heavy for
the<00:00:21.270> twist<00:00:22.220> so<00:00:23.220> for<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:23.580> reason<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:24.119> recommend

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
the twist so for that reason I recommend

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.620 
the twist so for that reason I recommend
that<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.410> use<00:00:25.439> this<00:00:25.949> stand<00:00:26.279> for<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:27.180> 2x2

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
that you use this stand for the 2x2

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.630 
that you use this stand for the 2x2
Rubik's<00:00:28.289> Cube<00:00:28.590> only<00:00:31.040> now<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.130> start<00:00:32.550> making

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
Rubik's Cube only now to start making

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.500 
Rubik's Cube only now to start making
the<00:00:33.059> stand<00:00:33.440> you<00:00:34.440> want<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.860> have<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.579> blue<00:00:35.880> side

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
the stand you want to have the blue side

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.180 
the stand you want to have the blue side
of<00:00:37.309> the<00:00:38.309> Rubik's<00:00:38.700> twist<00:00:39.079> facing<00:00:40.079> up<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.469> the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
of the Rubik's twist facing up and the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.529 
of the Rubik's twist facing up and the
white<00:00:41.399> side<00:00:41.640> facing<00:00:42.149> down<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:44.360> then<00:00:45.360> you

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
white side facing down and then you

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.840 
white side facing down and then you
start<00:00:45.809> counting<00:00:46.289> blue<00:00:46.590> triangles<00:00:47.100> starting

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
start counting blue triangles starting

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.670 
start counting blue triangles starting
from<00:00:48.090> here<00:00:50.120> until<00:00:52.219> you<00:00:53.219> get<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.670> fifth<00:00:53.910> one

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
from here until you get to the fifth one

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.700 
from here until you get to the fifth one
so<00:00:55.680> once<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.190> locate<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.850> fifth<00:00:57.090> one<00:00:57.710> the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
so once you locate the fifth one the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.260 
so once you locate the fifth one the
fifth<00:00:58.949> blue<00:00:59.250> triangle<00:00:59.899> you<00:01:00.899> want<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.260> turn<00:01:01.559> it

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
fifth blue triangle you want to turn it

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.870 
fifth blue triangle you want to turn it
downward

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.160 

and<00:01:08.970> then<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.960> want<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.290> know<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:11.479> blue<00:01:12.479> five

this down so so they match and then

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.140 
this down so so they match and then
we're<00:03:23.480> gonna<00:03:23.600> overlap<00:03:24.170> this<00:03:24.530> part<00:03:24.880> with<00:03:25.880> this

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
we're gonna overlap this part with this

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:33.660 
we're gonna overlap this part with this
right<00:03:26.780> here<00:03:28.510> so<00:03:29.510> you<00:03:29.630> turn<00:03:29.900> this<00:03:30.700> 180<00:03:31.700> degrees

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
right here so you turn this 180 degrees

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.620 
right here so you turn this 180 degrees
and<00:03:34.670> you<00:03:35.030> close<00:03:35.330> it<00:03:35.480> up<00:03:35.540> like<00:03:35.600> that<00:03:35.810> so<00:03:37.630> now
