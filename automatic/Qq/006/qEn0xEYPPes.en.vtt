 but today I am going to tell something that my friends in my community told me that 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.090
 On Thursday, July 1, 2010, they gave chapter 167 of Naruto Shippuden. 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.270
 my favorite anime series but as a us being favorite or emanuel 666 went to 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.440
 give a news that the naruto fight that obvious bsp dyn was going to be 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.680
 animated with the animators of the fight of naruto vs sasuke of the first 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.609
 season 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:22.649
 roll 

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:26.629
 that is, I would experience seeing those traumatic brain and back drawings 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.650
 then I started watching the anime and I can not believe that my eyes saw their 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.039
 animation was one of the worst 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:36.819
 these entertainers were terrible 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.819
 Here is a review of this animation 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.650
 it was quite horrible but his 6-tailed transformation was very 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.650
 good that is when the skeleton began to form 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:53.169
 when Penco arrives on the floor it seems that Naruto disfigured his face when 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:55.589
 nailed in the stones 

00:02:55.589 --> 00:03:00.149
 When Penn walks in the water his legs turn as Sonic Slash 4 does not 

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:04.849
 I knew what would fly 5 think that shit animation 6 much stuffed or 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.059
 is very useless but of all this we could all see my killed to appear 

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:10.359
 send a bull 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.359
 well this is the end of this chapter 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.579
