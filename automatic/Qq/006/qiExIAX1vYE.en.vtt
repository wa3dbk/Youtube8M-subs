picture of my dog I printed it out on
scrap<00:00:18.350> paper<00:00:18.740> because<00:00:19.220> the<00:00:19.250> picture<00:00:19.610> isn't

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
scrap paper because the picture isn't

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.330 
scrap paper because the picture isn't
what's<00:00:20.119> important<00:00:20.690> what's<00:00:21.470> important<00:00:21.980> is

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
what's important what's important is

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.630 
what's important what's important is
that<00:00:23.770> when<00:00:24.770> you<00:00:24.890> got<00:00:25.039> to<00:00:25.220> make<00:00:25.369> something

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
that when you got to make something

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.730 
that when you got to make something
that's<00:00:25.910> a<00:00:26.000> sculpture<00:00:26.570> and<00:00:26.930> even<00:00:27.619> though<00:00:27.710> you

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
that's a sculpture and even though you

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.710 
that's a sculpture and even though you
have<00:00:27.920> a<00:00:27.949> picture<00:00:28.190> of<00:00:28.340> it<00:00:28.520> in<00:00:28.609> your<00:00:28.760> head<00:00:28.970> it's

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
have a picture of it in your head it's

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.670 
have a picture of it in your head it's
harder<00:00:30.500> to<00:00:30.770> work<00:00:31.220> from<00:00:31.550> memory<00:00:32.029> so<00:00:32.750> I<00:00:33.109> broke

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
harder to work from memory so I broke

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.669 
harder to work from memory so I broke
this<00:00:33.829> down<00:00:34.010> into<00:00:34.399> elementary<00:00:34.969> shapes<00:00:35.600> so<00:00:36.530> that

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:36.679 
this down into elementary shapes so that

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:39.669 
this down into elementary shapes so that
we<00:00:36.859> can<00:00:37.069> make<00:00:37.609> our<00:00:37.879> little<00:00:38.179> dog<00:00:38.329> angel<00:00:38.899> from

00:00:39.669 --> 00:00:39.679

thicker and I want to bring this down to

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.340 
thicker and I want to bring this down to
an<00:01:05.720> offset<00:01:06.680> point<00:01:07.190> like<00:01:07.970> that<00:01:08.210> I'm<00:01:09.080> going<00:01:09.290> to

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
an offset point like that I'm going to

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.570 
an offset point like that I'm going to
flatten<00:01:09.620> this<00:01:09.860> and<00:01:10.070> pull<00:01:10.250> it<00:01:10.280> out<00:01:10.400> because

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
flatten this and pull it out because

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.350 
flatten this and pull it out because
that<00:01:10.850> will<00:01:10.970> go<00:01:11.210> on<00:01:11.480> the<00:01:11.620> back<00:01:12.620> of<00:01:12.890> the<00:01:13.190> dog<00:01:13.400> now

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
that will go on the back of the dog now

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.560 
that will go on the back of the dog now
let's<00:01:14.690> make<00:01:14.900> some<00:01:15.200> lines<00:01:15.940> with<00:01:16.940> a<00:01:16.970> needle<00:01:17.210> tool

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
let's make some lines with a needle tool

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.310 
let's make some lines with a needle tool
or<00:01:18.020> a<00:01:18.970> toothpick<00:01:19.970> or<00:01:20.600> whatever<00:01:20.900> you<00:01:21.020> happen<00:01:21.170> to

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
or a toothpick or whatever you happen to

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.220 
or a toothpick or whatever you happen to
have<00:01:22.990> I'm<00:01:23.990> gonna<00:01:24.200> lay<00:01:24.470> it<00:01:24.590> in<00:01:25.540> and<00:01:26.540> roll<00:01:26.930> it

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.230 
have I'm gonna lay it in and roll it

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.980 
have I'm gonna lay it in and roll it
over<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:27.530> edge<00:01:28.270> it<00:01:29.270> doesn't<00:01:29.690> have<00:01:29.810> to<00:01:29.960> be

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
over the edge it doesn't have to be

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.930 
over the edge it doesn't have to be
perfect<00:01:30.500> it<00:01:31.250> just<00:01:31.520> needs<00:01:31.670> to<00:01:31.730> be<00:01:31.820> recognizable

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
perfect it just needs to be recognizable

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.480 
perfect it just needs to be recognizable
so<00:01:34.940> there's<00:01:35.180> one<00:01:35.800> I've<00:01:36.800> broken<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.310> black

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
so there's one I've broken the black

so there's one I've broken the black
clay<00:01:37.760> down<00:01:38.090> into<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:38.780> shapes<00:01:39.050> that<00:01:39.170> I'll<00:01:39.380> need

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
clay down into the shapes that I'll need

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.400 
clay down into the shapes that I'll need
this<00:01:40.490> is<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.850> main<00:01:41.060> body<00:01:41.360> which<00:01:41.780> is<00:01:41.810> kind<00:01:42.140> of<00:01:42.200> a

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
this is the main body which is kind of a

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.970 
this is the main body which is kind of a
bottle<00:01:42.860> shape<00:01:44.050> the<00:01:45.050> two<00:01:45.350> little<00:01:45.590> back<00:01:46.460> legs

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:47.980 
bottle shape the two little back legs

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.950 
bottle shape the two little back legs
which<00:01:48.980> will<00:01:49.220> just<00:01:49.460> fit<00:01:50.000> onto<00:01:50.210> the<00:01:50.480> sides<00:01:50.720> like

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
which will just fit onto the sides like

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.040 
which will just fit onto the sides like
that

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.980 

let's<00:01:56.980> make<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.580> head<00:01:58.050> oops<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:01.000> that<00:02:01.900> is

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
let's make the head oops and that is

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.270 
let's make the head oops and that is
going<00:02:02.200> to<00:02:02.260> be<00:02:02.440> a<00:02:02.760> little<00:02:03.760> bit<00:02:04.890> flatter<00:02:05.890> on<00:02:06.130> the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
going to be a little bit flatter on the

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.010 
going to be a little bit flatter on the
back<00:02:06.460> than<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.730> front<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:09.660> it's<00:02:10.660> got<00:02:10.840> that

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
back than the front and it's got that

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.980 
back than the front and it's got that
cute<00:02:11.680> little<00:02:12.780> nose<00:02:13.780> shape<00:02:15.390> that<00:02:16.390> will<00:02:16.540> add<00:02:16.720> on

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
cute little nose shape that will add on

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.220 
cute little nose shape that will add on
to<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.260> front<00:02:17.530> and<00:02:17.710> of<00:02:18.280> course<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:19.690> nose<00:02:19.930> goes

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
to the front and of course the nose goes

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.790 
to the front and of course the nose goes
on<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.530> top<00:02:20.560> of<00:02:20.740> the<00:02:21.100> Hat<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:23.760> ears<00:02:24.760> are<00:02:25.180> just

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
on the top of the Hat the ears are just

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.010 
on the top of the Hat the ears are just
triangles<00:02:27.600> so<00:02:28.600> they'll<00:02:28.840> fit<00:02:30.450> at<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.690> top<00:02:31.990> of

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
triangles so they'll fit at the top of

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.990 
triangles so they'll fit at the top of
the<00:02:32.380> head<00:02:32.560> toward<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.220> back<00:02:35.550> now<00:02:36.550> let's<00:02:36.790> move

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
the head toward the back now let's move

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.430 
the head toward the back now let's move
the<00:02:37.240> head<00:02:37.390> down<00:02:37.630> to<00:02:37.780> here<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.970> then<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:44.200> front

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
the head down to here and then the front

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.820 
the head down to here and then the front
legs<00:02:44.770> go<00:02:45.670> from<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:48.250> shoulders<00:02:48.760> down<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:50.560> the

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
legs go from the shoulders down to the

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.490 
legs go from the shoulders down to the
front<00:02:51.070> but<00:02:51.340> we<00:02:51.490> will<00:02:51.700> smooth<00:02:52.030> those<00:02:52.390> in<00:02:52.840> we

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
front but we will smooth those in we

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.740 
front but we will smooth those in we
don't<00:02:53.740> need<00:02:53.920> to<00:02:54.040> see<00:02:54.370> them<00:02:55.150> on<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.570> top<00:02:55.810> so<00:02:56.260> we

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
don't need to see them on the top so we

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.630 
don't need to see them on the top so we
can<00:02:58.750> smooth<00:02:59.290> that<00:02:59.620> let's<00:02:59.920> move<00:03:00.070> ahead<00:03:00.280> back<00:03:00.610> a

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
can smooth that let's move ahead back a

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.630 
can smooth that let's move ahead back a
little<00:03:00.880> bit<00:03:04.650> you<00:03:05.650> can<00:03:05.800> use<00:03:05.950> anything<00:03:06.340> at<00:03:06.550> all

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
little bit you can use anything at all

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.940 
little bit you can use anything at all
that's<00:03:06.880> smooth<00:03:07.330> to<00:03:08.080> make<00:03:08.260> this<00:03:08.440> happen<00:03:08.680> and

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
that's smooth to make this happen and

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.320 
that's smooth to make this happen and
attach<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.220> head<00:03:12.370> unlike<00:03:12.670> that<00:03:12.910> now<00:03:13.150> of

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
attach the head unlike that now of

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:22.510 
attach the head unlike that now of
course<00:03:13.510> you<00:03:13.660> can<00:03:13.810> also<00:03:13.989> do<00:03:15.390> pause

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
angel are gonna be big I like to use the

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.620 
angel are gonna be big I like to use the
back<00:03:28.250> of<00:03:28.400> my<00:03:28.430> meat<00:03:28.790> needle<00:03:29.390> tool<00:03:31.420> you<00:03:32.420> don't

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
back of my meat needle tool you don't

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.180 
back of my meat needle tool you don't
have<00:03:32.780> to<00:03:32.900> do<00:03:33.050> this<00:03:33.200> you<00:03:33.260> could<00:03:33.470> certainly<00:03:33.770> do

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
have to do this you could certainly do

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:40.360 
have to do this you could certainly do
smaller<00:03:34.940> eyes<00:03:38.380> and<00:03:39.380> I'll<00:03:39.650> probably<00:03:39.890> end<00:03:40.250> up

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
smaller eyes and I'll probably end up

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.660 
smaller eyes and I'll probably end up
putting<00:03:40.580> little<00:03:40.820> jewels<00:03:41.180> in<00:03:41.450> there<00:03:41.660> now<00:03:42.670> let's

put it together I've got a three and a
half<00:03:47.690> inch<00:03:47.960> piece<00:03:48.290> of<00:03:48.670> wire<00:03:49.670> it's<00:03:50.000> 20<00:03:50.420> gauge

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
half inch piece of wire it's 20 gauge

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.720 
half inch piece of wire it's 20 gauge
and<00:03:51.370> I<00:03:52.370> want<00:03:52.970> to<00:03:53.120> make<00:03:53.330> a<00:03:53.510> halo<00:03:54.250> so<00:03:55.250> let's<00:03:55.520> say

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
and I want to make a halo so let's say

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:02.520 
and I want to make a halo so let's say
I'm<00:03:55.940> going<00:03:56.150> to<00:03:56.210> fold<00:03:56.540> it<00:03:57.460> this<00:03:58.460> way<00:04:01.060> I'm

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
I'm going to fold it this way I'm

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.420 
I'm going to fold it this way I'm
foreshortening<00:04:03.530> it<00:04:03.740> so<00:04:03.920> it's<00:04:04.040> going<00:04:04.160> to<00:04:04.220> be<00:04:04.340> an

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
foreshortening it so it's going to be an

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:15.790 
foreshortening it so it's going to be an
oval<00:04:05.260> let's<00:04:06.260> fold<00:04:06.800> it<00:04:07.130> back<00:04:07.910> over<00:04:14.440> and<00:04:15.440> that's

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
oval let's fold it back over and that's

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.130 
oval let's fold it back over and that's
a<00:04:16.010> little<00:04:16.610> wider<00:04:16.880> than<00:04:17.060> I<00:04:17.270> want<00:04:17.480> it<00:04:17.540> to<00:04:17.630> be<00:04:17.720> so

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
a little wider than I want it to be so

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:26.070 
a little wider than I want it to be so
I'm<00:04:18.410> just<00:04:18.799> going<00:04:19.190> to<00:04:22.270> pull<00:04:23.270> it<00:04:23.300> back<00:04:23.690> like<00:04:23.720> that

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
I'm just going to pull it back like that

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.170 
I'm just going to pull it back like that
yep<00:04:27.080> that's<00:04:27.410> about<00:04:27.560> how<00:04:27.830> I<00:04:27.860> want<00:04:28.130> it<00:04:28.190> to<00:04:28.250> be<00:04:28.370> now

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
yep that's about how I want it to be now

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.390 
yep that's about how I want it to be now
in<00:04:29.420> the<00:04:29.510> center<00:04:29.780> of<00:04:29.810> that<00:04:30.110> you<00:04:30.590> will<00:04:30.800> fold<00:04:31.130> the

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
in the center of that you will fold the

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.680 
in the center of that you will fold the
wire<00:04:31.610> down<00:04:33.010> like<00:04:34.010> that<00:04:34.520> and<00:04:34.790> then<00:04:35.210> you'll<00:04:35.420> take

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
wire down like that and then you'll take

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.990 
wire down like that and then you'll take
what's<00:04:35.900> left<00:04:36.110> over<00:04:36.290> here<00:04:36.800> this<00:04:37.130> tail<00:04:37.460> and<00:04:37.730> wrap

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
what's left over here this tail and wrap

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.870 
what's left over here this tail and wrap
it<00:04:38.150> around<00:04:38.560> so<00:04:39.560> there's<00:04:39.890> the<00:04:40.040> halo<00:04:40.340> part<00:04:40.640> I'm

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
it around so there's the halo part I'm

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.820 
it around so there's the halo part I'm
going<00:04:41.180> to<00:04:41.270> bend<00:04:41.540> that<00:04:41.630> forward<00:04:42.380> just<00:04:42.680> a<00:04:42.800> little

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
going to bend that forward just a little

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.990 
going to bend that forward just a little
bit<00:04:43.930> and<00:04:45.580> I'm<00:04:46.580> going<00:04:47.090> to<00:04:47.120> place<00:04:47.690> it<00:04:47.720> on<00:04:48.380> the

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
bit and I'm going to place it on the

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.480 
bit and I'm going to place it on the
wings<00:04:50.000> to<00:04:50.690> secure<00:04:51.110> this<00:04:51.410> in<00:04:51.710> there<00:04:52.040> I'm<00:04:52.220> going

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
wings to secure this in there I'm going

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.470 
wings to secure this in there I'm going
to<00:04:52.580> put<00:04:52.790> a<00:04:52.820> couple<00:04:53.120> of<00:04:53.270> bends<00:04:53.660> in<00:04:53.780> it<00:04:55.180> so<00:04:56.180> that

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
to put a couple of bends in it so that

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.060 
to put a couple of bends in it so that
it<00:04:56.930> won't<00:04:57.200> be<00:04:57.350> able<00:04:57.440> to<00:04:57.560> come<00:04:57.650> straight<00:04:58.040> out

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
it won't be able to come straight out

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.710 
it won't be able to come straight out
because<00:04:58.610> it's<00:04:58.820> not<00:04:59.170> sitting<00:05:00.170> straight<00:05:00.650> in<00:05:01.010> it

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
because it's not sitting straight in it

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.990 
because it's not sitting straight in it
so<00:05:02.720> I<00:05:02.750> made<00:05:03.110> a<00:05:03.140> little<00:05:03.460> curlicue<00:05:04.460> right<00:05:04.820> in

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
so I made a little curlicue right in

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.600 
so I made a little curlicue right in
there<00:05:05.530> I'm<00:05:06.530> going<00:05:06.770> to<00:05:06.860> set<00:05:07.070> these<00:05:07.220> clothes

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
there I'm going to set these clothes

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:15.970 
there I'm going to set these clothes
together<00:05:10.090> I'm<00:05:11.090> gonna<00:05:11.300> lay<00:05:11.540> that<00:05:11.570> in<00:05:11.990> there<00:05:14.980> I'm

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
together I'm gonna lay that in there I'm

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.630 
together I'm gonna lay that in there I'm
gonna<00:05:16.160> check<00:05:16.520> the<00:05:16.760> head<00:05:17.800> to<00:05:18.800> make<00:05:18.950> sure<00:05:19.130> it<00:05:19.400> can

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
gonna check the head to make sure it can

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.659 
gonna check the head to make sure it can
be<00:05:19.790> above<00:05:20.090> the<00:05:20.120> wings<00:05:20.540> yes<00:05:21.350> that<00:05:22.040> works<00:05:22.250> and

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
be above the wings yes that works and

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:24.970 
be above the wings yes that works and
now<00:05:23.360> I'm<00:05:23.510> going<00:05:23.660> to<00:05:23.720> add<00:05:23.840> one<00:05:23.870> more<00:05:24.410> piece<00:05:24.710> of

clay<00:05:25.310> on<00:05:25.610> top<00:05:25.669> of<00:05:26.090> that<00:05:26.240> now<00:05:26.870> that<00:05:27.110> halos

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
clay on top of that now that halos

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.970 
clay on top of that now that halos
in<00:05:27.620> there<00:05:27.800> and<00:05:27.950> it's<00:05:28.100> not<00:05:28.400> going<00:05:28.669> anywhere<00:05:29.980> so

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:30.980 
in there and it's not going anywhere so

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:37.180 
in there and it's not going anywhere so
let's<00:05:31.190> bring<00:05:31.430> up<00:05:31.580> the<00:05:31.820> head<00:05:35.860> let's<00:05:36.860> bring<00:05:37.100> up

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
let's bring up the head let's bring up

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.290 
let's bring up the head let's bring up
the<00:05:37.460> body<00:05:39.639> looks<00:05:40.639> like<00:05:40.730> you<00:05:40.940> can<00:05:41.090> see<00:05:41.270> that

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
the body looks like you can see that

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.920 
the body looks like you can see that
wire<00:05:41.720> just<00:05:42.080> a<00:05:42.230> little<00:05:42.500> bit<00:05:43.930> that's<00:05:44.930> better<00:05:45.280> and

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
wire just a little bit that's better and

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.520
