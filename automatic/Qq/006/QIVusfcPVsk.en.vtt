00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:18.860 
setup here you probably recognize this

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.859 
setup here you probably recognize this
it's<00:00:19.460> a<00:00:19.579> record<00:00:19.789> but<00:00:20.119> I<00:00:20.360> want<00:00:20.660> to<00:00:20.689> talk<00:00:20.840> about

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.380 
it's a record but I want to talk about
how<00:00:21.260> we<00:00:22.039> can<00:00:22.189> interface<00:00:22.550> these<00:00:22.910> things<00:00:23.180> with

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
how we can interface these things with

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.620 
how we can interface these things with
mp3s<00:00:24.349> and<00:00:24.560> so<00:00:25.490> this<00:00:25.910> this<00:00:26.150> isn't<00:00:26.330> a<00:00:26.449> real

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
mp3s and so this this isn't a real

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.050 
mp3s and so this this isn't a real
record<00:00:26.900> this<00:00:27.140> is<00:00:27.259> actually<00:00:27.619> a<00:00:28.060> digital

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
record this is actually a digital

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.029 
record this is actually a digital
something<00:00:29.570> something<00:00:30.109> yeah<00:00:30.410> it's<00:00:30.619> a<00:00:30.710> control

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:31.039 
something something yeah it's a control

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:32.860 
something something yeah it's a control
record<00:00:31.369> it<00:00:31.490> acts<00:00:31.759> like<00:00:31.880> a<00:00:32.029> vinyl<00:00:32.449> but<00:00:32.780> it

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
record it acts like a vinyl but it

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.869 
record it acts like a vinyl but it
actually<00:00:33.019> outputs<00:00:33.440> a<00:00:33.530> signal<00:00:33.920> that's<00:00:34.460> read<00:00:34.730> by

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
actually outputs a signal that's read by

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:37.119 
actually outputs a signal that's read by
this<00:00:35.030> box<00:00:35.300> this<00:00:35.629> is<00:00:35.809> a<00:00:35.839> serato<00:00:36.440> scratch<00:00:36.530> box

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
this box this is a serato scratch box

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.450 
this box this is a serato scratch box
made<00:00:37.850> by<00:00:38.000> rain<00:00:38.210> and<00:00:39.070> but<00:00:40.070> these<00:00:40.190> are<00:00:40.309> real

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
made by rain and but these are real

technic<00:00:43.010> 1200<00:00:43.750> turntables<00:00:44.750> that<00:00:44.989> you<00:00:45.049> can

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
technic 1200 turntables that you can

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.320 
technic 1200 turntables that you can
find<00:00:45.320> anywhere<00:00:45.500> and<00:00:46.250> so<00:00:46.640> by<00:00:46.970> basically

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
find anywhere and so by basically

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.600 
find anywhere and so by basically
putting<00:00:47.510> on<00:00:47.629> this<00:00:47.750> here<00:00:48.049> and<00:00:48.309> can<00:00:49.309> get<00:00:49.430> it<00:00:49.519> on

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
putting on this here and can get it on

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.189 
putting on this here and can get it on
there<00:00:49.729> and<00:00:49.909> getting<00:00:50.479> one<00:00:50.629> of<00:00:50.659> these<00:00:50.780> has<00:00:51.019> got<00:00:51.080> a

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
there and getting one of these has got a

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:52.479 
there and getting one of these has got a
USB<00:00:51.409> connection<00:00:51.650> that<00:00:51.979> goes<00:00:52.070> straight<00:00:52.220> into

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
USB connection that goes straight into

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.549 
USB connection that goes straight into
your<00:00:52.580> Mac<00:00:52.790> it<00:00:53.119> goes<00:00:53.330> into<00:00:53.540> my<00:00:53.690> mac<00:00:53.869> and<00:00:54.170> I<00:00:54.350> have

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
your Mac it goes into my mac and I have

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.880 
your Mac it goes into my mac and I have
the<00:00:54.830> software<00:00:55.190> on<00:00:55.309> there<00:00:55.699> that<00:00:56.600> reads<00:00:57.199> the<00:00:57.409> mp3

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
the software on there that reads the mp3

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.119 
the software on there that reads the mp3
files<00:00:58.159> as<00:00:58.489> the<00:00:59.030> vinyl<00:00:59.330> and<00:01:00.260> so<00:01:00.739> why<00:01:00.860> do<00:01:00.920> we<00:01:01.010> have

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
files as the vinyl and so why do we have

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.640 
files as the vinyl and so why do we have
two<00:01:01.339> turntables<00:01:01.930> so<00:01:02.930> we<00:01:03.019> can<00:01:03.140> play<00:01:03.290> two<00:01:03.439> songs

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
two turntables so we can play two songs

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.620 
two turntables so we can play two songs
that<00:01:03.860> one<00:01:04.010> oh<00:01:04.250> so<00:01:04.640> you<00:01:04.729> can<00:01:04.850> mix<00:01:05.000> them<00:01:05.150> exactly

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
that one oh so you can mix them exactly

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.140 
that one oh so you can mix them exactly
