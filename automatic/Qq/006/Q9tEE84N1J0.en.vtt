00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 I greet everyone who looked at my 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:08.460
 channel want to tell you about one idea 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.250
 organizing children's toys in the bathroom 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.330
 room for quite a while could not 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.010
 no way solve this question for yourself and 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.609
 children's toys stood by me 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:24.600
 box on the bathroom and constantly falling 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.210
 it was in the dresser under their sink 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.080
 constantly get to clean it was 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.200
 uncomfortable and didn't really want to find 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.390
 some solution so that the toys were in 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.309
 accessible place at the same time kept 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.600
 they are all organized and 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.850
 compact enough and yet I 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:49.170
 came up with for myself I found one solution 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.950
 and if you're interested, please go ahead 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.320
 with me 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.590
 bathroom in this way 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.829
 looks like our storage organizer 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:01.379
 toys this is such an angular mesh 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.619
 there are three branches 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.869
 with different colors numbers I suppose so 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.290
 it is also made just for fun 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.350
 child in order that he taught numbers and 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.880
 distinguished colors now I will show you closer 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:21.030
 you each branch and tell you what 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.250
 toys in general means us down here in 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.430
 the third compartment is the lowest 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.540
 there is such a turtles why she 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.240
 everything is downstairs because to her we 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.680
 enjoy the child enjoys most often 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.380
 This is such a turtle sorter but inside 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.939
 we are not figures 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:47.899
 all sorts of different interesting others 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:54.530
 the cap is removed and here we go 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:57.350
 balls of different sizes and different colors 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:03.140
 absolutely tell you why we need balls 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:06.320
 all sorts of such rubber toys 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:10.399
 squid turtle 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:13.189
 the most ordinary boat 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.560
 the shell we brought with us 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:26.599
 the sea or the guru gave it to someone I don’t 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:27.140
 I remember him such fish all this without 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:32.030
 tail 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.829
 and the tortoise itself means this 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.409
 turtle often 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:39.620
 Egorka puts some toys here 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:43.489
 fish or rubber ones 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.069
 He showed he rolls them in the water 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:49.849
 have it turtles as 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:54.799
 such a ship serves this one 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:59.120
 the container which its roof is often we 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:03.159
 playing as simple as I move away to 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:07.280
 distance from the child and he sitting in the water 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:10.129
 throws me here these balls principle 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.340
 rubber toys too these balls 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.180
 It turns out that we play for accuracy on 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.760
 agility 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.549
 that is, he can throw I can and this 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.859
 move like you should he 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:24.970
 orient get it or not 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:30.260
 that is the principle 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:32.780
 water entertainment game so on in 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:38.569
 here is the second compartment 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:42.229
 penguin poured some water here and he 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:46.370
 moving butterfly are spinning here 

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:48.349
 wheels and pours out of this one 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.889
 little jar is also a little water 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:54.349
 here to this penguin 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:55.810
 along with this the penguins went like this 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:04:00.229
 jars 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:03.919
 it is not from here we take it here such jars 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:06.019
 different sizes here holes in them 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:09.769
 there is precisely from these cans poured 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:12.940
 water on the head of the penguin they are like 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:17.419
 see a different size that is, you can 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:23.100
 it is also possible to collect each other 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:26.920
 make of them and such a head 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.730
 you can also make one of them 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.860
 turret 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.120
 The price is really these jars 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:38.170
 like the more also here 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:42.520
 develop and color knowledge of colors in 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:44.770
 to form the pyramid correctly 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.560
 or each other lay down and this one 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.420
 we had a jar separately from us 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.910
 pyramid but somewhere to be honest 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.730
 the rest of our jars were confused 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:58.500
 so we adapted her too court and 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:01.540
 it serves as the basis for all these 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.270
 other jars but also great 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:07.150
 just pour some water on them 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.370
 various waterfalls and all that and in this 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.360
 a jar then we just take and and 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:16.180
 add up all the rest 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:19.660
 containers in order that neatly 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:22.060
 we have the whole thing rotten on top yet 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.010
 such a fish, too, in her holes that is 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.970
 she, too, as such a small bucket 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:32.380
 serves we put everything all beautifully on 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:35.560
 their places and 3 container under tsiferka 1 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:42.120
 such colorful ones are stored here 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:45.310
 animals that have such a sticky 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:48.430
 its ability that is when 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.830
 contact with water to not get wet and 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:54.090
 stick to the edges of the bath but i think everything 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:06:04.170
 know who has children here we have 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:09.280
 horse cock cat dog piggy lamb 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:12.010
 Fox and went out a cow and a goat, too 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.980
 initially the child just liked them 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:17.020
 crush yes like they are bright 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:20.140
 get their attention later we also 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:23.140
 on it chili colors then we learned 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:25.689
 animal name wardrobe talking 

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:28.389
 every animal that is corolla there 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:32.169
 Well there piggy oink and now 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:35.379
 We fix such knowledge that mom cat 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:38.019
 there baby kitten mom pig baby 

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:40.119
 pig mother cow baby calf and 

00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:42.789
 everything is really like that 

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:45.269
 interesting and fun for the child its not 

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:49.089
 casually playing at the same time 

00:06:45.269 --> 00:06:52.209
 gains certain knowledge and also 

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:53.619
 here we still have a diving 

00:06:52.209 --> 00:06:56.529
 a mask like that 

00:06:53.619 --> 00:06:59.439
 I can not say that we are here every day 

00:06:56.529 --> 00:07:01.509
 entrusting the bathroom but just the baby well, not 

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:03.729
 allows her to clean because sometimes 

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:07.059
 he dresses her and we don’t know what we are 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:09.129
 it seems that he is a cat ichthyander I do not know 

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:11.800
 I hope that this method of organization 

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:13.149
 children's toys bathroom you 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.729
