00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 and ready 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.020
 ah 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:16.309
 if you put it intergalactic of the universe 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:18.860
 you on bases I am already public and 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.270
 I had to tell them that soon I will make a 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.550
 questions and answers 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.730
 that is, you can ask me 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:29.359
 whatever and under the comments on 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:32.330
 instagram that I'm going to leave it but for 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:35.330
 here maybe the points will appear in the 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.040
 next video and I also think that I'm going to 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.750
 open a new section of greetings like this 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.430
 if you want a greeting you can ask for it 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.979
 to work in the comments or in 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.720
 instagram I know we have not been very 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:47.050
 active in the channel both me and cassava 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.050
 but 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.260
 and a little bit my piece because there were some 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:56.329
 problems with the decoration and I was 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.179
 renewing education a little bit because 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.890
 because it's almost not going to change things I do not know 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:04.449
 if the lighting really bad maybe there's 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.449
 that turn on a good light 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.310
 I think it looks worse 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:18.690
 but I leave it matched a bit the moral 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.690
 well the good 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.630
 and told them to leave their questions 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.220
 the one you want below or greetings to the 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.600

 a trophy stained by lpc that 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.760
 it will mean that they were the first 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.260
 five customers and that's why it will be very fast 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.260
 and they are giving to the competitions 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.750
 those competencies and they do not exist so 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.750

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.680
 that you gave me everything
