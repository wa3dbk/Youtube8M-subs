00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.070
 those who invented the wheel 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.330

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.530
 as the donkeys will come long ears so that all humanity can 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.610
 give them but even so we will save everything that we have missed their fishing 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.760

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.409
