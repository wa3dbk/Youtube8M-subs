00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
hall and let's see we do it's like a

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.399 
hall and let's see we do it's like a
premature<00:01:12.150> town<00:01:12.360> relay<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.689> think<00:01:13.080> he<00:01:13.200> just

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
premature town relay I think he just

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.870 
premature town relay I think he just
turned<00:01:13.650> townhall<00:01:13.979> 8<00:01:14.070> cuz<00:01:14.310> nothing<00:01:14.490> is

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
turned townhall 8 cuz nothing is

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:04.169 
this honestly not the best base design

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:06.229 
this honestly not the best base design
ever<00:03:04.379> and<00:03:04.650> I<00:03:04.739> used<00:03:05.129> his<00:03:05.400> ability<00:03:05.939> already

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
which means if I used it now it would

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.050 
which means if I used it now it would

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
yeah that's it that wasn't a hard base

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:20.749 
yeah that's it that wasn't a hard base
at<00:03:19.620> all<00:03:19.769> and<00:03:19.949> set<00:03:20.099> up<00:03:20.189> most<00:03:20.400> of<00:03:20.459> my<00:03:20.519> troops

alive<00:03:21.349> wait<00:03:22.349> maybe<00:03:22.530> i<00:03:22.739> might<00:03:22.919> get<00:03:23.129> full<00:03:23.720> stores

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
alive wait maybe i might get full stores

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.059 
alive wait maybe i might get full stores
on<00:03:24.840> this<00:03:24.959> i<00:03:25.049> might<00:03:25.199> get<00:03:25.319> the<00:03:25.439> result<00:03:25.769> of<00:03:25.919> this

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
on this i might get the result of this

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.599 
on this i might get the result of this
on<00:03:26.189> 33<00:03:26.549> seconds<00:03:26.970> but<00:03:27.090> we'll<00:03:27.239> see<00:03:27.769> 91<00:03:28.769> did<00:03:29.579> a

on 33 seconds but we'll see 91 did a

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.849 
on 33 seconds but we'll see 91 did a
percentage<00:03:30.479> damage<00:03:30.959> right<00:03:31.259> that's<00:03:31.709> on

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
percentage damage right that's on

percentage damage right that's on
premature<00:03:32.340> townhall<00:03:32.729> 8<00:03:32.849> though<00:03:33.120> so<00:03:33.389> you<00:03:33.449> know

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 
premature townhall 8 though so you know

premature townhall 8 though so you know
this<00:03:33.840> that<00:03:34.049> as<00:03:34.169> well<00:03:34.349> but<00:03:34.829> ninety-one<00:03:35.310> percent

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
this that as well but ninety-one percent

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.360 
this that as well but ninety-one percent
damage<00:03:35.939> and<00:03:36.449> on<00:03:37.409> this<00:03:37.620> base<00:03:37.829> on<00:03:38.009> and<00:03:38.189> i<00:03:38.310> took

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
damage and on this base on and i took

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.390 
damage and on this base on and i took
all<00:03:38.609> his<00:03:38.759> resources<00:03:39.180> so<00:03:39.720> dude<00:03:40.290> this<00:03:40.739> is<00:03:40.979> not<00:03:41.340> a

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
all his resources so dude this is not a

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.210 
all his resources so dude this is not a
good<00:03:41.790> base<00:03:41.939> design<00:03:42.359> at<00:03:42.540> all<00:03:42.720> so<00:03:43.229> yeah<00:03:43.919> maybe<00:03:44.069> he

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
good base design at all so yeah maybe he

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.770 
good base design at all so yeah maybe he
gets<00:03:44.370> a<00:03:44.430> tunnel<00:03:44.729> 7<00:03:45.030> it<00:03:45.120> work<00:03:45.359> well<00:03:45.569> but

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
gets a tunnel 7 it work well but

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.499 
gets a tunnel 7 it work well but
otherwise<00:03:46.049> yeah<00:03:46.889> it<00:03:47.220> didn't<00:03:47.459> do<00:03:47.579> too<00:03:47.609> well<00:03:47.819> so

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:48.509 
otherwise yeah it didn't do too well so

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:49.969 
otherwise yeah it didn't do too well so
guess<00:03:49.199> i'll<00:03:49.379> see<00:03:49.500> you<00:03:49.560> guys<00:03:49.590> in<00:03:49.859> the<00:03:49.889> next

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.970 
I don't know how many indie I just check
that<00:04:45.030> he<00:04:45.180> does<00:04:45.330> have<00:04:45.480> wizards<00:04:45.900> and<00:04:46.080> yeah<00:04:46.920> I

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
that he does have wizards and yeah I

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.070 
that he does have wizards and yeah I
think<00:04:47.100> that's<00:04:47.730> all<00:04:47.940> of<00:04:47.970> them<00:04:48.090> awesome<00:04:48.780> and<00:04:48.990> we

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
think that's all of them awesome and we

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.340 
think that's all of them awesome and we
do<00:04:49.290> have<00:04:49.620> not<00:04:50.190> many<00:04:50.460> Giants<00:04:51.030> left<00:04:51.270> so<00:04:51.660> that

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
do have not many Giants left so that

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.990 
do have not many Giants left so that
really<00:04:52.590> really<00:04:52.800> sucks<00:04:52.950> so<00:04:53.340> let's<00:04:53.490> try<00:04:53.730> and<00:04:53.850> get

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
really really sucks so let's try and get

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.480 
really really sucks so let's try and get
rid<00:04:54.270> of<00:04:54.300> these<00:04:54.570> guys<00:04:54.930> and<00:04:55.320> the<00:04:55.860> Wizards<00:04:56.070> anyway

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
rid of these guys and the Wizards anyway

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.130 
rid of these guys and the Wizards anyway
just<00:04:56.670> because<00:04:56.760> they<00:04:57.000> can<00:04:57.030> wreck<00:04:57.540> Giants<00:04:58.020> and

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
just because they can wreck Giants and

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.810 
just because they can wreck Giants and
your<00:04:58.320> whole<00:04:58.590> strategy<00:04:58.830> can<00:04:59.250> fall<00:04:59.460> to<00:04:59.610> bits

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
your whole strategy can fall to bits

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.790 
your whole strategy can fall to bits

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
not a good base to go for loop for just

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.610 
not a good base to go for loop for just
because<00:05:41.970> it's<00:05:42.180> really<00:05:42.390> good<00:05:42.660> defending<00:05:43.290> the

you<00:05:50.880> know<00:05:51.000> die<00:05:51.210> because<00:05:51.600> here<00:05:51.780> is<00:05:51.930> a<00:05:51.960> ton<00:05:52.380> of

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 
obviously it doesn't count for anything

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.159 
obviously it doesn't count for anything
but<00:05:58.050> no<00:05:58.290> it's<00:05:58.680> what<00:05:58.860> for<00:05:59.040> fun<00:05:59.630> so<00:06:00.630> let's<00:06:00.900> see

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169
