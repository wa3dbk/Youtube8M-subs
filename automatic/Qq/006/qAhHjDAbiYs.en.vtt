00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
mean it was it was a riot and now it's a

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.190

little<00:01:38.070> bit<00:01:38.159> less<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.520> with<00:01:38.700> two<00:01:39.170> actually<00:01:40.170> I

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
little bit less so with two actually I

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.179 
little bit less so with two actually I
should<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.439> didn't<00:01:40.619> talk<00:01:40.740> about<00:01:40.829> this<00:01:41.009> there's

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
should I didn't talk about this there's

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.940 
should I didn't talk about this there's
a<00:01:41.250> difference<00:01:41.670> with<00:01:42.210> two<00:01:42.479> or<00:01:42.659> three<00:01:42.990> when<00:01:43.680> one

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
a difference with two or three when one

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.310 
a difference with two or three when one
person<00:01:44.460> moves<00:01:45.240> into<00:01:45.659> another<00:01:45.899> person's<00:01:46.200> room

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
person moves into another person's room

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.380 
person moves into another person's room
the<00:01:46.470> other<00:01:46.619> person<00:01:46.860> has<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.220> get<00:01:47.340> shoved<00:01:47.640> with

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
the other person has to get shoved with

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.050 
the other person has to get shoved with
four<00:01:48.750> or<00:01:49.020> more<00:01:49.320> players<00:01:49.710> what<00:01:50.430> happens<00:01:50.850> is

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
four or more players what happens is

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.450 
four or more players what happens is
when<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> person<00:01:52.049> moves<00:01:52.920> into<00:01:53.220> another

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
when a person moves into another

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.490 
when a person moves into another
person's<00:01:53.759> room<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.360> have<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.540> draw<00:01:54.750> card<00:01:55.170> and

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
person's room you have to draw card and

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.069 
person's room you have to draw card and
see<00:01:56.310> if<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:57.030> was<00:01:57.149> excessive<00:01:57.600> pushing<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:57.899> this

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
see if it was excessive pushing on this

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.709 
see if it was excessive pushing on this
was<00:01:58.229> not<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.409> successful<00:01:58.860> push<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.509> then<00:02:00.509> this

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
was not a successful push and then this

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.120 
was not a successful push and then this
would<00:02:01.259> have<00:02:01.380> been<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.560> successful<00:02:01.920> push

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
would have been a successful push

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.700 
would have been a successful push
because<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.549> highlight<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:04.079> the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
because of the highlight and so the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.289 
because of the highlight and so the
shoving<00:02:05.159> doesn't<00:02:05.399> happen<00:02:05.520> quite<00:02:05.820> as<00:02:05.969> much<00:02:06.090> so

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
shoving doesn't happen quite as much so

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.779 
shoving doesn't happen quite as much so
you<00:02:06.390> can<00:02:06.540> have<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.689> situation<00:02:06.840> where<00:02:07.700> you<00:02:08.700> know

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
you can have a situation where you know

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:09.800 
you can have a situation where you know
you<00:02:08.910> were<00:02:09.000> expecting<00:02:09.270> put<00:02:09.390> somebody<00:02:09.599> up<00:02:09.660> at

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
you were expecting put somebody up at

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.449 
you were expecting put somebody up at
all<00:02:09.899> they<00:02:10.050> don't<00:02:10.170> move<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.340> with

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
all they don't move and so you and with

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:11.800 
all they don't move and so you and with
more

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
more

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.080 
more
players<00:02:12.280> it's<00:02:13.280> actually<00:02:13.370> very<00:02:13.550> very<00:02:13.849> cool<00:02:13.970> to

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
players it's actually very very cool to

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.610 
players it's actually very very cool to
get<00:02:14.180> into<00:02:14.360> situations<00:02:14.510> where<00:02:14.930> there<00:02:15.440> are<00:02:15.590> two

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
get into situations where there are two

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.440 
get into situations where there are two
or<00:02:16.010> sometimes<00:02:16.190> even<00:02:16.430> three<00:02:16.580> robots<00:02:17.030> in<00:02:17.390> the

or sometimes even three robots in the

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.089 
or sometimes even three robots in the
same<00:02:17.660> room<00:02:17.870> because<00:02:18.500> then<00:02:18.680> I<00:02:18.709> remember

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
same room because then I remember

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:19.930 
same room because then I remember
yesterday<00:02:19.489> when<00:02:19.520> i<00:02:19.640> was<00:02:19.670> playing<00:02:19.819> a

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
yesterday when i was playing a

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.339 
yesterday when i was playing a
four-player<00:02:20.270> game<00:02:20.360> i<00:02:20.690> was<00:02:20.989> in<00:02:21.110> a<00:02:21.170> room<00:02:21.260> with

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.309 
four-player game i was in a room with
somebody<00:02:21.560> else<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.160> i<00:02:22.849> was<00:02:23.180> confident<00:02:24.050> that

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
somebody else and i was confident that

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.930 
somebody else and i was confident that
they<00:02:24.680> were<00:02:24.739> going<00:02:24.950> to<00:02:25.010> put<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.400> thing<00:02:25.670> that

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
they were going to put the thing that

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.350 
they were going to put the thing that
they<00:02:26.150> had<00:02:26.709> in<00:02:27.709> their<00:02:27.980> inventory<00:02:28.730> into<00:02:29.209> the

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
they had in their inventory into the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.600 
they had in their inventory into the
Machine<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:29.690> so<00:02:30.349> I<00:02:30.380> didn't<00:02:30.980> have<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.130> wake<00:02:31.489> up

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
Machine and so I didn't have to wake up

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.640 
Machine and so I didn't have to wake up
and<00:02:31.880> so<00:02:32.090> I<00:02:32.360> was<00:02:32.810> actually<00:02:32.989> going<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.290> activate

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
and so I was actually going to activate

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.309 
and so I was actually going to activate
the<00:02:33.739> machine<00:02:34.180> so<00:02:35.180> I<00:02:35.209> chose<00:02:35.480> an<00:02:35.660> activation<00:02:36.019> I

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
the machine so I chose an activation I

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.809 
the machine so I chose an activation I
chose<00:02:36.500> a<00:02:36.530> high<00:02:36.739> priority<00:02:36.980> one<00:02:37.370> but<00:02:37.489> turned<00:02:37.700> out

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
chose a high priority one but turned out

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.460 
chose a high priority one but turned out
and<00:02:38.120> they<00:02:38.390> did<00:02:38.569> put<00:02:38.720> in<00:02:38.870> with<00:02:38.959> an<00:02:39.080> even<00:02:39.319> higher

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
and they did put in with an even higher

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.470 
and they did put in with an even higher
priority<00:02:40.130> so<00:02:40.489> i<00:02:40.519> ended<00:02:40.700> up<00:02:40.790> activating<00:02:41.390> the

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
priority so i ended up activating the

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.680 
priority so i ended up activating the
machine<00:02:41.780> before<00:02:41.989> they<00:02:42.319> put<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.650> thing<00:02:42.860> in<00:02:42.890> and

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
machine before they put the thing in and

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.170 
machine before they put the thing in and
it's<00:02:44.690> just<00:02:45.470> it's<00:02:45.799> just<00:02:45.890> good<00:02:46.310> solid<00:02:46.760> fun<00:02:47.150> i

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
one I know it is still prototyping it

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:57.550 
one I know it is still prototyping it
does<00:02:56.450> seem<00:02:56.690> like<00:02:56.720> some<00:02:57.049> of<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.200> difficulty

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
does seem like some of the difficulty

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.020 
does seem like some of the difficulty
levels<00:02:57.799> of<00:02:57.890> some<00:02:58.069> of<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.310> mean<00:02:58.459> you<00:02:58.519> saw<00:02:58.730> I

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
levels of some of the I mean you saw I

levels of some of the I mean you saw I
had<00:02:59.360> the<00:02:59.630> easiest<00:03:00.049> rejection<00:03:00.319> in<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.530> world

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
had the easiest rejection in the world

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.199 
had the easiest rejection in the world
just<00:03:00.950> let<00:03:01.069> the<00:03:01.190> monkey<00:03:01.489> walk<00:03:01.700> into<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.030> room<00:03:02.120> I

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
just let the monkey walk into the room I

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.729 
just let the monkey walk into the room I
need<00:03:02.330> a<00:03:02.360> banana<00:03:02.660> that's<00:03:03.170> a<00:03:03.230> four<00:03:03.470> point

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
need a banana that's a four point

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.740 
need a banana that's a four point
objective<00:03:03.920> it<00:03:04.610> seemed<00:03:04.760> like<00:03:04.880> a<00:03:04.910> really<00:03:05.269> easy

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
objective it seemed like a really easy

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.270 
objective it seemed like a really easy
objective<00:03:06.319> and<00:03:06.470> so<00:03:06.560> I'm<00:03:06.650> really<00:03:06.890> not<00:03:07.130> quite

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
objective and so I'm really not quite

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.220 
objective and so I'm really not quite
sure<00:03:07.370> if<00:03:07.580> you<00:03:08.090> know<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.599> difficulty

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
sure if you know the the difficulty

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.509 
sure if you know the the difficulty
levels<00:03:09.470> for<00:03:09.590> some<00:03:09.709> of<00:03:09.799> these<00:03:09.860> are<00:03:10.010> finalized

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
levels for some of these are finalized

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.460 
levels for some of these are finalized
but<00:03:10.760> that's<00:03:11.120> a<00:03:11.209> minor<00:03:11.420> complaint<00:03:11.930> really<00:03:12.290> I

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
but that's a minor complaint really I

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.410 
but that's a minor complaint really I
can<00:03:12.920> see<00:03:13.069> how<00:03:13.160> that<00:03:13.340> might<00:03:13.370> be<00:03:13.790> difficult<00:03:13.940> if

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
can see how that might be difficult if

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.539 
can see how that might be difficult if
somebody<00:03:14.720> else<00:03:14.900> interrupted<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.829> monkey<00:03:16.130> and

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
somebody else interrupted the monkey and

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:17.650 
somebody else interrupted the monkey and
then<00:03:16.670> all<00:03:16.760> of<00:03:16.790> a<00:03:16.850> sudden<00:03:17.030> I<00:03:17.060> got<00:03:17.209> to<00:03:17.329> go<00:03:17.390> rescue

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
then all of a sudden I got to go rescue

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.000 
then all of a sudden I got to go rescue
the<00:03:17.900> monkey<00:03:18.140> and<00:03:18.260> get<00:03:18.380> him<00:03:18.500> in<00:03:18.590> there<00:03:18.829> or

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
the monkey and get him in there or

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.380 
the monkey and get him in there or
somebody<00:03:19.310> else<00:03:19.430> put<00:03:19.579> a<00:03:19.640> human<00:03:19.910> in<00:03:20.120> that<00:03:20.209> room

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
somebody else put a human in that room

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.440 
somebody else put a human in that room
or<00:03:20.540> whatever<00:03:20.690> but<00:03:21.380> Neil<00:03:21.620> whatever<00:03:22.070> and<00:03:22.450> then

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
or whatever but Neil whatever and then

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.960 
or whatever but Neil whatever and then
the<00:03:23.600> other<00:03:24.140> thing<00:03:24.170> so<00:03:24.920> it's<00:03:25.310> I<00:03:25.519> didn't<00:03:25.790> show<00:03:25.940> it

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
the other thing so it's I didn't show it

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:26.949 
the other thing so it's I didn't show it
but<00:03:26.150> at<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.420> beginning<00:03:26.510> of<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.840> game

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
but at the beginning of the game

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.780 
but at the beginning of the game
everybody<00:03:27.260> does<00:03:27.620> a<00:03:27.650> card<00:03:27.980> draft<00:03:28.280> to<00:03:28.430> get<00:03:28.609> their

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
everybody does a card draft to get their

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.830 
everybody does a card draft to get their
directives<00:03:29.269> and<00:03:29.540> honestly<00:03:30.530> I<00:03:31.450> mean<00:03:32.450> that<00:03:32.569> can

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
directives and honestly I mean that can

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.110 
directives and honestly I mean that can
you<00:03:33.470> know<00:03:33.560> work<00:03:33.829> out<00:03:34.010> not<00:03:34.250> in<00:03:34.489> your<00:03:34.640> favor<00:03:34.880> at

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
you know work out not in your favor at

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.150 
you know work out not in your favor at
all<00:03:35.239> I<00:03:35.269> mean<00:03:35.359> you<00:03:35.540> can<00:03:35.780> get<00:03:36.470> hos<00:03:36.650> and<00:03:36.680> get<00:03:36.980> just

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
all I mean you can get hos and get just

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.000 
all I mean you can get hos and get just
like<00:03:37.220> a<00:03:37.280> handful<00:03:37.730> of<00:03:37.760> really<00:03:38.120> tough<00:03:38.329> ones<00:03:38.600> and

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
like a handful of really tough ones and

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.069 
like a handful of really tough ones and
everybody<00:03:40.010> else<00:03:40.160> gets<00:03:40.310> easy<00:03:40.549> ones<00:03:40.870> to<00:03:41.870> serve

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
everybody else gets easy ones to serve

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:42.910 
everybody else gets easy ones to serve
extent<00:03:42.319> that's<00:03:42.440> not<00:03:42.590> that<00:03:42.680> big<00:03:42.799> a<00:03:42.859> deal

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
extent that's not that big a deal

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.620 
extent that's not that big a deal
because<00:03:43.130> you<00:03:43.549> know<00:03:43.670> a<00:03:43.730> lot<00:03:44.030> of<00:03:44.060> cards<00:03:44.359> it<00:03:44.450> seems

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
because you know a lot of cards it seems

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.270 
because you know a lot of cards it seems
like<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:44.989> balance<00:03:45.350> is<00:03:45.470> off<00:03:45.560> anyway<00:03:46.040> but<00:03:46.250> I

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
like the balance is off anyway but I

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.370 
like the balance is off anyway but I
almost<00:03:46.549> tend<00:03:46.940> to<00:03:47.030> think<00:03:47.239> it<00:03:47.389> I've<00:03:47.630> almost<00:03:47.989> be

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
almost tend to think it I've almost be

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.080 
almost tend to think it I've almost be
interested<00:03:48.709> in<00:03:48.920> like<00:03:49.160> an<00:03:49.280> alternative<00:03:49.880> where

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
interested in like an alternative where

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.120 
interested in like an alternative where
there's<00:03:50.660> like<00:03:50.810> a<00:03:50.840> stack<00:03:51.139> of<00:03:51.170> one<00:03:51.530> and<00:03:51.680> twos<00:03:51.859> and

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
there's like a stack of one and twos and

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.559 
there's like a stack of one and twos and
a<00:03:52.190> stack<00:03:52.430> of<00:03:52.459> three<00:03:52.639> and<00:03:52.880> a<00:03:52.940> stack<00:03:53.150> of<00:03:53.180> floors

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
a stack of three and a stack of floors

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:55.000 
a stack of three and a stack of floors
or<00:03:53.840> something<00:03:54.109> like<00:03:54.200> that<00:03:54.260> and<00:03:54.620> everybody

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
or something like that and everybody

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.710 
or something like that and everybody
just<00:03:55.130> takes<00:03:55.430> one<00:03:55.639> of<00:03:55.760> each<00:03:55.910> so<00:03:56.450> we<00:03:56.600> know

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
just takes one of each so we know

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.780 
just takes one of each so we know
everybody<00:03:57.019> has<00:03:57.350> a<00:03:57.769> two<00:03:58.069> or<00:03:58.100> three<00:03:58.400> and<00:03:58.519> a<00:03:58.579> four

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
everybody has a two or three and a four

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.819 
everybody has a two or three and a four
your<00:03:59.690> side<00:03:59.930> maybe<00:04:00.139> take<00:04:00.350> the<00:04:00.440> ones<00:04:00.620> out

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
your side maybe take the ones out

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:02.890 
your side maybe take the ones out
because<00:04:01.100> they're<00:04:01.250> so<00:04:01.400> easy<00:04:01.690> you<00:04:02.690> know<00:04:02.750> when<00:04:02.840> do

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
because they're so easy you know when do

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:03.849 
because they're so easy you know when do
you<00:04:02.989> want<00:04:03.200> to<00:04:03.260> MIT<00:04:03.380> you<00:04:03.440> want<00:04:03.620> to<00:04:03.709> have<00:04:03.799> a

you want to MIT you want to have a

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:05.319 
you want to MIT you want to have a
bigger<00:04:04.100> chance<00:04:04.280> of<00:04:04.459> the<00:04:04.519> game<00:04:04.549> lasting<00:04:05.180> long

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
bigger chance of the game lasting long

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:06.610 
bigger chance of the game lasting long
everybody<00:04:05.600> has<00:04:05.810> a<00:04:05.840> two<00:04:05.989> or<00:04:06.019> three<00:04:06.260> and<00:04:06.380> a<00:04:06.410> four

everybody has a two or three and a four

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.140 
everybody has a two or three and a four
but<00:04:07.280> he'll<00:04:07.400> maybe<00:04:07.430> that's<00:04:07.790> actually<00:04:08.060> a<00:04:08.120> very

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
but he'll maybe that's actually a very

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.610 
but he'll maybe that's actually a very
maybe<00:04:08.569> I<00:04:08.660> could<00:04:08.840> just<00:04:08.900> be<00:04:09.019> great<00:04:09.290> difficulty

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
maybe I could just be great difficulty

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.900 
maybe I could just be great difficulty
everybody<00:04:09.889> can<00:04:10.010> only<00:04:10.130> take<00:04:10.310> three<00:04:10.340> xin<00:04:10.670> fours
