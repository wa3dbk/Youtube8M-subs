 could make good parts during 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.879
 long ago there are two morons there that 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.290
 did not stop chasing good 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.360
 you understand it I will talk to you 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.680
 skate 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.590
 you're sure you'll make them too 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.860
 we did there it's totally out 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.840
 subject small story tale the first story 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.010
 skate board was invented at the end of 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.750
 1930s 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.050
 if I have to make scooters 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.910
 function but it was in 1965 that the 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.149
 Americans vote 15 million skate 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.860
 but it's like 1974 that skiing 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.250
 was unknown as a sport in the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.630
 Ministry in France and Belgium 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:15.000
 I should not have said that I was using 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:17.360
 wiki this word is not finished wikipedia 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.920
 maybe I should not have said that 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.860
 skateboarding can be considered a 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.009
 sport or art frankly the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.250
 skate is good but as soon as I have all 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.790
 a figure the least figure ben it is 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.220
 pass what's good ben I want to show 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:43.590
 a figure 1 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:46.380
 like that I'm not trying to figure 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.620
 because I do not really have the level 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.540
 the hermitage is good but it is ok for 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.210
 times but sometimes I fall figures 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.240
 I admit but it's small boards 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:02.840
 small dive but but that does not 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:05.220
 do not succeed too much I have shots here and there 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.490
