want that in the striker that's
fantastic<00:04:31.990> because<00:04:32.590> people<00:04:33.370> are<00:04:33.430> going<00:04:33.520> to

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
fantastic because people are going to

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.250 
fantastic because people are going to
say<00:04:33.700> I<00:04:33.880> would<00:04:34.090> say<00:04:34.270> he's<00:04:34.419> finishing<00:04:34.690> last<00:04:35.020> and

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
say I would say he's finishing last and

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.690 
say I would say he's finishing last and

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
obviously this is just my opinion but

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.730 
obviously this is just my opinion but
it's<00:04:37.210> not<00:04:37.330> too<00:04:37.480> bad<00:04:37.510> when<00:04:38.020> you're<00:04:38.380> going<00:04:38.560> to<00:04:38.680> be
