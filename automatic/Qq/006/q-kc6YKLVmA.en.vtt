so<00:00:47.780> the<00:00:47.899> first<00:00:48.109> thing<00:00:48.289> to<00:00:48.320> say<00:00:48.440> is<00:00:48.590> that<00:00:48.859> both

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
so the first thing to say is that both

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:50.229 
so the first thing to say is that both
of<00:00:49.070> my<00:00:49.309> books<00:00:49.489> are<00:00:49.730> completely

self-published and I think that

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:53.860 
self-published and I think that
self-publishing<00:00:52.850> is<00:00:53.120> an<00:00:53.269> amazing

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
self-publishing is an amazing

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.630 
self-publishing is an amazing
opportunity<00:00:53.989> for<00:00:54.559> female<00:00:55.070> entrepreneurs

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.770 
now as I said that cost me money to do
but<00:03:12.190> it<00:03:12.460> also<00:03:12.640> meant<00:03:13.000> that<00:03:13.090> I<00:03:13.150> didn't<00:03:13.450> have<00:03:13.630> to

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.860 
but it also meant that I didn't have to
start<00:03:14.050> from<00:03:14.290> scratch<00:03:14.680> so<00:03:15.130> I<00:03:15.820> really<00:03:16.360> recommend

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.020 
start from scratch so I really recommend
that<00:03:17.170> not<00:03:17.590> only<00:03:17.740> you<00:03:18.340> write<00:03:18.610> a<00:03:18.640> book<00:03:18.820> about

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
that not only you write a book about

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.120 
that not only you write a book about
your<00:03:19.180> own<00:03:19.330> personal<00:03:19.780> stories<00:03:20.200> but<00:03:20.230> maybe<00:03:20.830> you

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
your own personal stories but maybe you

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.670 
your own personal stories but maybe you
already<00:03:21.340> have<00:03:21.840> some<00:03:22.840> things<00:03:23.140> that<00:03:23.290> you<00:03:23.470> can

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680
