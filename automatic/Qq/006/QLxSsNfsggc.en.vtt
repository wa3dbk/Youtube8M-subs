00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.450 
good and drove in florianópolis forest
bikes<00:00:09.599> because<00:00:10.110> they<00:00:10.290> cannot<00:00:10.650> find<00:00:10.889> any

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
bikes because they cannot find any

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.720 
bikes because they cannot find any
snakes<00:00:11.580> long<00:00:12.269> enough<00:00:12.650> now<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:13.679> do<00:00:13.920> understand

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
snakes long enough now I do understand

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.210 
snakes long enough now I do understand
the<00:00:14.820> question<00:00:15.240> because<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:16.139> do<00:00:16.260> have<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.650> pretty

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
the question because I do have a pretty

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.460 
the question because I do have a pretty
tall<00:00:17.730> Dendrobium<00:00:18.330> Phalaenopsis<00:00:18.900> orchid<00:00:19.260> and

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
tall Dendrobium Phalaenopsis orchid and

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.950 
tall Dendrobium Phalaenopsis orchid and
I<00:00:19.949> really<00:00:20.250> cannot<00:00:20.460> find<00:00:20.789> any<00:00:21.090> snakes<00:00:21.359> for<00:00:21.840> it

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
I really cannot find any snakes for it

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.609 
I really cannot find any snakes for it
so<00:00:22.350> here<00:00:22.769> are<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.100> few<00:00:23.580> tricks<00:00:23.939> now<00:00:24.869> first<00:00:25.289> you

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
so here are a few tricks now first you

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.950 
so here are a few tricks now first you
can<00:00:25.830> use<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.279> bamboo<00:00:26.580> skewer<00:00:26.880> now<00:00:27.779> you'd<00:00:27.930> say

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
can use a bamboo skewer now you'd say

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.710 
can use a bamboo skewer now you'd say
it's<00:00:28.320> kind<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.650> short<00:00:28.830> yes<00:00:29.340> but<00:00:29.789> if<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.420> look

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
it's kind of short yes but if you look

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.780 
it's kind of short yes but if you look
at<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.929> Dendrobium<00:00:31.560> cane<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:32.189> can<00:00:32.340> see<00:00:32.610> the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
at a Dendrobium cane you can see the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.400 
at a Dendrobium cane you can see the
leaves<00:00:32.969> are<00:00:33.210> on<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.420> sides<00:00:33.780> leaving<00:00:34.290> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
leaves are on the sides leaving the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.920 
leaves are on the sides leaving the
front<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.160> back<00:00:35.280> wide<00:00:35.700> open<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.690> what<00:00:36.809> you

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
front and the back wide open so what you

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.069 
front and the back wide open so what you
can<00:00:37.110> do<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.739> try<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.370> attach<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.270> steak<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
can do is try to attach the steak to the

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.790 
can do is try to attach the steak to the
cane<00:00:40.469> like<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.640> can<00:00:41.850> rub<00:00:42.059> some<00:00:42.300> wire<00:00:42.629> on<00:00:43.410> it

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
cane like so you can rub some wire on it

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.660 
cane like so you can rub some wire on it
and<00:00:44.219> there<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.480> go<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:46.620> have<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.829> steak<00:00:47.219> for

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
and there you go you have a steak for

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.660 
and there you go you have a steak for
your<00:00:48.180> spike<00:00:48.600> now<00:00:49.410> there<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> huge<00:00:50.219> problem

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
your spike now there is a huge problem

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.580 
your spike now there is a huge problem
with<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:51.360> drogon<00:00:51.660> fire<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:51.989> abscess<00:00:52.230> orchids

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
with in drogon fire and abscess orchids

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.010 
with in drogon fire and abscess orchids
and<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:53.039> method<00:00:53.579> as<00:00:53.789> well<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.660> need<00:00:54.899> to

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
and this method as well so I need to

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.130 
and this method as well so I need to
show<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.260> some<00:00:55.530> other<00:00:55.980> tricks<00:00:56.989> so<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
show you some other tricks so the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.900 
show you some other tricks so the
problem<00:00:58.469> with<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.710> droving<00:00:59.039> florianópolis<00:00:59.760> is

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
problem with in droving florianópolis is

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.119 
problem with in droving florianópolis is
that<00:01:00.239> they<00:01:00.480> actually<00:01:00.899> produce<00:01:01.109> these<00:01:01.649> thin

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
that they actually produce these thin

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.840 
that they actually produce these thin
kind<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.910> thin<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.210> long<00:01:03.979> canes<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.369> also<00:01:05.729> if

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
kind of thin and long canes and also if

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.870 
kind of thin and long canes and also if
they<00:01:05.970> produce<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.570> flower<00:01:07.170> spike<00:01:07.680> now<00:01:08.490> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
they produce a flower spike now the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.289 
they produce a flower spike now the
whole<00:01:09.119> thing<00:01:09.450> will<00:01:09.780> just<00:01:09.810> start<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:11.090> pull<00:01:12.090> to

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
whole thing will just start to pull to

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.170 
whole thing will just start to pull to
one<00:01:12.330> side<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.200> actually<00:01:13.710> what<00:01:14.369> happens<00:01:14.880> is

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
one side and actually what happens is

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.090 
one side and actually what happens is
the<00:01:16.080> center<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.619> mass<00:01:17.060> changes<00:01:18.229> now<00:01:19.229> I'm<00:01:19.890> not

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
the center of mass changes now I'm not

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.499 
the center of mass changes now I'm not
sure<00:01:20.189> how<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.340> explain<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.939> I'm<00:01:21.210> not<00:01:21.360> really

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
sure how to explain this I'm not really

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.929 
sure how to explain this I'm not really
good<00:01:21.780> science<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.710> just<00:01:22.920> like<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.400> lot<00:01:23.580> but<00:01:23.820> I

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
good science it just like it a lot but I

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.090 
good science it just like it a lot but I
I<00:01:24.180> really<00:01:24.270> I'm<00:01:24.630> not<00:01:24.659> super<00:01:25.530> good<00:01:25.710> at<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.920> but

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
I really I'm not super good at it but

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.429 
I really I'm not super good at it but
okay<00:01:26.640> imagine<00:01:26.880> your<00:01:27.150> orchid<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.600> placed<00:01:27.900> smack

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
okay imagine your orchid is placed smack

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.580 
okay imagine your orchid is placed smack
in<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.680> middle<00:01:29.119> now<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.900> center<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.350> mass

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
in the middle now the center of mass

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.710 
in the middle now the center of mass
will<00:01:31.950> be<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.670> middle<00:01:32.939> right<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.540> the

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
will be in the middle right and the

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.830 
will be in the middle right and the
middle<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.170> actually<00:01:34.460> supported<00:01:35.460> if<00:01:36.180> the

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
middle is actually supported if the

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.200 
middle is actually supported if the
orchid<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.320> going<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.799> one<00:01:38.009> side<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.850> center

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
orchid is going to one side the center

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.630 
orchid is going to one side the center
of<00:01:39.329> mass<00:01:39.689> where<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.380> gravity<00:01:40.770> pulls<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.400> most

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
of mass where the gravity pulls the most

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.530 
of mass where the gravity pulls the most
is<00:01:41.909> gonna<00:01:42.509> go<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.530> same<00:01:43.860> side<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.610> what

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
is gonna go to that same side and what

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.960 
is gonna go to that same side and what
happens<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.950> particular<00:01:47.399> side<00:01:47.640> is

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
happens is that that particular side is

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.660 
happens is that that particular side is
not<00:01:48.299> supported<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.200> know<00:01:49.320> or<00:01:50.250> something<00:01:50.610> like

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
not supported you know or something like

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.899 
not supported you know or something like
that

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
that

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.749 
that
so<00:01:51.570> anyway<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.290> problem<00:01:52.710> with<00:01:53.009> these<00:01:53.159> guys<00:01:53.460> is

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
so anyway the problem with these guys is

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.819 
so anyway the problem with these guys is
that<00:01:54.119> because<00:01:54.479> they<00:01:54.630> go<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.140> site<00:01:55.350> and

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
that because they go to the site and

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.440 
that because they go to the site and
actually<00:01:55.979> they<00:01:56.280> have<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.670> flower<00:01:56.820> spike<00:01:57.210> that

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
actually they have the flower spike that

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.260 
actually they have the flower spike that
pulls<00:01:57.869> as<00:01:58.170> well<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.829> center<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.250> mass<00:01:59.490> changes

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
pulls as well the center of mass changes

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.179 
pulls as well the center of mass changes
and<00:02:00.719> will<00:02:00.899> no<00:02:01.049> longer<00:02:01.290> be<00:02:01.590> in<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.799> middle<00:02:02.009> it

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
and will no longer be in the middle it

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.740 
and will no longer be in the middle it
will<00:02:02.310> go<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.520> one<00:02:02.790> side<00:02:03.060> which<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.600> not

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
will go to one side which is not

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.889 
will go to one side which is not
supported<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.560> will<00:02:04.680> tip<00:02:04.890> over<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.899> yeah

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
supported and it will tip over and yeah

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.260 
supported and it will tip over and yeah
what<00:02:07.110> he<00:02:07.290> can<00:02:07.500> do<00:02:07.770> about<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.099> actually<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.789> to

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
what he can do about it actually is to

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.780 
what he can do about it actually is to
try<00:02:09.599> to

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
try to

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.059 
try to
you<00:02:11.790> know<00:02:11.909> attach<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.810> Canes<00:02:13.110> together<00:02:13.829> like

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
you know attach the Canes together like

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.149 
you know attach the Canes together like
so<00:02:14.310> try<00:02:14.549> to<00:02:14.579> wrap<00:02:14.939> them<00:02:15.209> with<00:02:15.810> some<00:02:16.349> wire<00:02:16.709> of

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
so try to wrap them with some wire of

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.490 
so try to wrap them with some wire of
course<00:02:17.459> if<00:02:17.579> you<00:02:17.670> have<00:02:17.849> some<00:02:18.209> more<00:02:18.810> canes<00:02:19.170> it's

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
course if you have some more canes it's

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.990 
course if you have some more canes it's
gonna<00:02:19.680> work<00:02:19.829> better<00:02:20.069> because<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.549> can<00:02:20.670> wrap

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
gonna work better because you can wrap

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.030 
gonna work better because you can wrap
them<00:02:21.239> together<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:21.780> can<00:02:21.810> bring<00:02:22.140> them<00:02:22.349> closer

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
them together you can bring them closer

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.770 
them together you can bring them closer
together<00:02:23.400> they<00:02:23.819> will<00:02:23.939> start<00:02:24.209> to<00:02:24.329> pull<00:02:24.540> on<00:02:24.659> each

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
together they will start to pull on each

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.250 
together they will start to pull on each
other<00:02:25.079> like<00:02:26.069> this<00:02:26.819> more<00:02:27.359> than<00:02:27.810> they<00:02:27.959> would<00:02:28.109> go

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
other like this more than they would go

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.360 
other like this more than they would go
to<00:02:28.319> one<00:02:28.620> side

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
to one side

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.460 
to one side
you're<00:02:29.670> gonna<00:02:29.849> balance<00:02:30.420> all<00:02:30.689> these<00:02:30.930> forces

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
you're gonna balance all these forces

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.410 
you're gonna balance all these forces
and<00:02:31.650> what<00:02:32.069> you're<00:02:32.280> gonna<00:02:32.489> try<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.760> do<00:02:33.000> is<00:02:33.120> to

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
and what you're gonna try to do is to

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.199 
and what you're gonna try to do is to
make<00:02:34.409> the<00:02:34.560> center<00:02:34.829> of<00:02:34.920> mass<00:02:35.129> go<00:02:35.519> to<00:02:35.579> the<00:02:35.819> middle

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
make the center of mass go to the middle

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.539 
make the center of mass go to the middle
once<00:02:36.450> again<00:02:36.629> because<00:02:37.049> because<00:02:37.590> this<00:02:37.769> is<00:02:38.010> where

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
once again because because this is where

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.839 
once again because because this is where
the<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:39.209> orchid<00:02:39.510> is<00:02:39.629> the<00:02:39.870> most<00:02:40.200> stable<00:02:40.859> so

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
the the orchid is the most stable so

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.849 
the the orchid is the most stable so
yeah<00:02:42.269> this<00:02:42.480> is<00:02:42.599> what<00:02:42.750> I<00:02:42.780> did<00:02:43.019> with<00:02:43.200> this<00:02:43.409> one<00:02:43.650> of

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859 
yeah this is what I did with this one of

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:46.309 
yeah this is what I did with this one of
course<00:02:44.190> I<00:02:44.340> only<00:02:44.549> have<00:02:45.120> two<00:02:45.389> canes<00:02:45.780> so<00:02:46.170> my

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
course I only have two canes so my

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.869 
course I only have two canes so my
center<00:02:46.560> of<00:02:46.680> gravity's<00:02:47.099> really<00:02:47.549> not<00:02:47.700> in<00:02:47.819> the

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
center of gravity's really not in the

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.180 
center of gravity's really not in the
middle<00:02:48.180> it's<00:02:48.359> summer<00:02:48.599> around<00:02:48.870> here<00:02:49.319> you<00:02:49.980> can

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
middle it's summer around here you can

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.809 
middle it's summer around here you can
see<00:02:50.370> so<00:02:50.549> it's<00:02:50.639> still<00:02:50.879> wobbly<00:02:51.299> like<00:02:51.480> so<00:02:52.819> but

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
see so it's still wobbly like so but

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.809 
see so it's still wobbly like so but
yeah<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.420> hope<00:02:54.720> you<00:02:54.810> got<00:02:55.049> the<00:02:55.230> idea

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
yeah I hope you got the idea

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.280 
yeah I hope you got the idea
bringing<00:02:56.819> the<00:02:56.970> Canes<00:02:57.269> closer<00:02:57.930> together

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
bringing the Canes closer together

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.379 
bringing the Canes closer together
making<00:02:58.829> them<00:02:59.159> pull<00:02:59.430> on<00:02:59.579> each<00:02:59.730> other<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.209> will

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
making them pull on each other it will

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.929 
making them pull on each other it will
help<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:01.079> tremendously<00:03:01.370> because<00:03:02.370> even<00:03:02.819> if

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939 
help you tremendously because even if

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:04.610 
help you tremendously because even if
you<00:03:03.030> place<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.510> stake<00:03:03.810> like<00:03:04.049> I<00:03:04.079> showed<00:03:04.409> you

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
you place the stake like I showed you

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.830 
you place the stake like I showed you
the<00:03:04.769> bamboo<00:03:05.099> skewer<00:03:05.430> you're<00:03:06.120> you're<00:03:06.599> still

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
the bamboo skewer you're you're still

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.720 
the bamboo skewer you're you're still
gonna<00:03:06.989> solve<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.500> issue<00:03:07.680> of<00:03:07.889> the<00:03:08.310> cane<00:03:08.549> and

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
gonna solve the issue of the cane and

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.869 
gonna solve the issue of the cane and
the<00:03:08.849> flower<00:03:09.030> spike<00:03:09.680> pulling<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.879> actual

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
the flower spike pulling the actual

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.809 
the flower spike pulling the actual
orchid<00:03:12.180> if<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.840> can<00:03:13.019> call<00:03:13.200> it<00:03:13.230> like<00:03:13.470> that<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:14.489> one

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
orchid if I can call it like that to one

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.869 
orchid if I can call it like that to one
side<00:03:14.849> and<00:03:15.629> destabilizing<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.620> whole<00:03:16.919> you

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:17.879 
side and destabilizing the whole you

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:23.449 
side and destabilizing the whole you
know<00:03:17.940> balance<00:03:18.540> point<00:03:19.699> and<00:03:20.699> even<00:03:20.940> if<00:03:21.329> the<00:03:22.459> the

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
know balance point and even if the the

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.699 
know balance point and even if the the
spike<00:03:23.790> itself<00:03:24.209> is<00:03:24.359> not<00:03:24.540> heavy<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.169> longer<00:03:25.590> it

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
spike itself is not heavy the longer it

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.520 
spike itself is not heavy the longer it
is<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.889> more<00:03:26.129> it<00:03:26.609> will<00:03:26.639> destabilize<00:03:27.530> the

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
is the more it will destabilize the

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.610 
is the more it will destabilize the
whole<00:03:28.560> orchid<00:03:29.250> also<00:03:30.030> you<00:03:30.329> can<00:03:30.540> use<00:03:30.810> decorative

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
whole orchid also you can use decorative

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.009 
whole orchid also you can use decorative
pots<00:03:31.919> pots<00:03:32.519> they're<00:03:33.000> good<00:03:33.239> they're<00:03:33.629> pretty

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
pots pots they're good they're pretty

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.899 
pots pots they're good they're pretty
heavy<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.409> they<00:03:34.799> will<00:03:34.949> support<00:03:35.310> it<00:03:35.489> even<00:03:35.790> if

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
heavy and they will support it even if

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:37.789 
heavy and they will support it even if
it's<00:03:36.090> wobbly<00:03:36.629> but<00:03:37.049> of<00:03:37.199> course<00:03:37.440> we<00:03:37.650> have<00:03:37.769> a

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
it's wobbly but of course we have a

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.969 
it's wobbly but of course we have a
super<00:03:38.519> huge<00:03:38.790> plant<00:03:39.120> it<00:03:39.329> will<00:03:39.449> not<00:03:40.440> work<00:03:40.919> so

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:40.979 
super huge plant it will not work so

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:43.550 
super huge plant it will not work so
great<00:03:41.459> it<00:03:42.030> will<00:03:42.239> tip<00:03:42.419> over<00:03:42.569> if<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.139> plant<00:03:43.349> is

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
great it will tip over if the plant is

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.789 
great it will tip over if the plant is
too<00:03:43.949> heavy<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:44.609> one<00:03:44.760> side<00:03:45.060> so<00:03:45.810> yeah<00:03:46.319> try<00:03:46.680> to

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
too heavy to one side so yeah try to
