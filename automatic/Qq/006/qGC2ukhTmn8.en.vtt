00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
can almost guarantee the reason why the

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.050 
can almost guarantee the reason why the
dog<00:02:10.179> is<00:02:10.450> having<00:02:10.660> so<00:02:11.050> much<00:02:11.200> gas<00:02:11.590> and<00:02:12.010> kind<00:02:13.000> of

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
dog is having so much gas and kind of

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.930 
dog is having so much gas and kind of
not<00:02:13.660> firm<00:02:14.050> stools<00:02:14.530> it's<00:02:15.130> because<00:02:15.580> of<00:02:15.790> the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
not firm stools it's because of the

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.570 
not firm stools it's because of the
protein<00:02:16.570> and<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.840> fat<00:02:17.080> content<00:02:17.410> Blue<00:02:18.340> Buffalo

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
protein and the fat content Blue Buffalo

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.420 
protein and the fat content Blue Buffalo
has<00:02:19.210> one<00:02:19.540> of<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.720> highest<00:02:19.930> protein<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:21.190> fat

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
has one of the highest protein and fat

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.020 
has one of the highest protein and fat
contents<00:02:22.360> in<00:02:22.630> their<00:02:22.930> puppy<00:02:23.260> food<00:02:23.500> so<00:02:24.190> this<00:02:24.820> one

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
contents in their puppy food so this one

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.980

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
is less and this one is also it's got

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.230 
is less and this one is also it's got
brown<00:02:29.500> rice<00:02:29.800> and<00:02:30.070> oatmeal<00:02:30.310> which<00:02:30.850> is<00:02:31.030> going<00:02:31.180> to

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
brown rice and oatmeal which is going to

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.510 
brown rice and oatmeal which is going to
be<00:02:31.360> good<00:02:31.600> for<00:02:31.900> his<00:02:32.170> belly<00:02:32.590> for<00:02:33.010> his<00:02:33.130> digestion
