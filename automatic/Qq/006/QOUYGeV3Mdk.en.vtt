00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.500
 [Music] 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.000
 now I'm going to teach how to make a 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.840
 sunflower in a cupcake for it 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.700
 we need the mouthpiece 67 and warn them 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.800
 that when I buy it is the mouthpiece 67 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.210
 it comes closed it's worth then and for a long 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.310
 that you try to be the cream is going to 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.510
 leave the petal well you have to open it 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.460
 well putting a knife or well 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.180
 putting a spatula so that it opens 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.860
 a little part of the tip we are going to 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.989
 work on a cupcake as we have 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.730
 said and in the center we will place 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.170
 something brown 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.489
 we are going to put a coin of 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.250
 chocolate but you can also use 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:48.900
 a mini oreo that is very funny we 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.900
 we focus well and start working 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.440
 the first layer 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.440
 we're going to do very very tiny him 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.440
 we put 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.940
 that's right, and we're making little sheets 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.300
 around 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.820
 of sunflower 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.980
 the beautiful thing is that it stays inside that 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.920
 hairline that is going to give it a very 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.180
 authentic 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.180
 we are turning it 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.210
 if you can find a support on the finger 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.780
 it's much better because if you support yourself like this 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.509
 We will tremble push the cupcake 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.780
 we go spinning even though we start 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:34.360
 working very perpendicular in a 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.760
 45 degree angle almost then we're going to 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.840
 go taking us so that he 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:44.369
 the fallen of the leaf goes varying 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:48.259
 and pushing and going and every time I go 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.259
 making the largest leaves 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:56.310
 and now the third round I'm going to 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.310
 push a lot more 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.890
 I'm always pulling up so that 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.730
 then I have the option to get under 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.730
 from that same sheet 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.800
 if we worked down, they would not give us 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.800
 that option 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:24.680
 and now let's do another round more 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.950
 [Music] 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.400
 It looks very nice if we put it in the 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.620
 center a fondant ladybug because 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.780
 the contrast of red and yellow then 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.600
 It is very funny 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.910
 and it is done very quickly 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.050
 and they are very resultÃ³n is in a table 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.920
 birthday 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.730
 [Music] 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.590
 with a snack 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.420
 seems much more elaborate what 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.819
 they are really going to do the last 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.180
 turn so you can not see what you see 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.470
 still a little the cupcake and the last 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.530
 back so we have to tilt 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.520
 much the sleeve and push so that it does not 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.679
 see the cupcake 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.679
 [Music] 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.610
 [Music] 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.450
 we have almost done our cupcake 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.450
 sunflower 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.549
 and it's finished 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:36.620
