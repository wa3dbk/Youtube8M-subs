00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
hazzard now that would be a ver all

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.060 
hazzard now that would be a ver all
alright<00:01:36.659> Van<00:01:36.900> Dam<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.170> Godzilla<00:01:37.680> versus

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
alright Van Dam and Godzilla versus

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.190 
alright Van Dam and Godzilla versus
Bruce<00:01:38.280> Lee<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.579> gamera<00:01:38.909> well<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.659> think<00:01:39.869> that

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
Bruce Lee and gamera well I think that

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.920 
Bruce Lee and gamera well I think that
Bruce<00:01:40.500> Lee<00:01:40.740> could<00:01:41.040> take<00:01:41.250> van<00:01:41.490> Damme<00:01:41.790> or<00:01:42.390> at

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
Bruce Lee could take van Damme or at

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.649 
Bruce Lee could take van Damme or at
least<00:01:43.049> he<00:01:43.290> could<00:01:43.619> have<00:01:43.649> many<00:01:43.979> years<00:01:44.220> ago<00:01:44.340> and

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
least he could have many years ago and

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.270 
least he could have many years ago and
Godzilla<00:01:45.659> would<00:01:45.899> definitely<00:01:46.380> take<00:01:46.560> camera<00:01:47.009> so

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
Godzilla would definitely take camera so

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.910 
Godzilla would definitely take camera so
my<00:01:47.729> guess<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.479> would<00:01:48.630> be<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.810> draw<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.770> lot

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
my guess is it would be a draw and a lot

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.819 
my guess is it would be a draw and a lot
of<00:01:50.070> fun<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.340> watch<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:50.970> we<00:01:51.090> can<00:01:51.210> only<00:01:51.329> hope<00:01:51.600> that

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
of fun to watch so we can only hope that

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.100 
of fun to watch so we can only hope that
through<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.950> miracles<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.869> space-time<00:01:54.869> or

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
through the miracles of space-time or

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.899 
through the miracles of space-time or
animation<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.130> somehow<00:01:56.430> happens

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
animation that that somehow happens

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.060 
animation that that somehow happens
because<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.960> would<00:01:58.049> be<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.290> lot<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.590> fun<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.920> a

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
because that would be a lot of fun and a

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.789
