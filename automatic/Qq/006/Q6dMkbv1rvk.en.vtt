00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
two other main green features we do have

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.140 
two other main green features we do have
is<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:23.409> recycling<00:01:24.409> of<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:24.970> irrigation<00:01:25.970> and

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
is the recycling of the irrigation and

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.840 
is the recycling of the irrigation and
rainwater<00:01:26.360> we've<00:01:27.350> got<00:01:27.530> a<00:01:27.560> pond<00:01:27.890> on<00:01:28.280> this<00:01:28.520> site

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
rainwater we've got a pond on this site

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.570 
rainwater we've got a pond on this site
where<00:01:29.600> we<00:01:29.659> pump<00:01:30.200> our<00:01:30.380> irrigation<00:01:30.680> water<00:01:31.159> from

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
where we pump our irrigation water from

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.190 
where we pump our irrigation water from
and<00:01:32.180> it's<00:01:32.360> caught<00:01:32.540> up<00:01:32.690> in<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:32.960> drainage

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
and it's caught up in the drainage

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.830 
and it's caught up in the drainage
system<00:01:33.400> which<00:01:34.400> takes<00:01:35.000> it<00:01:35.150> back<00:01:35.330> down<00:01:35.540> to<00:01:35.810> the

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
system which takes it back down to the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.690 
system which takes it back down to the
pond<00:01:36.200> again<00:01:36.380> and<00:01:36.710> it's<00:01:36.830> recycled<00:01:37.190> back<00:01:37.670> into

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
pond again and it's recycled back into

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.600 
pond again and it's recycled back into
the<00:01:38.240> irrigation<00:01:39.080> system<00:01:39.530> we're<00:01:40.250> also<00:01:40.399> using
