00:00:03.172 --> 00:00:05.841
 Welcome everyone to watch Tech a Look, I am Yao Wei. 

00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:09.814
 The product to be introduced today is the 14-inch touch screen launched by GIGABYTE. 

00:00:09.814 --> 00:00:13.054
 Ultrabook model is U2442T 

00:00:13.054 --> 00:00:15.576
 Ok, let's see what accessories are there? 

00:00:15.576 --> 00:00:20.376
 Some are chargers, and there is a manual. 

00:00:20.376 --> 00:00:22.148
 And one copy of the guarantee 

00:00:22.148 --> 00:00:24.392
 There is also a product CD 

00:00:24.392 --> 00:00:27.141
 Ok, now I am taking it with Gigabyte. 

00:00:27.141 --> 00:00:30.626
 Ultrabook U2442T Let's take a look at its appearance 

00:00:30.626 --> 00:00:36.519
 Did you see that its appearance is a metallic silver hairline 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:38.803
 Ok, let's see the side of it first. 

00:00:38.803 --> 00:00:42.184
 On the side we can see that this hole is the charging jack 

00:00:42.184 --> 00:00:46.441
 And HDMI slot, come again, USB3.0 slot 

00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:50.033
 And a slot that can hold an SD card 

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:54.533
 The other side we can see is the anti-theft jack 

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:58.740
 And the jack of the headset microphone, as well as the slot of USB2.0 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:04.272
 And VGA jack, there is a network jack~ 

00:01:04.272 --> 00:01:06.745
 Then we can see the back of it. 

00:01:06.745 --> 00:01:08.813
 In fact, you don't have to worry about it being overheated. 

00:01:08.813 --> 00:01:15.288
 Because it has this vent for the CPU and GPU 

00:01:15.288 --> 00:01:17.889
 Ok, let's take a look inside. 

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:21.447
 What does it look like in the end? 

00:01:21.447 --> 00:01:23.289
 Ok, we can see it. 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:26.751
 Ultrabook 14吋 touch screen 

00:01:26.751 --> 00:01:29.134
 Ok, we saw that the screen is 14! 

00:01:29.134 --> 00:01:35.401
 And we can see that it is an operating system with Windows 8. 

00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:37.310
 So it is very convenient to use 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.899
 And its resolution is 1366 x 768 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:43.566
 Now let's take a look 

00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:45.310
 It's this specification 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.143
 Ok, we can see that its CPU is Intel CORE i5 3230M 

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:56.546
 And its standalone graphics card is the NVDIA GeForce GT 730M 

00:01:56.546 --> 00:01:59.866
 Then it is using 8GB DDR3 

00:01:59.866 --> 00:02:02.893
 And 128G SSD 

00:02:02.893 --> 00:02:06.809
 Ok, let's take a look at its keyboard now. 

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:09.380
 The feature is that it is actually backlit 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.639
 So it’s very cool when I’m at night. 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:18.284
 In fact, Gigabyte has also designed some special features for it. 

00:02:18.284 --> 00:02:22.641
 We can see the next side of this Power button 

00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:27.227
 There is a button called Smart Manager. 

00:02:27.227 --> 00:02:31.617
 We can see that it has some exclusive features and some shortcuts 

00:02:31.617 --> 00:02:35.732
 You see that we can make a adjustment here very convenient 

00:02:35.732 --> 00:02:39.139
 And then we can see below the Bar below 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:41.084
 Have this Smart Switch 

00:02:41.084 --> 00:02:46.881
 If you want to switch this, you can switch the mode you want. 

00:02:46.881 --> 00:02:49.390
 Like the boot mode, which one can switch at will 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.975
 And if you want to shut down or sleep mode, you can make an adjustment here. 

00:02:54.975 --> 00:02:57.642
 Ok, the above is the introduction today. 

00:02:57.642 --> 00:03:01.061
