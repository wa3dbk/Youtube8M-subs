00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.749 

so<00:00:02.850> here<00:00:03.330> is<00:00:03.419> an<00:00:03.600> animation<00:00:03.810> of<00:00:04.440> an<00:00:05.100> orbit

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
so here is an animation of an orbit

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.740 
so here is an animation of an orbit
around<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.330> brain<00:00:07.639> let's<00:00:08.639> try<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.150> create<00:00:09.570> a

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
around the brain let's try to create a

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.350 
around the brain let's try to create a
stereo<00:00:10.440> video<00:00:10.800> from<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.550> animation<00:00:12.120> that<00:00:12.269> we

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
stereo video from the animation that we

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:29.820 
stereo video from the animation that we
have

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:36.110 

to<00:00:30.430> export<00:00:31.030> a<00:00:31.259> stereo<00:00:32.259> video<00:00:32.910> go<00:00:33.910> to<00:00:33.970> file/save

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
to export a stereo video go to file/save

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.850 
to export a stereo video go to file/save
animation<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:39.870> now<00:00:40.870> let's<00:00:41.140> change<00:00:41.410> the<00:00:41.650> frame

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
animation and now let's change the frame

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.180 
animation and now let's change the frame
rate<00:00:42.070> to<00:00:42.100> 30<00:00:42.550> frames<00:00:42.850> per<00:00:43.330> second<00:00:43.780> and<00:00:44.350> since<00:00:45.040> I

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
rate to 30 frames per second and since I

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.580 
rate to 30 frames per second and since I
have<00:00:45.280> 300<00:00:45.910> frames<00:00:46.150> this<00:00:46.540> will<00:00:46.750> be<00:00:46.840> a<00:00:46.870> 10<00:00:47.199> second

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
have 300 frames this will be a 10 second

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.080 
have 300 frames this will be a 10 second
video<00:00:48.269> changed<00:00:49.269> the<00:00:49.449> resolution<00:00:49.600> to<00:00:50.850> 1920<00:00:51.850> by

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
video changed the resolution to 1920 by

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.570 
video changed the resolution to 1920 by
1080<00:00:52.629> and<00:00:53.400> stereo<00:00:54.400> mode<00:00:54.640> to<00:00:55.000> left<00:00:55.360> eye<00:00:55.540> only<00:00:56.580> we

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:57.580 
1080 and stereo mode to left eye only we

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.729 
1080 and stereo mode to left eye only we
will<00:00:57.790> export<00:00:58.330> the<00:00:58.510> left<00:00:58.690> eye<00:00:58.809> view<00:00:59.019> first<00:00:59.290> and

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
will export the left eye view first and

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.479 
will export the left eye view first and
then<00:00:59.949> export<00:01:00.430> the<00:01:00.610> right<00:01:00.790> eye<00:01:00.820> view<00:01:01.090> later<00:01:02.489> now

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
then export the right eye view later now

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:16.170 
then export the right eye view later now
change<00:01:04.120> your<00:01:04.780> directory<00:01:05.260> and<00:01:05.740> name<00:01:06.310> your<00:01:06.520> file

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:24.870 

and<00:01:16.320> click<00:01:17.320> ok<00:01:21.780> after<00:01:22.780> it<00:01:23.560> finishes<00:01:24.310> rendering

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
and click ok after it finishes rendering

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:36.110 
and click ok after it finishes rendering
we<00:01:25.690> will<00:01:25.900> export<00:01:26.440> the<00:01:26.740> right<00:01:27.010> eye<00:01:27.040> view

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:44.050 

you

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.359 

now<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.119> export<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.990> right<00:01:46.170> eye<00:01:46.200> view<00:01:46.619> go<00:01:47.159> back

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
now to export the right eye view go back

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.429 
now to export the right eye view go back
to<00:01:47.640> file<00:01:48.259> save<00:01:49.259> animation<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:51.170> now<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.229> have

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
to file save animation and now you have

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.139 
to file save animation and now you have
to<00:01:52.560> make<00:01:52.710> sure<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.429> settings<00:01:53.909> are

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
to make sure that the settings are

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.340 
to make sure that the settings are
exactly<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.869> same<00:01:56.420> so<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.600> framerate<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.079> 30

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
exactly the same so the framerate is 30

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.800 
exactly the same so the framerate is 30
frames<00:01:58.710> per<00:01:58.799> second<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.399> the<00:02:00.000> resolution<00:02:00.600> is

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
frames per second and the resolution is

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.969 
frames per second and the resolution is
1920<00:02:01.799> by<00:02:01.950> 1080<00:02:02.929> I'll<00:02:03.929> change<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.439> row<00:02:04.500> mode<00:02:04.740> to

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
1920 by 1080 I'll change the row mode to

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:13.839 
1920 by 1080 I'll change the row mode to
right<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.399> only<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:06.770> name<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:08.039> file<00:02:09.950> click<00:02:10.950> OK

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.750 

after<00:02:14.849> it<00:02:15.660> finishes<00:02:16.049> rendering<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:17.370> have<00:02:17.579> a

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
after it finishes rendering you have a

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.809 
after it finishes rendering you have a
left<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.150> right<00:02:18.299> eye<00:02:18.810> view<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.319> a<00:02:20.040> stereo
