00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
experienced a lot of shedding on the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.969 
experienced a lot of shedding on the
second<00:01:03.539> day<00:01:03.570> or<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.439> second<00:01:04.830> day<00:01:04.890> after

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
second day or the second day after

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.530 
second day or the second day after
instant<00:01:05.689> installation<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:08.030> like<00:01:09.030> for<00:01:09.360> today

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
instant installation and like for today

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.840 
instant installation and like for today
I<00:01:09.689> didn't<00:01:10.140> experience<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.280> much<00:01:11.460> shedding

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
I didn't experience that much shedding

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.429 
I didn't experience that much shedding
so<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.030> guess<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.390> was<00:01:12.479> because<00:01:12.600> like<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.229> was

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439
