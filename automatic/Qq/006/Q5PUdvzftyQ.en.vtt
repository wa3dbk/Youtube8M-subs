00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.550
 then you just go with your volkswagen 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.800
 Maybe the bad luck will come tomorrow 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.799
 somehow we make someone out 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.839
 otherwise a huge hype is apparently 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.830
 not there you have to get started double 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.449
 must now discuss what 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.070
 has made less fun today at the 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.660
 to stand or watch it was 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.029
 really a black day you can 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.060
 say through and through or 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.939
 yes you are right so we have us 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.910
 made more substantial and more 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:35.430
 and we have little today 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.719
 from implemented how is that for you 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.270
 the space-time has at the moment the feeling 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.620
 actually you can try everything on 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.910
 tactics and setup but how 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.989
 everything is not working right now because 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.820
 the team simply out of the joints 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.930
 that's the way it is for you too 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.690
 feel or do you have another one 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.789
 statement 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.170
 You 're going to play a game like today 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.920
 It can be a huge floor again 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.660
 do well 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.570
 the other teams have too 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.570
 lost and then I think the same 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.000
 Almost the first shot in it again 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:06.299
 and the time enormously down the sea 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.520
 the size at the second action the 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.960
 second clearly to early again 20 behind 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.420
 and of course extremely difficult 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.530
 I would probably come back 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.060
 also similar to that 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.380
 Outsider you do yourself we are 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.350
 hard to look for explanations 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.390
 because you can not say consistently 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.470
 the squad is still too poorly staffed 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.830
 in the first round really good football 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.070
 played and in the first round only a few 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.750
 bad games are actually there 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.520
 there is something that you can wear 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.790
 What fault is it that in the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.860
 back round so much worse that runs 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.420
 if we knew what it is then 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.909
 I think we already have 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.899
 changed as I just said 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.930
 if we have so much again 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.270
 made today would have such a 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.590
 make a huge leap forward 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.840
 yes then it is so sooner 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.149
 to apply and that is extremely annoying 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.039
 Of course, there are discussions right now 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.320
 There are moods where then would be said yes 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.579
 Something you have to change now 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.219
 which approaches you can give him around 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.259
 actually there get out of the hole 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.409
 it would be two home games now 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.360
 first a heavy away game more 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.849
 as likely to work on it 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.280
 you do not or he we have to first 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.840
 Now get the heads free again 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.950
 that we in the cabin dead we ask 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.620
 were completely on the ground 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.239
 I think that the coach is over now 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.340
 week find the right measures 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.290
 That's what we're doing with a right one 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.450
 Good attitude again on the weekend 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.370
 in difficult and there then clearly 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.640
 better play completely the impression 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.079
 that he is actually abroad at the moment 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.130
 less problems than you at home where 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.090
 you have to do the game because the 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.860
 work in the last three 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.120
 played away one point each 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.860
 and actually relatively stable 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.690
 belongs despite the arrears 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.310
 yes that's true in the last 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.950
 It was stopped playing early in the morning 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.849
 come slipping come residue 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.360
 are but then again 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:53.280
 come back clear if one we 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.540
 self-confidence is lacking in security 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.829
 of course it's hard, too 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.109
 to do the game yourself 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.549
 So it also falls on gladbacher before 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:02.069
 Also a game where you where , too 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:04.590
 certainly from the gameplay not as 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.510
 simple situation had so out now 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.400
 can one this uncertainty so the 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.260
 do not notice mars or yes i mean 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.670
 that the playful also lacks he 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.750
 today a bit far too if 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.030
 Then you are back two times 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.440
 then lacked the safety and when it 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.620
 hard to play forward 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.989
 today also little chances no no 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.950
 clear chances to win 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.209
 because the opponent then, of course, too 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.090
 If he can, he can 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.840
 withdraw can lurk on the counter and 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.380
 normally this would have to be with us 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.030
 say you have a relative 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.230
 You have to say with such a season 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.489
 various injuries again 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.400
 until now that she is now 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.500
 Once again, how far are you 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.410
 or how are you at your 100th 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.030
 percent I think there is still one missing 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.770
 whole piece I was almost half 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.910
 year out 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.500
 I I almost nothing done 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.780
 I had two serious injuries 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.820
 I can go there after two weeks 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.100
 by no means be 100 percent 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.330
 but I am now before me 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.470
 I am healthy and I hope that I am 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.010
 Team still a bit far 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.960
 can help 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.540
 we also have to match again 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.890
 get twitter questions where to ask how 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.950
 you need many painkillers 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.350
 such a lot 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.550
 This week I went there I am 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.209
 I'm the one without the game 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.420
 come out 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.890
 but I have the last week 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.230
 in the car quite a lot of things done 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.900
 I have three over the whole week 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.150
 taken three pieces a day and big 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.050
 the next the game again which 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.750
 that will be up after the game 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.250
 clearly noticeable 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.180
 but in fact it is so that one 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.500
 end in sight so this 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.200
 painkiller time is with you now 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.910
 soon you see so far now 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.530
 light at the end of the tunnel that you believe 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:47.110
 that you are the season free of complaints too 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:49.780
 I can play the end I hope I notice 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.080
 Of course that's even my time 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.490
 knee 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:57.490
 who is not quite back 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:59.140
 But one hundred percent is yes 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.790
 I believe the time is there 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.780
 something to this old farmer rule 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.240
 which one always says that one in the principle 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.919
 roughly as long as you need except 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.760
 was fighting back to the right in the 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.620
 track to come 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.479
 I hope not because then it still takes 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.880
 a little bit I hope that faster 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:16.360
 then go ask difficult questions from 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.120
 benny was the reunion with diego yes 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.860
 I now imagine differently 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.800
 Clear with you god I'm not quite like that 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.060
 played together for a long time because you are longer 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.410
 was nice to see again but i would have 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.360
 rather won 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.710
 and last question from dominik about 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.780
 twitter input of the game meanwhile 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.010
 his fifth season for green-white you see 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.680
 you are already in this young team as 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.390
 management player 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.370
 yes I think that I am part of one 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.050
 take responsibility already by doing so 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.250
 I would like to have a young one, too 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.300
 I'm a player but I think I'm in 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.720
 the last years also my experience 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.530
 but that could be a question 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.940
 that could actually happen to me 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.220
 individual problems be that they are relative 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.720
 few players have those in these 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.520
 team could grow longer in pure 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.930
 really just a lot at once 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.530
 was changed at the same time 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.820
 team a very young 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:02.660
 has age structure and 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.920
 with the in Sebastian Prödl and who 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.330
 a lot of clemens fritz actually only 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.240
 four players has really longer than 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.150
 one and a half to two years are very 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.440
 good but a preliminary round has indeed 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.570
 worked better than now I believe that 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.670
 is not the reason why it is always now 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.780
 not going so well 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.220
 who actually makes enough players 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.930
 who can handle the booklet 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.790
 So that's what I do not think so 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.530
 philipp bargfrede here thank you 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.550
 Here what I always think so one 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.380
 then do not quite do such a game 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.150
 that much fun you do too 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.660
 autographs I can say 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:34.280
 There are no typing champions today 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.530
 it may also be understood as 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.510
 Sapphire finds a symptom free 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.950
 rest season and soon the points so we 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.270
 Maybe you can breathe a bit 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.310
 already in leverkusen now there are 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.700
 autographs and we say thank you philipp 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.700
