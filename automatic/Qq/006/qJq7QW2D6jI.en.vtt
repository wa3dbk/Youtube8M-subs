00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
this machine we're going to do things a

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.669 
this machine we're going to do things a
bit<00:00:29.939> different<00:00:30.359> but<00:00:30.900> first<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.349> all<00:00:31.470> let's

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
bit different but first of all let's

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.229 
bit different but first of all let's
take<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.890> look<00:00:32.160> at<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.369> resources<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:32.969> we're

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
take a look at the resources that we're

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.660 
take a look at the resources that we're
going<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.450> need<00:00:33.600> we<00:00:34.320> will<00:00:34.500> need<00:00:34.649> 87<00:00:35.309> building

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
going to need we will need 87 building

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.810 
going to need we will need 87 building
blocks<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.270> 12<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.649> then<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.160> water<00:00:38.370> buckets

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
blocks and 12 and then to water buckets

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.310 
blocks and 12 and then to water buckets
that<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.149> can<00:00:39.329> make<00:00:39.480> an<00:00:39.629> infinite<00:00:40.020> amount<00:00:40.050> of

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
that you can make an infinite amount of

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.290 
that you can make an infinite amount of
water<00:00:40.559> then<00:00:41.520> we're<00:00:41.700> going<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.879> use<00:00:42.059> two

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
water then we're going to use two

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.720 
water then we're going to use two
Pistons<00:00:42.809> eight<00:00:43.079> redstone<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:44.370> redstone

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
Pistons eight redstone to redstone

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.850 
Pistons eight redstone to redstone
repeaters<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.329> pressure<00:00:45.719> plate<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.289> free

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
repeaters a pressure plate and free

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.700 
repeaters a pressure plate and free
redstone<00:00:47.309> torches<00:00:48.110> so<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.289> machine<00:00:49.590> itself

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
redstone torches so the machine itself

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.639 
redstone torches so the machine itself
is<00:00:50.280> quite<00:00:50.489> long<00:00:50.820> it's<00:00:51.270> actually<00:00:51.539> 19<00:00:52.050> blocks

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
is quite long it's actually 19 blocks

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.590 
is quite long it's actually 19 blocks
and<00:00:53.010> that's<00:00:53.550> not<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.789> gold<00:00:54.090> blocks<00:00:54.390> we're

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
and that's not the gold blocks we're

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.840 
and that's not the gold blocks we're
counting<00:00:54.989> it's<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.710> blocks<00:00:55.949> inside<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.699> these

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
counting it's the blocks inside so these

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.819 
counting it's the blocks inside so these
ones<00:00:57.090> just<00:00:57.360> mark<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.809> outside<00:00:58.199> area<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:58.770> you

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
ones just mark the outside area so you

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.340 
ones just mark the outside area so you
can<00:00:58.920> see<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.460> it's<00:01:00.030> five<00:01:00.300> deep<00:01:00.600> it's<00:01:00.870> 19

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
can see that it's five deep it's 19

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.680 
can see that it's five deep it's 19
blocks<00:01:01.680> long<00:01:01.980> two<00:01:02.820> blocks<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.539> goes

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
blocks long two blocks I and it goes

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.460 
blocks long two blocks I and it goes
underground<00:01:04.500> by<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> few<00:01:05.250> blocks<00:01:05.519> as<00:01:05.729> well<00:01:06.470> to

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
underground by a few blocks as well to

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.899 
underground by a few blocks as well to
build<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:07.860> we're<00:01:08.100> going<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.250> dig<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> hole<00:01:08.700> at

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
build this we're going to dig a hole at

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.149 
build this we're going to dig a hole at

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.359 
block from the side we're going to dig
down<00:01:12.750> free<00:01:13.110> blocks<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.950> too<00:01:14.159> deep

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
down free blocks and this is too deep

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.670 
down free blocks and this is too deep
and<00:01:14.640> full<00:01:15.210> wide<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:15.960> at<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.350> bottom<00:01:16.560> we're

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
going to place the two blocks and put

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.149 
going to place the two blocks and put
two<00:01:18.570> redstone<00:01:18.810> wires<00:01:19.290> on<00:01:19.530> top<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.890> them<00:01:20.040> and

redstone repeater on the third saying
facing<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.500> way<00:01:25.560> then<00:01:26.159> we<00:01:26.310> can<00:01:26.340> place<00:01:26.700> these

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
facing this way then we can place these

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.640 
facing this way then we can place these
three<00:01:27.330> blocks<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.930> then<00:01:28.140> these<00:01:28.350> free

three blocks and then these free
redstone<00:01:29.100> wires<00:01:29.369> then<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.270> want<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.479> dig<00:01:30.659> down

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
redstone wires then you want to dig down

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.200 
redstone wires then you want to dig down
here<00:01:31.079> by<00:01:31.200> two<00:01:31.259> blocks<00:01:31.680> place<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.369> block<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.939> put

can<00:01:35.759> fill<00:01:35.939> this<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.810> white<00:01:37.110> wall<00:01:37.290> blocks

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
can fill this in the white wall blocks

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.800 
can fill this in the white wall blocks
represent<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.369> part<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.299> land<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.630> is

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
represent the part of the land that is

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.450 
represent the part of the land that is
essential<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.380> using<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.159> you're<00:01:41.280> going<00:01:41.369> to

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
essential to using it so you're going to

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.830 
essential to using it so you're going to
need<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.700> walk<00:01:41.880> up<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.240> down<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.600> bit<00:01:42.810> here

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
need to walk up and down this bit here

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.260 
need to walk up and down this bit here
and<00:01:43.259> that's<00:01:43.950> why<00:01:44.100> they're<00:01:44.310> marked<00:01:44.610> out<00:01:44.820> even

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
and that's why they're marked out even

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.639 
and that's why they're marked out even
though<00:01:45.360> their<00:01:45.540> level<00:01:45.840> with<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.079> ground<00:01:46.110> so

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
though their level with the ground so

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.920 
though their level with the ground so
you<00:01:46.740> can<00:01:46.890> go<00:01:47.040> ahead<00:01:47.159> fill<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.450> like<00:01:48.630> that

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
you can go ahead fill this in like that

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.490 
you can go ahead fill this in like that
then<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.100> 16<00:01:50.640> blocks<00:01:50.939> long<00:01:51.509> coming<00:01:52.320> all

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
then this is 16 blocks long coming all

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.170 
then this is 16 blocks long coming all
the<00:01:52.590> way<00:01:52.649> down<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.130> end<00:01:53.220> here<00:01:53.460> then

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
the way down to the end here then

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.670 
the way down to the end here then
diagonal<00:01:54.780> from<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.170> we're<00:01:55.320> going<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.470> dig

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
diagonal from that we're going to dig

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.319 
diagonal from that we're going to dig
down<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.920> block<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.369> place<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.610> redstone<00:01:56.939> torch

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
down a block and place a redstone torch

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.510 
down a block and place a redstone torch
and<00:01:57.780> then<00:01:58.200> behind<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:58.799> this<00:01:58.950> corner<00:01:59.369> we're

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
and then behind it in this corner we're

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.300 
and then behind it in this corner we're
going<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.700> use<00:01:59.850> these<00:02:00.090> four<00:02:00.360> blocks<00:02:01.189> now<00:02:02.189> we're

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
going to use these four blocks now we're

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.830 
going to use these four blocks now we're
going<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.490> place<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:02.969> block<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.600> side

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
going to place this block and the side

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.510 
going to place this block and the side
here<00:02:04.079> with<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.290> pressure<00:02:04.590> plate<00:02:04.860> next<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.340> it

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
here with a pressure plate next to it

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.639 
here with a pressure plate next to it
then<00:02:06.149> we<00:02:06.270> can<00:02:06.420> put<00:02:06.509> down<00:02:06.719> this<00:02:06.869> piston<00:02:07.350> on<00:02:07.469> top

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
then we can put down this piston on top

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.440 
then we can put down this piston on top
of<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.890> torch<00:02:08.129> on<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.489> previous<00:02:08.910> layer<00:02:09.149> put

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
of the torch on the previous layer put

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.479 
of the torch on the previous layer put
all<00:02:09.599> of<00:02:09.629> this<00:02:09.840> dirt<00:02:10.080> going<00:02:10.860> in<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.069> row<00:02:11.250> and

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
all of this dirt going in a row and

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.090 
all of this dirt going in a row and
stopping<00:02:12.000> just<00:02:12.360> before<00:02:12.660> this<00:02:12.780> red

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
stopping just before this red

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.160 
stopping just before this red
stone<00:02:13.280> torch<00:02:13.550> then<00:02:14.270> we<00:02:14.390> can<00:02:14.570> put<00:02:14.720> a<00:02:14.780> piston

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
stone torch then we can put a piston

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.440 
stone torch then we can put a piston
over<00:02:15.410> here<00:02:15.620> a<00:02:15.650> block<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.220> side<00:02:16.520> of<00:02:16.550> it<00:02:16.790> then

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
over here a block to the side of it then

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.600 
over here a block to the side of it then
these<00:02:17.660> free<00:02:17.930> redstone<00:02:18.350> wires<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:18.950> a<00:02:19.280> redstone

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
these free redstone wires and a redstone

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.420 
these free redstone wires and a redstone
repeater<00:02:20.030> facing<00:02:20.540> into<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:20.900> piston<00:02:21.430> then

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
repeater facing into the piston then

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.590 
repeater facing into the piston then
behind<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.820> dirt<00:02:23.060> we're<00:02:23.210> going<00:02:23.330> to<00:02:23.390> place<00:02:23.570> a

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
behind the dirt we're going to place a

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.170 
behind the dirt we're going to place a
block<00:02:23.960> either<00:02:24.440> end<00:02:24.740> and<00:02:24.980> then<00:02:25.400> blocks<00:02:25.910> behind

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
block either end and then blocks behind

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.020 
block either end and then blocks behind
where<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:26.840> water<00:02:27.020> is<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.980> last<00:02:28.340> of<00:02:28.550> all<00:02:28.640> once

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
where the water is and last of all once

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.370 
where the water is and last of all once
you<00:02:29.180> place<00:02:29.390> those<00:02:29.600> blocks<00:02:29.930> in<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.140> back

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
you place those blocks in the back

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.640 
you place those blocks in the back
you're<00:02:30.590> going<00:02:30.710> to<00:02:30.800> feel<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.070> same<00:02:31.250> of<00:02:31.400> water

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
you're going to feel the same of water

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.080 
you're going to feel the same of water
so<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.800> very<00:02:33.980> last<00:02:34.220> thing<00:02:34.370> that<00:02:34.520> we<00:02:34.790> need<00:02:34.820> to

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
so the very last thing that we need to

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.210 
so the very last thing that we need to
do<00:02:35.180> now<00:02:35.450> is<00:02:35.480> place<00:02:36.020> a<00:02:36.050> block<00:02:36.470> on<00:02:36.740> top<00:02:36.800> of<00:02:37.130> this

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
do now is place a block on top of this

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.760 
do now is place a block on top of this
piston<00:02:37.670> over<00:02:37.940> here<00:02:38.150> then<00:02:38.900> a<00:02:38.930> block<00:02:39.230> above<00:02:39.590> the

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
piston over here then a block above the

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.950 
piston over here then a block above the
gap<00:02:39.980> between<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.610> piston<00:02:40.790> and<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.360> dirt<00:02:41.750> and

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
gap between the piston and the dirt and

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.440 
gap between the piston and the dirt and
then<00:02:42.800> blocks<00:02:43.100> going<00:02:43.520> from<00:02:43.970> here<00:02:44.150> all<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.360> way

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
then blocks going from here all the way

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.150 
then blocks going from here all the way
down<00:02:44.750> to<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.960> end<00:02:45.080> covering<00:02:45.680> up<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:45.980> water

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
down to the end covering up the water

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.000 
down to the end covering up the water
and<00:02:46.580> then<00:02:47.180> you<00:02:47.300> can<00:02:47.450> get<00:02:47.630> home<00:02:47.930> and<00:02:48.170> turn<00:02:48.830> all

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
and then you can get home and turn all

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.950 
and then you can get home and turn all
this<00:02:49.280> dirt<00:02:49.580> into<00:02:50.540> farmland<00:02:52.570> so<00:02:53.570> that's<00:02:53.750> all

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
this dirt into farmland so that's all

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.780 
this dirt into farmland so that's all
there<00:02:54.110> is<00:02:54.140> to<00:02:54.500> it<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.950> machine<00:02:55.280> is<00:02:55.310> now<00:02:55.550> ready

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
there is to it the machine is now ready

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.160 
there is to it the machine is now ready
to<00:02:55.880> use<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.510> there's<00:02:56.720> a<00:02:56.780> couple<00:02:56.960> of<00:02:57.110> things

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
to use and there's a couple of things

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.660 
to use and there's a couple of things
that<00:02:57.560> I<00:02:57.590> want<00:02:57.770> to<00:02:57.800> clear<00:02:58.040> up<00:02:58.160> before<00:02:58.340> this

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
that I want to clear up before this

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.300 
that I want to clear up before this
tutorial<00:02:59.240> is<00:02:59.360> over<00:02:59.720> so<00:03:00.380> first<00:03:00.620> of<00:03:00.800> all<00:03:00.890> items

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
tutorial is over so first of all items

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.700 
tutorial is over so first of all items
can<00:03:01.520> fall<00:03:01.760> between<00:03:02.120> moving<00:03:02.510> blocks<00:03:02.840> but<00:03:03.530> when

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
can fall between moving blocks but when

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.650 
can fall between moving blocks but when
this<00:03:03.830> machine<00:03:04.250> is<00:03:04.430> harvested<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.150> items<00:03:05.450> get

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
this machine is harvested the items get

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.960 
this machine is harvested the items get
popped<00:03:05.930> up<00:03:06.170> into<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:06.710> air<00:03:06.740> so<00:03:07.490> by<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.730> time

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
popped up into the air so by the time
