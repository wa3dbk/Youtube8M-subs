project<00:00:05.279> I<00:00:10.309> was<00:00:11.309> thinking<00:00:11.700> one<00:00:11.849> day<00:00:12.030> that<00:00:12.240> the

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
project I was thinking one day that the

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.509 
project I was thinking one day that the
light<00:00:12.540> bulb<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:12.990> amazing<00:00:13.650> it's<00:00:14.099> probably<00:00:14.400> one

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
light bulb is amazing it's probably one

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.919 
light bulb is amazing it's probably one
of<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.670> greatest<00:00:14.940> inventions<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.660> all<00:00:15.870> time

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
of the greatest inventions of all time

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.930 
of the greatest inventions of all time
but<00:00:16.650> it<00:00:16.770> hasn't<00:00:17.039> really<00:00:17.130> changed<00:00:17.220> much<00:00:17.699> in<00:00:17.850> the

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
but it hasn't really changed much in the

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.260 
but it hasn't really changed much in the
last<00:00:18.210> hundred<00:00:18.359> years<00:00:19.310> switch<00:00:20.310> on<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:21.090> light

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
last hundred years switch on the light

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
mention how annoying it is when they

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.350 
mention how annoying it is when they
blow<00:00:30.689> these<00:00:31.650> traditional<00:00:32.309> bulbs<00:00:32.640> also<00:00:32.850> use

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
blow these traditional bulbs also use

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.670 
blow these traditional bulbs also use
heaps<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.809> power<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.290> those

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
heaps of power and those

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.069 
heaps of power and those
energy-efficient<00:00:35.640> fluro<00:00:36.030> globes<00:00:36.450> have<00:00:36.899> that

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
energy-efficient fluro globes have that

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.979 
energy-efficient fluro globes have that
cold<00:00:37.380> white<00:00:37.680> light<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.219> we<00:00:38.340> all<00:00:38.579> hate<00:00:38.960> so<00:00:39.960> I

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
cold white light that we all hate so I

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.600 
cold white light that we all hate so I
started<00:00:40.410> thinking<00:00:40.559> with<00:00:41.040> all<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.280> technology

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
started thinking with all the technology

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.819 
started thinking with all the technology
we've<00:00:42.030> got<00:00:42.210> these<00:00:42.390> days<00:00:42.660> surely<00:00:43.559> there<00:00:43.800> must

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
we've got these days surely there must

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.069 
we've got these days surely there must
be<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.219> better<00:00:44.430> way<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.940> mean<00:00:45.420> for<00:00:45.570> starters<00:00:45.930> it's

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
be a better way I mean for starters it's

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.389 
be a better way I mean for starters it's
not<00:00:46.200> like<00:00:46.350> we<00:00:46.440> get<00:00:46.590> up<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.829> change<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.190> TV

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
not like we get up to change the TV

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.410 
not like we get up to change the TV
channel<00:00:47.550> anymore

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
channel anymore

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.760 
channel anymore
so<00:00:48.690> why<00:00:48.840> do<00:00:48.899> we<00:00:49.050> still<00:00:49.230> do<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.530> with<00:00:49.649> our

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
so why do we still do that with our

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.990 
so why do we still do that with our
lights<00:00:51.079> well<00:00:52.079> six<00:00:52.649> months<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.370> that's<00:00:53.820> going

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
lights well six months and that's going

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000 
lights well six months and that's going
through<00:00:54.120> your<00:00:54.449> home<00:00:54.690> network<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.500> more<00:00:55.860> than

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
through your home network and more than

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.369 
through your home network and more than
a<00:00:56.100> dozen<00:00:56.309> prototypes<00:00:56.969> later<00:00:57.270> we've<00:00:58.020> managed

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
a dozen prototypes later we've managed

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.920 
a dozen prototypes later we've managed
to<00:00:58.469> create<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.010> world's<00:00:59.280> smartest
