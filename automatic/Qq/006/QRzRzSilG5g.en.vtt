 about freezing paper

 I will prepare the sheets first with the adhesive 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:19.139
 on paper not freezing and further according to plan 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:21.660
 on the printer and print the biggest joke 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:25.590
 in the fact that I was drawing blocks 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:28.530
 because as I saw them here is a bouquet 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.680
 is that the blocks are all perfect 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:34.639
 all blocks of different size and each 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.740
 change at the dacha by yourself 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:42.240
 so I only printed 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:46.020
 the central parts of the arom and I will cut 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.360
 separately and pumping the central part 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.750
 and then perry stop the main 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.750
 the size 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.500
 all the best to you
