hey this is Marc Menendez professional

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:04.849 
hey this is Marc Menendez professional
angler<00:00:03.990> here<00:00:04.170> with<00:00:04.319> you<00:00:04.440> and<00:00:04.589> I've<00:00:04.650> got<00:00:04.830> a

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
angler here with you and I've got a

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.460 
angler here with you and I've got a
couple<00:00:05.100> tips<00:00:05.460> here<00:00:05.759> about<00:00:06.509> using<00:00:07.080> your<00:00:07.230> bait

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
couple tips here about using your bait

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.490 
couple tips here about using your bait
casting<00:00:07.919> here<00:00:08.160> effectively<00:00:09.059> bait<00:00:09.990> casting<00:00:10.380> I

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
casting here effectively bait casting I

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.410 
casting here effectively bait casting I
use<00:00:10.710> about<00:00:10.920> 80%<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.730> time<00:00:11.910> in<00:00:12.059> my<00:00:12.179> fishing

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
use about 80% of the time in my fishing

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.870 
use about 80% of the time in my fishing
and<00:00:13.049> spinning<00:00:13.469> here<00:00:13.710> whatever<00:00:14.370> is<00:00:14.490> leftover

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
and spinning here whatever is leftover

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.880 
and spinning here whatever is leftover
so<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.210> bait<00:00:15.450> caster<00:00:15.630> does<00:00:16.049> most<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.560> my<00:00:16.680> work

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
so a bait caster does most of my work

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.400 
so a bait caster does most of my work
this<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.550> lose<00:00:17.880> tournament<00:00:18.449> EMG<00:00:18.810> spinner

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
here and there's a couple things you

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.810 
here and there's a couple things you
need<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.600> learn<00:00:24.900> about<00:00:25.109> casting<00:00:25.800> reels<00:00:26.010> first

need to learn about casting reels first
most<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.420> us<00:00:27.539> when<00:00:27.689> we<00:00:27.840> go<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.050> make<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.289> cast

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
most of us when we go to make a cast

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.060 
most of us when we go to make a cast
we<00:00:29.369> will<00:00:29.580> leave<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.300> reel<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:31.070> horizontal

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
we will leave the reel in a horizontal

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.340 
we will leave the reel in a horizontal
position<00:00:32.189> like<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:33.600> don't<00:00:33.870> need<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.170> do

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
position like that you don't need to do

that bait casting reels simply work

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.959 
that bait casting reels simply work
better<00:00:36.780> when<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.530> roll<00:00:37.890> your<00:00:38.190> wrist<00:00:38.399> over<00:00:38.700> and

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
learned in physics class years ago it's

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.180 
learned in physics class years ago it's
a<00:00:45.989> it's<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.410> property<00:00:46.739> called

way the world is going around and your
line<00:00:55.590> simply<00:00:56.250> comes<00:00:56.520> off<00:00:56.699> better<00:00:57.500> when<00:00:58.500> you

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
line simply comes off better when you

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.580 
line simply comes off better when you
turn<00:00:58.859> your<00:00:59.010> wrist<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.460> make<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.850> cast<00:01:00.590> by

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
turn your wrist and make that cast by

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.349 
turn your wrist and make that cast by
leaving<00:01:01.920> my<00:01:02.039> hand<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.460> way<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.910> casting<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
reel in a horizontal position all the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.609 
reel in a horizontal position all the
physics<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.420> world<00:01:06.450> are<00:01:06.960> fighting<00:01:07.470> one

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
physics of the world are fighting one

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.600 
physics of the world are fighting one
another<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.460> ends<00:01:09.240> up<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:10.200> proverbial

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
another and it ends up in the proverbial

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.170 
another and it ends up in the proverbial
backlash<00:01:11.610> we<00:01:11.909> don't<00:01:12.119> want<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:14.000> turn<00:01:15.000> your

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
backlash we don't want that so turn your

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.840 
backlash we don't want that so turn your
wrist<00:01:15.390> sideways<00:01:15.990> when<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:16.979> make<00:01:17.189> your<00:01:17.340> cast

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
wrist sideways when you make your cast

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.210 
wrist sideways when you make your cast
now<00:01:18.479> there's<00:01:18.659> another<00:01:18.720> cast<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.890> can<00:01:20.040> do

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
now there's another cast that you can do

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.820 
now there's another cast that you can do
with<00:01:20.729> bait<00:01:20.939> casting<00:01:21.360> gear<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:22.259> it's<00:01:22.500> called<00:01:22.740> a

with bait casting gear and it's called a

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.940 
with bait casting gear and it's called a
pitching<00:01:23.220> cast<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:24.299> technique<00:01:24.810> where<00:01:25.710> you're

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
striking worm or a jig you're just

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.399 
striking worm or a jig you're just
basically<00:01:32.100> dropping<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.909> rod<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.479> allowing

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
basically dropping the rod and allowing

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.469 
basically dropping the rod and allowing
