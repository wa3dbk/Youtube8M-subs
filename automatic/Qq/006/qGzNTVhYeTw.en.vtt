00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:31.060
 windows 8 made room for hybrids and 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.210
 each manufacturer invested in a style of 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.500
 use one of the bets of hp is the 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.050
 shipping x 2 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.000
 this gadget is a keyboard tablet mixer 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.220
 detachable 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.920
 Completely different 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:48.610
 the tablet brings Intel Atom processor 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:52.059
 two sdb cores of 64 gb and 2 gb of 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.739
 memory on the keyboard to the extra 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.140
 some connections that guarantee 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.870
 using the device as a notebook 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.790
 the idea is not new but nothing like the touch 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.949
 of a company that understands the 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.870
 make the concept even better 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.180
 can this hybrid be able to embrace 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.800
 two causes and still offer excellent 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.800
 results for the consumer 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.800
 if the first impression is the one 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.080
 so hp hit squares 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.930
 either as a tablet or as a notebook 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.210
 henry x2 impresses by the visual 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.520
 the manufacturer has mastered the design with 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.160
 Well defined materials that 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.260
 mimic brushed steel and willingness of 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.330
 components 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.500
 the tablet is tight in the minimum 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.390
 Details 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.420
 the buttons well positioned on the 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.400
 Rear well - finished edges and the screen 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.770
 with good responses to touch commands 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.990
 are the highlights 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.940
 the keyboard layout is good and guarantees 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.930
 comfort for those who are used to 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:59.090
 notebooks either as a tablet or as 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.000
 this hybrid shows itself very 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.550
 lightweight and comfortable between handsets 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.440
 category that we tested this hp gadget 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.890
 is the most practical and intelligent in 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.540
 concept the shipping performance is 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.620
 enough to run the 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.720
 windows 8 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.370
 we were impressed with the autonomy 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.040
 of the appliance's batteries 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.590
 adding the two charges we can extract 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.390
 almost eight hours of heavy use 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.390
 considerable number for a notebook 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.100
 free shipping x 2 to 1 free but he 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.080
 has a visual problem 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.840
 the space reserved for the speakers 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.700
 of the tablet is an unnecessary gap that 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.650
 dust may accumulate 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.740
 damaged easily 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.080
 in theory the audio technology beats 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.900
 should be great but it's not what 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.480
 we have in practice checked the sound levels 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.020
 are high but the acoustic system does not 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.790
 offers the quality we expected 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.160
 we miss the speakers together 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.140
 to the keyboard which could offer a 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.720
 serious gain and quality 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.580
 the concept of the device is interesting 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.810
 but the tablet coupling is 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.850
 uncomfortable 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.290
 there is fear of damaging the connector or 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:18.090
 lock as we said the performance is 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.190
 enough for the basic apps of the 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.090
 windows 8 but do not expect more than 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.010
 that 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.020
 apps work well on a first 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.790
 moment but working with multiple 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.280
 tasks is impossible 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.070
 after a while up the windows menu 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.660
 was slow in our analysis and the 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.860
 experience with the product was 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.470
 disappointing 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.510
 henry x 2 is unable to maintain good 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.500
 frame rates even in more games 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.780
 basic 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.360
 unfortunately the atom processor does not 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.430
 can do the trick and only 2 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.540
 gb of ram are insufficient for 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.070
 who uses many programs 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.750
 considering that the sending x 2 is one more 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.170
 tablet than a notebook 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.910
 the 64gb ssd is very interesting but it is 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.610
 fact that it can limit the installation 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.930
 of larger software and storage of 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.930
 high definition video files 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.190
 the product's main camera is capable of 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.260
 capture 8 megapixels 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.910
 the number is impressive the result 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.310
 of photos not so much 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.709
 The lens is useful only for good 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.030
 illuminated but still does not capture with 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.400
 quality 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.790
 images are not clear and use of the 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.190
 flash is not good for a 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.010
 the hd resolution of the screen is 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.690
 enough but this gadget was designed 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.210
 to be used most of the time 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.810
 like a tablet and when we approach the 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.550
 screen 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.580
 we can see that the display does not offer 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.040
 enough quality the pixels are 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.260
 visible what bothers so much at the time of 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.400
 view pictures when you 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.400
 resolves to read texts 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:57.389
 all defects of mx 2 are 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:58.979
 perfectly acceptable if 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.719
 we consider that this is a device 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:02.580
 for basic tasks 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:04.770
 It so happens that the story changes. 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.500
 completely when we talk about the price of 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.810
 product in Brazil the lowest value 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.180
 to acquire this hybrid is three thousand 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:15.300
 and six hundred reais 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.909
 Yes you heard perfectly are three 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.919
 thousand and 600 reais for a tablet coming 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:22.259
 with keyboard and extra battery 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.210
 taking this into account certainly 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:28.500
 not worth investing in the InglÃªs 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:30.960
 two incidentally it is worth noting that even if he 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.779
 was sold for half the price yet 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.520
 we could not recommend it after all 

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:37.259
 what's the use of investing in a tablet that 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.219
 is not able to run games and that 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:42.449
 disappoints in a series of requirements 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:44.189
 unfortunately it was not this time that 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:47.810
 we could try a hybrid of 

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:47.810
 quality with 28 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.659
 complete analysis of the world and 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.659
 until our next video
