00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
together that's going to be the trick

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.250 
together that's going to be the trick
especially<00:02:25.910> if<00:02:26.030> it's

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
especially if it's

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.080 
especially if it's
two<00:02:27.769> years<00:02:28.010> down<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.400> road<00:02:28.480> but

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
two years down the road but

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.930 
two years down the road but
we<00:02:31.540> get<00:02:31.630> in<00:02:31.720> cloture

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
we get in cloture

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.010 
we get in cloture
so<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:35.200> next<00:02:35.440> part<00:02:36.480> get<00:02:37.480> these<00:02:37.690> running

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
so the next part get these running

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.610 
so the next part get these running
boards<00:02:38.230> off<00:02:38.590> or<00:02:39.340> this<00:02:39.520> one<00:02:39.730> off<00:02:39.910> anyway<00:02:40.620> and

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620

when<00:03:12.739> I<00:03:12.769> guy<00:03:12.980> I<00:03:13.010> bought<00:03:13.280> it<00:03:13.340> off<00:03:13.580> of<00:03:13.690> rose<00:03:14.690> I

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
when I guy I bought it off of rose I

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.339 
when I guy I bought it off of rose I
brought<00:03:16.910> it<00:03:17.060> home<00:03:17.150> -<00:03:17.360> I<00:03:17.629> thought<00:03:18.470> the

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
brought it home - I thought the

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.259 
brought it home - I thought the
something<00:03:21.349> was<00:03:21.470> locked<00:03:21.680> up<00:03:21.920> in<00:03:22.129> the<00:03:22.269> somewhere

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
something was locked up in the somewhere

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:24.520 
something was locked up in the somewhere
and<00:03:23.480> so<00:03:23.629> I<00:03:23.660> tried<00:03:23.930> to<00:03:23.959> take<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.260> driveshaft

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
and so I tried to take the driveshaft

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.250 
and so I tried to take the driveshaft
off<00:03:25.129> well<00:03:25.519> I'd<00:03:25.879> still<00:03:26.269> be<00:03:26.420> easier<00:03:26.900> said<00:03:27.080> than

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
off well I'd still be easier said than

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.140 
off well I'd still be easier said than
done

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
done

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.860 
done
so<00:03:29.150> I

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
so I

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.380 
so I
playing<00:03:31.530> with<00:03:31.709> it<00:03:31.830> and<00:03:31.920> had<00:03:32.190> a<00:03:32.220> put<00:03:32.549> the<00:03:33.030> drain

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
playing with it and had a put the drain

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.020 
playing with it and had a put the drain
plug<00:03:33.540> in<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.810> bottom<00:03:34.110> that<00:03:34.879> transmissions<00:03:35.879> I

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
plug in the bottom that transmissions I

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.750
