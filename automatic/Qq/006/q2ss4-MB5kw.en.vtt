00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.710

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:27.640
 is everything is to jailbreak not released are the phones was and people 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.270
 What do you think

 and that he will be able to free him by using a sim card from another fighter this is 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.960
 totally uncertain this tool 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.060
 the only thing he does is jailbreak does not free 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.200
 from here he showed us an ipad min 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.880
 that this one 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.039
 Free ja created 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.350
 the daughter of the delegate 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.780
 this afternoon 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.440
 here you can see 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.040
 Well, there are some applications 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.360
 n in it as is the tomtom 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.490
 and some more 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.640
 for example most of these applications 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.060
 as you can see are iphone applications 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.060
 litt that were charged percent 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.140
 on the ipad 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.880
 in not only it is necessary to free to posada lanes that aranda 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.670
 with jailbreak earl to what makes us sixta b arrest them the cydia 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.530
 it would also allow us to heal install applications 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.660
 properly said of the cydia 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.980
 that are inside the fiat but that does not mean 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.660
 we can have here the cydia as you see 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.580
 percent good let's turn it over perez 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.580
 so you see it I do not know if every doctor given by pedophiles 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.970
 from the side of the back 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.690
 and of course 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.960
 it's hard 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.670
 as equity from the uncle we can been submit applications from the 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.770
 proper of fida 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.330
 then pm it happens that 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.179
 As far as most of us are interested, it is possible to install applications and 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.809
 that is, applications 

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:13.519
 which is so expensive that to those who are one of the plae store 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.239
 but that can be installed as percent and 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.049
 through 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.439
 the system 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:25.719
 and through 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:27.819
 iTunes 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.489
 as I was telling you by the way here you will see some applications for example because no 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:33.039
 he 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:35.589
 the guitar 0 

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:40.549
 does not know the formula thousand goals but not the tetris 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:41.489
 n 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.359
 the pub 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:46.509
 all these in it are day applications 

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:50.609
 that have been embargo pieces are the most in this application is 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.479
 empty in tibial tunisia percent 

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:56.879
 in charge art does not work by the way the blackburn a duty 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.229
 so what we are interested in is these applications that are min 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.390
 your company that is now because of it one way or pirated 

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:09.969
 to be able to establish its location is a sheep and the prize 'fair sees that now 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:11.049
 the ipad 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:16.739
 we need the scenic package 3 points 2 eye mini very careful with no 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.609
 I was in 3 points 1 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.119
 because it will leave you blocked and peace and the truth is that restore 

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:24.949
 that is, you need the nick apps 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:27.180
 three points and for 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.870
 install the apps or 3 points 2 you need 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:34.659
 I installed a repository 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.339
 what percent is the 

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:39.980
 k 1 dot com 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.999
 in this repository 

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:44.539
 you will find the apps neither 

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:46.749
 three points 

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:51.319
 it's important this percent let's go here I made myself here are you both 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.319
 we lived to only three 

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:58.289
 by the way there is a repository 

00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:01.419
 the one of facundo point us 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:02.609
 I dont know 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.449
 is I think the third 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:06.399
 what says there 

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:10.089
 then this repository lourdes crystal art 

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:13.569
 ny if we are going to be repositories you will see that here 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:20.410
 good does not appear because in the plot three points because it would be installed 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:22.460
 does not appear 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.080
 but percent that is necessary to put applications and peace 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.489
 Spain will open another on the one hand increase those that would be through 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.159
 never giving in for ssh 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:38.919
 ask also we could install our own much more laborious and sea 

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:43.050
 as I said b is that here 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.050
 is on the psni 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.909
 go for god 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:50.969
 3 point 2 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:53.900
 ap manager zenit percent sport 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.370
 or that three points that's what you need is 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.819
 to be able to amend the situation before legislators all 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:03.539
 you can put the same tracks 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:08.219
 paraguay focus are the same that you will work hiphopero expensive to have in 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.999
 account 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:12.479
 that you will have the smallest voice screen 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.479
 You can not be approved by the guitar 0 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:19.389
 although the ipad has to multiply by 2 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.990
 that is, to see it double 

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:29.939
 we put here an alliance several applications of the iphone 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.500
 we have a myth we are not going to say by which we can without duplicating the 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.889
 screen and that does not come out so tiny 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.129
 in this case 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:41.589
 as you see 

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:42.559
 is 

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:45.559
 it costs you do not take the whole screen 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:50.689
 but that bet of the mocedá the maximum that could be put 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:52.870
 silence 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.889
 the ice Age 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:57.889
 I have also knew the back then I find it difficult 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.449
 touching because I really do not see well 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:02.900
 nowadays 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.900
 this series a of italy 0 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:15.889
 for trying 

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:26.439
 oliver difficult because from behind but it is difficult to do 

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:31.129
 but as it is what it is what I was saying 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:32.500
 after another filtration 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.500
 you see that it's the size disk shows the size 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:39.129
 iphone iphone screen because it is an application for iphone 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:41.800
 but nevertheless if we get here for two 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.200
 the screen increases 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.200
 oviedo 8 is not the eagerness of more floors side 

00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:50.099
 Tokyo then I survived 

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:51.659
 I can 

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:53.560
 and we return to the iphone screen 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.529
 gain pop size 

00:06:55.529 --> 00:07:00.210
 but good when they start to leave the jó just stop and ease 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:03.270
 people take it out and convert them and peace 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.759
 means that we can load the same as we had been doing in the 

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:07.300
 iphone 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.569
 this I think is 

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:11.569
 one of the most important things 

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:13.849
 the inn 

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:17.149
 little more I can tell you how is the world 

00:07:17.149 --> 00:07:20.719
 one of the programs that does work for the subsidiary is the smallest 

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:27.119
 which we can change n putting in the air in this case the name of operator 

00:07:27.119 --> 00:07:29.919
 not the banner up here I do not know if you see it 

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:32.919
 the kidnapping and he denied it 

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:38.039
 obviously not having poper I love that in this case we can not change the 

00:07:38.039 --> 00:07:39.369
 name of the operator 

00:07:39.369 --> 00:07:40.980
 the plant that interesting 

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.839
 to watch videos and that is free sixth 

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:48.769
 through which we can see the connection to aa + troubadour and see the 

00:07:48.769 --> 00:07:51.089
 videos that we have a text 

00:07:51.089 --> 00:07:52.180
 well, this 

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.240
 so in the beginning it's for you to see it and 

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.330
 how is this left? 

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:58.469
 and else 

00:07:58.469 --> 00:07:59.590
 a little 

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.869
 forgetfulness but good to try to make a better 

00:08:02.869 --> 00:08:03.989
 thank you very much to all
