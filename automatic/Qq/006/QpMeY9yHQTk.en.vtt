00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:03.370
 Good day and welcome 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.580
 We would like to show our strategy of marketing your property here 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:20.859
 How does the real estate wish price come about? 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:26.239
 one compares similar offers on the internet to order ads 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:29.720
 one hears of alleged price proceeds of the neighbors 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.060
 you calculate your own investments 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.170
 and multiply everything with a very personal relationship 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.350
 that results then the own price led 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.350
 if only it were that easy 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.380
 we mean 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.530
 Price policy is not a matter of feeling 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.200
 before she died 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.330

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.460
 we are doing a comparative analysis of the competitors 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.460
 so the other objects in the situation and in the wings 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.220
 now was on the current contract 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.480
 and we consider 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.480
 All we can discuss with you in detail 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.310
 the floor plans and the land register extract discussions under certain circumstances also over 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.340
 upcoming renovations 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.660
 in apartments even more is added 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.130
 There difficult rules prevail over the division declaration 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.230
 with all its possible little problems and sift through 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.840
 Owner meeting is logs 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.380
 We control the billing and possible leases and ensure 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.290
 for the compilation of the loan to load and of course we know 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.900

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.900
 most new energy certificate must stand 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.840
 Customers could 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:56.150
 the most interesting and that brings prospects 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.100

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.750

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.430
 Bellings sales in consultation with them posters or stalls 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:23.799
 otherwise we are in our city everywhere well set up but no 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.799

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.379

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:36.739
 Then go for a well thought out marketing plan 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.830
 In the end, all parties must win 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.220
 we conduct the sales negotiations arguing and catering to the circles 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.220

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:01.869
