00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:09.360
 1000 bessel live on the bike linz 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.719
 2014 here at the princeton stand with harald 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.599
 Kessler herald of the aps 20 is mine 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.460
 I was really good at acquaintances 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.289
 Test on the street and on the 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.130
 race track even in mugello with one 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:28.800
 rc8 r with 301 driven by the way and 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:33.000
 now there is an evo what has happened 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.530
 what is different there is 20 evo was done 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.770
 because we developed in this 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.760
 segment after three times test victory now 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:45.059
 want to keep the nose ahead of it 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.039
 20 is a perfect mature for some 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.289
 Motorcycles who might see more 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.870
 mutti strada where the mature maybe 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.059
 not the first recommendation is because the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.530
 but tend to do devices but no matter the 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.289
 once said well they do not come on 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.420
 the mileage is very strong engine that 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.650
 you have five different treads 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.700
 strip or shoulder very soft medium 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.189
 made abrasion resistant that one on one 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.170
 Higher mileage comes that is the 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.790
 a development is developing further 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.119
 The handling front wheel was again 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.680
 improved the substructure corrected and 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.259
 the rubber compound in the shoulder area 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.170
 again equipped with more grip 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.479
 Did he round it off again ? 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.780
 Aries March will be available to replace one 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.030
 it becomes the predecessor of 20 to one 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.740
 same big show just out of easy 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.810
 just a sign that says you surrender 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.650
 you want to stay ahead with 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.420
 this product then there are currently two 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.580
 the third year market 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.259
 and yes is a real product of 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.729
 not given before what was there 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.340
 Real race track can drive it 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.290
 wetness best relative to very sporty 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.630
 good durability then that way 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.860
 really great things and the paragraphs 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.939
 It's always hard to get over that 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.149
 I'll always be the same 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:00.729
 black and but if you have this 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:04.090
 tires only feels that of the 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.369
 reality is a high-tech product 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.890
 good and also applies to this mature 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.650
 I believe field of application 1000ps 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.650
 bridgestone barbecue parties 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.650
 Of course
