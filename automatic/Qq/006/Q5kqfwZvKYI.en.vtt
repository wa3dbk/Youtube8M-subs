00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.340
 like these two 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.939
 many patients are not 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:10.939
 of the world 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:14.619
 so now not ethical weather services 8 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:16.429
 I feel sick 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:19.939
 Federal and state governments are allowed to do so over the next three years 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.949
 Tax revenues of 60 billion euros 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.869
 what will be dammed at home now again find them bad questions 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:32.140
 The bad thing about this message is the term expect 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.610
 It may well be that federal states and municipalities make additional revenue 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.080
 Expect billions of dollars, but they just can not 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.150
 How do I know that now because they never could? 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.970
 they just can not laugh and argue about it again 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.330
 what they should spend this extra income for 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.680
 The tax estimate may be reliable, they are in no case 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.530
 remember darkly the previous year 2008 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.400
 It is 30 months since the then Minister of Finance SteinbrÃ¼ck expected 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.000
 balanced due to tax estimates at the end of the year 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.560
 state budget 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.950
 let's say so 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.530
 the easy doing was not quite fulfilled 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.260
 Not six months later, the Lehman bank splendor together 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.090
 Of course, that could not be but esteem and appreciation is at all 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.090
 Not 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.050
 instead of the expected balanced state budget got like the 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.210
 estimated highest new debt ever 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.140
 burned child shies the fire says one unfortunately says mine not burned there 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.980
 Finance Minister SchÃ¤uble the tax estimate 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.350
 But how should one evaluate such expectations or what is allowed? 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.630
 one of estimates expectations 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:44.750
 are they the 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.470
 about the moment his boss says 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.970
 I guess she could pay attention to a salary increase next year 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.770
 Are you the type who then picks up the phone right away and a world trip without 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.310
 Cancellation insurance bay 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.160
 they are not or 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.310
 I thought if you were such a guy you would not have any 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.240
 Chief then they would be namely politicians and budget experts of the FDP 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.680
 So professional for air reservations without traction back of insurance 

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:13.019
 they're calling again now 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.189
 to use the expected tax revenues for tax cuts 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:22.229
 that is, in a situation where the state is definitely less 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:26.709
 as he spends he wants to take extra income for even more 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.309
 use higher expenses 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:32.019
 probably not to hurt the revenue spending distance requirement 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:36.509
 I guess you should not expect anything else from brain-burning 

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:37.219
 until recently
