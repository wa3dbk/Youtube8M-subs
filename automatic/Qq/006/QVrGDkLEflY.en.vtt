00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
great flavor of carmelization than I

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:41.260 
great flavor of carmelization than I

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
thought it would be perfect with crab

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.980 
thought it would be perfect with crab
okay

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
okay

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.679 
okay
so<00:01:42.439> what's<00:01:43.130> so<00:01:43.789> we're<00:01:43.909> gonna<00:01:44.030> get<00:01:44.210> sweet<00:01:44.539> from

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689

the Krispy Kreme and the crab is going

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.840 
the Krispy Kreme and the crab is going
to<00:01:46.189> be<00:01:46.280> kind<00:01:46.460> of<00:01:46.520> spicy<00:01:47.000> I<00:01:47.560> think<00:01:48.560> I<00:01:48.890> think<00:01:49.609> it's

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
to be kind of spicy I think I think it's

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.480 
to be kind of spicy I think I think it's
gonna<00:01:49.969> be<00:01:50.179> a<00:01:50.210> perfect<00:01:50.420> combination

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.240 

I<00:01:53.520> am<00:01:54.510> ready<00:01:55.080> with<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.380> Krispy<00:01:55.740> Kremes<00:01:56.010> so

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
I am ready with the Krispy Kremes so

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.109 
I am ready with the Krispy Kremes so
should<00:01:56.430> we<00:01:56.460> go<00:01:56.580> ahead<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.729> put<00:01:56.850> those<00:01:56.970> right

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
should we go ahead and put those right

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:23.090 
should we go ahead and put those right
on<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.330> grill<00:02:20.270> right<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:22.560> they're<00:02:22.709> quick<00:02:22.920> to

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
on the grill right and they're quick to

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.080 
on the grill right and they're quick to
cook<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:24.050> I<00:02:25.050> guess<00:02:25.530> that's<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.610> most<00:02:26.760> hardest

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
cook so I guess that's the most hardest
