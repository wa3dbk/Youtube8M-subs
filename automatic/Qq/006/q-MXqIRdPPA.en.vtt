00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.770
 news for all tastes the plot 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.870
 is based on the new virus and it 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.260
 narrates in four linked chapters 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.940
 each other three main stories 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.520
 starred by chris redfield lions 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.500
 Kennedy and Jay Miller each with a 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.800
 different objective to undertake the 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.780
 adventure in addition to the extra campaign 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.329
 where we control the sexy and always 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.630
 mysterious and id a wong and that is vital 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.460
 importance to close the story every 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.860
 one of the campaigns is played in a way 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.920
 different the cruise is full of 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.410
 shots and a lot of action that of Lyon is the 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.630
 darker and with more suspense in the 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.020
 jay campaign that we are constantly 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.329
 tension and it's more dramatic and with it is 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.059
 less linear and balances in a great way 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.950
 stealth and action adding different 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.469
 game modes that we can play from 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.970
 local way goes online including the 

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:13.660
 already typical mercÃ© way 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.340
 that give you even more variety already 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.790
 can shoot and walk at the same time 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.220
 to cover oneself, to run, to roll or to sweep 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.290
 which is very useful in addition to combat 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.810
 melee this time is more 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.300
 complete and recurrent what can 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.430
 save a lot of ammo are also 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.440
 present the quick time events and now 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.000
 it has a resistance bar 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.000
 to add some strategy 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.600
 the visual aspect disappoints a little 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.000
 cinematic and character design and 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.130
 It is very good but the scenarios in more 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.010
 once they see themselves with too much light 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.960
 and opaque in textures as well as an evil 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.110
 performance in some big bosses 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.810
 size in terms of sound in general is 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.910
 good music accompanies in a great way 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.610
 either the action or the suspense and the 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.590
 environmental effects sound wonderful 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.450
 the voice work in English is also 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.959
 very good although the version in 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.600
 Spanish stinks as always' resident 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.550
 evil '6 is a complete game with a good 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.920
 narrative approach and a variety 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.470
 in very high playability a good 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.900
 experiment where the zombies return and 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.300
 that teach us another facet of the already so 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.270
 modified series that made great the 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.770
 survival 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.770
 final rating 87
