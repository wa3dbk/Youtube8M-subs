quite<00:04:49.590> honestly<00:04:49.710> that<00:04:49.889> we<00:04:50.069> had<00:04:50.310> to<00:04:50.460> have<00:04:50.610> the

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:50.819 
quite honestly that we had to have the

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:52.999 
quite honestly that we had to have the
hard<00:04:51.060> fought<00:04:51.270> win<00:04:51.449> that<00:04:51.690> we<00:04:51.780> had<00:04:51.960> to<00:04:52.080> have<00:04:52.259> a

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.009 
hard fought win that we had to have a

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:54.950 
hard fought win that we had to have a
game<00:04:53.340> where<00:04:53.550> we<00:04:53.639> didn't<00:04:53.970> play<00:04:54.150> great<00:04:54.360> and<00:04:54.690> had

you know I think for us you know we keep

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:35.420 
you know I think for us you know we keep
preaching<00:06:34.199> this<00:06:34.319> you<00:06:34.650> know<00:06:34.740> we're<00:06:35.069> not<00:06:35.219> going

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:35.430 
preaching this you know we're not going

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:36.800 
preaching this you know we're not going
to<00:06:35.490> be<00:06:35.580> distracted<00:06:35.969> by<00:06:36.210> outside<00:06:36.779> influences

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810 
to be distracted by outside influences

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.990 
to be distracted by outside influences
we<00:06:37.620> won't<00:06:37.770> be<00:06:37.919> motivated<00:06:38.490> by<00:06:38.520> outside

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
we won't be motivated by outside

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.430 
we won't be motivated by outside
influences

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
influences

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.290 
influences
and<00:06:40.770> so<00:06:40.920> these<00:06:41.070> were<00:06:41.280> great<00:06:41.520> learning<00:06:41.940> lessons

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 
and so these were great learning lessons

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.610 
and so these were great learning lessons
for<00:06:42.450> us<00:06:42.480> okay<00:06:42.840> here's<00:06:43.080> potential

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 
for us okay here's potential

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.770 
for us okay here's potential
distractions<00:06:44.250> going<00:06:44.430> on<00:06:44.700> our<00:06:44.940> ability<00:06:45.600> to

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:45.780 
distractions going on our ability to

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.300 
distractions going on our ability to
stay<00:06:46.050> focused<00:06:46.530> and<00:06:46.650> go<00:06:46.770> out<00:06:46.860> put<00:06:47.040> our<00:06:47.160> best

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.310 
stay focused and go out put our best

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.830 
stay focused and go out put our best
foot<00:06:47.490> forward<00:06:47.790> is<00:06:47.970> huge<00:06:48.420> and<00:06:48.600> so<00:06:48.720> hopefully

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 
foot forward is huge and so hopefully

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.470 
foot forward is huge and so hopefully
the<00:06:49.620> way<00:06:49.800> we<00:06:50.100> use<00:06:50.310> this<00:06:50.580> is<00:06:50.820> that<00:06:51.000> when<00:06:51.240> a<00:06:51.270> new

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:51.480 
the way we use this is that when a new

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.330 
the way we use this is that when a new
distraction<00:06:52.080> comes<00:06:52.320> about<00:06:52.560> we<00:06:52.830> can<00:06:52.980> go<00:06:53.130> back

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:53.340 
distraction comes about we can go back

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.670 
distraction comes about we can go back
and<00:06:53.370> lean<00:06:53.730> on<00:06:53.880> those<00:06:54.090> and<00:06:54.390> say<00:06:54.510> hey<00:06:54.660> we<00:06:55.470> made<00:06:55.650> it

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 
and lean on those and say hey we made it

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.170 
and lean on those and say hey we made it
