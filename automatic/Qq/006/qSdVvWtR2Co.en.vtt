00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.539
 maybe you think that none of this has 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.000
 something to do with you 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:41.430
 maybe you see this, he thinks it's the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.739
 nature maybe when you listen to the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.780
 term global warming do you think in 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.329
 sci-fi movies in groups 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.850
 radical environmentalists or even worse than 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.000
 it's been many years before it becomes 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.119
 actually maybe if you've been 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.309
 wrong this is our planet the 

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:01.350
 layer that surrounds us is the atmosphere 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.570
 its function is to catch some of the 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.640
 Sun rays and keep them inside the 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.130
 planet to conserve a temperature 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.350
 of 15 degrees centigrade otherwise 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.060
 the sun's rays would escape and 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.039
 our planet would come down to a 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.280
 temperature of minus 18 degrees 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:19.409
 centigrade this is known as effect 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.330
 greenhouse and is effected by gases 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.700
 like water vapor dioxide 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.679
 carbon methane and others in a 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.590
 Proper proportion gases effect 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.959
 greenhouse fulfill their purpose but if 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.420
 increase their concentration the rays of the 

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:37.050
 Sun can not escape and the temperature 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.900
 of the planet rises with repercussions 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.670
 roses this is the concentration of 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.730
 carbon dioxide and temperature 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.410
 global average of the last 30 years and 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.140
 this is the level of carbon dioxide 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:52.050
 in the atmosphere you are not currently 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.240
 some relationship because they increase the 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.400
 greenhouse gases there are three 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.370
 fundamental factors the burning of 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.230
 fossil fuels the destruction of 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.590
 forests that absorb dioxide 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.810
 carbon and the population increase 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.119
 everything is a vicious circle the population 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.370
 the world skyrockets 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.400
 which supposes a greater demand for food 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.350
 water and natural resources trees 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.930
 absorb a large percentage of the 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.360
 emanations of carbon dioxide but 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.610
 we are currently destroying our 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.830
 forests and jungles the lungs of our 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.960
 planet by satisfying the demands that 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.410
 they take us to the third point of the circle 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.600
 vicious technologies obsolete being 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.760
 human still uses plants based on 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.820
 coal to generate energy this is 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.040
 translates into 2,500 million tons of 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.660
 carbon dioxide a year that is expelled 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.730
 in the environment the excessive use of 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.489
 car 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.349
 500 million tons of dioxide 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.540
 carbon that go straight to the 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:53.959
 atmosphere what consequences does it bring 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.819
 global warming, let's see 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.040
 trapped higher number of sun rays 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.950
 and the temperature of the planet increases 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.090
 this causes even shortage of water and 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.080
 fires 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.090
 paradoxically global warming 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.720
 it also produces rains and floods 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.430
 more severe because the sun's rays 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.890
 increase the temperature of the oceans 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.920
 this causes more evaporation and 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.110
 more severe rainfall but also 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.390
 when a hurricane comes in contact with 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:26.160
 warmer waters the worst happens 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.350
 an increase in the occasional temperature 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.630
 also that the poles defrost and 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.610
 as a consequence more fresh water enters 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.709
 to the sea this raises the level of 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.890
 oceans causing severe floods 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.410
 the problem is serious if the sea level 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.070
 climb to 6 meters would sweep places 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:47.040

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.980
 thinking still the time to change but 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.319
 that's not true we have to start 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.269
 act now here are some simple ones 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.939
 points you can take to help the 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.879
 Planet buys savers of 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:11.549
 energy turns off electrical appliances in 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:13.170
 instead of leaving them on hold reduces the 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.750
 consumption of heaters and air 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.669
 conditioning if you can buy a 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.130
 Hybrid car with electric motor or 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.320
 than a percentage of 17 kilometers 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.930
 per liter keep the tires of your 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.310
 well-inflated automobile shares the 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.030
 car 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.430
 walk or use bicycle use less water 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.610
 hot when bathing wash clothes with 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:39.410
 cold or warm water recycles separates 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.410
 trash plant a tree 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:44.340
 we are running out to the planet this 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.039
 wonderful world that has given us so much 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.110
 we are still on time but we have 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:52.639
 that change our way of thinking and 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.639
 start acting now 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.080
 no no no
