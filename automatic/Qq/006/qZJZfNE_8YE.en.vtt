more<00:01:06.780> from<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.200> deck<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.860> faced<00:01:08.159> on<00:01:08.280> defense

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
more from the deck and faced on defense

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.740 
more from the deck and faced on defense
position<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.030> think<00:01:09.150> it's<00:01:09.240> based<00:01:09.360> on<00:01:09.450> defense

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
position I think it's based on defense

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.789 
position I think it's based on defense
so<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.560> allows<00:01:10.740> synchros<00:01:11.659> next<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.930> material

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
so it allows synchros next to material

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.370 
so it allows synchros next to material
Cosmo<00:01:14.130> beat<00:01:14.340> two<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:15.210> really<00:01:15.630> good<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:15.960> first
