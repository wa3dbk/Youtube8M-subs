00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.529
 and here is my fig 4 fig bush 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:19.220
 horizontal cordon well what can i 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:23.789
 say about cordon 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:28.019
 winded cordon well that is 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:34.200
 shoots of living and extinct left very 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:35.600
 a lot but they are awakening the kidneys 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:42.320
 on the cordon 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:50.809
 which are most removed the base of the bush 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:53.960
 later here they are later than the kidneys 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:01:00.420
 the base of the bush and in this way 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:03.750
 it turns out that the shoots on the cordon none 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.890
 the moment is not the same growth force that is 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.150
 the center of the bush 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:14.580
 strong and high and on the sides of the bush then 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:22.470
 there are shoots on cordless shoulders more 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:29.100
 the weak here on the left here in the center and again 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:37.380
 right shoots weaker and so on all 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:43.439
 bushes here on the right center 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:47.009
 and to the left that is on the shoulders of the cordon 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:52.890
 but for now I refuse to refuse cordon 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:58.429
 I will be one or two more seasons will experience 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:01.520
 I will experiment I will check and 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:06.110
 after that I will do 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:09.720
 final conclusions as I lead 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.959
 Shaping a bush you become another 4-ku became 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:18.299
 I planted and I will grow them 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:22.049
 ordinary bush you method shoots 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:26.630
 who will stoop and hide 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:34.410
 for the winter without cordon 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:38.760
 let's experiment together except 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.519
 addition when using the cordon we lose 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.180
 the possibility of obtaining the first crop or 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.840
 Odessa 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.840
 June-July 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.850
 and as I spoke buds on the shoulders of the cordon 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:59.760
 most distant from the base of the bush 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:03:02.370
 awaken to growth oh and because of this 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:09.710
 you can not wait and aging 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:09.710
 2 crops will be checked
