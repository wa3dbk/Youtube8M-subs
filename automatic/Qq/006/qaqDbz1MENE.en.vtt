the peaks for the video as you can see
i'm<00:02:06.810> just<00:02:07.290> gonna<00:02:07.409> stop<00:02:07.860> recording<00:02:08.489> now<00:02:08.670> for<00:02:09.060> a

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
i'm just gonna stop recording now for a

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.900 
i'm just gonna stop recording now for a
while<00:02:09.270> again<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.810> let<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.080> load<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.459> oldie

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
while again to let it load the oldie

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.670 
while again to let it load the oldie
peaks<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.420> then<00:02:12.629> i'll<00:02:12.750> be<00:02:12.900> back

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
peaks and then i'll be back

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.500 
peaks and then i'll be back
right<00:02:13.769> so<00:02:13.890> as<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.069> can<00:02:14.219> see<00:02:14.489> all<00:02:14.969> the<00:02:15.030> city<00:02:15.359> has

right so as you can see all the city has

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.709 
right so as you can see all the city has
loaded<00:02:15.750> all<00:02:16.079> the<00:02:16.109> peaks<00:02:16.560> in<00:02:16.859> the<00:02:16.920> video<00:02:17.159> and

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:17.719 
loaded all the peaks in the video and

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:21.259 
loaded all the peaks in the video and
you<00:02:18.719> will<00:02:18.870> now<00:02:19.019> have<00:02:19.049> to<00:02:19.319> find<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.920> part<00:02:20.909> of<00:02:21.090> the

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
you will now have to find a part of the

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.949 
you will now have to find a part of the
video<00:02:21.750> where<00:02:22.079> there<00:02:22.829> is<00:02:23.040> only<00:02:23.280> quiet<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.719> only

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
video where there is only quiet and only

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.259 
video where there is only quiet and only
the<00:02:25.079> noise<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:26.459> will<00:02:26.640> look<00:02:26.819> probe<00:02:27.060> list

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
the noise and it will look probe list

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:36.730 
the noise and it will look probe list
like<00:02:27.510> this<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.989> I'll<00:02:28.980> just<00:02:29.310> play<00:02:29.549> it

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
so if you can hear it there's like me

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.020 
so if you can hear it there's like me
breathing<00:02:39.260> and<00:02:39.650> all<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.250> noise<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:40.790> now

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
breathing and all the noise and now

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.300 
breathing and all the noise and now
we're<00:02:41.240> going<00:02:41.360> to<00:02:41.450> get<00:02:41.630> rid<00:02:41.960> of<00:02:42.020> this<00:02:42.350> noise<00:02:42.590> so

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
we're going to get rid of this noise so

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.730 
we're going to get rid of this noise so
just<00:02:43.610> go<00:02:43.820> just<00:02:44.390> select<00:02:44.540> your<00:02:44.810> part<00:02:45.140> like<00:02:45.500> this

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
track now go into effect now noise

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.200 
track now go into effect now noise
removal<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:19.300> in<00:03:20.300> here<00:03:20.990> don't<00:03:21.680> touch<00:03:21.920> need<00:03:22.610> the

removal and in here don't touch need the

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.290 
removal and in here don't touch need the
two<00:03:23.960> last<00:03:24.230> options<00:03:24.680> just<00:03:25.010> leave<00:03:25.220> that<00:03:25.370> on<00:03:25.430> 150

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
two last options just leave that on 150

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.770 
two last options just leave that on 150
and<00:03:26.510> zero<00:03:27.230> point<00:03:27.620> 15<00:03:27.950> and<00:03:28.220> if<00:03:29.120> it<00:03:29.240> is<00:03:29.390> not<00:03:29.600> on

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
and zero point 15 and if it is not on

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.550 
and zero point 15 and if it is not on
these<00:03:30.790> values<00:03:31.790> just<00:03:32.210> set<00:03:32.390> it<00:03:32.420> there<00:03:32.570> and<00:03:33.050> now

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
these values just set it there and now

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.200 
these values just set it there and now
the<00:03:33.620> noise<00:03:34.010> reduction<00:03:34.190> is<00:03:34.490> a<00:03:34.520> very<00:03:34.760> important

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.210 
the noise reduction is a very important

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.340 
the noise reduction is a very important
part<00:03:35.360> you<00:03:35.830> can<00:03:36.830> go<00:03:37.040> up<00:03:37.310> to<00:03:37.610> 48<00:03:38.450> decibels<00:03:38.960> but

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
part you can go up to 48 decibels but

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.800 
part you can go up to 48 decibels but
not<00:03:39.530> a<00:03:39.770> lot<00:03:39.890> and<00:03:40.430> it<00:03:40.610> will<00:03:40.820> decrease<00:03:41.030> the

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
not a lot and it will decrease the

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.880 
not a lot and it will decrease the
quality<00:03:42.140> of<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.830> audio<00:03:42.950> of<00:03:43.370> your<00:03:43.970> talking<00:03:44.570> and

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
quality of the audio of your talking and

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.360 
quality of the audio of your talking and
and<00:03:45.890> it<00:03:46.550> will<00:03:46.790> mainly<00:03:47.950> strangely<00:03:48.950> cut<00:03:49.160> out

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
and it will mainly strangely cut out

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.850 
and it will mainly strangely cut out
your<00:03:49.700> talking<00:03:50.300> because<00:03:50.420> it<00:03:50.780> it<00:03:51.410> will<00:03:51.590> really

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
your talking because it it will really

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.120 
your talking because it it will really
do<00:03:52.790> it<00:03:52.910> very<00:03:53.030> hardly<00:03:53.420> and<00:03:53.720> I<00:03:54.130> always

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
do it very hardly and I always

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.630 
do it very hardly and I always
experiment<00:03:55.970> between<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:57.200> 25<00:03:57.680> is<00:03:57.950> limit<00:03:58.400> for

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
experiment between the 25 is limit for

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.260 
experiment between the 25 is limit for
me<00:03:58.670> and<00:03:59.030> I<00:03:59.570> don't<00:04:00.530> go<00:04:00.920> below<00:04:01.160> 10<00:04:01.580> because<00:04:01.850> if<00:04:02.150> I

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
me and I don't go below 10 because if I

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.270 
me and I don't go below 10 because if I
go<00:04:02.450> below<00:04:02.690> 10<00:04:02.900> then<00:04:03.200> I<00:04:03.410> can<00:04:03.740> still<00:04:03.950> hear<00:04:03.980> the

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
go below 10 then I can still hear the

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.880 
go below 10 then I can still hear the
noise<00:04:04.430> now<00:04:05.060> i'm<00:04:05.120> going<00:04:05.330> to<00:04:05.390> try<00:04:05.510> it<00:04:05.600> so<00:04:06.050> i<00:04:06.320> set

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
take a while and i'm going to show you

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.690 
take a while and i'm going to show you
on<00:04:23.180> the<00:04:23.570> part<00:04:23.900> on<00:04:24.410> this<00:04:24.680> part<00:04:24.980> exactly<00:04:25.190> here

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
on the part on this part exactly here

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.880 
on the part on this part exactly here
where<00:04:26.270> there<00:04:26.420> should<00:04:26.570> be<00:04:26.690> only<00:04:26.840> noise<00:04:27.110> that<00:04:27.710> it

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
where there should be only noise that it

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.410 
where there should be only noise that it
got<00:04:28.070> nicely<00:04:28.670> removed<00:04:29.060> and<00:04:29.330> the<00:04:30.320> video<00:04:30.650> is<00:04:30.830> now

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
got nicely removed and the video is now

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.660 
got nicely removed and the video is now
very<00:04:32.420> I<00:04:32.840> mean<00:04:33.590> the<00:04:33.680> audio<00:04:34.010> is<00:04:34.070> not<00:04:34.310> very<00:04:34.460> clear

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
very I mean the audio is not very clear

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.720 
very I mean the audio is not very clear
so<00:04:35.150> this<00:04:35.720> is<00:04:35.840> a<00:04:35.870> very<00:04:36.170> useful<00:04:36.320> method<00:04:36.890> to<00:04:37.100> clear

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
so this is a very useful method to clear

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.180 
so this is a very useful method to clear
your<00:04:37.940> audio<00:04:38.480> out<00:04:38.660> now<00:04:39.230> click<00:04:39.530> and<00:04:39.740> just<00:04:39.920> play

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
your audio out now click and just play

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:48.850 
your audio out now click and just play
it<00:04:41.590> yes<00:04:42.590> you<00:04:42.740> can<00:04:42.770> hear<00:04:43.370> there's<00:04:43.790> still<00:04:44.140> some

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.309 

there's<00:04:49.860> still<00:04:50.039> some<00:04:50.219> noise<00:04:50.689> but<00:04:51.689> if<00:04:51.930> it<00:04:52.199> was

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:52.319 
there's still some noise but if it was

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:54.249 
there's still some noise but if it was
like<00:04:52.529> on<00:04:52.740> default<00:04:53.039> here<00:04:53.279> you<00:04:53.490> can't<00:04:53.789> hear<00:04:54.210> it

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:54.259 
like on default here you can't hear it

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:56.510 
like on default here you can't hear it
just<00:04:55.259> try<00:04:55.439> it<00:04:55.469> for<00:04:55.589> yourself<00:04:55.770> this<00:04:56.279> is<00:04:56.430> the

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
just try it for yourself this is the

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.510 
just try it for yourself this is the
most<00:04:57.229> advanced<00:04:58.229> well<00:04:58.559> not<00:04:58.710> the<00:04:58.800> most<00:04:59.009> advanced

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
most advanced well not the most advanced

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.879 
most advanced well not the most advanced
but<00:04:59.819> the<00:04:59.999> really<00:05:00.539> easiest<00:05:01.020> way<00:05:01.199> to<00:05:01.259> do<00:05:01.529> it<00:05:01.710> and

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
but the really easiest way to do it and

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:04.249 
but the really easiest way to do it and
it<00:05:02.309> removes<00:05:02.729> the<00:05:02.909> noise<00:05:03.119> very<00:05:03.360> nicely<00:05:03.539> so<00:05:04.229> a

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.259 
it removes the noise very nicely so a

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:06.409 
it removes the noise very nicely so a
few<00:05:04.559> after<00:05:05.099> you<00:05:05.189> will<00:05:05.339> do<00:05:05.490> this<00:05:05.639> just<00:05:06.119> go<00:05:06.210> into
