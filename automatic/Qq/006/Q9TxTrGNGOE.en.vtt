half moon shape so you'll do that on

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.630 
half moon shape so you'll do that on
both<00:01:55.520> my<00:01:56.240> sockets<00:01:56.830> just<00:01:57.830> being<00:01:58.040> extra<00:01:58.490> careful

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
both my sockets just being extra careful

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.210 
both my sockets just being extra careful
on<00:01:59.030> both<00:01:59.270> occasions<00:01:59.570> these<00:02:00.170> scalpels<00:02:00.830> can<00:02:01.070> go

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
on both occasions these scalpels can go

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.250 
on both occasions these scalpels can go
right<00:02:01.520> through<00:02:01.790> the<00:02:02.060> vinyl<00:02:02.300> through<00:02:03.050> to<00:02:03.170> the

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
right through the vinyl through to the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.400 
right through the vinyl through to the
other<00:02:03.380> side<00:02:03.500> through<00:02:04.070> to<00:02:04.130> your<00:02:04.220> skin<00:02:04.550> so<00:02:05.410> you

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
other side through to your skin so you

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:15.520 
other side through to your skin so you
need<00:02:06.740> to<00:02:06.890> go<00:02:07.040> slow<00:02:10.960> so<00:02:11.960> in<00:02:12.290> there<00:02:12.560> I<00:02:14.200> have<00:02:15.200> both

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
need to go slow so in there I have both

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.790 
need to go slow so in there I have both
of<00:02:15.560> my<00:02:16.250> eye<00:02:17.090> sockets<00:02:17.720> cut<00:02:18.020> to<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.320> Halfmoon

I'm very lucky I can get in there but as

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.160 
I'm very lucky I can get in there but as
with<00:02:37.640> most<00:02:37.910> of<00:02:38.120> these<00:02:38.300> heads<00:02:38.630> they're<00:02:38.930> very

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
with most of these heads they're very

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.460 
with most of these heads they're very
pliable<00:02:40.070> at<00:02:40.700> this<00:02:40.910> stage<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.450> even<00:02:41.660> more<00:02:42.230> so

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
pliable at this stage and even more so

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.080

which I highly recommend the knife will

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.090 
which I highly recommend the knife will
cut<00:02:47.480> through<00:02:47.630> it<00:02:47.750> like<00:02:47.930> butter<00:02:48.110> and<00:02:48.650> you're

pop in itself in work on most occasions

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.149 
pop in itself in work on most occasions
now<00:04:03.540> of<00:04:03.659> course<00:04:03.840> we<00:04:04.140> need<00:04:04.319> to<00:04:04.349> make<00:04:04.500> sure<00:04:04.920> those

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 
now of course we need to make sure those

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:08.240 
now of course we need to make sure those
eyes<00:04:05.489> and<00:04:05.970> not<00:04:06.780> cross-eyed<00:04:07.440> before<00:04:07.950> you<00:04:08.069> glue

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
eyes and not cross-eyed before you glue

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.449 
eyes and not cross-eyed before you glue
them<00:04:08.519> so<00:04:09.389> to<00:04:09.450> do<00:04:09.840> that<00:04:09.870> you<00:04:10.590> look<00:04:10.799> at<00:04:10.980> a<00:04:11.099> light

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
them so to do that you look at a light

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.349 
them so to do that you look at a light
angle<00:04:12.440> not<00:04:13.440> sure<00:04:13.650> if<00:04:13.769> you<00:04:13.889> can<00:04:14.040> see<00:04:14.280> that<00:04:14.519> but

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
angle not sure if you can see that but

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.469 
angle not sure if you can see that but
for<00:04:15.750> the<00:04:15.840> eyes<00:04:16.049> to<00:04:16.350> be<00:04:16.470> in<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.739> correct<00:04:17.100> place

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
for the eyes to be in the correct place

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:22.250 
for the eyes to be in the correct place
the<00:04:18.479> little<00:04:18.780> light<00:04:19.079> you<00:04:19.410> see<00:04:19.799> on<00:04:20.299> eye<00:04:21.299> itself

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
the little light you see on eye itself

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.650 
the little light you see on eye itself
needs<00:04:23.100> to<00:04:23.250> be<00:04:23.340> in<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.789> exact<00:04:24.150> same<00:04:24.419> position

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
needs to be in the exact same position

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.800 
needs to be in the exact same position
on<00:04:25.110> both<00:04:25.970> so<00:04:26.970> I'll<00:04:27.090> try<00:04:27.300> to<00:04:27.330> make<00:04:27.479> her

high section my particular glue now I

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.560 
high section my particular glue now I
owe<00:05:40.590> you<00:05:40.680> something<00:05:41.040> called<00:05:41.430> gel<00:05:41.850> bond<00:05:42.210> and

owe you something called gel bond and
you<00:05:43.110> can<00:05:43.260> get<00:05:43.380> it<00:05:43.470> from<00:05:43.650> most<00:05:43.860> hardware<00:05:44.460> as<00:05:44.580> I

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
you can get it from most hardware as I

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.060 
you can get it from most hardware as I
think<00:05:44.760> and<00:05:45.420> I<00:05:45.570> use<00:05:45.840> that<00:05:46.080> because<00:05:46.320> it's<00:05:46.800> um

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
think and I use that because it's um

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.150 
think and I use that because it's um
it's<00:05:47.550> waterproof<00:05:47.970> and<00:05:48.630> it's<00:05:49.470> got<00:05:49.770> a<00:05:49.800> sort<00:05:50.100> of

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
it's waterproof and it's got a sort of

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.220 
it's waterproof and it's got a sort of
certain<00:05:50.520> flex<00:05:50.850> to<00:05:51.180> it<00:05:51.210> so<00:05:51.740> if<00:05:52.740> someone<00:05:53.070> was

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:54.230 
certain flex to it so if someone was

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.480 
certain flex to it so if someone was
wetting<00:05:55.230> the<00:05:55.320> hair<00:05:55.350> conditioning<00:05:56.160> the<00:05:56.280> hair

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
wetting the hair conditioning the hair

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.030 
wetting the hair conditioning the hair
and<00:05:56.610> then<00:05:56.760> combing<00:05:57.240> it<00:05:57.420> the<00:05:58.140> actual<00:05:58.740> glue

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.040 
and then combing it the actual glue

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.560 
and then combing it the actual glue
inside<00:05:59.490> is<00:05:59.730> is<00:06:00.650> waterproof<00:06:01.650> and<00:06:02.370> and<00:06:03.180> that<00:06:03.390> way

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
inside is is waterproof and and that way

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:04.550 
inside is is waterproof and and that way
it'd<00:06:03.630> be<00:06:03.750> better<00:06:03.930> because<00:06:04.170> you're<00:06:04.470> always

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
it'd be better because you're always

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.010 
it'd be better because you're always
spraying<00:06:04.920> it<00:06:05.100> with<00:06:05.130> water<00:06:05.430> in<00:06:05.610> that<00:06:05.780> so<00:06:06.780> I<00:06:06.810> hope

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
spraying it with water in that so I hope

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.070 
spraying it with water in that so I hope
