00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
interesting wave compositor yet wave

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.619 
interesting wave compositor yet wave
composition<00:00:50.370> here<00:00:50.550> he<00:00:50.789> has<00:00:50.879> mummies<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
composition here he has mummies in the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.860 
composition here he has mummies in the
number<00:00:52.440> one<00:00:52.469> spot<00:00:52.820> I'm<00:00:53.820> not<00:00:54.270> sure<00:00:54.329> on<00:00:54.840> that

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
number one spot I'm not sure on that

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.680 
number one spot I'm not sure on that
because<00:00:55.469> mummies<00:00:55.949> they<00:00:56.460> do<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.730> stunned<00:00:57.239> but<00:00:57.570> it

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
because mummies they do a stunned but it

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.500 
because mummies they do a stunned but it
doesn't<00:00:57.960> affect<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.350> hero<00:00:58.789> you<00:00:59.789> know<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.359> would

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
doesn't affect the hero you know I would

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.510 
doesn't affect the hero you know I would
probably<00:01:00.750> prefer<00:01:01.020> more<00:01:01.469> range<00:01:01.739> dps<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.340> just

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
probably prefer more range dps to just

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.340 
probably prefer more range dps to just
kill<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.879> hero<00:01:03.059> faster<00:01:03.600> but<00:01:04.049> we'll<00:01:04.170> have<00:01:04.290> to

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
kill the hero faster but we'll have to

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.830 
kill the hero faster but we'll have to
see<00:01:04.619> how<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.920> works<00:01:05.100> out<00:01:05.369> for<00:01:05.610> him<00:01:05.840> again

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
see how that works out for him again

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.990 
see how that works out for him again
this<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.229> an<00:01:07.350> elite<00:01:07.680> level<00:01:07.710> base<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.520> don't<00:01:08.850> have

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
this is an elite level base I don't have

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.020 
this is an elite level base I don't have

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
didn't even take it all down so we are

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.570 
didn't even take it all down so we are
definitely<00:03:08.110> in<00:03:08.410> trouble<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:09.010> stun<00:03:09.280> there<00:03:09.460> oh

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
would have allowed me to to kind of

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.460 
would have allowed me to to kind of
attack<00:03:18.880> those<00:03:19.150> snake<00:03:19.450> towers<00:03:19.810> without<00:03:19.989> taking

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
attack those snake towers without taking

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.330 
attack those snake towers without taking
damage<00:03:20.500> I<00:03:20.980> was<00:03:21.340> a<00:03:21.370> little<00:03:21.760> too<00:03:21.940> slow<00:03:22.300> on<00:03:22.330> that

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
damage I was a little too slow on that

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.020 
damage I was a little too slow on that
so<00:03:24.340> we<00:03:24.459> are<00:03:24.550> going<00:03:24.640> to<00:03:24.730> go<00:03:24.820> ahead<00:03:24.910> and

resurrect<00:03:25.450> one<00:03:25.510> time<00:03:25.840> here<00:03:26.050> hopefully<00:03:26.530> we<00:03:26.620> can

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
resurrect one time here hopefully we can

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.590 
resurrect one time here hopefully we can
get<00:03:26.830> through<00:03:27.010> most<00:03:27.310> of<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:27.520> base<00:03:27.730> and<00:03:28.090> get<00:03:28.570> a

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
get through most of the base and get a

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.540 
get through most of the base and get a
nice<00:03:28.780> highlight<00:03:29.080> feature<00:03:29.530> here<00:03:29.890> of<00:03:30.040> his<00:03:30.280> base

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
nice highlight feature here of his base

he will not regenerate so taking away
the<00:04:05.500> slowness<00:04:06.300> by<00:04:07.300> using<00:04:07.480> the<00:04:07.750> hero<00:04:08.019> scream<00:04:08.410> in

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
the slowness by using the hero scream in

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.759 
the slowness by using the hero scream in
the<00:04:08.650> top<00:04:08.890> left<00:04:09.519> corner<00:04:10.410> helps<00:04:11.410> tremendously

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
the top left corner helps tremendously

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.309 
the top left corner helps tremendously
even<00:04:12.700> if<00:04:12.820> no<00:04:12.970> units<00:04:13.360> are<00:04:13.540> around<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:13.989> hero<00:04:14.200> to

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
even if no units are around the hero to

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.589 
even if no units are around the hero to
hell<00:04:14.470> actually<00:04:14.650> like<00:04:15.010> call<00:04:15.220> to<00:04:15.430> him

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:21.719 

so<00:04:19.599> the<00:04:19.720> mummies<00:04:20.049> are<00:04:20.079> doing<00:04:20.439> a<00:04:20.530> fair<00:04:20.769> job<00:04:20.799> at

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729

massive amount of HP I'm actually really

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.029 
massive amount of HP I'm actually really
