00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.460 
back how strong or how stronger have it
even<00:03:23.269> though<00:03:23.480> you're<00:03:23.750> doing<00:03:23.989> this<00:03:24.109> alone

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
even though you're doing this alone

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.720 
even though you're doing this alone
could<00:03:25.099> you<00:03:25.220> actually<00:03:26.950> not<00:03:27.950> break<00:03:28.220> it<00:03:28.400> off<00:03:28.519> and

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
could you actually not break it off and

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.140 
could you actually not break it off and
isolate<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:30.049> the<00:03:30.680> action<00:03:31.280> of<00:03:31.549> the<00:03:31.700> lumbrical

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
isolate the the action of the lumbrical

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.589 
isolate the the action of the lumbrical
interosseous<00:03:35.319> it's<00:03:36.319> very<00:03:36.590> interesting<00:03:36.950> yeah

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
interosseous it's very interesting yeah

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.860 
interosseous it's very interesting yeah
so<00:03:38.599> so<00:03:39.049> of<00:03:39.170> course<00:03:39.519> it's<00:03:40.519> not<00:03:40.700> you<00:03:41.540> know<00:03:41.629> I'm

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
so so of course it's not you know I'm

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.149 
so so of course it's not you know I'm
not<00:03:42.049> gonna<00:03:42.200> ask<00:03:42.349> you<00:03:42.530> to<00:03:42.590> play<00:03:42.739> the<00:03:42.859> rest<00:03:42.950> your

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:43.159 
not gonna ask you to play the rest your

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:45.759 
not gonna ask you to play the rest your
life<00:03:43.250> or<00:03:43.430> slash<00:03:43.609> fingers<00:03:43.970> but<00:03:44.150> why<00:03:44.480> not<00:03:44.840> why

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
life or slash fingers but why not why

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.899 
life or slash fingers but why not why
not<00:03:45.799> acquire<00:03:46.549> that<00:03:46.879> option<00:03:48.370> if<00:03:49.370> you<00:03:49.519> wanted<00:03:49.790> to

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 
not acquire that option if you wanted to

00:03:49.909 --> 00:04:04.620 
not acquire that option if you wanted to
play

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.960 

but<00:04:05.630> even<00:04:06.050> just<00:04:06.230> to<00:04:06.440> do<00:04:06.620> that<00:04:06.830> in<00:04:07.100> isolation

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
but even just to do that in isolation

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.880 
but even just to do that in isolation
it's<00:04:08.450> gonna<00:04:08.600> come<00:04:08.900> in<00:04:08.930> useful<00:04:09.200> for<00:04:09.620> all<00:04:09.860> sorts

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
it's gonna come in useful for all sorts

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.070 
it's gonna come in useful for all sorts
of<00:04:10.580> different<00:04:10.820> places<00:04:11.450> in<00:04:11.810> their<00:04:11.900> repertoire

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
of different places in their repertoire

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.310 
of different places in their repertoire
where<00:04:12.650> you've<00:04:13.460> been<00:04:13.640> currently<00:04:14.390> as<00:04:14.630> we<00:04:14.870> all<00:04:15.020> do

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
where you've been currently as we all do

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.190 
where you've been currently as we all do
wonderfully<00:04:16.100> but<00:04:16.430> at<00:04:16.670> the<00:04:16.880> expense<00:04:17.060> of<00:04:17.810> the

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
wonderfully but at the expense of the

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.069 
wonderfully but at the expense of the
more<00:04:18.590> powerful<00:04:18.920> part<00:04:19.579> of<00:04:19.700> our<00:04:19.790> hand<00:04:20.060> this<00:04:20.840> is

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
more powerful part of our hand this is

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.510 
more powerful part of our hand this is
why<00:04:21.260> people<00:04:21.340> invest<00:04:22.340> their<00:04:22.520> art<00:04:22.940> to<00:04:23.810> make<00:04:23.990> tome

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
why people invest their art to make tome

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.360 
why people invest their art to make tome
because<00:04:25.520> they've<00:04:26.620> sacrificed<00:04:27.620> the<00:04:28.160> power

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
because they've sacrificed the power

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.660 
because they've sacrificed the power

pianist<00:04:34.570> but<00:04:35.570> what<00:04:36.169> about<00:04:36.380> the<00:04:36.530> middle<00:04:36.650> part

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
pianist but what about the middle part

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.430 
pianist but what about the middle part
when<00:04:37.460> you<00:04:37.550> have<00:04:37.790> this<00:04:38.060> you<00:04:38.120> no<00:04:38.540> longer<00:04:38.840> need<00:04:39.260> to

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
when you have this you no longer need to

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.159 
when you have this you no longer need to
invest<00:04:39.830> over<00:04:40.100> investigator<00:04:40.850> then<00:04:41.660> the<00:04:41.780> arm<00:04:41.990> is

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
invest over investigator then the arm is

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.480 
invest over investigator then the arm is
free<00:04:42.470> to<00:04:43.070> do<00:04:43.190> all<00:04:43.460> this<00:04:43.669> crazy<00:04:43.880> stuff<00:04:45.220> but<00:04:46.220> you

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
free to do all this crazy stuff but you

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.970 
free to do all this crazy stuff but you
need<00:04:46.760> you<00:04:47.419> need<00:04:47.630> to<00:04:47.750> just<00:04:48.020> get<00:04:48.169> that<00:04:48.410> image<00:04:48.620> of

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
need you need to just get that image of

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.960 
need you need to just get that image of
this<00:04:49.340> motion<00:04:49.730> without<00:04:51.370> then<00:04:52.370> you<00:04:52.640> added

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
this motion without then you added

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.780 
this motion without then you added
consciously<00:04:55.060> not<00:04:56.470> unwittingly<00:04:57.470> ends<00:04:57.790> without

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
consciously not unwittingly ends without

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.530 
consciously not unwittingly ends without
any<00:04:59.150> control<00:05:00.020> over<00:05:00.290> how<00:05:00.440> much<00:05:00.470> or<00:05:00.830> how<00:05:00.919> little

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
so when you have control over how much

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.560 
so when you have control over how much
or<00:05:04.130> how<00:05:04.220> little<00:05:04.250> bit<00:05:04.700> and<00:05:05.000> you've<00:05:05.150> got<00:05:05.360> a

wonderful tone variation you can just
you<00:05:09.080> can<00:05:09.110> every<00:05:10.010> look<00:05:10.700> like<00:05:10.970> 80%<00:05:12.130> interosseous

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
you can every look like 80% interosseous

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:20.380 
you can every look like 80% interosseous

each<00:05:20.570> one<00:05:20.870> of<00:05:20.990> those<00:05:21.080> will<00:05:21.290> give<00:05:21.470> a<00:05:21.500> different

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
each one of those will give a different

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.040 
each one of those will give a different
scenario<00:05:22.220> and<00:05:22.640> then<00:05:23.479> you've<00:05:23.660> got<00:05:23.870> this

wonderful sorority very very apparatus

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.580 
wonderful sorority very very apparatus
but<00:05:27.440> you<00:05:27.590> have<00:05:27.800> to<00:05:27.979> have<00:05:28.130> this<00:05:28.280> part
