00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
that due to limitations of the file

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.819 
that due to limitations of the file
system<00:02:24.900> movie<00:02:25.900> shooting<00:02:26.319> will<00:02:26.560> stop

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
system movie shooting will stop

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:28.979 
system movie shooting will stop
automatically<00:02:27.610> if<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.819> file<00:02:28.150> size<00:02:28.569> of<00:02:28.900> a

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
automatically if the file size of a

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.710 
automatically if the file size of a
single<00:02:29.470> movie<00:02:29.890> clip<00:02:30.220> reaches<00:02:30.849> four<00:02:31.150> gigabytes

single movie clip reaches four gigabytes

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.800 
single movie clip reaches four gigabytes
and<00:02:32.620> Ford<00:02:33.190> advice<00:02:33.610> takes<00:02:34.030> approximately

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
and Ford advice takes approximately

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.849 
and Ford advice takes approximately
eleven<00:02:35.200> minutes<00:02:35.700> there<00:02:36.700> we<00:02:36.849> go<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:37.420> so<00:02:38.140> when

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:38.859 
eleven minutes there we go and so when

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.309 
eleven minutes there we go and so when
you<00:02:39.099> look<00:02:39.129> at<00:02:39.579> if<00:02:40.239> your<00:02:40.480> self<00:02:40.870> you're<00:02:41.019> filming

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
you look at if your self you're filming

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:47.009 
you look at if your self you're filming
in<00:02:41.760> HD<00:02:44.280> eleven<00:02:45.280> minutes<00:02:45.459> is<00:02:45.879> four<00:02:46.450> gigabytes

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
in HD eleven minutes is four gigabytes

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:52.500 
in HD eleven minutes is four gigabytes
and<00:02:47.470> so<00:02:48.239> when<00:02:49.239> I<00:02:49.269> went<00:02:49.510> to<00:02:49.660> page<00:02:50.310> 291<00:02:51.310> in<00:02:52.299> the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
and so when I went to page 291 in the

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.599 
and so when I went to page 291 in the
manual

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
manual

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.199 
manual
it's<00:02:55.090> a<00:02:55.329> it<00:02:55.720> would<00:02:56.019> say<00:02:56.380> that<00:02:56.849> in<00:02:57.849> high

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
it's a it would say that in high

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.520 
it's a it would say that in high
definition<00:02:58.650> you're<00:02:59.650> doing<00:03:00.359> 330<00:03:01.530> megabytes

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
definition you're doing 330 megabytes

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.620 
definition you're doing 330 megabytes
per<00:03:02.680> minute<00:03:03.280> which<00:03:04.269> calculates<00:03:05.079> off<00:03:05.560> to<00:03:05.799> 46

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
per minute which calculates off to 46

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.780 
per minute which calculates off to 46
megabytes<00:03:07.630> per<00:03:07.780> second<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:08.739> when<00:03:09.250> I<00:03:09.280> look<00:03:09.639> at

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
megabytes per second and when I look at

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.009 
megabytes per second and when I look at
the<00:03:09.940> card<00:03:11.669> right<00:03:12.669> on<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:12.970> card<00:03:13.269> and<00:03:13.569> realize

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
the card right on the card and realize

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.809 
the card right on the card and realize
it<00:03:14.169> even<00:03:14.410> had<00:03:14.590> it<00:03:14.739> on<00:03:14.889> there<00:03:15.160> but<00:03:15.370> right<00:03:15.519> on<00:03:15.579> the

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
it even had it on there but right on the

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.750 
it even had it on there but right on the
card<00:03:16.150> my<00:03:16.750> 32<00:03:17.290> gigabyte<00:03:18.000> ultra<00:03:19.000> card<00:03:19.359> is<00:03:19.720> 30

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
card my 32 gigabyte ultra card is 30

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.039 
card my 32 gigabyte ultra card is 30
megabytes<00:03:21.760> per<00:03:22.030> second

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
megabytes per second

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.250 
megabytes per second
I<00:03:24.389> need<00:03:25.389> 46

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
I need 46

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.670 
I need 46
megabytes<00:03:28.260> per<00:03:28.409> second<00:03:29.069> in<00:03:29.280> order<00:03:29.579> to<00:03:30.120> run

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
megabytes per second in order to run

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.399 
megabytes per second in order to run
high-definition<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:31.890> my<00:03:32.340> card<00:03:33.049> was<00:03:34.049> only

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 
high-definition and my card was only

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:37.850 
high-definition and my card was only
writing<00:03:34.680> at<00:03:35.250> 30<00:03:36.090> megabytes<00:03:36.569> per<00:03:36.810> second<00:03:37.560> and

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
writing at 30 megabytes per second and

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:44.890 
writing at 30 megabytes per second and
so<00:03:38.579> then<00:03:38.879> I<00:03:39.379> purchased<00:03:40.379> the<00:03:41.840> Extreme<00:03:42.840> Pro
