00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.440 
have the brain got the brain on the
front<00:02:43.489> because<00:02:43.640> that's<00:02:43.760> what<00:02:43.970> you<00:02:44.120> have<00:02:44.300> to

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
front because that's what you have to

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.320 
front because that's what you have to
hit<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:45.350> zap<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.770> zombie<00:02:46.190> let's<00:02:46.640> try<00:02:46.850> this<00:02:46.910> at

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
hit to zap the zombie let's try this at

00:02:47.330 --> 00:03:08.470 
hit to zap the zombie let's try this at
100<00:02:48.230> yards

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.030 

what<00:03:09.480> do<00:03:09.540> you<00:03:09.630> think<00:03:09.750> about<00:03:09.810> that<00:03:09.959> for<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.470> 100

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
what do you think about that for a 100

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.910 
what do you think about that for a 100
yards<00:03:11.370> zombiebrain<00:03:11.880> shot<00:03:12.450> very<00:03:13.200> nice<00:03:13.530> and

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
yards zombiebrain shot very nice and

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.770 
yards zombiebrain shot very nice and
here<00:03:14.550> is<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.970> point<00:03:15.180> of<00:03:15.300> entry

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
here is the point of entry

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.620 
here is the point of entry
no<00:03:16.709> exit<00:03:17.160> marks<00:03:17.430> on<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:17.670> block<00:03:17.880> at<00:03:18.090> all<00:03:18.270> let's

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
no exit marks on the block at all let's

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.860 
no exit marks on the block at all let's
cut<00:03:18.780> it<00:03:18.870> open<00:03:18.959> and<00:03:19.230> take<00:03:19.350> a<00:03:19.380> look<00:03:20.780> here's<00:03:21.780> a

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
cut it open and take a look here's a

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.050 
cut it open and take a look here's a
dissection<00:03:22.560> of<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.800> zombie<00:03:23.160> head<00:03:23.370> this<00:03:23.700> is

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
dissection of the zombie head this is

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.110 
dissection of the zombie head this is
the<00:03:24.120> left<00:03:24.780> side<00:03:25.220> point<00:03:26.220> of<00:03:26.310> entry<00:03:26.520> coming<00:03:26.970> in

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
the left side point of entry coming in

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.110 
the left side point of entry coming in
here<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:28.370> expansion<00:03:29.370> starting<00:03:29.700> about<00:03:29.790> 1/2

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
here and expansion starting about 1/2

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.900 
here and expansion starting about 1/2
inch<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.690> it<00:03:31.170> just<00:03:31.319> really<00:03:31.920> explodes<00:03:32.489> right

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
inch and it just really explodes right

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.120 
inch and it just really explodes right
here<00:03:33.690> at<00:03:33.780> about<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.080> 1<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.380> a<00:03:34.410> half<00:03:34.590> inch<00:03:34.890> mark

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
here at about the 1 and a half inch mark

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.979 
here at about the 1 and a half inch mark
so<00:03:35.310> I'll<00:03:35.400> get<00:03:35.520> a<00:03:35.550> cross-section<00:03:36.390> right

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
so I'll get a cross-section right

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.560 
so I'll get a cross-section right
through<00:03:37.230> here<00:03:37.440> and<00:03:37.500> we'll<00:03:37.650> take<00:03:37.800> another

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
through here and we'll take another

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.060 
through here and we'll take another
dimension<00:03:39.570> another<00:03:39.810> look<00:03:40.140> at<00:03:40.320> this<00:03:40.560> look<00:03:41.010> at

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
dimension another look at this look at

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.740 
dimension another look at this look at
all<00:03:41.160> these<00:03:41.310> bits<00:03:41.580> and<00:03:41.790> pieces<00:03:42.000> in<00:03:42.300> this<00:03:42.420> cavity

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
all these bits and pieces in this cavity

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.810 
all these bits and pieces in this cavity
which<00:03:43.620> again<00:03:43.920> we'll<00:03:44.160> see<00:03:44.340> better<00:03:44.580> in<00:03:44.730> the

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
which again we'll see better in the

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.449 
which again we'll see better in the
cross-section<00:03:45.320> that's<00:03:46.320> just<00:03:46.590> nasty<00:03:46.860> again

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
cross-section that's just nasty again

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.520 
cross-section that's just nasty again
that's<00:03:47.640> just<00:03:47.760> one<00:03:48.030> side<00:03:48.269> of<00:03:48.330> this<00:03:48.630> path<00:03:48.900> so

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
that's just one side of this path so

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.440 
that's just one side of this path so
bits<00:03:49.769> and<00:03:49.950> pieces<00:03:50.130> are<00:03:50.430> carrying<00:03:50.820> on<00:03:50.940> here<00:03:51.209> for

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
bits and pieces are carrying on here for

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.440 
bits and pieces are carrying on here for
about<00:03:51.630> 6<00:03:52.350> inches<00:03:52.650> or<00:03:52.830> so<00:03:53.010> I<00:03:53.250> was<00:03:53.940> looking<00:03:54.090> for

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
about 6 inches or so I was looking for

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.990 
about 6 inches or so I was looking for
the<00:03:54.540> bullet<00:03:54.900> core<00:03:55.170> and<00:03:55.470> have<00:03:56.400> not<00:03:56.580> found<00:03:56.610> it

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
the bullet core and have not found it

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.130 
the bullet core and have not found it
yet<00:03:57.060> so<00:03:57.360> I<00:03:57.390> don't<00:03:57.660> know<00:03:57.750> if<00:03:57.840> that<00:03:57.959> just

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
yet so I don't know if that just

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.090 
yet so I don't know if that just
absolutely<00:03:58.709> exploded<00:03:59.630> or<00:04:00.630> if<00:04:01.200> it's<00:04:01.410> buried<00:04:02.040> in

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
absolutely exploded or if it's buried in

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.320 
absolutely exploded or if it's buried in
here<00:04:02.340> somewhere<00:04:02.610> haven't<00:04:02.970> found<00:04:03.150> it<00:04:03.269> yet

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
here somewhere haven't found it yet

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.210 
here somewhere haven't found it yet
might<00:04:03.810> even<00:04:03.959> find<00:04:04.230> it<00:04:04.380> in<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:04.530> casting<00:04:04.980> and

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
might even find it in the casting and

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.150 
might even find it in the casting and
melting<00:04:05.910> process<00:04:06.600> and<00:04:07.200> here<00:04:07.829> on<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:08.010> other

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
melting process and here on the other

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.630 
melting process and here on the other
side<00:04:08.430> I<00:04:08.459> found<00:04:08.970> that<00:04:09.420> polymer<00:04:10.290> tip<00:04:10.680> it<00:04:10.950> was<00:04:11.489> in

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
side I found that polymer tip it was in

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.620 
side I found that polymer tip it was in
this<00:04:11.790> track<00:04:12.150> at<00:04:12.750> about<00:04:12.989> 4<00:04:13.290> inches<00:04:14.480> here's<00:04:15.480> the

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
this track at about 4 inches here's the

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.300 
this track at about 4 inches here's the
first<00:04:15.780> cross-section<00:04:16.560> this<00:04:16.709> was<00:04:16.919> made<00:04:17.130> at

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
first cross-section this was made at

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.340 
first cross-section this was made at
one-and-a-half<00:04:17.700> inches<00:04:18.299> inside<00:04:18.840> the<00:04:19.079> path

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
one-and-a-half inches inside the path

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.069 
one-and-a-half inches inside the path
and<00:04:19.790> it's<00:04:20.790> about<00:04:21.090> three<00:04:21.359> quarters<00:04:21.390> of<00:04:21.750> an<00:04:21.959> inch

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
and it's about three quarters of an inch

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.930 
and it's about three quarters of an inch
in<00:04:22.410> diameter<00:04:22.590> and<00:04:23.220> look<00:04:23.340> at<00:04:23.430> all<00:04:23.520> those<00:04:23.640> pieces

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
in diameter and look at all those pieces

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.980 
in diameter and look at all those pieces
that<00:04:24.180> is<00:04:24.630> the<00:04:24.810> bullet<00:04:25.110> coming<00:04:25.680> toward<00:04:26.130> us

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
that is the bullet coming toward us

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.150 
that is the bullet coming toward us
here's<00:04:27.990> the<00:04:28.169> rest<00:04:28.350> of<00:04:28.410> the<00:04:28.500> cross-section

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
here's the rest of the cross-section

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.490 
here's the rest of the cross-section
isn't<00:04:29.430> that<00:04:29.550> just<00:04:29.760> nasty<00:04:30.450> or<00:04:30.660> what<00:04:30.960> this<00:04:31.260> is

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
isn't that just nasty or what this is

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.409 
isn't that just nasty or what this is
from<00:04:31.740> one<00:04:31.979> and<00:04:32.100> a<00:04:32.130> half<00:04:32.310> inches<00:04:32.760> forward<00:04:33.090> and

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
from one and a half inches forward and

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.750 
from one and a half inches forward and
I'm<00:04:33.990> obviously<00:04:34.169> spreading<00:04:34.830> this<00:04:34.919> open<00:04:35.340> but<00:04:35.520> if

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
I'm obviously spreading this open but if

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.090 
I'm obviously spreading this open but if
you<00:04:36.180> measured<00:04:36.630> it<00:04:36.720> it's<00:04:36.930> about<00:04:37.110> two<00:04:37.560> inches<00:04:37.919> in

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
you measured it it's about two inches in

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.500 
you measured it it's about two inches in
diameter<00:04:38.250> on<00:04:38.850> this<00:04:39.450> cavity<00:04:39.960> I<00:04:41.300> suppose<00:04:42.300> you

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
diameter on this cavity I suppose you

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.150 
diameter on this cavity I suppose you
could<00:04:42.660> use<00:04:42.840> this<00:04:42.990> on<00:04:43.140> zombies<00:04:43.620> that<00:04:43.830> they<00:04:43.950> came

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
could use this on zombies that they came

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.630 
could use this on zombies that they came
to<00:04:44.220> that<00:04:44.550> but<00:04:44.580> has<00:04:45.090> everyone<00:04:45.600> figured<00:04:45.960> it<00:04:46.080> out

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
to that but has everyone figured it out

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.950 
to that but has everyone figured it out
some<00:04:47.640> of<00:04:47.760> you<00:04:47.880> knew<00:04:48.060> this<00:04:48.210> before<00:04:48.600> the<00:04:48.690> video

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
some of you knew this before the video

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.990 
some of you knew this before the video
began<00:04:49.320> others<00:04:49.830> may<00:04:50.010> have<00:04:50.039> just<00:04:50.460> confirmed<00:04:50.640> it

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
began others may have just confirmed it
