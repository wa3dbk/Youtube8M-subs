00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 for beginners, npd data is extremely extreme 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.910
 be complicated when you do that 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.500
 basic concept but once understood 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.820
 has and knows the right sources 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.590
 it changes 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.690
 The data is used by many 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.820
 details to describe and always will 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.830
 at the end of a command she inserts 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.240
 start with an open and end 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.789
 with a closed curved 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.650
 bracket are extremely simple, for example, the mb 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.019
 data for building a particular 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.849
 horses type of command now starts with 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.340
 together entity horse and the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.170
 coordinates without further details 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.300
 any random one with this command 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.340
 Horse be curious with the indication 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.530
 But we can do type colon 1 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.489
 to give happiness to us that learns of the type e 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.620
 should be 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.680
 besides, there is still the normal driving 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.690
 with the zero mules with the 2 to the bbi 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.879
 I'll be with the three and skeletons 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.559
 to note with the four generated is the 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.329
 exact uppercase and lowercase of the 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.550
 Word type otherwise with the tag 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.379
 in principle, individuals are ignored 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.420
 in wicke data separated by comma 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.620
 we want our other one ranked 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.750
 donkey so still a custom 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.030
 name we hang behind type 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.189
 colon 1 1 comma and add 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.290
 then add the tag custom nejm 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.330
 If you want names and description of one 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.790
 You could theoretically change items at 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.770
 self command in the npd data easy 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.450
 one day for the name and one day 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.130
 for the description add there 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.110
 this, however, with a large amount of 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.090
 data becomes confusing 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.130
 groups of data with terms 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.470
 summarized in our case reads 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.150
 the generic term display there we add 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.579
 instead of a name or a number as 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.960
 worth a new nbc record one of 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.520
 with another curved bracket 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.100
 opened and closed again at the end 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.740
 is located at the tec display there 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.479
 then once at the point name of the title 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.070
 from afar and if they are one 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.200
 You can trade leather armor with the 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.909
 day all also a color code 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.020
 Just paste this one for that one 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.030
 editor from the video description 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.920
 used next to curly braces 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.899
 there are also square for a list 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.430
 clinging in curly braces 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.290
 can the npd data all 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.360
 own different structures 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.670
 the text name becomes a text 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.799
 registered at the point color one 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.079
 Number code and under law is one 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.450
 foolhardy brackets cling to the npd data 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.910
 imtech display are different because 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.849
 a text is neither a number nor a he 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.410
 in the letter of lohr is by a comma 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.600
 separated 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.490
 each line of the subtitle is listed 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.990
 every line just consists of 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.270
 normal text and always has it 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.920
 the same structure is the same 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.080
 The enchantment of a structure 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.060
 items the day starts with and 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.650
 colon and square brackets in 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.150
 each of these square brackets will cling 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.920
 enchantment individually the curved one 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.960
 clinging as they always only 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.760
 the idea and the level need that 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.650
 aditus enchantment we find minecraft 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.750
 and the level can be higher 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.610
 be normal for example one 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.080
 power to generate 100 points 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.180
 pillar at bonn in september every 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.520
 you want to kill the opponent immediately with the 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.260
 tag hiflex for an item 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.090
 Details from blind one could yes 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.160
 actually in a list every detail 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.450
 enumerate that should be trained 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.550
 because it is always just a text 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.080
 Sometimes the whole thing is like in 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.910
 in this case, however, over a numerical value 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.800
 you want to get rid of enchantment 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.240
 Hiding there is a 1 there 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.270
 and for the lack of attributes 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.220
 a 2 you want in chats and attributes 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.740
 must hide to the values add up 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.720
 So you want to use a 3 only the 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.070
 hide the indestructibility of an item 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.350
 Do you give a 4 there 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.330
 since the three is already occupied you want 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.910
 hide all three details you add 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.070
 the values ​​and comes to 7 the exact ones 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.780
 Wording of the noon and its meaning 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.040
 you can find clear minecraft wiki 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.150
 on two pages in the video 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.680
 description are linked 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.420
 Highly recommended is the search function 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.580
 which we with control and f 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.900
 can activate before the name of a 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.150
 tags will always give us the exact 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.860
 data type and its abbreviation called in 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.950
 a far one can be whole number in the 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.850
 interval from minus 128 to 127 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.770
 to save 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.620
 If this is not enough , you take the type 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.630
 short becomes even greater and the integer 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.890
 Finally, there is still a long time floating point 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.080
 pay in minecraft 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.300
 English either in the float or 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.860
 saved in double this is important 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.390
 as a professional sometimes behind the 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.250
 registered worth the data sorte 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.350
 must specify if I have a very small 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.150
 I want to save the value, I use the data 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.030
 sort byd and then write at the 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.930
 Specifying whether, for example, a zombie game should be 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.489
 for a year 1b and for 90 b metadata 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.620
 items that are in a box 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.450
 are stored with short 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.549
 So we hang there eg with a potion 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.160
 the regeneration 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:21.160
 8193 it is not hanging on behind inter 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.140
 letters and behind float values ​​1 f 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.250
 texts you save a string to the man 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.250
 do not need to mark further
