let's<00:01:29.909> just<00:01:30.090> see<00:01:30.270> how<00:01:30.450> int<00:01:30.810> 2x<00:01:31.140> breaks<00:01:31.530> this

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
let's just see how int 2x breaks this

let's just see how int 2x breaks this
lower<00:01:32.189> down<00:01:34.490> zoom<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.670> little<00:01:35.790> bit

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:50.710
