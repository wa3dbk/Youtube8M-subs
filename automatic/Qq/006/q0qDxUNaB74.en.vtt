00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.660
 the principle of this sauce avg is to 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.849
 replace fat with quantity and 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.500
 part of the nest so as to conserve 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.130
 the appetence of the room to say that's it 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.000
 which is important 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.130
 in the end then the quantity we are going 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.380
 get through yoghurt 0% 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.930
 it's all about volume and nappy 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.939

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:13.080
 further there a soy sauce line 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.350
 in the soy sauce give taste is 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.700
 salty at the same time then then there 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.049
 it's according to the tastes too but I 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.570
 do you want to put a line of vinegar 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.189
