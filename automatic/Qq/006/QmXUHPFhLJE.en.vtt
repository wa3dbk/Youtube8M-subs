 sterilized jars cooked brine then 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.579
 there was a long procedure for transfusing it

 gang and back it all took a lot 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.129
 places of effort and time have happened and burned 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.500
 sometimes boiling water mistress of what you can not stand 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.020
 for winter stocks but we live in a century 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.329
 high tech for the technician takes on 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.219
 yourself most of the work by the way and 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.320
 canning is also possible with her

 lay the necessary products 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.309
 pour hot marinade expose 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.589
 the program is enough convection 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.930
 combines the functions of 10 kitchen 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.930
 items in it easily get along plate

 he absorbed all the best quality 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.340
 these devices but left at the same time 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.229

 less product lay and now you can 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.670
 Pour the already ready brine and now so 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.220
 understand and cover it with a lid and 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.740
 set take the time we need succeed 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.909
 gather here in the rubber pads 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.310
 convection oven very high temperature 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.689
 so that the rubber is not diluted we need it 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.950
 remove i just cover up the worker 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:46.750

 required temperature 10 minutes 10 for 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.850
 liter 15 to two liters and 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.100
 260 degrees so this is what we have 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.189
 1 bank of 15 minutes turns out and how many 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.619
 cans you can roll 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.450

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.880
 preserve 3 2 liter jars and 6 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.799

 air that circulates around 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.180
 product and evenly heats it with 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:24.280
 all sides in this way products 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.380
 prepared without the use of oil and fat
