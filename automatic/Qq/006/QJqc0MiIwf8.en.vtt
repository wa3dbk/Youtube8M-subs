00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.290
 what is the best ipad case for you? 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:10.639
 everyone will have a difference 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:11.969
 there is no doubt 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.309
 for my part, however, after having tried so many I return 7 on that one 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.740
 the reasons are quite simple because it is very very thin and resistant 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:27.020
 at the same time to this very practical interlocking feature that makes it 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:29.529
 immediately available in stand mode 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.460
 notes this feels like a fault 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.830
 after all, in the review we linked it harder 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.930
 but the really annoying one with sport and it was easily from the pictures and the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.930
 sensibility the dirt of the material of that compound 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.820
 other material however very resistant 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.920
 so when i saw the if you want to be asked open part said it 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.830
 I immediately thought it was the definitive solution indeed 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.590
 this almost slavishly takes up the structure of the apple case but you love it 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.490
 instead a material much more night because internet 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.900
 entity then charcoal defect just mentioned 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.350
 the opening for inserting the strings always sideways 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.650
 The cover 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.340
 the same features we said about the one in the apple case for which e 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.620
 sectioned 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.270
 two games 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.910
 this evening it bends and goes to fit on the back with the fauna 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.490
 to an attachment that in practice takes up even here in a fairly faithful manner 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.490
 that of the leather case 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.480
 in fact we can to do the exact same thing as 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.680
 this place you also see the result held 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.590
 in short, so far so good, moreover, by handling laxins 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.050
 immediately notice the classic price quality of pisa that exists for which 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.870
 the skin is really good for me infinity very well 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.689
 let's go and visit her 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.149
 and we will first leopard its current custody operation if that 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.390
 if you had the net you know if you don't have expensive seats you need to 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.299
 I'll tell you a little strength 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:16.029
 and we insert the same in the case exited with the sketches 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:21.889
 the material here is a little stiffer and allows for easier insertion 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:23.830
 you can fix 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.009
 the ipadevice 

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:30.319
 this classic side tongue that passes fold back inside 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:39.289
 now we the word made more times than in the place of apple enasarco both 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:42.969
 on functionality but also on the subject of practicality 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:47.409
 here we see how you see a feature that is reported here as well 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:49.100
 faithfully that of thickness 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.250
 although of the nhl material if it was slightly more often in the whole the 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.119
 custody 

00:02:55.119 --> 00:03:00.029
 anneheche really thin and therefore turns out to be practical the same way it will hold the 

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:03.459
 transport also for insertion and surroundings for internal of another bag 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.619
 but let's see how it behaves from a functional point of view 

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:11.129
 the frame a little thicker than the original abuse for which it was necessary 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.799
 a ground cut have direct access to the home button 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.090
 as well as a hole in the upper area on the ground the environmental sensors 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:26.479
 laterally in the part in alternative cost that there is also an article cut 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:27.099
 for 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.370
 alan create a slowly usable pocket for small documents 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.650
 clearly nothing d 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.419
 transcendental just some note to consult mondotrans 

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:41.959
 we have already cited the quality of the material but it is also evident from da 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:42.590
 close 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.720
 eccert classic I said b7es 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.809
 slightly raised in the lower right air 

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:51.090
 one thing that you notice that moon 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.360
 less run resistance 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.920
 of the section 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.269
 front 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.510
 this is lucia a little negatively on usability because it is pure 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.690
 incastrandosi 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.159
 it is more or less the same way as the original on the back 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:09.629
 it happens instead that 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:11.210
 xiii and deadlifts 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.430
 quite 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.509
 easily 

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:18.079
 for example, suppose you place it in horizontal stand mode 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.979
 and just touch a little bit 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:25.469
 the side part that this is ahahah coming off 

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:29.089
 and this does not happen with the same simplicity as havana 

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:30.039
 original 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.629
 and it can be seen even more easily when held in the hand 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:36.199
 because you just need to touch it 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:37.830
 or in any case movement 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:44.380
 dream maybe a little sudden while you hold it immediately on the cover 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:45.800
 goes to break away 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.020
 and I think it depends a little on the birth of the material but also 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.770
 from a lower width of bellows interlocking as always as I can 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.690
 besate sessa we have a product 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.890
 d excellent quality regarding the materials with well-finished finishes 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:05.580
 there is also the cost as is normally the case for the company is rather high and but that 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.060
 from the practical point of view, by taking it again, the course of the people turns out to be truly 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.070
 special with some exceptions we have seen for this joint in 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:17.419
 back part that does not work with the same 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.840
 perfection we can say that of the original case from here yes 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.849
 explains 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:23.849
 the final vote external edit 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:26.849
 but I invite you to read the full review on the block 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:28.090
 See you soon
