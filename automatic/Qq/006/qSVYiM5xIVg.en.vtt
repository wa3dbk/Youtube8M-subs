00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.150
 today we have here in the mante 10 point 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.370
 com this is a good monitor 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.670
 interesting to know why I'm going to 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.670
 open it 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:21.230
 very simple this can not be hit is 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.590
 a monitor 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:28.740
 hitting things but quickly 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.240
 be firm that is calling you already 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.560
 we had done something with them a long time ago 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.350
 time has started today in order to 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.420
 televisions and monitors but hey this one 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.180
 our attention was called by the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.090
 attention because it has a characteristic 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.559
 well very interesting that is the first 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.840
 time that at least I have to see it 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.640
 and so live and direct and it's a 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.219
 super light product 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.739
 just not what weigh two kilos a 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.110
 little bit less is a monitor of 16 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.920
 inches if I'm not wrong because I do not 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.969
 I have all the services always and they are 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:06.100
 16 inches is 15.6 or basically 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:11.439
 16 inches is not so big 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:17.740
 look what you have is a cable with two 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:20.740
 inputs two usb connectors that will go from 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:25.370
 another side that is this micro mini and micro 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.890
 usb mini usb mini usb 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:32.390
 they see that they already understood how 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:35.360
 is the story button and alarte has no 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.480
 old age to nothing nor of my son be march 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.190
 of micro displayport and game are giving 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.290
 nothing the most important is that neither 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.520
 has exact current change not 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.420
 It has power cord has nothing 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.980
 does not weigh much is a 100% usb monitor 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.280
 now what is it for? 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.660
 connect to another computer the 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.150
 instructions here we leave it for 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.490
 course and we're going to cheat him 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.370
 because I'm sure you need drivers 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.530
 because finally it's nothing standard 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.420
 take video by in usb 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.030
 we do not want friends in that same standard 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.350
 there are people who are two usb is because 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.150
 one of the stream and others are the 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.370
 data we are going to connect is a machine 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:18.900
 with windows 8 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:23.160
 we will be windows 8 I will connect it 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.930
 1 2 in each bag 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.550
 but if they are two ports that you have to 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.380
 use for this you can not do anything else 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.160
 cum and I'll see what windows does to 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.160
 see if he tells us something 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.140
 because here is the disc with the 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:43.099
 good drivers surely need it 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:46.720
 but by the way we did not do anything and 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:51.049
 do nothing to look there is something to be 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.970
 installing devices wait while 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.069
 the installation program installs the 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.590
 necessary files in your system this 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.209
 it may take several minutes there goes 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.340
 then surely doing windows 8 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.290
 connected in the toilet room some 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.790
 site that the drivers are 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.760
 I'm sure that he applied 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.489
 let's restart and why not with magic 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.069
 of the video returned and good after 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.629
 true create it there because first 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.180
 supposedly under the driver but not what 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.799
 under we enter a place under one not 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.140
 compatible with windows 8 finally 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.519
 we entered where we had to enter 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.450
 downloaded the very fast driver 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:28.790
 of a mega and we connect again and look 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.790
 the information of 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.310
 windows that detected another monitor I'm going to 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.370
 open a window 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:41.670
 explorer I do not see when she's already gone 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:45.980
 I'm not operating as a remote control 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.980
 what I do not see anything we have in the sale 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.379
 why 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:03.230
 has a little sensor or will it be that 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:06.110
 something that feels of sense is sensible 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.430
 and look point here agrees this 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.660
 windows window where it tells you that 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.190
 monitors you have and what is and what 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.550
 resolution in this case the monitor 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.070
 external is vertically us 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.359
 Well, I'm going to turn it around so you can see and 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.340
 how it changes 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.260
 I'm going to flip this was flipped here 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.150
 there is a little blink and it already puts you in 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.760
 horizontal mode in such a way that no 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.190
 you can use how resolution is done 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:32.770
 of this monitor 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:38.770
 they are is currently and not more or less thousand 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.770
 366 x 768 inches 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.220
 pixels sometimes in just the performance of 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.040
 the brain with his mom the place but 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.040
 we can appear but criticizes certain 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.490
 for eternal 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.490
 is in one place 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:55.930
 vertical brain 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.050
 with the ad fort 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:12.000
 it's like a demo they did for everyone 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.389
 it's not a vertical video video 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.280
 what happens best is a third time 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.280
 bigger not the brain 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.730
 nothing to do with our official video 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:28.690
 nothing to see more good if you have to see 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.690
 but it 's different 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.430
 there is improving 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.650
 this is chaos in the monitor model 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:45.480
 as you always know the names are 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:49.140
 horrible 1649 fw11 but good 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:52.740
 basically it's a usb monitor which 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:55.140
 we are using and in the metroplex in the 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:59.370
 practice here below us in not being 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:00.390
 dot com so that you would make us to 1800 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.180
 pesos 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:05.640
 of the range let's say a little bit above but 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.190
 aouate your sb has no current no 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.170
 nothing is this and here we have found 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:13.980
 a couple of uses you practice the work 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:16.380
 in a few clear ideas in the days 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.510
 to watch videos that are deep what 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.360
 we do not any application and I go to a 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:24.200
 I do not know what store you can put here 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:27.330
 sports that do my role or double the 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.860
 desk tube and then that some 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.650
 application I do not know surely there 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.920
 applications with a usb and a monitor 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.920
 external
