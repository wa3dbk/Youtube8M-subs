it<00:00:54.180> doesn't<00:00:54.510> just<00:00:54.719> disappear<00:00:54.980> so<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.100> gets

it doesn't just disappear so it gets

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.770 
it doesn't just disappear so it gets

slow<00:01:02.789> down<00:01:03.000> our<00:01:03.180> metabolism<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.650> we<00:01:04.769> need<00:01:04.920> to

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
slow down our metabolism so we need to

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.060 
slow down our metabolism so we need to
boost<00:01:05.339> our<00:01:05.580> calorie<00:01:06.000> usage<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:07.590> other<00:01:07.799> words

boost our calorie usage in other words
we<00:01:08.670> need<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.000> find<00:01:09.240> foods<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.900> speed<00:01:10.140> up<00:01:10.470> our

we need to find foods that speed up our
metabolism<00:01:11.400> but<00:01:11.850> still<00:01:12.119> don't<00:01:12.299> provide

metabolism but still don't provide
enough<00:01:12.659> energy<00:01:13.640> that's<00:01:14.640> when<00:01:14.970> our<00:01:15.000> body<00:01:15.330> will

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
enough energy that's when our body will

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.380 
enough energy that's when our body will
go<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.350> our<00:01:16.590> fat<00:01:16.830> storage<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.430> use<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.180> as

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
go to our fat storage and use that as

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.390 
go to our fat storage and use that as
energy<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.350> we'll<00:01:19.500> start<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.860> see<00:01:19.890> our<00:01:20.130> fat

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
energy and we'll start to see our fat

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.240 
energy and we'll start to see our fat
beginning<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.030> disappear<00:01:21.770> now<00:01:22.770> what<00:01:22.979> if<00:01:23.100> we

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
beginning to disappear now what if we

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.730 
beginning to disappear now what if we
could<00:01:23.430> find<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.790> way<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.689> keep<00:01:24.869> our<00:01:25.049> metabolism

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
could find a way to keep our metabolism

not have enough energy then our body

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.469 
not have enough energy then our body
will<00:01:31.950> get<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.250> energy<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.729> needs<00:01:32.759> from<00:01:33.150> fat

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
will get the energy it needs from fat

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.539
