00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.800 

the<00:00:03.740> light<00:00:03.980> is<00:00:04.300> definitely<00:00:05.300> something<00:00:05.540> that's

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:05.810 
the light is definitely something that's

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.599 
the light is definitely something that's
intriguing<00:00:06.319> there<00:00:06.740> that<00:00:06.979> it<00:00:07.130> doesn't<00:00:07.460> ever

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:07.609 
intriguing there that it doesn't ever

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:10.210 
intriguing there that it doesn't ever
really<00:00:07.729> get<00:00:08.120> light<00:00:08.330> but<00:00:08.599> the<00:00:08.750> venue<00:00:09.050> itself<00:00:09.410> is

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:10.220 
really get light but the venue itself is

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.150 
really get light but the venue itself is
a<00:00:11.030> long<00:00:11.660> flat<00:00:12.020> out<00:00:12.320> of<00:00:12.440> the<00:00:12.530> start<00:00:12.830> with<00:00:13.130> a

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
a long flat out of the start with a

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.450 
a long flat out of the start with a
pretty<00:00:13.610> substantial<00:00:14.240> break<00:00:14.480> over<00:00:14.840> and<00:00:15.460> and

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
pretty substantial break over and and

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.300 
pretty substantial break over and and
then<00:00:16.849> that's<00:00:17.750> that's<00:00:18.140> not<00:00:18.320> too<00:00:18.529> long<00:00:18.800> and<00:00:19.099> then

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
then that's that's not too long and then

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.579 
then that's that's not too long and then
it<00:00:19.429> rolls<00:00:19.669> moderately<00:00:20.449> back<00:00:20.659> out<00:00:20.900> flat<00:00:21.289> at<00:00:21.470> the

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:21.589 
it rolls moderately back out flat at the

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:24.429 
it rolls moderately back out flat at the
finish<00:00:21.890> so<00:00:22.599> they<00:00:23.599> usually<00:00:23.839> do<00:00:24.140> a<00:00:24.169> great<00:00:24.409> job

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
finish so they usually do a great job

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.450 
finish so they usually do a great job
with<00:00:24.890> the<00:00:25.130> surface<00:00:25.669> there<00:00:25.909> and<00:00:26.210> and<00:00:27.460> the

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
with the surface there and and the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.239 
with the surface there and and the
injection<00:00:28.999> works<00:00:29.149> well<00:00:29.449> and<00:00:29.630> it's<00:00:29.779> quite<00:00:30.050> a

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:30.249 
injection works well and it's quite a

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:33.010 
injection works well and it's quite a
humid<00:00:31.249> environment<00:00:31.399> so<00:00:32.180> I<00:00:32.419> guess<00:00:32.630> it<00:00:32.780> can<00:00:32.899> get

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
humid environment so I guess it can get

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.780 
humid environment so I guess it can get
quite<00:00:33.200> slick<00:00:33.590> so<00:00:33.920> we'll<00:00:34.190> see<00:00:34.370> how<00:00:34.399> it<00:00:34.550> turned

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
quite slick so we'll see how it turned

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.360 
quite slick so we'll see how it turned
we're<00:00:35.059> way<00:00:35.269> up<00:00:35.420> in<00:00:35.600> Finland<00:00:36.109> and<00:00:36.230> it<00:00:36.350> was<00:00:36.530> you

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
we're way up in Finland and it was you

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.029 
we're way up in Finland and it was you
know<00:00:37.430> minus<00:00:37.940> 15<00:00:38.660> or<00:00:38.989> something<00:00:39.320> like<00:00:39.469> that<00:00:39.530> so

00:00:40.029 --> 00:00:40.039 
know minus 15 or something like that so

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:42.400 
know minus 15 or something like that so
yeah<00:00:40.820> it<00:00:41.030> should<00:00:41.239> be<00:00:41.269> should<00:00:41.719> be<00:00:41.750> cold<00:00:42.079> that's

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
yeah it should be should be cold that's

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.349 
yeah it should be should be cold that's
what<00:00:42.559> we<00:00:42.620> hope<00:00:42.739> for<00:00:42.800> without<00:00:43.609> Jimmy<00:00:43.910> right<00:00:44.179> now

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
on that

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.210 
on that
in<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:24.040> past<00:01:24.930> we're<00:01:25.930> excited<00:01:26.230> to<00:01:26.470> go<00:01:26.650> and<00:01:26.950> and

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
in the past we're excited to go and and

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.160 
in the past we're excited to go and and
it's<00:01:27.550> you<00:01:27.940> know<00:01:27.970> it's<00:01:28.060> pretty<00:01:28.780> similar<00:01:29.020> to

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
it's you know it's pretty similar to

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.750 
it's you know it's pretty similar to
sold<00:01:29.500> it<00:01:29.650> in<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:29.860> sense<00:01:30.100> that<00:01:30.190> it's<00:01:30.400> a<00:01:30.490> really

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
sold it in the sense that it's a really

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.880 
sold it in the sense that it's a really
early<00:01:31.000> race<00:01:31.390> and<00:01:31.690> it's<00:01:31.810> a<00:01:31.900> single<00:01:32.350> race<00:01:32.560> in<00:01:32.800> a

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
early race and it's a single race in a

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.610 
early race and it's a single race in a
single<00:01:33.250> event<00:01:33.580> so<00:01:33.910> it's<00:01:34.120> tough<00:01:34.870> logistically

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
single event so it's tough logistically

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.430 
single event so it's tough logistically
it's<00:01:36.160> tough<00:01:36.430> to<00:01:36.730> train<00:01:37.270> for<00:01:37.600> and<00:01:37.900> all<00:01:38.260> those

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
it's tough to train for and all those

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.320 
it's tough to train for and all those
things<00:01:38.740> so<00:01:39.040> you<00:01:39.760> don't<00:01:39.910> we'll<00:01:40.030> see<00:01:40.180> how<00:01:40.300> it

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
things so you don't we'll see how it

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.300 
things so you don't we'll see how it
goes<00:01:40.450> and<00:01:40.870> and<00:01:41.080> then<00:01:41.440> we<00:01:41.680> start<00:01:41.920> our<00:01:42.040> fight

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
goes and and then we start our fight

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.480 
goes and and then we start our fight
