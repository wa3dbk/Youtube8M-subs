00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:27.149 
with all that running I still pop out

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:29.929 
with all that running I still pop out
well<00:05:28.050> 18<00:05:28.589> hours<00:05:28.889> of<00:05:29.009> battery<00:05:29.369> life<00:05:29.399> before<00:05:29.729> I

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:29.939 
well 18 hours of battery life before I

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:32.959 
well 18 hours of battery life before I
feel<00:05:30.149> like<00:05:30.240> it<00:05:30.419> needs<00:05:30.539> a<00:05:30.749> charge<00:05:31.939> which<00:05:32.939> is

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:32.969 
feel like it needs a charge which is

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:35.179 
feel like it needs a charge which is
really<00:05:33.719> good<00:05:33.959> especially<00:05:34.409> seeing<00:05:34.889> as<00:05:34.949> it<00:05:35.099> has

00:05:35.179 --> 00:05:35.189 
really good especially seeing as it has

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:37.969 
really good especially seeing as it has
a<00:05:35.219> dual<00:05:35.490> core<00:05:35.699> processor<00:05:36.409> the<00:05:37.409> trick<00:05:37.649> here<00:05:37.919> is

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
a dual core processor the trick here is

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:40.969 
a dual core processor the trick here is
the<00:05:38.249> dual<00:05:38.430> cores<00:05:38.729> don't<00:05:39.029> always<00:05:39.629> work<00:05:40.050> at<00:05:40.889> the

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
the dual cores don't always work at the

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.579 
the dual cores don't always work at the
same<00:05:41.159> time<00:05:41.599> if<00:05:42.599> the<00:05:42.749> phone<00:05:42.930> doesn't<00:05:43.379> need<00:05:43.469> to

00:05:43.579 --> 00:05:43.589 
same time if the phone doesn't need to

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:45.799 
same time if the phone doesn't need to
use<00:05:43.769> both<00:05:44.219> cords<00:05:44.699> it<00:05:44.849> won't<00:05:45.029> use<00:05:45.240> both<00:05:45.449> cores

00:05:45.799 --> 00:05:45.809 
use both cords it won't use both cores

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:49.100 
use both cords it won't use both cores
now<00:05:46.469> won't<00:05:46.649> even<00:05:46.860> use<00:05:46.949> all<00:05:47.339> of<00:05:47.519> one<00:05:47.759> cord<00:05:48.110> so

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
now won't even use all of one cord so

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.529 
now won't even use all of one cord so
that<00:05:49.259> way<00:05:49.469> it<00:05:49.709> does<00:05:50.519> a<00:05:50.550> really<00:05:50.819> good<00:05:51.059> job<00:05:51.120> at

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
that way it does a really good job at

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:54.949 
that way it does a really good job at
battery<00:05:51.870> and<00:05:52.139> power<00:05:52.379> management<00:05:53.689> now<00:05:54.689> I'm<00:05:54.809> not

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:54.959 
battery and power management now I'm not

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:56.299 
battery and power management now I'm not
going<00:05:55.080> to<00:05:55.139> be<00:05:55.229> doing<00:05:55.349> any<00:05:55.680> quadrant<00:05:56.219> standard

00:05:56.299 --> 00:05:56.309 
going to be doing any quadrant standard

00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:59.869 
going to be doing any quadrant standard
tests<00:05:56.969> on<00:05:57.089> the<00:05:57.899> sensation<00:05:58.469> 4g<00:05:58.740> and<00:05:59.129> that's<00:05:59.610> for

00:05:59.869 --> 00:05:59.879 
tests on the sensation 4g and that's for

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:02.449 
tests on the sensation 4g and that's for
one<00:06:00.149> particular<00:06:00.360> reason<00:06:01.189> if<00:06:02.189> I<00:06:02.249> thought<00:06:02.430> a

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:02.459 
one particular reason if I thought a

00:06:02.459 --> 00:06:06.649 
one particular reason if I thought a
system<00:06:02.879> in<00:06:02.969> flow<00:06:04.849> it<00:06:05.849> can't<00:06:06.119> even<00:06:06.330> tell<00:06:06.509> you

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:06.659 
system in flow it can't even tell you

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:08.749 
system in flow it can't even tell you
what<00:06:06.899> the<00:06:07.110> current<00:06:07.349> maximum<00:06:08.249> or<00:06:08.729> minimum

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 
what the current maximum or minimum

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:12.290 
what the current maximum or minimum
frequency<00:06:09.389> of<00:06:09.930> the<00:06:10.080> CPU<00:06:10.499> is<00:06:10.680> so<00:06:11.669> I<00:06:11.699> figured<00:06:12.119> if

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
frequency of the CPU is so I figured if

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.939 
frequency of the CPU is so I figured if
it<00:06:12.449> can't<00:06:12.629> even<00:06:12.719> tell<00:06:13.019> you<00:06:13.139> that<00:06:13.349> it's<00:06:13.860> not

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:13.949 
it can't even tell you that it's not

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:15.499 
it can't even tell you that it's not
going<00:06:14.129> to<00:06:14.219> be<00:06:14.279> able<00:06:14.309> to<00:06:14.519> give<00:06:14.669> you<00:06:14.819> totally

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:15.509 
going to be able to give you totally

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:18.170 
going to be able to give you totally
accurate<00:06:16.639> representation<00:06:17.639> of<00:06:17.699> the<00:06:17.819> power<00:06:18.059> of

accurate representation of the power of

accurate representation of the power of
this<00:06:18.240> DP

00:06:22.989 --> 00:06:22.999 

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:25.670 

to<00:06:23.999> be<00:06:24.090> honest<00:06:24.419> I<00:06:24.599> was<00:06:24.840> never<00:06:25.020> completely<00:06:25.349> sold

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 
to be honest I was never completely sold

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.110 
to be honest I was never completely sold
on<00:06:25.800> the<00:06:25.919> idea<00:06:25.979> of<00:06:26.310> having<00:06:26.520> a<00:06:26.699> dual-core

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
on the idea of having a dual-core

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.929 
on the idea of having a dual-core
processor<00:06:27.719> on<00:06:27.810> a<00:06:27.870> phone<00:06:28.080> I<00:06:28.289> mean<00:06:29.099> it<00:06:29.430> sounds

00:06:29.929 --> 00:06:29.939 
processor on a phone I mean it sounds

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:31.909 
processor on a phone I mean it sounds
nice<00:06:30.270> and<00:06:30.300> all<00:06:30.629> but<00:06:30.870> when<00:06:31.409> you<00:06:31.499> have<00:06:31.529> to<00:06:31.710> worry

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 
nice and all but when you have to worry

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:34.219 
nice and all but when you have to worry
about<00:06:32.009> things<00:06:32.340> like<00:06:32.550> battery<00:06:33.029> life<00:06:33.240> I<00:06:33.539> just

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229 
about things like battery life I just

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:35.959 
about things like battery life I just
didn't<00:06:34.499> see<00:06:34.529> it<00:06:34.650> being<00:06:34.889> that<00:06:35.069> practical<00:06:35.639> to

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:35.969 
didn't see it being that practical to

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:37.279 
didn't see it being that practical to
have<00:06:36.150> a<00:06:36.180> dual<00:06:36.479> core<00:06:36.629> processor<00:06:36.689> on<00:06:37.229> a

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:43.830 
HTC Sensation I can say I definitely see

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.350 
HTC Sensation I can say I definitely see
where<00:06:44.069> we<00:06:44.189> would<00:06:44.249> want<00:06:44.550> to<00:06:44.669> have<00:06:44.789> a<00:06:44.849> dual<00:06:45.180> core

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360
