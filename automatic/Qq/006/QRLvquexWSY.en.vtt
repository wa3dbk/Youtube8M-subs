00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.640
 have pressure now let's talk about divisors in multiples of a number 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.550
 current starting 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.799
 of multiple 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:12.279
 to find the multiple natural monument 

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:15.589
 Just multiply the basic explains this number 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:17.850
 by the succession of natural numbers 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 01 2 3 4 there goes 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.980
 here is the set of multiples of trains as that set with the 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.239
 Format 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:31.550
 I multiply three by being pole 1 by two by 3por4 by five 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.540
 and so on 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.340
 I went to find these spaces three times 00 three times with three three vices. 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.470
 3 times 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.950
 and so it goes then 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.359
 the musicians of three are to be known 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:48.740
 which grows from 3 in 3 from zero 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.460
 are in havard for the musicians of seven 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.859
 multiplying set with zero zero if you had 1 7 7 times 2 14 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.130
 and so on too 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.150
 then the multiples of 7 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.770
 are a sequence 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.790
 which lacks 7 in 7 from 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.970
 two brics 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.350
 be multiple examples of 12 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.490
 - we find this knowledge explains nÂº 12 by the succession of numbers 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.550
 natural 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.710
 twice 00 12 times the jobs and twice 2 24 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.350
 and so on 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.100
 thomas and well-known musicians of 12 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.070
 I grew two by two 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.470
 from scratch 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.980
 note that what in these 300 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.610
 the 0 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.100
 appeared as the first multiple in all sets this is valid for 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.700
 any current number 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.000
 tones 0 is the first natural-born musician with the exception of the check itself 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 in fact we see that zero has no multiples 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.149
 but serious 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.670
 is multiple 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.670
 tower number 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.970
 in any case to make the multiple can dry for example 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.820
 3 is a multiple of 3 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.029
 the seventh type of 7 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:10.999
 twelve musicians given so 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:14.209
 this also applies to any current number 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.309
 it will always be multiple 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:17.839
 of oneself 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:22.389
 in fact these sets are here and happens in any set of 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:24.729
 musicians 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:29.249
 according to multiples of three will be the own tce the first musician of three 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:32.439
 anyway it ends today 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:34.999
 according to the multiple of 7 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:37.999
 I proposed that according to the musician of blues and pop rock and the blues 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.989
 Can I talk now about divisions? 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.989
 to find the natural number divisors' 

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:51.419
 just find all the numbers by which we can divide 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.019
 the number 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.019
 of course, like this 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:59.459
 the dividers of 20 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.559
 the divisors of 20 are the numbers by which I can divide 20 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.409
 and get a division that the result is a number one in the toral 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.239
 and this division has no remains has remains 0 

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:20.789
 twenty the right for a 2 4 5 10 and 20 if I try to split 

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:23.559
 twenty by any other natural number ' 

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:25.769
 I will not have a division 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.729
 this date 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:30.279
 the divisors of 36 

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:32.629
 me 36 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:33.909
 I can 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:35.419
 share 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:38.809
 for all these natural numbers here 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:41.429
 and I will find there 

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:44.529
 as a result it is also mere natural 

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:47.529
 in the rest of this division will be 0 

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:53.049
 here are the dividers 42 42 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.069
 I can also 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.709
 of 20 by these natural numbers 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.849
 in all of them the division will be 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:03.009
 to raise 

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:04.639
 for these 0 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:08.019
 an important note note that the size of the number 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.249
 it has nothing to do with the amount of vision you have 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.660
 for example 42 years that 36-36 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.620
 You have more time today than I would like to question. 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.410
 it is not true to say that the greater the number 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.970
 but divisions and east but divisors he has this is lie 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.840
 this is not true 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.800
 well an important note 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.949
 the anthem is the first of visual is the first term of the set 

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:42.999
 of dividers at any time 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:47.870
 and everything in a division of this pact and security price was known 

00:04:47.869 --> 00:04:49.650
 growing way 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.199
 the last viewer 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:52.509
 of each number 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:53.479
 will be 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:57.990
 the name itself for example the last division of 20 was the 20 division team 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.379
 36 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:02.800
 I was also the one who I know if this happened too 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.800
 with 43 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.100
 here we have this division 42% t 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.289
 everybody knows it gives 6 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:18.879
 and the rest to 0 

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:19.990
 that's us 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.900
 lets say here 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.450
 42 is divisible by sirte if we take the inverse operation 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:29.770
 six times criticized the 42 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.580
 This allows us to say 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.000
 42 is a multiple of seven because the 42 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.279
 and ct 

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:39.120
 multiplied 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.120
 for six 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:43.719
 other 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:46.580
 information that we withdraw from here 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.800
 is that with the set is the division of 42 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:52.870
 these three information 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.509
 they are 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:56.339
 dependents 

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:58.009
 from each other 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:03.370
 for example saying that 42 is divisible by 7 is the same as saying 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.340
 42 years present also the burden to say the following 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.630
 42 is a multiple of seven because it is divisible by 7 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:15.069
 or 42 is a multiple of 7 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:18.330
 why seven of them for 42 or so 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.949
 42 is viseu by 7 

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:23.999
 because seven division of 42 

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:27.550
 we have to be careful not to confuse and divisible 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.119
 with division 

00:06:29.119 --> 00:06:34.569
 but if we pay close attention to the difference is that the divisible words 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.159
 multiply division 

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:38.949
 we can understand 

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:40.860
 these three concepts here 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.050
 It's only okay, just stop and think 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.520
 with enough attention 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.710
 very well, personal numbers fall from the sky 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.580
 content of the year is approaching
