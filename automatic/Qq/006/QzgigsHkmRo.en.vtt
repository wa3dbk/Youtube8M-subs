00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 every action of the school 

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:16.659
 Thank you, sir, for my school. 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:19.689
 it has many defects like all schools have. 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:22.880
 she has problems always will have 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.289
 When some are solved, others appear if every day a new 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:28.699
 worry 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:30.479
 in these sacred spaces 

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:33.430
 I used very different people 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.490
 the students come from families defenses and carry with them dreams and traumas 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.140
 own 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.140
 some are more closed 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.050
 others like to appear 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.790
 all are relatives 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.790
 needs attention to tend to tenderness 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.030
 teachers are also different 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.340
 some very young others older 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.020
 they say different things 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.290
 everyone in their own way 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.710
 some know the power it has 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.820
 few seem not to care about this 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.220
 do not know that leaders are referential should be 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.160
 employees 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.420
 people so dear to hear our regrets and who take care of us 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.200
 we are together every day 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.970
 on warmer days 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.200
 and other colder ones 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.340
 to quieter days 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.000
 what other more tumultuous 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 to happier and more painful days 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.650
 we spent together 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.700
 which had more than 31 schools come polidoro 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.520
 It's like she's a great mother. 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.240
 to embrace this 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.700
 Let's release only on the day. 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.060
 in which we were prepared to fly 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.510
 it is 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.510
 she teaches us our vocation 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.960
 we were born to fly 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.460
 But we need to know that. 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.010
 and we still need a boost in the bids for this high 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.960
 we do not need a school that brings us all the information 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.169
 the world already fulfills this role 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.969
 we do not need a school that makes us all machines the same 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:17.870
 would be a crime and reduced of great that resides in our interior 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:23.139
 it would be a crime to expect the flight to be always the same size 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:25.809
 speed at the same height 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:27.929
 I chose the brokerage house 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:31.819
 in her was allowing the seed to become flat 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.449
 in flower 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:36.839
 allowing the caterpillar to become a butterfly 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.689
 so you do not need this for this 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:45.169
 if you want to help the caterpillar come out of the cocoon 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:47.989
 Maybe I'll never have a chance to act. 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.179
 27 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:50.879
 not ready 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.599
 chris cole cozy 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.699
 I know you have no archer's right 

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:57.059
 life is a constant learning 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:59.739
 but I also know that I am happy 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.209
 I know every corner of this space. 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.019
 the colors of the wall the pictures to square 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.929
 the room of the director of the secretariat of fishing 

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:10.929
 I already moved from school many times I was growing here 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:12.739
 with all this 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.179
 I wander so long in this place 

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:16.759
 but I think more 

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:18.479
 I know the people 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:21.479
 and each one of you made it important in my life 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.629
 in our lives 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:24.999
 and in that nation 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:26.669
 I ask you, sir. 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:29.169
 for all of us who live together 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:32.379
 for these sacred spaces in which we are being born every day 

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:34.789
 birth 

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:38.899
 the beautiful lesson of Socrates on the role of his mother 

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:40.239
 midwife 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.279
 the midwife who does not do the child because she is already ready 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.359
 the midwife who only helps the child to see 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:50.079
 and do it so many times 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.979
 He is happy every time. 

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:55.759
 because every new life is the only one 

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:58.049
 deserve all the care 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.759
 Thank you, sir, for my school. 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:04.309
 so a tour that of us was born and in the siemens space 

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:08.539
 I can say that I'm happy. 

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:09.629
 and this is the most important
