00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.800
 flies and there

 plus folder download like others came out 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.080
 an attempt to make 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.880
 that at least one where flies in the first 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.050
 round unbroken gymnasts 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.050

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.560
 way 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.560
 coping with this case took 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.650
 the same flies 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.349
