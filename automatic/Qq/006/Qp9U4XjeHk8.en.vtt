00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
we had study Davis paleo challenge last

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.130 
we had study Davis paleo challenge last
year<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.460> palatal<00:00:18.029> great<00:00:18.300> sauce<00:00:18.570> for<00:00:18.840> lumber

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
year and palatal great sauce for lumber

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.380 
year and palatal great sauce for lumber
but<00:00:19.859> there's<00:00:20.100> another<00:00:20.369> source<00:00:20.730> that<00:00:21.029> often

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
but there's another source that often

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.240 
but there's another source that often
overlooked<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:23.090> trees<00:00:24.920> this<00:00:25.920> is<00:00:26.070> why

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
overlooked and that is trees this is why

overlooked and that is trees this is why
this<00:00:26.310> challenge<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.210> about<00:00:27.330> making<00:00:27.689> something

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
this challenge is about making something

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.089 
this challenge is about making something
from<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.920> branch<00:00:29.250> or<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.609> piece<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.820> tree<00:00:31.099> the

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
from a branch or a piece of tree the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.729 
from a branch or a piece of tree the
some<00:00:32.880> requirements<00:00:33.510> has<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.050> come<00:00:34.260> with<00:00:34.440> live

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
some requirements has to come with live

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.220 
some requirements has to come with live
edge<00:00:34.980> at<00:00:35.340> some<00:00:35.610> point<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.630> can<00:00:36.809> take<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.110> off

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
edge at some point you can take it off

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.630 
edge at some point you can take it off
if<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.440> want<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:38.160> idea<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.610> make

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
something out of a piece of branch a

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.060 
something out of a piece of branch a
tree<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.399> not<00:00:42.000> higher<00:00:42.210> than<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.570> are<00:00:42.750> and

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
tree that is not higher than you are and

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.119 
tree that is not higher than you are and
well<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.879> should<00:00:44.910> be<00:00:45.270> able<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.770> to<00:00:46.770> handle<00:00:47.039> it

well you should be able to to handle it

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.510 
well you should be able to to handle it
yourself<00:00:47.160> no<00:00:47.940> forklifts<00:00:48.629> or<00:00:48.840> anything<00:00:49.520> just

yourself no forklifts or anything just
to<00:00:50.700> set<00:00:50.879> some<00:00:51.059> ground<00:00:51.180> rules<00:00:51.390> not<00:00:52.170> from<00:00:52.350> that

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
to set some ground rules not from that

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.639 
to set some ground rules not from that
everything<00:00:53.370> goes<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:54.149> can<00:00:54.360> use<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.899> live

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
everything goes you can use the live

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.500 
everything goes you can use the live
edge<00:00:55.920> or<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.309> can<00:00:56.489> mill<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.820> up<00:00:56.940> with<00:00:57.090> perfectly

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
edge or it can mill it up with perfectly

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.360 
edge or it can mill it up with perfectly
square<00:00:57.870> boards<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.469> build<00:00:58.890> something<00:00:59.250> from

square boards and build something from

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.750 
square boards and build something from
those<00:00:59.989> that<00:01:00.989> doesn't<00:01:01.379> matter<00:01:01.500> as<00:01:02.100> long<00:01:02.160> as<00:01:02.640> you

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
those that doesn't matter as long as you

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.090 
those that doesn't matter as long as you
take<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.030> piece<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.300> tree<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.930> process<00:01:04.920> it

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
take a piece of tree and process it

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.969 
take a piece of tree and process it
yourself<00:01:05.960> this<00:01:06.960> actually<00:01:07.200> started<00:01:07.830> as<00:01:07.950> a

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
yourself this actually started as a

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.710 
yourself this actually started as a
christmas<00:01:08.369> tree<00:01:08.580> challenge<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.479> is

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
christmas tree challenge and this is

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.590 
christmas tree challenge and this is
last<00:01:10.110> year's<00:01:10.229> christmas<00:01:10.770> tree<00:01:11.180> soon<00:01:12.180> some<00:01:12.450> of

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
last year's christmas tree soon some of

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.570 
last year's christmas tree soon some of
you<00:01:12.750> probably<00:01:13.530> aren't<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.220> habit<00:01:14.250> of

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
you probably aren't in the habit of

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.700 
you probably aren't in the habit of
having<00:01:14.760> christmas<00:01:15.240> trees<00:01:15.509> or<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:16.200> her<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.560> out

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
having christmas trees or of her it out

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.219 
having christmas trees or of her it out
already<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.159> can<00:01:17.250> also<00:01:17.640> use<00:01:17.909> other<00:01:18.180> kinds<00:01:19.020> of

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
already you can also use other kinds of

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.190 
already you can also use other kinds of
branches<00:01:20.070> trees<00:01:20.549> whatever<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.659> one<00:01:21.900> of

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
branches trees whatever this one of

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.630 
branches trees whatever this one of
course<00:01:22.590> would<00:01:23.580> be<00:01:23.640> too<00:01:23.939> high<00:01:25.040> but<00:01:26.040> if<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.430> cut

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
course would be too high but if you cut

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.760 
course would be too high but if you cut
it<00:01:26.790> off<00:01:26.909> somewhere<00:01:27.630> there<00:01:27.869> you'd<00:01:28.380> be<00:01:28.409> fine

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
it off somewhere there you'd be fine

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.249 
it off somewhere there you'd be fine
again<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.490> course<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.030> can<00:01:30.240> use<00:01:30.570> shorter

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
again of course you can use shorter

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.160 
again of course you can use shorter
pieces<00:01:31.470> as<00:01:31.770> well<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.450> there's<00:01:33.450> no<00:01:33.689> limitation

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
pieces as well and there's no limitation

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.069 
pieces as well and there's no limitation
too<00:01:34.590> well<00:01:35.579> there's<00:01:36.030> no<00:01:36.180> limitation<00:01:36.570> at<00:01:36.810> ultra

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
too well there's no limitation at ultra

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.230 
too well there's no limitation at ultra
what<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.290> can<00:01:37.470> do<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:38.369> contest<00:01:38.820> won't<00:01:39.090> be

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
what you can do the contest won't be

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.630 
what you can do the contest won't be
touched<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:40.320> process<00:01:40.740> will<00:01:40.860> be<00:01:41.009> awarded<00:01:41.460> be<00:01:41.610> a

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
touched the process will be awarded be a

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.340 
touched the process will be awarded be a
randomizer<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.780> reason<00:01:43.079> for<00:01:43.259> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
randomizer the reason for the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.100 
randomizer the reason for the
randomization<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.720> skills<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.960> better

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
randomization is that skills and better

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.560 
randomization is that skills and better
tools<00:01:46.439> should<00:01:46.799> not<00:01:47.009> play<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> role<00:01:47.369> in<00:01:47.909> who<00:01:48.360> gets

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
tools should not play a role in who gets

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.530 
tools should not play a role in who gets
the<00:01:48.780> prices<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:50.040> idea<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.579> participate

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
the prices the idea is to participate

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.770 
the prices the idea is to participate
and<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.899> inspire<00:01:52.369> so<00:01:53.369> if<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.700> take<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.479> piece

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
and to inspire so if you take this piece

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.789 
and to inspire so if you take this piece
cut<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.920> up<00:01:56.040> into<00:01:56.579> coasters<00:01:57.299> that's<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.380> project

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
cut it up into coasters that's a project

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.660 
cut it up into coasters that's a project
right<00:01:59.040> there<00:01:59.310> Matthew<00:02:00.299> simple<00:02:00.719> but<00:02:00.930> maybe<00:02:01.259> a
