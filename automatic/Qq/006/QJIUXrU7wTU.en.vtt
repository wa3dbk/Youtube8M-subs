00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
it in any other way it feels right and

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.460 
it in any other way it feels right and
and<00:05:50.250> it's<00:05:51.250> surprising<00:05:51.790> that<00:05:51.820> I've<00:05:52.060> kept<00:05:52.470> it

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
and it's surprising that I've kept it

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.860 
and it's surprising that I've kept it
dry<00:05:53.710> and<00:05:54.070> that<00:05:54.190> I<00:05:54.220> haven't<00:05:54.460> been<00:05:54.760> crying<00:05:55.600> or

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 
anything and I think that's just another

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.820 
anything and I think that's just another
sign<00:05:57.490> that<00:05:57.550> you<00:05:58.090> know<00:05:58.210> it's<00:05:58.390> it's<00:05:59.380> the<00:05:59.650> right

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
choice if you go back and play with any

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:15.890 
choice if you go back and play with any
