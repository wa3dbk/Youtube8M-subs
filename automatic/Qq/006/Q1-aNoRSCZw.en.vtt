in<00:00:03.910> this<00:00:04.910> tutorial<00:00:05.149> we<00:00:05.599> will<00:00:05.630> cover<00:00:05.930> the<00:00:06.080> stair

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:06.319 
in this tutorial we will cover the stair

operations found in the specialty suite
of<00:00:08.809> tools<00:00:09.820> let's<00:00:10.820> begin<00:00:11.120> with<00:00:11.240> a<00:00:11.299> stair<00:00:11.540> from

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:11.629 
of tools let's begin with a stair from

first draw a path on which we shall

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.250 
first draw a path on which we shall
generate<00:00:17.180> the<00:00:17.240> stair<00:00:19.750> with<00:00:20.750> the<00:00:20.900> stair<00:00:21.170> from
