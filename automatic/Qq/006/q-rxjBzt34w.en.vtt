00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
remake in this case I'm going to use the

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.049 
remake in this case I'm going to use the
Wii<00:00:11.580> version<00:00:12.059> so<00:00:12.920> what<00:00:13.920> we<00:00:14.639> need

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
Wii version so what we need

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.810 
Wii version so what we need
we're<00:00:15.839> scroll<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:17.150> I<00:00:18.150> need<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.420> file<00:00:18.750> from<00:00:19.320> our

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
we're scroll and I need a file from our

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:33.770 
we're scroll and I need a file from our
game<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:25.369> so<00:00:26.369> we<00:00:26.550> open<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:28.429> this<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:32.780> right

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
game and so we open it this is it right

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.819 
game and so we open it this is it right
one<00:00:34.110> once<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.710> open<00:00:35.250> we<00:00:35.730> go<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.910> partition<00:00:36.480> 1

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
one once it is open we go to partition 1

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.880 
one once it is open we go to partition 1
to<00:00:37.829> am<00:00:38.129> folder<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:40.430> the<00:00:41.430> files<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.300> begin

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
to am folder and the files that begin

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:50.830 
to am folder and the files that begin
with<00:00:43.940> am<00:00:44.940> our<00:00:45.860> enemy<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.789> my<00:00:47.969> enemies<00:00:48.660> and

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
with am our enemy and a my enemies and

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.240 
with am our enemy and a my enemies and
the<00:00:51.840> files<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.680> begin<00:00:53.039> with<00:00:53.820> PL<00:00:54.210> our<00:00:54.390> player

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
the files that begin with PL our player

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.250 
the files that begin with PL our player
so<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:57.210> case<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.989> will<00:00:58.050> extract<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.370> 0<00:01:00.059> 0

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
so in this case I will extract the 0 0

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.090 
so in this case I will extract the 0 0
that<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.410> Chris<00:01:02.390> and<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.559> important

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
that is Chris and and this is important

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.010 
that is Chris and and this is important
we<00:01:05.369> have<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.729> extract<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.630> folder

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
we have to extract it in a folder

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.670 
we have to extract it in a folder
without<00:01:07.200> any<00:01:07.619> space<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.700> name<00:01:09.439> neither<00:01:10.439> in

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
without any space the name neither in

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
without any space the name neither in
the<00:01:10.770> name<00:01:10.950> nor<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.520> pot<00:01:11.780> so<00:01:12.950> it<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.580> will

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
the name nor in the pot so it so I will

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.300 
the name nor in the pot so it so I will
call<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.119> crease<00:01:16.850> that<00:01:19.100> right

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
call it crease that right

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.590 
call it crease that right
once<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.939> struct<00:01:21.330> we<00:01:22.020> open<00:01:22.590> my<00:01:23.040> program

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
once it is a struct we open my program

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:31.390 
once it is a struct we open my program
we<00:01:24.600> go<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.810> file<00:01:25.080> open<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.740> that

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.070 

right<00:01:32.090> so<00:01:33.080> and<00:01:33.380> on<00:01:34.010> the<00:01:34.310> on<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.420> right<00:01:35.600> side<00:01:35.870> we

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
right so and on the on the right side we

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.890 
right so and on the on the right side we
can<00:01:36.110> see<00:01:36.410> the<00:01:37.400> models<00:01:37.790> that<00:01:37.970> we<00:01:38.390> are<00:01:38.510> going<00:01:38.750> to

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
can see the models that we are going to

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.960 
can see the models that we are going to
edit<00:01:39.020> it<00:01:39.230> later<00:01:39.890> and<00:01:41.050> on<00:01:42.050> the<00:01:42.350> left<00:01:43.250> on<00:01:43.910> the

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
edit it later and on the left on the

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.010 
edit it later and on the left on the
left<00:01:44.210> we<00:01:44.420> can<00:01:44.450> see<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:45.050> texture<00:01:45.470> so<00:01:46.250> this<00:01:46.580> is

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
left we can see the texture so this is

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.050 
left we can see the texture so this is
there<00:01:48.020> are<00:01:48.140> a<00:01:48.170> lot<00:01:48.440> of<00:01:48.470> TPL<00:01:49.040> files<00:01:49.280> and<00:01:49.670> inside

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
there are a lot of TPL files and inside

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.820 
there are a lot of TPL files and inside
them<00:01:50.690> there<00:01:51.500> are<00:01:51.650> the<00:01:52.220> TG<00:01:52.610> a<00:01:52.790> files<00:01:53.680> that<00:01:54.680> are

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
them there are the TG a files that are

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.320 
them there are the TG a files that are
our<00:01:55.130> testers<00:01:55.930> in<00:01:56.930> this<00:01:57.200> case<00:01:57.410> I<00:01:57.620> have<00:01:57.860> already

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
our testers in this case I have already

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.660 
our testers in this case I have already
change<00:01:59.330> to<00:01:59.990> test<00:02:00.200> two<00:02:00.880> so<00:02:01.880> we<00:02:02.590> select<00:02:03.640> what<00:02:04.640> we

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
change to test two so we select what we

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.990 
change to test two so we select what we
want<00:02:04.790> to<00:02:05.030> change<00:02:05.300> and<00:02:05.570> click<00:02:05.660> on<00:02:06.470> this<00:02:06.590> part

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.750 

right<00:02:11.000> now<00:02:13.390> we<00:02:14.390> open<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:14.870> tester<00:02:15.760> with

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
right now we open the tester with

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.720 
right now we open the tester with
Photoshop<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:19.570> we<00:02:20.570> do<00:02:20.810> whatever<00:02:21.440> we<00:02:21.830> want<00:02:22.610> to

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
Photoshop and we do whatever we want to

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.940 
Photoshop and we do whatever we want to
do<00:02:22.850> so<00:02:23.660> in<00:02:23.810> this<00:02:23.900> case<00:02:24.110> I<00:02:24.140> will<00:02:24.260> cross<00:02:24.680> a<00:02:25.030> line

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
do so in this case I will cross a line

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.200 
do so in this case I will cross a line
we<00:02:27.950> save<00:02:28.160> it<00:02:28.870> right<00:02:30.340> now<00:02:31.340> we<00:02:31.400> return<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:31.970> my

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
we save it right now we return to my

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.820 
we save it right now we return to my
program<00:02:32.630> and<00:02:33.010> we<00:02:34.780> select<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:35.989> tester<00:02:36.560> that<00:02:36.709> we

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
program and we select the tester that we

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.180 
program and we select the tester that we
want<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:37.100> replace<00:02:37.370> click<00:02:38.239> on<00:02:38.390> replace<00:02:39.190> texture

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
want to replace click on replace texture

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:47.199 
want to replace click on replace texture
one<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:41.110> that's<00:02:42.110> it<00:02:43.450> pre-packed<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:46.910> as<00:02:47.120> you

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
one and that's it pre-packed and as you

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.750 
one and that's it pre-packed and as you
can<00:02:47.360> see<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:49.730> program<00:02:50.090> creates

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
can see and the program creates

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.040 
can see and the program creates
different<00:02:52.760> files<00:02:52.970> so<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:53.360> original<00:02:53.870> while

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
different files so the original while

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.800 
different files so the original while
the<00:02:54.470> original<00:02:54.890> one<00:02:55.060> what<00:02:56.060> wouldn't<00:02:56.540> be

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
the original one what wouldn't be

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.580 
the original one what wouldn't be
replaced<00:02:59.350> won't<00:03:00.350> be<00:03:00.530> replaced<00:03:00.950> and<00:03:01.250> sorry<00:03:01.580> so

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
replaced won't be replaced and sorry so

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:11.780 
replaced won't be replaced and sorry so
if<00:03:03.590> we<00:03:04.010> open<00:03:04.810> our<00:03:05.860> resulting<00:03:06.860> file

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.699 

we<00:03:12.790> will<00:03:12.970> see<00:03:13.150> that<00:03:13.420> there<00:03:13.930> is<00:03:14.610> our<00:03:15.610> tester

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
we will see that there is our tester

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:23.640 
we will see that there is our tester
inside<00:03:19.170> so<00:03:20.170> once<00:03:20.500> we<00:03:20.739> have<00:03:20.980> our<00:03:21.190> data<00:03:21.849> file<00:03:22.720> add

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
inside so once we have our data file add

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.610 
inside so once we have our data file add
it<00:03:24.060> we<00:03:25.060> replace<00:03:25.420> it<00:03:26.129> and<00:03:27.129> thus<00:03:27.310> it<00:03:28.230> now<00:03:29.230> if<00:03:29.410> we

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
it we replace it and thus it now if we

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.030 
it we replace it and thus it now if we
want<00:03:29.799> to<00:03:29.860> change<00:03:30.819> an<00:03:31.239> enemy<00:03:32.200> is<00:03:32.349> the<00:03:32.860> same

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
want to change an enemy is the same

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.630 
want to change an enemy is the same
thing<00:03:33.430> we<00:03:34.239> have<00:03:34.420> to<00:03:34.540> extract<00:03:35.019> the<00:03:35.410> ne3<00:03:36.160> file

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
thing we have to extract the ne3 file

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.979 
thing we have to extract the ne3 file
the<00:03:37.360> DAT<00:03:37.540> file

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
the DAT file

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.530 
the DAT file
I<00:03:38.530> don't<00:03:38.769> know<00:03:38.860> what<00:03:39.129> does<00:03:39.730> what<00:03:40.390> it<00:03:41.019> does<00:03:41.080> but

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
I don't know what does what it does but

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.539 
I don't know what does what it does but
it<00:03:43.540> doesn't<00:03:43.720> matter

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
it doesn't matter

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:50.970 
it doesn't matter
so<00:03:45.549> we<00:03:45.760> extract<00:03:46.209> it<00:03:46.360> and<00:03:48.090> we<00:03:49.090> open<00:03:49.480> and<00:03:49.769> in<00:03:50.769> the

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
so we extract it and we open and in the

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.210 
so we extract it and we open and in the
file

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.630 

and<00:03:57.790> we<00:03:57.970> can<00:03:58.150> see<00:03:58.360> the<00:03:58.870> same<00:03:59.080> in<00:04:00.070> the<00:04:00.220> texture

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
and we can see the same in the texture

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:09.750 
and we can see the same in the texture
this<00:04:01.360> case<00:04:01.660> with<00:04:01.990> a<00:04:02.020> dog<00:04:06.510> for<00:04:07.510> the<00:04:08.670> good<00:04:09.670> the

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
this case with a dog for the good the

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.560 
this case with a dog for the good the
same<00:04:10.030> that<00:04:10.390> seems<00:04:10.690> we<00:04:11.650> go<00:04:11.800> to<00:04:11.860> event<00:04:12.570> folder

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
same that seems we go to event folder

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:19.949 
same that seems we go to event folder
and<00:04:14.160> the<00:04:15.160> same<00:04:15.370> thing<00:04:15.840> we<00:04:16.840> extract<00:04:17.230> it<00:04:17.410> and<00:04:18.959> we

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
and the same thing we extract it and we

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:31.770 
and the same thing we extract it and we
open<00:04:20.380> it<00:04:25.830> this<00:04:26.830> case<00:04:27.070> the<00:04:27.220> program<00:04:30.180> appears<00:04:31.180> a

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
open it this case the program appears a

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:39.120 
open it this case the program appears a
new<00:04:33.300> function<00:04:34.300> that<00:04:34.330> is<00:04:36.390> this<00:04:37.390> one<00:04:37.600> but<00:04:38.380> we

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
new function that is this one but we

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.070 
new function that is this one but we
will<00:04:39.310> see<00:04:39.490> that<00:04:39.700> later<00:04:40.980> and<00:04:42.600> here<00:04:43.600> we<00:04:43.780> have<00:04:43.960> the

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
will see that later and here we have the

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:51.770 
will see that later and here we have the
texture<00:04:44.560> so<00:04:47.010> what<00:04:48.010> is<00:04:48.130> this<00:04:48.660> crease

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.360 

June<00:04:53.970> what<00:04:54.970> scar<00:04:55.530> so<00:04:56.530> it's<00:04:57.070> the<00:04:57.160> same<00:04:57.310> thing

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
June what scar so it's the same thing

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.580 
June what scar so it's the same thing
you<00:04:58.150> have<00:04:58.180> to<00:04:58.540> sport<00:04:59.470> this<00:04:59.680> place<00:04:59.950> and<00:05:00.270> debug

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
you have to sport this place and debug

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:07.680 
you have to sport this place and debug
so<00:05:02.590> this<00:05:02.919> is<00:05:03.070> that's<00:05:03.580> it<00:05:03.700> that's<00:05:04.240> it<00:05:04.680> easy
