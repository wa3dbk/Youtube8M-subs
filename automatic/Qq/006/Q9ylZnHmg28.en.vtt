season this season he hasn't been able
to<00:00:48.270> do<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.630> I'd<00:00:48.810> say<00:00:49.050> upstate<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.800> year

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.730 
to do that I'd say upstate this year
he's<00:00:50.280> had<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.460> lot<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.960> tough<00:00:51.960> luck<00:00:52.200> and<00:00:52.500> it's

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:52.740 
he's had a lot of tough luck and it's

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.620 
he's had a lot of tough luck and it's
because<00:00:53.040> of<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.310> tough<00:00:53.730> luck<00:00:53.970> that<00:00:54.300> his<00:00:54.420> car

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 
because of this tough luck that his car

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.260 
because of this tough luck that his car
just<00:00:54.660> hasn't<00:00:55.230> been<00:00:55.320> quite<00:00:55.500> as<00:00:55.830> good<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.400> we're

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
actually dominating the field by doing a

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.570 
actually dominating the field by doing a
Hamilton<00:01:00.840> because<00:01:01.290> metals<00:01:01.680> cars<00:01:02.010> just<00:01:02.400> not

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.580 
Hamilton because metals cars just not

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.939 
Hamilton because metals cars just not
quite<00:01:02.880> been<00:01:03.090> there<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:04.259> far<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:04.710> season

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
quite been there so far this season

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.820

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
anyway but it is exceptionally early

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.190 
anyway but it is exceptionally early
days<00:01:08.070> yet<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.759> on<00:01:08.909> we<00:01:09.090> go<00:01:09.119> now<00:01:09.509> and<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.810> look<00:01:10.080> at

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
days yet so on we go now and I look at

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.740 
days yet so on we go now and I look at
that<00:01:10.320> exquisite<00:01:10.890> line<00:01:11.220> through<00:01:11.700> turn<00:01:11.970> seven

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
that exquisite line through turn seven

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.260 
that exquisite line through turn seven
that<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.290> an<00:01:13.409> absolute<00:01:13.979> lesson<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.060> how<00:01:15.240> to

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
that is an absolute lesson in how to

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.999 
that is an absolute lesson in how to
drive<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.840> corner<00:01:16.259> as<00:01:16.350> we<00:01:16.470> go<00:01:16.590> towards<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
drive that corner as we go towards the

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.560 
drive that corner as we go towards the
hairpin<00:01:17.310> now<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.610> I'm<00:01:17.700> dominating<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.480> field

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
hairpin now and I'm dominating the field

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.450 
hairpin now and I'm dominating the field
in<00:01:19.140> fact<00:01:19.350> no<00:01:19.560> say<00:01:19.800> that<00:01:19.980> back<00:01:20.159> I'm<00:01:20.340> not

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
in fact no say that back I'm not

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.800 
in fact no say that back I'm not
dominating<00:01:20.940> the<00:01:21.000> field<00:01:21.120> at<00:01:21.270> all<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.630> car

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
dominating the field at all the car

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.710 
dominating the field at all the car
behind<00:01:22.200> me<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.680> nought<00:01:23.130> point<00:01:23.460> four<00:01:23.940> zero<00:01:24.570> four

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
behind me is nought point four zero four

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.870 
behind me is nought point four zero four
seconds<00:01:25.530> behind<00:01:25.680> me<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.159> he<00:01:26.220> might<00:01:26.670> actually

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
seconds behind me and he might actually

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.730 
seconds behind me and he might actually
make<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.330> move<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:27.780> this<00:01:27.960> back<00:01:28.170> straight<00:01:28.440> here<00:01:28.590> I

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
make a move on this back straight here I

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.020 
make a move on this back straight here I
think<00:01:29.130> he's<00:01:29.280> going<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.490> make<00:01:29.550> a<00:01:29.640> move<00:01:29.850> because

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
think he's going to make a move because

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.190 
think he's going to make a move because
he's<00:01:30.150> got<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.390> slipstream<00:01:30.750> I'll<00:01:30.870> cut<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.050> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
he's got the slipstream I'll cut to the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.540 
he's got the slipstream I'll cut to the
inside<00:01:31.229> I've<00:01:31.620> smashed<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.220> barriers

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
inside I've smashed it to the barriers

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.010 
inside I've smashed it to the barriers
