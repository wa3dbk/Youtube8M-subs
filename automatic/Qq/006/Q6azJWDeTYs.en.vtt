00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.610
 hello to all series because you're fine 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.590
 we meet today for the 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.839
 first video commented on matha vitro 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.850
 I'm going to ask you a tutorial on 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.430
 place scout because what I play enough 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.750
 exclusively in this game I allow myself 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.490
 to do a tutorial on this 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.260
 class because I think I have 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.880
 enough experience to learn 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.529
 some things to people who 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.560
 want to take more pleasure and who 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.759
 want to train in this class I 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.300
 will you describe a little bit my way 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.250
 to play 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.440
 through riehl trips 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.000
 positioning but I'm also going to 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.460
 talk about little guy who will help you to 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.030
 do pretty lots scop and shifts and 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.030
 shot drugs 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.190
 exc 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.640
 to compete with the medic did recon 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.560
 can not afford to be uncovered 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.270
 there are no care packs and it is 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.570
 very visible because of the light effect 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.920
 from the bezel of his kitchen proposal 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.990
 is a very important thing 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.909
 this will not only allow you to be 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.890
 more difficult to justin by your 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.250
 enemies but it suits you too 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.259
 able to resist a demon angel a 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.340
 good position is also characterized 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.590
 by its visibility 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.720
 you need to have a field of vision on 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.910
 widest possible in order to be able to 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.910
 eliminate the most important targets 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.070
 like the music the opposing recon or 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.470
 still supports that is supreme 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.030
 your team 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.100
 when you're under there under the 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.259
 suppression and that your enemy is at 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.090
 medium distance 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.280
 do not even try shooting and stayed 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.380
 hidden there for example 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.580
 it was one of too many but it can be 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.159
 also a room or a wall just wait 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.590
 that your viewfinder was going to normal 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.860
 then eliminate your target when you 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.810
 to be at home will be done with the guns 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.909
 your 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.790
 is partly hidden by in the object of 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.000
 ground 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.410
 would become more difficult to adjust 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.200
 you can also advise me 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.870
 hold your breath only when 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.550
 your enemy is very far away will gain 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.440
 very precious time and you will be very 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.700
 widely favored in the mutuals 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.700
 adverse agricultural 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.870
 this 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.140
 so now I'm going to teach you 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.910
 how to make a co-op wedding that is to 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.319
 both very accurate but also 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.520
 formidable in the sense that they do not 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.739
 do not suffer the deletion 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.569
 first of all you have to have a 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.980
 sniper rifle in hand is very 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.400
 important one bullet in the 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.410
 charger 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.630
 if you have two balls that does not 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.280
 will not walk you probably have already 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.830
 heard about the blitzfinder of 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.540
 assault rifles a hub s legend and well 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.000
 the principle is exactly the same 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.290
 to describe the situation it does not 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.660
 remains more than one bullet in the 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.190
 charger when you adjust an enemy 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.380
 then you pull it 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.840
 you have to make a double switch 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.819
 of very fast weapons passing over your 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.760
 secondary weapon then on your main 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.920
 at the end of reloading your reticle 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:24.209
 will be very small and so your our scop 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:26.010
 or go straight on now I'm going 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.930
 to talk to you about what I consider to be the 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.990
 most important thing to play in 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.730
 decor displacements 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.970
 for that you need to understand 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.760
 that when I play you recon for like 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.980
 if you play at the wholesale 2000 pp you 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.660
 makes upts of face so you have to 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.330
 bypass enemies to win a 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.640
 maximum time for this you need 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.140
 an excellent information outlet your 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.460
 magnifying bezel will help you 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.500
 strongly spot the enemies 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.960
 if it's not already done and 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.790
 exploit it with the key not it you 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.160
 have to look at your mini map with one eye 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.020
 attentive in order to predict the 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.840
 movement of enemies in a 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.180
 advanced length on them move yourself 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.950
 on the sides of the positions that you are 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.590
 need it 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.490
 privilege the story displacement to 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.830
 bad displacement 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.930
 this will save you from getting killed by 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.390
 behind not to die secondly 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.010
 of these four of schengen or eight 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.170
 markers in case of a sound hunter 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.990
 rooster to wine all scores i would say 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.820
 classic would take us so more than 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.380
 pleasure to play but also in 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.450
 bypassing the opposing team 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.930
 you have the means to do a lot of 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:35.420
 prague and play the goal on 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.280
 tight cards like subway operation a 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.560
 das covers a very large area of 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.100
 battles will therefore be able to help your 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.500
 team 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.170
 dare the most advanced 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.550
 the importance of the das and the fact 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.500
 locate the opposing team 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.700
 it will also allow you to take 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.370
 the enemy behind 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.140
 I do not advise you to try to 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.150
 do all your kilos more details 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.820
 prefer the mass is the team that are 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.330
 ashore you will be very rarely 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.330
 disappointed 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.180
 to make offsets aecon is a thing 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.760
 very important in a gameplay 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.590
 aggressive you will never be able to kill a 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.720
 enemy if he suppresses you if he will 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.540
 attained for this it is necessary to know 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.770
 where he is where he could be this 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.810
 requires a very good crisis 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.370
 of information a good knowledge of 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.010
 spots and map on which you 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.900
 play for well off I recommend 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.270
 from the corner of a wall then from 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.190
 aim and move and shoot 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.229
 instantly at enemy head height 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.620
 or not to a probable position of 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:36.620
 your opponent 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.600
 there are a lot of people who are 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:53.690
 ask how to adjust an enemy 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.950
 come in record time the solution is 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.350
 to master the drac shot 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.080
 if you do not know what a drag 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.670
 shot i will explain the principle 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.890
 you start aiming in the direction 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.620
 general of your enemy then in a 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:09.140
 kind of move give you a big 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.250
 mouse shot so that your viewfinder this 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.800
 thiery I prove that your 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.540
 opponent and you shoot of the moon 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.060
 that is to say at the same time as you 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:19.250
 shift your viewfinder it's a 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.780
 very difficult technique to master and 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.910
 dreadfully effective in eliminating 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.670
 the race as enemies average 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:27.800
 distance by performing sets of 

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.370
 jade dredge you increase your cadence 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.650
 shooting 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.390
 when you kill more enemies 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.430
 quickly and in greater numbers 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.080
 after you can very well you 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.940
 ask why I advise you to 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.610
 do not braques shot of rooster 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.920
 scop well I would say that the quick 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.570
 scope are a bit too random they 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.040
 are more viable beyond fifteen 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.250
 meters while the dracs shot are 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.780
 usable under any circumstances 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.800
 do not try all the time dracs 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.800
 long distance shot 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.450
 they are too unreliable you have to know 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.100
 that realized a match up requires a 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.450
 very long training I do not know 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.820
 person who makes dracs 

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:03.980
 tickle what are you training me 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.620
 can advise you to go on servers 

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:08.630
 unclassified and train yourself to shoot 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.670
 on mines on windows or on 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:15.130
 elements of the decor, such as 

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:15.130
 street lights or crates 

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:21.339
 to finish this video I will talk 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.589
 quickly from my impressions on 

00:07:21.339 --> 00:07:24.999
 the crossbow she adds some 

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:27.430
 tactical dimension in a gameplay 

00:07:24.999 --> 00:07:29.050
 aggressive but here too the advantage 

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:31.539
 to have the power in several countries 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:33.789
 do not hesitate to use it in 

00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:35.740
 is a principal to advance she is 

00:07:33.789 --> 00:07:37.749
 also very effective for destroying referred 

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.009
 guy cock earth but a lot less with 

00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:40.539
 the tanks 

00:07:39.009 --> 00:07:42.580
 I hope you liked this video 

00:07:40.539 --> 00:07:44.349
 that you found it useful 

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:47.759
 sorry for my voice I was a little 

00:07:44.349 --> 00:07:47.759
 sick châteauneuf
