00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.170

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
lowest score wins so there are some

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.180 
lowest score wins so there are some
obvious<00:00:54.660> ways<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.350> can<00:00:55.710> hurt<00:00:56.039> other

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
obvious ways that you can hurt other

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.889 
obvious ways that you can hurt other
players<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.940> game<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.360> can<00:00:57.570> cut<00:00:57.780> off<00:00:57.870> a

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
players in the game you can cut off a

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.590 
players in the game you can cut off a
color<00:00:58.340> right<00:00:59.340> but<00:00:59.730> then<00:00:59.850> there's<00:01:00.030> some<00:01:00.180> other

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
color right but then there's some other

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.979 
color right but then there's some other
ways<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.170> do<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.160> aren't<00:01:02.670> as<00:01:02.789> obvious

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
ways to do that that aren't as obvious

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.050 
ways to do that that aren't as obvious
like<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.290> can<00:01:04.409> play<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> card<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.670> there's

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
like you can play a card so that there's

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.670 
like you can play a card so that there's
only<00:01:06.180> one<00:01:06.479> or<00:01:06.570> two<00:01:06.600> colors<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.439> can<00:01:07.560> be

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
only one or two colors that can be

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.789 
only one or two colors that can be
playing<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.340> turn<00:01:09.080> so<00:01:10.080> someone<00:01:10.409> might<00:01:10.530> still

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
playing in a turn so someone might still

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.109 
playing in a turn so someone might still
have<00:01:10.920> plays<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.310> their<00:01:11.430> hand<00:01:11.670> but<00:01:11.880> because

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
have plays in their hand but because

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.700 
have plays in their hand but because
they<00:01:12.240> can't<00:01:12.450> play<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.659> turn<00:01:13.170> they're

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
they can't play that turn they're

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.830 
they can't play that turn they're
eliminated<00:01:14.310> two<00:01:14.790> players<00:01:15.090> can<00:01:15.330> feel<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.540> bit

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
eliminated two players can feel a bit

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.890 
eliminated two players can feel a bit
dull<00:01:16.170> five<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.340> six<00:01:17.549> can<00:01:17.850> feel<00:01:18.090> chaotic<00:01:18.720> and

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
dull five and six can feel chaotic and

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.960 
dull five and six can feel chaotic and
for<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> lot<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.500> people<00:01:19.619> who<00:01:19.950> like<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.430> more

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
for a lot of people who like a more

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.260 
for a lot of people who like a more
strategic<00:01:21.180> game<00:01:21.689> three<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.680> four<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.460> going

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
strategic game three and four is going

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.330 
strategic game three and four is going
to<00:01:24.450> feel<00:01:24.720> probably<00:01:25.380> best<00:01:25.619> for<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:26.009> lot<00:01:26.310> of

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
to feel probably best for a lot of

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.649 
to feel probably best for a lot of
people<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.939> doesn't<00:01:27.150> mean<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.420> there<00:01:27.630> isn't

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
people it doesn't mean that there isn't

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.330 
people it doesn't mean that there isn't
strategy<00:01:28.350> at<00:01:28.439> five<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.829> six<00:01:29.040> but<00:01:29.250> it

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
strategy at five and six but it

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.710 
strategy at five and six but it
definitely<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:30.170> a<00:01:31.170> very<00:01:31.799> different<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.150> and

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
definitely is a very different and and

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.649 
definitely is a very different and and
more<00:01:34.110> reactive<00:01:34.740> kind<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.130> namely<00:01:35.640> it's<00:01:36.270> short

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
more reactive kind of namely it's short

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.580 
more reactive kind of namely it's short
but<00:01:36.780> addictive<00:01:37.439> each<00:01:38.400> round<00:01:38.880> goes<00:01:39.450> only<00:01:39.930> just

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
but addictive each round goes only just

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.039 
but addictive each round goes only just
a<00:01:40.680> few<00:01:40.950> minutes<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:42.150> whole<00:01:42.329> game<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.840> only

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
a few minutes and a whole game is only

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.319 
a few minutes and a whole game is only
between<00:01:43.320> 20<00:01:43.799> or<00:01:43.920> 30<00:01:44.100> minutes<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:44.970> find

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
between 20 or 30 minutes so you find

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.020 
between 20 or 30 minutes so you find
yourself<00:01:46.009> coming<00:01:47.009> up<00:01:47.130> with<00:01:47.280> new<00:01:47.460> ideas<00:01:47.490> and

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
yourself coming up with new ideas and
