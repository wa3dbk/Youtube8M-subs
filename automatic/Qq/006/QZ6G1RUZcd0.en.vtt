mean<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.780> see<00:01:48.930> how<00:01:48.990> stupid<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.590> sounds<00:01:49.740> and

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
mean you see how stupid that sounds and

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.719 
mean you see how stupid that sounds and
understanding<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.350> muscles<00:01:52.799> grow<00:01:53.070> because

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
or a healthier diet eventually once your

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.059 
or a healthier diet eventually once your
performance<00:02:05.820> becomes<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.659> great<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.920> you

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
performance becomes so great that you

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.940 
performance becomes so great that you
need<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.970> best<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.599> all<00:02:09.989> your<00:02:10.289> macro<00:02:10.830> and

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
need the best of all your macro and

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.170 
need the best of all your macro and
micronutrients<00:02:11.849> then<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.510> makes<00:02:12.629> a<00:02:12.780> different

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
micronutrients then it makes a different

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.449 
micronutrients then it makes a different
so<00:02:13.959> when<00:02:14.140> you<00:02:14.230> become<00:02:14.500> an<00:02:14.590> Olympian<00:02:15.040> give<00:02:15.310> me<00:02:15.430> a

just started lifting weights and started

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.110 
just started lifting weights and started
doing<00:02:25.870> cardiovascular<00:02:26.650> activity<00:02:27.120> you'd

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
doing cardiovascular activity you'd

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.869 
doing cardiovascular activity you'd
become<00:02:28.900> more<00:02:29.109> muscular<00:02:29.530> you<00:02:30.069> become<00:02:30.459> stronger

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
become more muscular you become stronger

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.879 
become more muscular you become stronger
you<00:02:31.150> become<00:02:31.269> bigger<00:02:31.689> and<00:02:31.810> you'd<00:02:32.379> improve<00:02:32.739> your

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:32.889 
you become bigger and you'd improve your

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:36.149 
you become bigger and you'd improve your
cardiovascular<00:02:33.549> performance<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:34.980> if<00:02:35.980> you

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
cardiovascular performance and if you

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:37.619 
cardiovascular performance and if you
did<00:02:36.340> that<00:02:36.370> enough<00:02:36.790> and<00:02:36.969> you<00:02:37.030> didn't<00:02:37.239> eat<00:02:37.359> so

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
did that enough and you didn't eat so

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.319 
did that enough and you didn't eat so
much<00:02:37.810> fast<00:02:38.109> food<00:02:38.200> you'd<00:02:38.469> lose<00:02:38.709> weight<00:02:39.329> amazing

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
much fast food you'd lose weight amazing

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.690 
much fast food you'd lose weight amazing
and<00:02:40.569> then<00:02:41.560> eventually<00:02:41.680> you'd<00:02:42.219> have<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.489> clean

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
and then eventually you'd have to clean

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.729 
and then eventually you'd have to clean
up<00:02:42.730> your<00:02:42.849> diet<00:02:43.120> again<00:02:43.840> once<00:02:44.349> you<00:02:44.530> were
