the USB that requires a three and a half

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.399 
the USB that requires a three and a half
wat<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.790> can<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.329> can<00:01:45.450> run<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.780> directly<00:01:46.140> or

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
wat you can you can run it directly or

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.740 
wat you can you can run it directly or
charge<00:01:46.950> directly<00:01:47.280> from<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:48.890> but<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:51.360> idea

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
charge directly from that but the idea

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.030 
charge directly from that but the idea
is<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.899> use<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.850> battery<00:01:53.850> unit<00:01:54.170> okay<00:01:55.170> or<00:01:55.500> use

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
is to use the battery unit okay or use

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.550 
is to use the battery unit okay or use
the<00:01:56.340> lots<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.420> items<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.049> can<00:01:58.200> use<00:01:58.350> these

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
the lots of items that you can use these

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.410 
the lots of items that you can use these
batteries<00:01:58.950> for<00:01:59.310> so<00:01:59.820> I<00:01:59.850> think<00:02:00.000> it's<00:02:00.210> kind<00:02:00.299> of

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
batteries for so I think it's kind of

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.249 
batteries for so I think it's kind of
neat<00:02:00.740> looking<00:02:01.740> at<00:02:01.860> 100<00:02:02.189> bucks<00:02:02.600> just<00:02:03.600> over<00:02:03.930> 100

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
neat looking at 100 bucks just over 100

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.249 
neat looking at 100 bucks just over 100
bucks<00:02:04.670> if<00:02:05.670> there<00:02:05.939> was<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.149> downside<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.869> this

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
bucks if there was a downside to this

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.680

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.490 
straps on here that these are kind of
nice<00:02:20.220> because<00:02:20.490> you<00:02:20.640> could<00:02:20.970> strap<00:02:21.240> it<00:02:21.570> on<00:02:21.870> your

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
the go they are solar panels so and I'm

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.920 
the go they are solar panels so and I'm
kind<00:02:29.640> of<00:02:29.700> hard<00:02:29.880> on<00:02:30.000> stuff<00:02:30.330> so<00:02:30.540> what<00:02:30.660> I'm<00:02:30.750> going

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
kind of hard on stuff so what I'm going

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.240 
kind of hard on stuff so what I'm going
to<00:02:30.990> do<00:02:31.490> is<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:34.290> again<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:34.650> pulls<00:02:34.890> right<00:02:35.100> back

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
to do is and again it pulls right back

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.420 
to do is and again it pulls right back
up<00:02:35.490> and<00:02:36.290> put<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:37.410> back<00:02:37.620> in<00:02:37.770> perspective

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
up and put that back in perspective

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.360 
up and put that back in perspective
there<00:02:38.640> that's<00:02:39.150> how<00:02:39.300> big<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.660> is<00:02:40.220> compared<00:02:41.220> it

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
there that's how big that is compared it

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.450 
there that's how big that is compared it
to<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.580> batteries<00:02:43.130> but<00:02:44.130> I'm<00:02:44.220> going<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.400> find

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
to the batteries but I'm going to find

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.530 
to the batteries but I'm going to find
something<00:02:44.880> that<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.210> can<00:02:45.390> put<00:02:45.540> this<00:02:45.750> in<00:02:46.020> that<00:02:46.440> is

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
something that I can put this in that is

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.780 
something that I can put this in that is
kind<00:02:48.540> of<00:02:48.570> like<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.720> laptop<00:02:49.200> bag<00:02:50.100> or<00:02:50.640> some

kind of like a laptop bag or some

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.360 
kind of like a laptop bag or some
cushion<00:02:51.180> so<00:02:51.930> I<00:02:52.470> don't<00:02:52.710> have<00:02:52.800> to<00:02:52.890> be<00:02:53.070> worried

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370
