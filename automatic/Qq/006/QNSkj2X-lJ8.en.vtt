in<00:00:01.830> the<00:00:02.830> last<00:00:03.040> lesson<00:00:03.250> you<00:00:03.520> created<00:00:03.909> a<00:00:03.970> part

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:04.210 
in the last lesson you created a part

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.269 
in the last lesson you created a part
file<00:00:04.420> main<00:00:04.690> pin<00:00:04.990> and<00:00:05.290> you<00:00:05.680> saved<00:00:05.950> it<00:00:06.130> in<00:00:06.250> the

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:06.279 
file main pin and you saved it in the

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:08.580 
file main pin and you saved it in the
Documents<00:00:06.819> folder<00:00:07.260> now<00:00:08.260> you're<00:00:08.410> going<00:00:08.530> to

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:08.590 
Documents folder now you're going to

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:09.690 
Documents folder now you're going to
learn<00:00:08.680> about<00:00:08.830> the<00:00:09.070> process<00:00:09.520> of<00:00:09.639> creating

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
learn about the process of creating

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.760 
learn about the process of creating
features<00:00:10.480> and<00:00:11.020> we'll<00:00:11.260> start<00:00:11.530> with<00:00:11.680> the

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:11.770 
features and we'll start with the

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.970 
features and we'll start with the
creation<00:00:12.219> of<00:00:12.280> a<00:00:12.400> sketch<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:14.139> features<00:00:14.500> tab<00:00:14.740> of

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:14.980 
creation of a sketch the features tab of

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.890 
creation of a sketch the features tab of
the<00:00:15.010> command<00:00:15.369> manager<00:00:15.580> is<00:00:15.910> active<00:00:16.299> so<00:00:16.720> these

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 
the command manager is active so these

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.800 
the command manager is active so these
are<00:00:17.050> the<00:00:17.140> feature<00:00:17.410> commands<00:00:18.179> if<00:00:19.179> you<00:00:19.630> click

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
are the feature commands if you click

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.210 
are the feature commands if you click
the<00:00:19.900> sketch<00:00:20.140> tab<00:00:20.439> you'll<00:00:20.679> see<00:00:20.740> all<00:00:21.039> the

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
the sketch tab you'll see all the

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.880 
the sketch tab you'll see all the
commands<00:00:21.609> used<00:00:21.880> in<00:00:22.089> sketches<00:00:22.619> we<00:00:23.619> need<00:00:23.769> to

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
commands used in sketches we need to

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.380 
commands used in sketches we need to
create<00:00:24.160> a<00:00:24.220> sketch<00:00:24.519> so<00:00:24.550> click<00:00:25.029> the<00:00:25.150> sketch

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
create a sketch so click the sketch

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.159 
create a sketch so click the sketch
command<00:00:27.329> when<00:00:28.329> you<00:00:28.449> do<00:00:28.599> the<00:00:28.779> first<00:00:28.960> thing

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:29.169 
command when you do the first thing

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:30.929 
command when you do the first thing
you'll<00:00:29.289> notice<00:00:29.470> is<00:00:29.710> three<00:00:29.980> default<00:00:30.369> planes<00:00:30.669> in

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
you'll notice is three default planes in

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:32.880 
you'll notice is three default planes in
the<00:00:31.029> graphics<00:00:31.390> area<00:00:31.539> I'll<00:00:32.439> tell<00:00:32.680> you<00:00:32.770> about

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
the graphics area I'll tell you about

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.069 
the graphics area I'll tell you about
these<00:00:33.100> planes<00:00:33.430> in<00:00:33.610> just<00:00:33.820> a<00:00:33.910> minute<00:00:34.030> for<00:00:34.420> now<00:00:35.050> I

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079 
these planes in just a minute for now I

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:36.360 
these planes in just a minute for now I
want<00:00:35.350> to<00:00:35.379> show<00:00:35.530> you<00:00:35.590> changes<00:00:36.100> to<00:00:36.250> the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
want to show you changes to the

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.220 
want to show you changes to the
SolidWorks<00:00:36.820> interface<00:00:37.300> that<00:00:37.690> you<00:00:37.809> may<00:00:38.020> not

SolidWorks interface that you may not

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.529 
SolidWorks interface that you may not
have<00:00:38.320> noticed<00:00:39.030> first<00:00:40.030> we'll<00:00:40.239> look<00:00:40.329> at<00:00:40.449> the

00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:40.539 
have noticed first we'll look at the

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:42.540 
have noticed first we'll look at the
feature<00:00:40.780> manager<00:00:41.050> before<00:00:42.039> I<00:00:42.250> click<00:00:42.460> the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
feature manager before I click the

feature manager before I click the
sketch<00:00:42.760> command<00:00:43.149> the<00:00:43.329> feature<00:00:43.539> manager<00:00:43.809> tree

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
sketch command the feature manager tree

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.549 
sketch command the feature manager tree
was<00:00:44.559> the<00:00:44.770> active<00:00:45.219> tab<00:00:45.460> and<00:00:46.260> after<00:00:47.260> I<00:00:47.289> flicked

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
was the active tab and after I flicked

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.020 
was the active tab and after I flicked
the<00:00:47.620> command<00:00:47.980> the<00:00:48.070> property<00:00:48.550> manager<00:00:48.850> tab

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
the command the property manager tab

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.630 
the command the property manager tab
became<00:00:49.420> active<00:00:49.870> the<00:00:50.559> property<00:00:51.039> manager<00:00:51.190> gives

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
became active the property manager gives

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.279 
became active the property manager gives
you<00:00:51.730> a<00:00:51.760> message<00:00:52.149> describing<00:00:52.660> how<00:00:52.750> to<00:00:52.780> use<00:00:53.079> the

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:53.289 
you a message describing how to use the

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:54.990 
you a message describing how to use the
command<00:00:53.590> and<00:00:53.829> in<00:00:54.100> most<00:00:54.280> cases<00:00:54.489> it<00:00:54.850> has

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
command and in most cases it has

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.819 
command and in most cases it has
settings<00:00:55.390> that<00:00:55.570> control<00:00:55.989> the<00:00:56.140> operation<00:00:56.769> of

settings that control the operation of

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.189 
settings that control the operation of
the<00:00:56.949> command<00:00:57.340> the<00:00:58.269> sketch<00:00:58.510> command<00:00:58.960> is<00:00:59.079> a

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
the command the sketch command is a

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.049 
the command the sketch command is a
simple<00:00:59.589> command<00:00:59.859> so<00:01:00.129> the<00:01:00.250> property<00:01:00.670> manager

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
simple command so the property manager

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.689 
simple command so the property manager
only<00:01:01.300> explains<00:01:01.870> how<00:01:02.109> to<00:01:02.170> use<00:01:02.260> it<00:01:02.649> it<00:01:03.219> says<00:01:03.519> to

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
only explains how to use it it says to

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.070 
only explains how to use it it says to
select<00:01:03.969> the<00:01:04.089> plane<00:01:04.300> on<00:01:04.449> which<00:01:04.600> to<00:01:04.780> create<00:01:04.930> the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
select the plane on which to create the

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.140 
select the plane on which to create the
sketch<00:01:05.470> so<00:01:06.190> we're<00:01:06.340> gonna<00:01:06.430> select<00:01:06.700> one<00:01:06.850> of<00:01:07.000> the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
sketch so we're gonna select one of the

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.960 
sketch so we're gonna select one of the
default<00:01:07.300> planes<00:01:08.160> before<00:01:09.160> we<00:01:09.430> do<00:01:09.580> I<00:01:09.610> want<00:01:09.910> you

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
default planes before we do I want you

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.580 
default planes before we do I want you
to<00:01:10.030> notice<00:01:10.330> the<00:01:10.450> feature<00:01:10.660> tree<00:01:10.960> in<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.320> upper

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
to notice the feature tree in the upper
