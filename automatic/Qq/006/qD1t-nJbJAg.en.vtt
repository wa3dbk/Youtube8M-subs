 beauty talks to you 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.270
 This video here will show my first 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.170
 map that they consider to have seen that the game 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.760
 the old 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.460
 the first map I made of 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.280
 customized thinking was 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.680
 Really cool, it took me 14 minutes to 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.390
 do he told me I'll show 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.430
 link for you back here 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.530
 It really was pretty complicated right now. 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.290
 know why this has stopped because the blog 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.640
 shadow here I went really well 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.149
 complicated this theme 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.140
 well I did everything by hand even in four 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.530
 days 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.740
 and you see this here is a system of 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.270
 panel back there and this would be one day 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.070
 to make this panel and had to 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.810
 fix a lot as you can 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.460
 Here see 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.100
 I will leave download the map in 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.720
 description and now now of course let's 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.000
 one for you is 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.720
 I'm going to rescue the panel here and it will 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.149
 quite cheerful even looks op now she 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.509
 got every stop and will reject all 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:59.440
 panel reservation panel 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.209
 good how does the game work, did you 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.729
 You have to know how to play play was right 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:06.649
 here within the rules of paraná 1 gives 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:11.840
 problem on the map in the game system here 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:13.610
 Just take a look and here back here. 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:19.430
 It's the only score you score when you 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:21.319
 played with your friend right 45 and with 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.680
 what works basically will you 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.910
 choose with whom one you go 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.220
 joaquim starts the game neither with whom you 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.209
 will play here and you will select 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.830
 like here 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.430
 this one since he will select 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.400
 That one there, oh boy, he's going to press here. 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.430
 select the one there 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.610
 I was not sure why the market is 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.159
 Sound, some problem, some problem. 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.310
 There is no sound and beauty oxy selective o 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:51.489
 xo-1 beauty there public again and 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.109
 turns around and only if you want you 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.819
 ended up playing wrong you can result 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:03:02.680
 just putting it back and then I did not hesitate 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:04.060
 I did not call it 's now it was our delay. 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.129
 very much 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.609
 Good in the same place as I am. 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:12.389
 I'll click here on the console that side 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:15.609
 here is what you can see just give a 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:18.159
 let's say you drag that panel over there 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:20.170
 and you will get an idea of ​​how it is there 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:22.180
 There's the ball that's why it has everything. 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:26.859
 that complex system back there 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.060
 beauty will disable it there was now a 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:31.060
 little faster 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:35.400
 beauty then it's only if that's the way you play 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.400
 motivate active'm all right there here 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:42.549
 covenant and also reminding the crew 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.290
 here I will carry water when 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.319
 easy take longer is because of 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.769
 system that is long and very large and here 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.169
 O 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.930
 You never squeeze in the same place for 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:55.150
 example the xv is all those five 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.970
 tight then never loses in the same 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.680
 Place there because that gives me trouble, I do not 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.480
 I should do this but I will 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.359
 both can see that now drawing him 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:08.260
 will stay all over the oil is all over 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:10.329
 the stranger the strange fact since then 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.549
 I did not want him to be 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:14.349
 You will not give a problem there. 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:16.599
 You reset this, just click again and 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:18.130
 it will work out let's hope not 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:22.530
 has no problem the system did not give 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:25.030
 beauty has left everything here and 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:29.710
 Beauty, you just ended up from here. 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:31.060
 stopped loading it was was beauty and 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.659
 the match is over 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.550
 and there it is only you and tac is rescue panel is 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:37.990
 click here it will rescue all of 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.280
 all sides and will work hard 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:45.039
 As I already said, I think I'm going to do it. 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.600
 two videos one is going to be from here 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:48.480
 showing everything 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.130
 I do not know why you do not want to carry 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.170
 desert reserve 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.070
 I do not know why it's taking too long. 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.540
 but OK 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.280
 good this video will be to show the 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.930
 Clear map I'm going to make a second video 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.640
 showing the system circuit and 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:06.790
 return here and if de de la roca is the 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.500
 system reserving the panel he said 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.650
 than the panel system to connect each 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.860
 joining is not very complicated there from the other 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:17.230
 side has also made this map all 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.660
 that was made by hand except this system 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:23.860
 of every panel you love 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:26.020
 Let me explain the process is this 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.150
 The panel that I said took a day. 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.640
 really very complicated you try 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.680
 It's going to take a while because I understand. 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.050
 it is really quite complex that the system 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.240
 but if you know the recession well in the US 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.100
 will probably understand these 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.590
 three here I made the hand and really 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.600
 It took me a long time and then I had to 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.150
 use a program called imsi edith that 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.620
 Then I gave mine with control and control. 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.050
 there I put it everywhere 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.660
 but the rest was all done by hand even 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.400
 these circuit beauty here 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.960
 so this is it people I hope you 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.390
 liked or made another video 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:02.280
 Like I said explaining this circuit here. 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:04.510
 if you want to understand it is clear here that 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.470
 show you guys to give you a 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.970
 look 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.550
 I used a really cool system here as well. 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:14.290
 interesting is that you know the the 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:16.660
 sony network has a limit of 15 is 15 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:19.510
 hence it loses its energy it does not arrive any more 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:22.330
 then I use this system that loves the back 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.820
 complete here and come back here and there he does 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:27.430
 with which the drawing is sure to ball 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.350
 xl to have no conflict was fine 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.490
 cool even then this galera I hope 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.410
 did you like 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.440
 Can you help me in your home and that your 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.790
 favorite that will help me a lot in 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.440
 work to make this map you can 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:42.160
 help cell damage that your favorite 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:44.830
 Do you have any doubt on the map? It's just me. 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.750
 ask then is this guys to download 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.710
 this map is there in the description of that 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.200
 video 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:54.000
 I hope you have passed until then 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.000
 the next video said
