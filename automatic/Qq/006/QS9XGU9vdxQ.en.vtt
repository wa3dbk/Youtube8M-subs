00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.440
 Hello, I fulfill the request which 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.049
 received a year ago 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.900
 request to perform makeup with three 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.700
 New Year's makeup arrows are not cute 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.680
 maybe shoot this video at the end 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.840
 last year so I am performing a query 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.480
 just now the number of arrows i 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.609
 I will reduce the fret 2 I think so more 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.730
 looks harmonious, I took just white 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:33.900
 the arrow from the original photo which is to me 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.900
 you are fat sensei ra 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.680
 most often on New Year's Eve we do not have 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.620
 time for ourselves we either cook 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.360
 then we meet guests and there is time 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.270
 just to get together in a festive dress 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.220
 and even if you were planning on doing what 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.350
 then makeup 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.900
 just does not have time for him this 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.300
 makeup is done very quickly I advise it 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.660
 for those who like to draw arrows who can 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.610
 drawing them is actually nothing complicated in 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.260
 This is not you just do your usual 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.790
 makeup 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:10.229
 just draw two arrows and arrows 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.060
 it looks very festive to someone 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.430
 interesting keep watching i already 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.130
 put concealer and concealer to 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.270
 save time my eyebrows are hidden 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.850
 padded bangs 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.540
 but I still make them out like a bang 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.180
 move 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.290
 sometimes it opens up i think that 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.240
 eyebrow shaping 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.890
 is an important part of makeup 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.540
 no matter they are visible if 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.030
 makeup should hold out longer 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.149
 four hours it is desirable to put a base 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:43.160
 under the shade my eyelashes are straight and by forceps 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.160
 no makeup costs 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:50.670

 I paint eyelashes with mascara 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:35.099
 on the cheeks I apply a rouge Art Deco in shade 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:35.099
 27 he will give them a natural blush 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.830
