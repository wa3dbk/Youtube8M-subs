okay first thing we're going to talk
about<00:00:04.259> is<00:00:04.770> running<00:00:05.100> tempo<00:00:05.730> or<00:00:05.940> running

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
about is running tempo or running

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.750 
about is running tempo or running
cadence<00:00:06.690> this<00:00:07.529> is<00:00:07.710> just<00:00:07.919> for<00:00:08.069> musicians<00:00:08.250> it's

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
cadence this is just for musicians it's

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.959 
cadence this is just for musicians it's
a<00:00:08.940> metronome<00:00:09.690> you<00:00:10.410> can<00:00:10.769> also<00:00:11.040> use<00:00:11.429> an<00:00:11.639> iPhone

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
a metronome you can also use an iPhone

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.289 
a metronome you can also use an iPhone
app<00:00:12.210> for<00:00:12.240> this<00:00:12.630> so<00:00:13.320> we're<00:00:13.620> looking<00:00:13.860> for<00:00:14.299> 180

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
app for this so we're looking for 180

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.910 
app for this so we're looking for 180
beats<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.750> minute<00:00:16.220> right<00:00:17.220> on<00:00:17.690> 180<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:19.439> you're

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
beats a minute right on 180 and you're

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.439 
beats a minute right on 180 and you're
just<00:00:20.070> wanting<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.400> put<00:00:20.580> your<00:00:20.699> feet<00:00:20.910> down<00:00:21.090> at

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
just wanting to put your feet down at

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.740 
just wanting to put your feet down at
this<00:00:21.720> exact<00:00:22.289> tempo<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:23.460> this<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:23.880> good<00:00:24.090> 180<00:00:24.570> is

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
this exact tempo so this is good 180 is

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.620 
this exact tempo so this is good 180 is
going<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:24.990> be<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.260> minimum<00:00:25.410> tempo<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.670> it

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
going to be the minimum tempo so it

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.080 
going to be the minimum tempo so it
helps<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:27.990> listen<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.160> can<00:00:29.279> actually<00:00:29.609> see

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
helps to listen and you can actually see

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.359 
helps to listen and you can actually see
it<00:00:30.240> on<00:00:30.359> these<00:00:30.539> as<00:00:30.869> well<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.380> then<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
it on these as well and then the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.360 
it on these as well and then the
practice<00:00:32.880> for<00:00:33.059> this<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.510> just<00:00:33.809> in<00:00:34.020> place<00:00:34.380> I'll

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
practice for this is just in place I'll

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.000 
practice for this is just in place I'll
show<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.790> now<00:00:36.860> it's<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.980> stepping<00:00:39.920> with<00:00:40.920> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
show it now it's the stepping with the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.000 
show it now it's the stepping with the
heels<00:00:41.309> coming<00:00:41.730> down<00:00:42.620> exactly<00:00:43.620> at<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.010> tempo

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
heels coming down exactly at the tempo

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.380 
heels coming down exactly at the tempo
you<00:00:47.010> can<00:00:47.160> practice<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.670> with<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.850> toes<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
you can practice it with the toes on the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.229 
you can practice it with the toes on the
ground<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.840> heels<00:00:49.050> moving<00:00:50.059> and<00:00:51.059> then

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
ground and the heels moving and then

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:59.540 
ground and the heels moving and then
move<00:00:51.449> into<00:00:51.600> Iran<00:00:57.050> if<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.230> helps<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:59.219> can<00:00:59.280> hold

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
move into Iran if it helps you can hold

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.830 
move into Iran if it helps you can hold
it<00:00:59.699> by<00:00:59.789> your<00:00:59.940> ear<00:01:00.739> so<00:01:01.879> what's<00:01:02.879> important<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.510> to

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
it by your ear so what's important is to

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.420 
it by your ear so what's important is to
make<00:01:03.989> sure<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.290> stay<00:01:04.500> right<00:01:04.710> on<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.070> tempo

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
make sure you stay right on the tempo

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.190 
make sure you stay right on the tempo
you<00:01:05.460> can<00:01:05.760> even<00:01:05.970> turn<00:01:06.150> on<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.630> style<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.080> can

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
you can even turn on this style you can

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.140 
you can even turn on this style you can
turn<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.500> sound<00:01:07.650> off<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.220> see<00:01:08.460> the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
turn the sound off and to see the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.149 
turn the sound off and to see the
picture<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.630> it

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
picture of it

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.240 
picture of it
so<00:01:11.810> again<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.170> want<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.439> get<00:01:13.649> that<00:01:14.009> rhythm

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
so again you want to get that rhythm

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.450 
so again you want to get that rhythm
down<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.360> can<00:01:15.509> even<00:01:15.630> run<00:01:15.930> with<00:01:16.140> this

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
down and you can even run with this

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.310 
down and you can even run with this
right<00:01:17.460> at<00:01:17.640> your<00:01:17.729> ear<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.390> whole<00:01:18.420> time<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:19.289> make

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
right at your ear the whole time to make

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.840 
right at your ear the whole time to make
sure<00:01:19.649> you're<00:01:19.799> right<00:01:19.950> on<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.340> when<00:01:20.759> you're

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
sure you're right on it when you're

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.880 
sure you're right on it when you're
running<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.270> place<00:01:21.539> again<00:01:22.380> you're<00:01:22.710> going<00:01:22.829> to

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
running in place again you're going to

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.120 
running in place again you're going to
be<00:01:23.009> touching<00:01:24.079> and<00:01:25.079> you're<00:01:25.860> going<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.009> be

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
be touching and you're going to be

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.399 
be touching and you're going to be
touching<00:01:26.549> here<00:01:27.060> that's<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.750> forefront<00:01:28.259> where

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
touching here that's the forefront where

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.899 
touching here that's the forefront where
you're<00:01:28.500> hitting<00:01:28.679> every<00:01:28.950> time<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.460> then<00:01:29.820> the

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
you're hitting every time and then the

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.270 
you're hitting every time and then the
heels<00:01:30.149> are<00:01:30.420> lightly<00:01:30.810> touching<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.649> again<00:01:31.950> with

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
heels are lightly touching so again with

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:46.639 
heels are lightly touching so again with
the<00:01:32.399> 180<00:01:32.759> drill<00:01:44.209> and<00:01:45.209> that's<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:45.990> 180<00:01:46.200> is

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
the 180 drill and that's it so 180 is

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.309 
the 180 drill and that's it so 180 is
the<00:01:46.709> minimum<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.490> can<00:01:47.759> run<00:01:48.240> faster<00:01:48.750> we're<00:01:49.200> not

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.319 
the minimum you can run faster we're not

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:50.749 
the minimum you can run faster we're not
going<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.530> worry<00:01:49.679> right<00:01:49.920> now<00:01:49.950> about<00:01:50.099> how<00:01:50.549> much

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
going to worry right now about how much

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.130 
going to worry right now about how much
faster<00:01:51.030> but<00:01:51.360> it's<00:01:51.509> okay<00:01:51.780> if<00:01:51.899> you're<00:01:52.020> running

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
faster but it's okay if you're running

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.139 
faster but it's okay if you're running
faster<00:01:52.649> than<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.890> but<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.610> base<00:01:53.849> line

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
faster than that but the base line

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.779 
faster than that but the base line
should<00:01:54.390> always<00:01:54.659> be<00:01:55.020> 180<00:01:55.500> there<00:01:56.220> is<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.399> reason

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
should always be 180 there is a reason

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.260 
should always be 180 there is a reason
for<00:01:56.819> this<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.360> gets<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.630> little<00:01:57.860> it<00:01:58.860> gets

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
for this it gets a little it gets

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.669 
for this it gets a little it gets
scientific<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.360> has<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.630> do<00:02:00.750> with<00:02:00.869> elasticity

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
scientific it has to do with elasticity

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.230 
scientific it has to do with elasticity
and<00:02:01.860> we<00:02:02.220> want<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.520> foot<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.700> be<00:02:02.789> able<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.090> come

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
and we want the foot to be able to come

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.240 
and we want the foot to be able to come
up<00:02:03.390> quickly<00:02:03.720> so<00:02:04.020> there's<00:02:04.560> some<00:02:04.709> benefits<00:02:05.099> we

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
up quickly so there's some benefits we

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.039 
up quickly so there's some benefits we
get<00:02:05.399> when<00:02:05.700> we<00:02:05.909> do<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.209> and<00:02:06.539> that's<00:02:06.659> something

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
get when we do this and that's something

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.900 
get when we do this and that's something
we<00:02:07.140> can<00:02:07.289> cover<00:02:07.439> some<00:02:07.709> some<00:02:08.310> other<00:02:08.459> time

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
we can cover some some other time

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.020
