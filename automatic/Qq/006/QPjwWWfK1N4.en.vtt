00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.080
 the French round of the championship 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.760

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.739
 competition days on the same 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.180
 special as the wrc before this round 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.879
 three pilots stood in one 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.949
 handkerchief at the top of the overall ranking 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.330
 Sebastian chardonnet coin with four 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:47.949
 small advance points on nicolas 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.949
 romiguière and quentin gilbert 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.470
 sébastien chardonnet was taking a good 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.810
 departure and prevailed in both 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.920
 first special 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.660
 Boosted in the country's special 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.580
 d'ormont disputed in his native Vosges 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.559
 Quentin Gilbert then took 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.390
 the advantage 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.580
 he was completing the first stage with 17 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.580
 seconds advanced on nicolas romiguiere 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.170
 way went well for us we got 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.060
 went out of the yard what was it 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.890
 still quite difficult very dirty 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.380
 data pay attention to all 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.180
 turns did not burst etc 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.479
 we started on a rhythm below 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.479
 usually 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.260
 we increased our pace on 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.729
 special after we did a little 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.409
 touchette who opened us a little bit 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.750
 the rear end but it's not us 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.860
 embarrassed to make the best time in 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.850
 the fourth special so a good 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.759
 day a good first step 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.350
 today and tomorrow we will continue 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.759
 to attack a little bit not so fast 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.149
 that the last two specials we have 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.740
 made to try to manage then 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.060
 chardonnay had lost nearly 2 minutes 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.299
 because of a box problem 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.670
 velocities saturday quentin gilbert 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.409
 continued his effort until he 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.890
 sort of the road in the special the 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.530
 big balloon 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.330
 the disappointment was immense because it 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.869
 almost lost all hope of being 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.280
 titled a day is not too much it's over 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.800
 not too much we had rather good 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.679
 start began to manage I wanted 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.459
 leave by finally attacking the 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.170
 specials were really very 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.190
 difficult we managed to manage a small 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.100
 little bit of our lead so I wanted 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.390
 continue in rally like this and in the 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.430
 Valley Valley Special 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.780
 munster in attack and no I got 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.930
 trapped in December on road from 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.190
 the wet it's going to be complicated now 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.190
 to win the championship 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:37.290
 I am really really 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.640
 really sad romiguière who had 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.320
 kept up the pressure did not ask 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.860
 both to relay his rival at the head of 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.350
 the race 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.330
 released he aligned the scratch at the end of 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.880
 day and completed the stage with 2 minutes 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.100
 30 advanced on the amazing damien defert 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.360
 a perfect day 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.860
 we did a little what we wanted in 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.270
 the first two we had twenty 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.650
 seconds late on quentin so we 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.490
 knew that it was important not to 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.800
 let escape 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.120
 so we managed to pick up a bit 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.010
 of time and to return to less than 15 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.550
 seconds of it in the first ream 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.530
 special 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.110
 he makes a small mistake that still makes 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.060
 ten seconds so we almost come back to 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.500
 equality with him and therefore adherence 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.600
 it was necessary to attack all 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.040
 two boundary weather holes we went 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.520
 several times close to the 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.690
 Corrections 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.750
 luckily we stayed on the road 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.850
 and him in a room turn that closed 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.740
 he made the mistake not to commit 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.450
 he left in front of a hole so is 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.840
 there he got stuck is impossible to 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.940
 divide 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.680
 we went so now we're going 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.190
 we will ensure we have more than four 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.740
 minutes of advanced 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.710
 it's quite comfortable so we're going 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.910
 ensure tomorrow and at dawn or again 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.280
 faced with mechanical problems 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.500
 Chardonnay dropped to 5th place behind 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.960
 charles martin and anthony balester but 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.090
 it's true that yesterday we had a big 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.040
 mechanical failure in the support of 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.960
 box that is who broke and who caused 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.480
 damage to the gimbal and today 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.790
 we had exactly the same breakdown 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.950
 started from the end of the 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.480
 third special of the day so that we 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.530
 cost a little bit of time when we 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.810
 is when the car broke down 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.730
 we had about 250 km left 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.670
 between times and connections 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.890
 so we had to preserve the 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.040
 car to be here tonight for 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.180
 to mark 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.250
 to score points for the 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.200
 championship overwhelmed by the lack of 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.909
 Successful sébastien chardonnet was going 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.600
 to be forced to throw away the sponge 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:18.609
 Sunday morning 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.229
 the big winner of this fifth 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.539
 round of the season was nicolas nicolas 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:25.410
 romiguiere remedy to perform so a 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:25.410
 big step towards the title 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:38.950
 well what is this talent for us 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.770
 is super happy we were not hoping so much 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.150
 we report the rally in juniors and in 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.240
 plus our main competitors 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.800
 abandoned so we do we make a big 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.120
 too championship there we take the lead 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.300
 with normand more than six points advanced 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.660
 on sébastien so it's perfect for 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:58.330
 hope for better with 36 points against 30 at 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.950
 Chardonnay and 26 in Gilbert Romiguière 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.310
 can afford to handle the rally 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.440
 of the var 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.530
 since a fourth place will ensure 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.850
 of the title of the twingo r2 trophy side the 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.770
 start was marked by 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.270
 multiple punctures dug by the 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.670
 road degradation after crossing 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.010
 one because the first clown theater 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.770
 occurred in the s1 with the abandonment of 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.630
 roman salinas the leader of the trophy 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.790
 before this appointment you were a victim of 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.230
 double puncture 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:26.140
 stéphane consani in the s2 and laurent 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.880
 Clutier in the s3 as it burst 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.530
 left the field open to georges gonon 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.150
 who completed the first step in mind 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.450
 with a nice lead over mathias of 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:36.190
 souza consani and cloutier get into 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.620
 a real pursuit race when 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.790
 the long second step aligning the 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.110
 better times they redid their 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.790
 delay with long strides 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.570
 the gones we could afford to 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.570
 manage your advance 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.909
 the third step curve did not bring 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:50.589
 no change in the ranking 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:53.610
 and george gonon won so his 

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:53.610
 first win of the season 

00:05:55.559 --> 00:06:01.059
 other account a too happy this morning 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:04.180
 it was hard hard I had to manage I 

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:05.559
 did not want to lose too much and we are 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.419
 arrived at the end we worked really well 

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:10.169
 with christophe and congratulations to the team 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:16.990

 Stéphane Consani took over the head of 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.509
 general classification for two peas 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:27.009
 more than one of the first positive rally 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:27.520
 day we were unlucky we got a 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:32.050
 puncture 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:33.059
 the next day we have stretched the train 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.710
 back 

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:37.839
 so we fought all the way 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:40.659
 weekend with a twisted rear train and 

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:42.960
 balance sheet balance of the rally we take the head 

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:45.150
