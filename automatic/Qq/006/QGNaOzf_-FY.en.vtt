side<00:00:27.119> or<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.420> other<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:28.670> don't<00:00:29.670> know<00:00:29.760> how<00:00:29.880> it

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
side or the other I don't know how it

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.339 
side or the other I don't know how it
makes<00:00:30.150> any<00:00:30.330> difference<00:00:30.420> but<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:30.990> my<00:00:31.109> head<00:00:31.289> it

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
makes any difference but in my head it

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.580 
makes any difference but in my head it
worked<00:00:31.710> out<00:00:33.050> don't<00:00:34.050> see<00:00:34.230> how<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.440> doesn't

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590

anymore<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.920> guess<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.219> makes<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.460> just<00:00:35.610> look

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730
