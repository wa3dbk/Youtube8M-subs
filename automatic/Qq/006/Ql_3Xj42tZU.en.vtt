hello<00:00:02.159> folks<00:00:02.399> well<00:00:03.060> not<00:00:03.419> really<00:00:03.629> happy<00:00:04.080> with

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
hello folks well not really happy with

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.170 
hello folks well not really happy with
the<00:00:04.410> IR<00:00:04.799> controller<00:00:05.310> and<00:00:05.640> the<00:00:05.730> low<00:00:05.910> battery

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
the IR controller and the low battery

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.900 
the IR controller and the low battery
life<00:00:06.629> of<00:00:06.839> my<00:00:06.990> Air<00:00:07.140> Swimmer<00:00:07.440> I<00:00:07.740> decided<00:00:08.490> to<00:00:08.730> see

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
life of my Air Swimmer I decided to see

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.290 
life of my Air Swimmer I decided to see
if<00:00:09.000> I<00:00:09.120> could<00:00:09.179> switch<00:00:09.540> it<00:00:09.780> to<00:00:09.860> 2.4<00:00:10.860> gigahertz

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:11.300 
if I could switch it to 2.4 gigahertz

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.759 
if I could switch it to 2.4 gigahertz
well<00:00:12.300> first<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.690> used<00:00:12.900> an<00:00:13.080> orange<00:00:13.320> receiver

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
well first I used an orange receiver

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.300 
well first I used an orange receiver
from<00:00:13.980> hobbyking<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.849> bound<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.269> my<00:00:15.480> d.xxi

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:16.310 
from hobbyking and bound it to my d.xxi

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.220 
from hobbyking and bound it to my d.xxi
then<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.340> used<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.789> triple<00:00:17.940> throw<00:00:18.420> switch<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:19.050> run

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
then I used a triple throw switch to run

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.529 
then I used a triple throw switch to run
the<00:00:19.380> stock<00:00:19.650> CG<00:00:20.130> shifting<00:00:20.640> motor<00:00:20.880> by

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
the stock CG shifting motor by

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.359 
the stock CG shifting motor by
connecting<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.619> server<00:00:23.010> with<00:00:23.340> the

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
connecting it to a server with the

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.599 
connecting it to a server with the
center<00:00:23.820> off<00:00:24.230> else<00:00:25.230> used<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.590> 3<00:00:25.769> point<00:00:26.010> 7<00:00:26.400> volt

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
center off else used the 3 point 7 volt

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.269 
center off else used the 3 point 7 volt
500<00:00:27.210> milliamp<00:00:27.630> battery<00:00:27.720> for<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.410> power<00:00:28.650> with

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
500 milliamp battery for the power with

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.759 
500 milliamp battery for the power with
the<00:00:29.400> 68<00:00:29.849> ohm<00:00:30.179> resistor<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.990> compensate<00:00:31.590> for

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
the 68 ohm resistor to compensate for

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.639 
the 68 ohm resistor to compensate for
the<00:00:31.890> voltage<00:00:32.279> increase<00:00:32.759> on<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.660> CG<00:00:34.050> motor<00:00:34.320> it

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
the voltage increase on the CG motor it

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.750 
the voltage increase on the CG motor it
worked<00:00:35.070> perfectly

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
worked perfectly

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.709 
worked perfectly
I<00:00:36.350> also<00:00:37.350> replaced<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.100> rear<00:00:38.370> fin<00:00:38.670> motor<00:00:38.969> with

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
I also replaced the rear fin motor with

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.860 
I also replaced the rear fin motor with
a<00:00:39.750> proportional<00:00:40.620> servo<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.370> had<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.300> add<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.450> fin

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
a proportional servo I had to add a fin

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.170 
a proportional servo I had to add a fin
third<00:00:43.200> wire<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.920> stock<00:00:44.190> 2<00:00:44.430> wire<00:00:44.640> set<00:00:45.030> up

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
third wire to the stock 2 wire set up

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.279 
third wire to the stock 2 wire set up
for<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.719> work

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
for that to work

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.369 
for that to work
I<00:00:46.550> then<00:00:47.550> attached<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:47.969> stock<00:00:48.480> fish<00:00:48.780> fin<00:00:49.050> motor

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
I then attached the stock fish fin motor

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.279 
I then attached the stock fish fin motor
arm<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:50.190> my<00:00:50.399> servo<00:00:50.879> stock<00:00:51.239> arm<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.840> then

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
arm to my servo stock arm and then

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.229 
arm to my servo stock arm and then
fitted<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.829> with<00:00:53.010> double<00:00:53.340> sticky<00:00:53.699> back<00:00:53.910> tape

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
fitted it with double sticky back tape

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.810 
fitted it with double sticky back tape
to<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.629> fin<00:00:54.840> mounting<00:00:55.320> assembly<00:00:55.699> well<00:00:56.699> that

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
to the fin mounting assembly well that

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.450 
to the fin mounting assembly well that
works<00:00:57.000> perfectly<00:00:57.539> -<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.590> always<00:00:58.859> centers

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
works perfectly - and it always centers

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.790 
works perfectly - and it always centers
thus<00:00:59.879> keeping<00:01:00.300> trimming<00:01:00.780> way<00:01:00.960> easier<00:01:01.469> on<00:01:01.649> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
thus keeping trimming way easier on the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.590 
thus keeping trimming way easier on the
fishy

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
fishy

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.780 
fishy
well<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.899> proved<00:01:04.229> just<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.680> bit<00:01:04.890> too<00:01:05.100> heavy<00:01:05.369> so

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
well this proved just a bit too heavy so

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.789 
well this proved just a bit too heavy so
I<00:01:05.820> decided<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.540> make<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:07.080> whole<00:01:07.260> lot<00:01:07.290> lighter

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
I decided to make it a whole lot lighter

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.060 
I decided to make it a whole lot lighter
and<00:01:08.070> simpler<00:01:08.580> by<00:01:08.880> shifting<00:01:09.360> gravity

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
and simpler by shifting gravity

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.490 
and simpler by shifting gravity
proportionately<00:01:11.070> just<00:01:11.880> using<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.360> servo<00:01:12.659> it

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
proportionately just using a servo it

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.649 
proportionately just using a servo it
takes<00:01:13.740> very<00:01:13.979> little<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.520> change<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.850> CG<00:01:15.360> once

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
takes very little to change the CG once

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.450 
takes very little to change the CG once
balanced<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.710> thought<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:16.950> would<00:01:17.159> give<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.340> a

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
balanced so I thought I would give it a

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.830 
balanced so I thought I would give it a
try

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.539 

these<00:01:20.840> Air<00:01:21.079> Swimmers<00:01:21.499> are<00:01:21.679> really<00:01:21.950> touchy<00:01:22.219> for

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
these Air Swimmers are really touchy for

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.569 
these Air Swimmers are really touchy for
the<00:01:22.700> balance<00:01:23.149> you<00:01:24.020> know<00:01:24.170> helium<00:01:24.979> also<00:01:25.369> has

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:25.579 
the balance you know helium also has

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:27.880 
the balance you know helium also has
grades<00:01:25.999> of<00:01:26.270> higher<00:01:26.509> and<00:01:26.840> lower<00:01:27.020> well<00:01:27.740> I<00:01:27.770> think

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
grades of higher and lower well I think

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.730 
grades of higher and lower well I think
mine's<00:01:28.280> okay<00:01:28.759> but<00:01:29.539> after<00:01:29.810> several<00:01:30.079> fillings

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
mine's okay but after several fillings

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.469 
mine's okay but after several fillings
the<00:01:31.009> valve<00:01:31.250> that's<00:01:31.520> on<00:01:31.789> the<00:01:31.969> balloon<00:01:32.209> is<00:01:32.450> just

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
the valve that's on the balloon is just

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.849 
the valve that's on the balloon is just
not<00:01:32.869> as<00:01:33.079> airtight<00:01:33.289> anymore<00:01:34.130> as<00:01:34.249> it<00:01:34.429> used<00:01:34.609> to<00:01:34.729> be

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:35.859 
not as airtight anymore as it used to be

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:39.339 
not as airtight anymore as it used to be
see<00:01:36.859> by<00:01:37.069> adding<00:01:37.579> a<00:01:37.609> little<00:01:38.149> lead<00:01:38.689> shot<00:01:38.990> weight

see by adding a little lead shot weight
here<00:01:39.649> is<00:01:39.890> what<00:01:40.310> I've<00:01:40.429> been<00:01:40.459> doing<00:01:40.849> to<00:01:41.780> my

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
here is what I've been doing to my

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.050 
here is what I've been doing to my
little<00:01:42.770> feeler<00:01:43.099> you<00:01:43.280> can<00:01:43.399> hardly<00:01:43.640> even<00:01:43.789> see

little feeler you can hardly even see

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.849 
little feeler you can hardly even see
this<00:01:44.179> thing<00:01:44.390> when<00:01:44.539> it's<00:01:44.689> flying<00:01:44.990> that's<00:01:45.709> how

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:45.859 
this thing when it's flying that's how

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:47.469 
this thing when it's flying that's how
you<00:01:45.920> get<00:01:46.069> it<00:01:46.189> to<00:01:46.310> balance<00:01:46.490> it's<00:01:46.909> real<00:01:47.119> easy<00:01:47.149> to

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
you get it to balance it's real easy to

00:01:47.479 --> 00:02:04.550 
you get it to balance it's real easy to
do<00:01:48.219> weight<00:01:49.219> goes<00:01:49.429> forward<00:01:49.909> she<00:01:50.149> goes<00:01:50.329> down

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.400 

this<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:07.180> can't<00:02:07.450> do<00:02:07.600> this<00:02:07.780> too<00:02:08.020> many<00:02:08.259> times

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
this you can't do this too many times

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.140 
this you can't do this too many times
folks<00:02:09.160> I've<00:02:10.149> done<00:02:10.420> it<00:02:10.539> already<00:02:10.690> too<00:02:11.140> many<00:02:11.349> and

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
folks I've done it already too many and

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:50.559 
folks I've done it already too many and
it's<00:02:14.069> it's<00:02:15.069> beginning<00:02:15.459> to<00:02:15.610> leak<00:02:15.910> too

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.020 

so<00:02:51.569> here<00:02:51.750> you<00:02:51.840> can<00:02:51.989> see<00:02:52.200> how<00:02:52.349> it<00:02:52.470> works<00:02:53.000> all<00:02:54.000> I

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
so here you can see how it works all I

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.809 
so here you can see how it works all I
do<00:02:54.209> is<00:02:54.540> push<00:02:55.200> forward<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:55.890> see<00:02:56.129> that<00:02:56.310> causes

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
do is push forward and see that causes

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:04.190 
do is push forward and see that causes
her<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.030> tilt<00:02:57.480> in<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:59.090> direction

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.000 

I<00:03:04.230> have<00:03:04.920> a<00:03:04.950> lot<00:03:05.160> more<00:03:05.190> control<00:03:05.550> with<00:03:06.030> this<00:03:07.010> see

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
I have a lot more control with this see

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:28.180 
I have a lot more control with this see
this<00:03:08.250> redder

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.450 

see<00:03:28.850> I<00:03:28.880> have<00:03:29.120> a<00:03:29.150> whole<00:03:29.390> lot<00:03:29.660> more<00:03:29.720> control<00:03:30.460> with

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:31.460 
see I have a whole lot more control with

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:37.720 
see I have a whole lot more control with
my<00:03:31.730> rudder<00:03:32.450> I<00:03:32.890> mean<00:03:33.890> my<00:03:34.100> tail<00:03:34.400> fin<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:36.730> also

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
my rudder I mean my tail fin and also

00:03:37.730 --> 00:04:08.900 
my rudder I mean my tail fin and also
the<00:03:37.910> up<00:03:38.030> and<00:03:38.240> down

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.150 

and<00:04:09.910> it's<00:04:10.240> a<00:04:10.330> whole<00:04:10.510> lot<00:04:10.540> lighter<00:04:11.020> and<00:04:11.380> all

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
and it's a whole lot lighter and all

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.340 
and it's a whole lot lighter and all
that<00:04:12.460> simpler<00:04:12.880> I'm<00:04:13.000> using<00:04:13.210> a<00:04:13.390> 500<00:04:13.930> milliamp

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
that simpler I'm using a 500 milliamp

00:04:14.350 --> 00:05:01.540 
that simpler I'm using a 500 milliamp
lipo<00:04:14.890> I<00:04:15.280> can<00:04:15.820> recharge<00:04:16.239> it

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.930 

come<00:05:02.150> on<00:05:02.270> Ellen

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
come on Ellen

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:16.720 
come on Ellen
a<00:05:04.030> good<00:05:04.780> girl<00:05:08.430> planning

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.120 

now<00:05:17.390> that<00:05:17.630> I<00:05:17.810> know<00:05:17.870> it<00:05:18.110> works<00:05:18.380> I've<00:05:18.710> made<00:05:19.100> a

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
now that I know it works I've made a

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.790 
now that I know it works I've made a
little<00:05:19.420> module<00:05:20.420> so<00:05:20.660> I<00:05:20.690> can<00:05:20.960> just<00:05:21.140> tape<00:05:21.650> it

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
little module so I can just tape it

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
little module so I can just tape it
right<00:05:21.860> on<00:05:22.280> the<00:05:23.090> CG<00:05:24.190> in<00:05:25.190> case<00:05:25.370> you<00:05:25.490> missed<00:05:25.730> it

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
right on the CG in case you missed it

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.700 
right on the CG in case you missed it
here's<00:05:26.060> how<00:05:26.270> it<00:05:26.360> works<00:05:26.570> again<00:05:26.930> my<00:05:27.110> forward<00:05:27.440> and

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
here's how it works again my forward and

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.430 
here's how it works again my forward and
backward<00:05:28.190> is<00:05:28.370> just<00:05:28.640> shifts<00:05:28.970> the<00:05:29.030> weight

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
backward is just shifts the weight

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:38.700 
backward is just shifts the weight
forward<00:05:30.440> and<00:05:30.740> backward<00:05:31.190> just<00:05:31.760> like<00:05:31.940> that

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.840 

I<00:05:39.300> can<00:05:40.300> trim<00:05:40.570> the<00:05:40.660> proper<00:05:41.590> flight<00:05:41.890> when<00:05:42.760> you

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
I can trim the proper flight when you

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.520 
I can trim the proper flight when you
let<00:05:43.000> go<00:05:43.150> of<00:05:43.180> it<00:05:43.360> it<00:05:43.450> goes<00:05:43.570> back<00:05:43.630> to<00:05:43.960> Center<00:05:44.290> I

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
let go of it it goes back to Center I

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.590 
let go of it it goes back to Center I
think<00:05:45.220> this<00:05:45.550> is<00:05:45.640> a<00:05:45.700> much<00:05:45.880> better<00:05:46.090> control

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
think this is a much better control

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:52.760 
think this is a much better control
system<00:05:47.730> there<00:05:48.730> you<00:05:48.910> go

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.530 

well<00:05:53.770> I'm<00:05:53.920> ready<00:05:54.070> for<00:05:54.340> the<00:05:54.460> next<00:05:54.670> race<00:05:54.910> I<00:05:55.270> mean

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.540 
well I'm ready for the next race I mean

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.450 
well I'm ready for the next race I mean
no<00:05:55.660> I<00:05:55.690> have<00:05:55.900> the<00:05:56.080> fastest<00:05:56.500> fishing<00:05:56.860> but<00:05:57.370> I

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
no I have the fastest fishing but I

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.050 
no I have the fastest fishing but I
could<00:05:57.640> sure<00:05:57.820> control<00:05:58.150> it<00:05:58.360> very<00:05:58.600> well<00:05:58.780> now
