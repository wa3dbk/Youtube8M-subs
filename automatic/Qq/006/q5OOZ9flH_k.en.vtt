loop that we had created before so let
me<00:01:44.280> make<00:01:45.060> sure<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.270> guys<00:01:45.540> didn't<00:01:45.840> see<00:01:45.869> moves

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
me make sure you guys didn't see moves

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.340 
me make sure you guys didn't see moves
out<00:01:46.590> lighting<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:47.009> little<00:01:47.159> bit<00:01:48.259> hopefully<00:01:49.259> you

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
out lighting a little bit hopefully you

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.700 
out lighting a little bit hopefully you
guys<00:01:49.470> can<00:01:49.530> see<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:50.100> well<00:01:50.750> okay<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:51.810> from<00:01:52.320> here

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
guys can see that well okay so from here

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.850 
guys can see that well okay so from here
I'm<00:01:53.130> going<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.610> now<00:01:53.790> take<00:01:53.850> my<00:01:54.450> tail<00:01:55.409> enter<00:01:55.710> the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
I'm going to now take my tail enter the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.679 
I'm going to now take my tail enter the
knot<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.280> place<00:01:56.490> just<00:01:56.909> right<00:01:57.270> through<00:01:57.509> this

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
knot and place just right through this

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.580 
knot and place just right through this
little<00:01:58.619> loop<00:01:58.890> here

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:10.040 

so<00:02:04.590> now<00:02:04.800> we<00:02:04.860> are<00:02:06.440> up<00:02:08.030> around<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.780> through

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
so now we are up around and through

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.850 
so now we are up around and through
again<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:12.750> now<00:02:12.930> I'm<00:02:13.020> gonna<00:02:13.170> go<00:02:13.410> ahead<00:02:13.680> and

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
again and now I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:21.230 
again and now I'm gonna go ahead and
bring<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:15.110> up<00:02:16.110> underneath<00:02:16.800> there<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:20.240> just

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
bring it up underneath there so just

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.000 
bring it up underneath there so just
like<00:02:21.890> that<00:02:23.810> it's<00:02:24.810> trying<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.140> come<00:02:25.350> there<00:02:25.740> we

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
like that it's trying to come there we

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.390 
like that it's trying to come there we
go<00:02:26.480> okay<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:27.510> we've<00:02:27.810> got<00:02:27.840> our<00:02:28.320> shake<00:02:28.710> there<00:02:28.950> now

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
go okay so we've got our shake there now

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.980 
go okay so we've got our shake there now
from<00:02:29.520> here<00:02:29.910> this<00:02:30.210> is<00:02:30.270> pretty<00:02:30.570> much<00:02:30.660> like<00:02:30.750> the

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
from here this is pretty much like the

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.810 
from here this is pretty much like the
four<00:02:31.200> rings<00:02:31.380> all<00:02:31.590> in<00:02:31.680> differences<00:02:32.160> everything

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
four rings all in differences everything

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.880 
four rings all in differences everything
has<00:02:32.940> folded<00:02:33.150> up<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:33.720> if<00:02:34.020> you<00:02:34.440> like<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.710> four

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
has folded up so if you like the four

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.050 
has folded up so if you like the four
rings<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.190> you<00:02:35.250> just<00:02:35.370> wanted<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:35.640> try<00:02:35.820> it<00:02:35.850> with

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
rings and you just wanted to try it with

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.370 
rings and you just wanted to try it with
the<00:02:36.180> ins<00:02:36.330> folded<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:36.900> could<00:02:37.050> leave<00:02:37.200> it<00:02:37.350> just

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
the ins folded you could leave it just

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.630 
the ins folded you could leave it just
like<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:37.860> here<00:02:38.600> but<00:02:39.600> I<00:02:39.900> am<00:02:40.260> NOT<00:02:41.160> trying<00:02:41.490> to

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
like this here but I am NOT trying to

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.040 
like this here but I am NOT trying to
wear<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.790> four<00:02:42.060> rings<00:02:42.240> not<00:02:42.570> today<00:02:42.900> because

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
wear the four rings not today because

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.530 
wear the four rings not today because
this<00:02:43.470> is<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.650> different<00:02:44.160> nut<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:45.090> I'm<00:02:45.240> going<00:02:45.480> to

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
this is a different nut so I'm going to

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.570 
this is a different nut so I'm going to
now<00:02:45.780> go<00:02:45.840> ahead<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.410> bring<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.040> tail<00:02:47.340> and

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
now go ahead and bring the tail and

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.460 
now go ahead and bring the tail and
around<00:02:48.270> the<00:02:48.390> back<00:02:48.570> back<00:02:48.930> around<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.320> left

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
around the back back around the left

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.880 
around the back back around the left
side<00:02:49.590> we're<00:02:50.459> gonna<00:02:50.550> come<00:02:50.820> up<00:02:51.090> on<00:02:51.709> the<00:02:52.709> right

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
side we're gonna come up on the right

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.000 
side we're gonna come up on the right
side<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.550> through<00:02:53.850> this<00:02:54.120> loop<00:02:54.450> again<00:02:54.900> here

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.680 

there<00:02:59.010> we<00:02:59.160> go

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.190 

yes<00:03:04.530> if<00:03:05.130> I<00:03:05.220> can<00:03:05.370> pack<00:03:05.640> that<00:03:05.910> uh<00:03:05.970> we're<00:03:06.810> gonna<00:03:06.960> go

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200

it up something I can you guys know me

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.480

I'm all about wearing it loose and so

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.700 
I'm all about wearing it loose and so
then<00:03:20.670> I<00:03:20.760> would<00:03:20.820> just<00:03:20.940> lightly<00:03:21.810> tuck<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.500> end

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
then I would just lightly tuck the end

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.040 
then I would just lightly tuck the end
up<00:03:23.370> under<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:23.820> collar<00:03:24.120> there<00:03:24.360> and<00:03:24.630> when<00:03:24.750> I<00:03:24.780> go

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
up under the collar there and when I go

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.900 
up under the collar there and when I go
to<00:03:25.110> adjust<00:03:25.620> it<00:03:25.950> pretty<00:03:26.340> much<00:03:26.550> make<00:03:26.880> sure

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
to adjust it pretty much make sure

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.890 
to adjust it pretty much make sure
everything<00:03:27.540> stays<00:03:27.870> in<00:03:28.140> place<00:03:32.420> so<00:03:33.420> then<00:03:33.570> we<00:03:33.660> end

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
everything stays in place so then we end

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.130 
everything stays in place so then we end
up<00:03:34.050> with<00:03:34.110> that<00:03:35.480> serpentine<00:03:36.480> type<00:03:36.900> of<00:03:37.020> look

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140
