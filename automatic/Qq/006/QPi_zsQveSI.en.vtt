how to fix corrupted video files I used
to<00:00:23.010> do<00:00:23.100> this<00:00:23.189> all<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.400> time<00:00:23.490> until<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.119> tweaked

if<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:25.550> land<00:00:26.550> your<00:00:26.970> vision<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.779> switch<00:00:28.439> the

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
if you land your vision and switch the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.770 
if you land your vision and switch the
power<00:00:30.000> off<00:00:30.500> without<00:00:32.600> stopping<00:00:33.600> recording

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
power off without stopping recording

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.740 
power off without stopping recording
with<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.530> app<00:00:34.649> first<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.969> video<00:00:36.360> file<00:00:36.719> that

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
with the app first the video file that

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.080 
with the app first the video file that
you're<00:00:37.050> currently<00:00:37.550> actively<00:00:38.550> recording

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
you're currently actively recording

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.569 
you're currently actively recording
can't<00:00:39.390> finalize<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.950> won't<00:00:41.129> be<00:00:41.340> read

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
can't finalize and so it won't be read

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.490 
can't finalize and so it won't be read
so<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:41.910> take<00:00:42.180> your<00:00:42.210> SD<00:00:42.600> card<00:00:42.870> out<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.050> load<00:00:43.290> up

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
so you take your SD card out you load up

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.950 
so you take your SD card out you load up
now<00:00:43.550> why<00:00:44.550> can't<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:44.879> see<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.210> or<00:00:45.329> it's<00:00:45.450> corrupted

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
now why can't I see it or it's corrupted

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.900 
now why can't I see it or it's corrupted
and<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.590> used<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.890> just<00:00:47.070> think<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.640> was<00:00:47.700> one<00:00:47.850> of

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
and I used to just think it was one of

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.619 
and I used to just think it was one of
those<00:00:48.030> things<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.780> sort<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.140> get<00:00:49.950> rid<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.129> it

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
those things and sort of get rid of it

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.970 
those things and sort of get rid of it

you<00:01:17.070> know<00:01:17.159> as<00:01:17.369> long<00:01:17.430> as<00:01:17.490> you've<00:01:17.640> got<00:01:17.670> props<00:01:18.000> off

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
you know as long as you've got props off

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.050 
you know as long as you've got props off
for<00:01:18.509> safety<00:01:18.869> obviously<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.320> case<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:20.060> just

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
for safety obviously in case it just

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.910 
for safety obviously in case it just
leave<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.140> sitting<00:01:22.290> there<00:01:22.409> for<00:01:22.619> about<00:01:22.650> 30

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
leave it sitting there for about 30

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.539 
leave it sitting there for about 30
seconds<00:01:23.520> maybe<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.759> minute<00:01:24.229> power<00:01:25.229> down<00:01:25.560> when

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
seconds maybe a minute power down when

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.550 
seconds maybe a minute power down when
you<00:01:26.640> remove<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.060> SD<00:01:27.210> card<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.840> will<00:01:27.930> find<00:01:28.320> it

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
you remove the SD card you will find it

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.370 
you remove the SD card you will find it
has<00:01:28.740> fixed<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.549> corrupted<00:01:30.000> file<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:31.170> only

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
has fixed that corrupted file the only

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.810 
has fixed that corrupted file the only
downside<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.070> will<00:01:32.189> lose<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.640> last

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
downside is you will lose the last

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.749 
downside is you will lose the last
several<00:01:33.630> seconds<00:01:34.110> it's<00:01:34.229> about<00:01:34.530> seven<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.490> 10

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
several seconds it's about seven to 10

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.460 
several seconds it's about seven to 10
seconds<00:01:36.530> you'll<00:01:37.530> lose<00:01:37.970> so<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.150> usually<00:01:39.659> if

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
seconds you'll lose so that usually if

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.770 
seconds you'll lose so that usually if
you<00:01:40.740> want<00:01:41.130> some<00:01:41.310> cool<00:01:41.670> crash<00:01:42.119> footage<00:01:42.540> that

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
you want some cool crash footage that

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.420 
you want some cool crash footage that
usually<00:01:43.259> might<00:01:43.470> include<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.979> crash<00:01:44.189> if<00:01:44.340> you

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
usually might include the crash if you

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.429 
usually might include the crash if you
weren't<00:01:44.579> able<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.540> get<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.229> switch

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
weren't able to to get to it to switch

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.240 
weren't able to to get to it to switch
the<00:01:46.590> recording<00:01:47.399> off<00:01:47.490> by<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.700> app<00:01:48.829> the<00:01:49.829> the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
the recording off by the app the the

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.380 
the recording off by the app the the
other<00:01:50.640> thing<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:50.880> will<00:01:50.970> do<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.270> will<00:01:51.299> give

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
other thing it will do is it will give

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.280 
other thing it will do is it will give
it<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.689> very<00:01:51.899> bizarre<00:01:53.360> date<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.600> time<00:01:54.810> stamp<00:01:55.140> on

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
it a very bizarre date and time stamp on

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.889 
it a very bizarre date and time stamp on
it<00:01:55.439> something<00:01:55.590> like<00:01:55.710> 2008<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:57.270> for<00:01:57.509> ages<00:01:57.810> I

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
it something like 2008 so for ages I

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.090 
it something like 2008 so for ages I
couldn't<00:01:58.200> find<00:01:58.350> any<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.560> these<00:01:58.649> corrected

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
couldn't find any of these corrected

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.889 
couldn't find any of these corrected
ones<00:01:59.250> because<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.610> was<00:01:59.759> looking<00:01:59.969> at<00:02:00.060> all<00:02:00.149> my<00:02:00.180> all

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899
