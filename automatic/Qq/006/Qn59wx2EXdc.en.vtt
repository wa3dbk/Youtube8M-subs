00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.229
 it's an osteopath for horses but 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.070
 I mean that's not the rule 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:54.670
 general for all 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.839
 Farriers tell him it's because 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.159
 that I did a training to be 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:59.049
 equine osteopath 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:02.289
 I must say that I am a son and 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:04.869
 training at the base so that's my 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:09.430
 thil job and that led me to do 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:10.330
 this specialization of zero that if you 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.090
 are in the cradle of the breed 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.500
 Ardennes is so there is you 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.960
 will encounter more art given than 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.149
 everywhere else which is normal but 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.710
 it's true that even in the Ardennes 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:22.720
 there are several types of horses there are 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.979
 the heavier we have the biggest 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.630
 there are some finer for the hitch 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.399
 so there are some models a little bit 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.940
 different depending on the use 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.940
 that people are doing 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.950
 at this time it's all this rise 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.650
 is riding four years so that's 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.960
 a young mare that has just been devoured 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.890
 so we're busy trimming the foot 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.420
 the horn surplus 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.470
 there is not much to cut because 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.300
 she worked a little bit feet 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.190
 naked but so now we put him his 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.200
 first make an effect be adapted in 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.610
 size function according to the 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.220
 template of the fold we will choose a 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.800
 section make slightly thicker 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.160
 or less a test depending on the job 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.850
 so so here I have prepared myself to do 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.620
 So the owner sent me the marc 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.330
 foot dimensions in advance i 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.160
 prepared my irons at the forge in advance 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.570
 so is here now I'm going to go 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.160
 prepare to do it to put it on 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.860
 turn therefore exactly to the shape of the 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.150
 foot with irons like those who have 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.030
 a fairly important section 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.010
 works on coal to travel to 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.989
 work in gas link here rooney at 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.940
 coal I say that allows for good 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.800
 heat a farm there I put it on 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.030
 world tour that corresponds 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.030
 perfectly at the foot of the horse 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:57.660
 the neighborhood still a little bit there 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.980
 there is a Tetouan thing the dread not of 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.340
 pain the agreement does not lead the 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.850
 heat 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.980
 of course so exaggerated and that I posed 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.290
 for an hour we would be able to melt 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.620
 the agreement but closed southern males 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.120
 but means a priori not horses 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.520
 who lands for can do several 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.960
 is raging with the same pair to do 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.770
 on the other hand horses that need to 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.410
 hitch on the road 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.640
 Ben systematically in the traded more 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:28.170
 regularly because he plays on the 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:29.430
 road what in the finishes your 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:36.720
 opportunities for nails 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:38.880
 perfectly everything that is care of 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.230
 the horse's foot I mean there's nothing to 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.490
 do it our job so I'm going 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.060
 to say that too that's part of it 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:48.990
 So here we are 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.420
 nice but so that's nothing 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.910
 serious in itself it's not a problem 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.650
 hygiene a priori either so it's 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.780
 just that there are degraded parts of 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.459
 the fork that is softer you 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.140
 see so I was scraped until 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.720
 that I find the most 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.050
 impossible so well I'll tell them 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.250
 most degraded parts besson i want 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:14.880
 say a favorite food for hours 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:16.560
 this kind of questions as you see 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.040
 the horse does not hurt him he gets 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.410
 does not realize that they carry 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.060
 clandestine he suffers more from the co 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.160
 rot progress further he suffers 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.600
 of rot by maggots so 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.940
 their hands little dots 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.340
 tungsten to prevent it from slipping 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.880
 on the asphalt I would say there are some 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.570
 accidents have it's a metal that is 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.570
 extremely hard 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.599
 and so that that and quickly 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.639
 it's the old nail tire system 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:51.190
 it is also the same matter 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:53.889
 conceding in the small point of the tires 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.610
 to nails and so it does not 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:56.610
 slide on the slope
