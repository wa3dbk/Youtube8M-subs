00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
powder sits on the scalp and you're

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.950 
powder sits on the scalp and you're
patting<00:01:56.969> down<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.299> kind<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.450> moves<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.810> so

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
patting down it kind of moves this so

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.429 
patting down it kind of moves this so
sometimes<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.350> gotta<00:01:58.469> like<00:01:59.899> reuse<00:02:00.899> lost<00:02:01.200> some
