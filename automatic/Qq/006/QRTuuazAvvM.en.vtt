this<00:02:13.290> crazy<00:02:13.710> leap<00:02:14.130> of<00:02:14.280> faith<00:02:14.490> that<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:14.760> survived

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
this crazy leap of faith that I survived

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:26.750 
this crazy leap of faith that I survived
you're<00:02:15.420> not<00:02:15.570> even<00:02:15.780> gonna<00:02:15.930> believe<00:02:16.110> this

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.140 

what<00:02:27.760> was<00:02:28.060> that<00:02:28.329> I<00:02:28.390> felt<00:02:28.930> like<00:02:29.280> 200<00:02:30.280> feet<00:02:30.730> and

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
what was that I felt like 200 feet and

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.270 
what was that I felt like 200 feet and
the<00:02:31.659> platform<00:02:32.319> just<00:02:32.379> happened<00:02:33.069> to<00:02:33.159> have

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
the platform just happened to have

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.360 
the platform just happened to have
picked<00:02:33.579> me<00:02:33.790> up<00:02:33.819> I<00:02:34.180> mean<00:02:34.629> if<00:02:34.870> I<00:02:35.079> was<00:02:35.349> point<00:02:35.860> zero

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
picked me up I mean if I was point zero

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.910 
picked me up I mean if I was point zero
zero<00:02:36.489> one<00:02:37.000> of<00:02:37.420> a<00:02:37.480> second<00:02:37.900> off<00:02:38.049> I<00:02:38.319> would<00:02:38.799> have

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
zero one of a second off I would have

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.970 
zero one of a second off I would have
landed<00:02:39.400> wide<00:02:39.790> on<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.299> spikes<00:02:40.720> also<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.590> point

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
landed wide on the spikes also the point

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.470 
landed wide on the spikes also the point
of<00:02:42.099> the<00:02:42.220> game<00:02:42.370> is<00:02:42.489> a<00:02:42.519> little<00:02:42.790> unclear<00:02:43.180> it's

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
of the game is a little unclear it's

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.330 
of the game is a little unclear it's
like<00:02:43.659> you're<00:02:43.840> told<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.349> go<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.799> left<00:02:44.950> pick

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
like you're told to go to the left pick

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.250 
like you're told to go to the left pick
something<00:02:45.760> up<00:02:45.909> go<00:02:46.239> to<00:02:46.269> the<00:02:46.450> right<00:02:46.810> fight

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
something up go to the right fight

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.110 
something up go to the right fight
someone<00:02:47.739> but<00:02:47.980> it's<00:02:48.099> very<00:02:48.400> vague<00:02:48.790> because

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
someone but it's very vague because

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.270 
someone but it's very vague because
obviously<00:02:49.510> there's<00:02:50.049> levels<00:02:50.590> it's<00:02:50.829> not<00:02:51.040> just

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
obviously there's levels it's not just

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.550 
obviously there's levels it's not just
going<00:02:51.430> left<00:02:51.760> and<00:02:51.970> right<00:02:52.090> going<00:02:52.989> to<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.319> left

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
going left and right going to the left

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.559 
going left and right going to the left
could<00:02:53.859> mean<00:02:54.040> going<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.459> left<00:02:54.730> on<00:02:54.970> top<00:02:55.239> of<00:02:55.480> a

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
could mean going to the left on top of a

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.720 
could mean going to the left on top of a
mountain<00:02:55.780> or<00:02:56.139> beneath<00:02:57.010> on<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.340> ground

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
mountain or beneath on the ground

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.430 
mountain or beneath on the ground
somewhere<00:02:58.090> there's<00:02:58.720> a<00:02:58.780> lot<00:02:59.079> of<00:02:59.230> just

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
somewhere there's a lot of just

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.410 
somewhere there's a lot of just
aimlessly<00:03:00.040> walking<00:03:00.489> around<00:03:01.000> this<00:03:01.239> game

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
aimlessly walking around this game

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.990 
aimlessly walking around this game
because<00:03:01.780> you<00:03:02.079> will<00:03:02.319> not<00:03:02.680> find<00:03:02.739> out<00:03:03.430> where<00:03:03.819> to

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
because you will not find out where to

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.780 
because you will not find out where to
go<00:03:04.180> in<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:04.959> first<00:03:05.319> try<00:03:05.680> or<00:03:05.709> the<00:03:06.010> second<00:03:06.430> try<00:03:06.609> or

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
go in the first try or the second try or

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.309 
go in the first try or the second try or
even<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:07.209> third<00:03:07.239> try

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
even the third try

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.860 
even the third try
look<00:03:08.590> Galahad<00:03:09.190> is<00:03:09.220> not<00:03:09.700> a<00:03:09.730> bad<00:03:10.060> game<00:03:10.299> but<00:03:10.510> it<00:03:10.659> is

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
look Galahad is not a bad game but it is

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.470 
look Galahad is not a bad game but it is
really<00:03:11.409> difficult<00:03:11.709> to<00:03:12.430> play<00:03:12.730> at<00:03:12.909> your<00:03:13.120> own

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
really difficult to play at your own

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.220 
really difficult to play at your own
