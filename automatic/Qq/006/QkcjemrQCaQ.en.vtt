or<00:01:57.910> paint<00:01:58.119> it<00:01:58.270> black<00:01:58.479> but<00:01:58.660> they<00:01:58.780> didn't<00:01:59.110> choose

00:01:59.309 --> 00:01:59.319 
or paint it black but they didn't choose

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.180 
or paint it black but they didn't choose
to<00:01:59.349> but<00:02:00.099> oh<00:02:00.130> well<00:02:00.720> so<00:02:01.720> is<00:02:01.959> a<00:02:02.200> one<00:02:02.679> weight<00:02:02.920> back

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
to but oh well so is a one weight back

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.440 
to but oh well so is a one weight back
so<00:02:03.429> that<00:02:03.550> means<00:02:03.759> obviously<00:02:04.060> if<00:02:04.119> you<00:02:04.209> fan<00:02:04.420> it

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
so that means obviously if you fan it

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.630 
so that means obviously if you fan it
one<00:02:04.750> way<00:02:04.959> you'll<00:02:05.770> get<00:02:05.979> a<00:02:06.009> different<00:02:06.250> type<00:02:06.610> of

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
one way you'll get a different type of

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.339 
one way you'll get a different type of
thing<00:02:07.000> because<00:02:07.330> of<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:07.509> just<00:02:07.929> because<00:02:08.170> of<00:02:08.289> the

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
thing because of the just because of the

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.290 
thing because of the just because of the
text<00:02:08.770> really<00:02:09.009> but<00:02:09.340> it<00:02:09.729> doesn't<00:02:09.970> really<00:02:10.060> matter

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
text really but it doesn't really matter

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.390 
text really but it doesn't really matter
but<00:02:10.750> it<00:02:10.929> is<00:02:11.230> one<00:02:11.470> way<00:02:11.500> back<00:02:11.920> because<00:02:12.160> it's<00:02:12.310> as

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
but it is one way back because it's as

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.670 
but it is one way back because it's as
an<00:02:12.580> Stokes<00:02:12.940> collection<00:02:13.480> so<00:02:14.290> as<00:02:14.470> we're<00:02:14.650> looking

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
an Stokes collection so as we're looking

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.800 
an Stokes collection so as we're looking
at<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:14.980> back<00:02:15.130> design<00:02:15.310> it<00:02:15.610> has<00:02:15.700> a<00:02:15.760> black<00:02:16.180> border

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
at the back design it has a black border

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.650 
at the back design it has a black border
so<00:02:17.080> as<00:02:17.260> that<00:02:17.500> means<00:02:17.680> it<00:02:18.069> is<00:02:18.099> a<00:02:18.459> full<00:02:19.120> bleed

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
so as that means it is a full bleed

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.750 
so as that means it is a full bleed
death<00:02:20.170> it<00:02:20.470> has<00:02:20.590> an<00:02:20.800> Stokes<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.520> it<00:02:21.640> has<00:02:21.730> a

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
death it has an Stokes and it has a

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.309 
death it has an Stokes and it has a
dragon<00:02:22.060> there<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:22.420> has<00:02:22.510> collection<00:02:23.110> and

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
dragon there and has collection and

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.839 
dragon there and has collection and
there's<00:02:23.650> a<00:02:23.739> nice<00:02:23.860> scrollwork<00:02:24.310> patterns<00:02:24.730> in

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
there's a nice scrollwork patterns in

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.610 
there's a nice scrollwork patterns in
the<00:02:24.940> corners<00:02:25.330> there<00:02:25.569> and<00:02:25.810> it's<00:02:26.140> just<00:02:26.260> a<00:02:26.349> really

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
the corners there and it's just a really

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.289 
the corners there and it's just a really
really<00:02:26.800> detailed<00:02:27.489> back<00:02:27.700> because<00:02:27.909> I'm<00:02:28.090> with

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
really detailed back because I'm with

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:29.490 
really detailed back because I'm with
the<00:02:28.390> scrollwork<00:02:28.840> I<00:02:28.989> like<00:02:29.140> that

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
the scrollwork I like that

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.959 
the scrollwork I like that
everything<00:02:30.040> else<00:02:30.219> is<00:02:30.400> just<00:02:30.459> like<00:02:30.670> kind<00:02:30.879> of

everything else is just like kind of

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:32.050 
everything else is just like kind of
plain<00:02:31.299> there

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
plain there

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.170 
plain there
is<00:02:32.150> a<00:02:32.270> full-bleed<00:02:32.870> deck<00:02:33.230> okay<00:02:33.910> then<00:02:34.910> you<00:02:35.030> move

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
is a full-bleed deck okay then you move

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.880 
is a full-bleed deck okay then you move
on<00:02:35.300> to<00:02:35.420> this<00:02:35.540> card<00:02:35.750> it's<00:02:35.989> just<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.260> you<00:02:36.739> know

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
on to this card it's just the you know

same Joker it just has extra on it and
all<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.319> pips<00:03:03.800> when<00:03:03.980> you've<00:03:04.069> got<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.220> whole

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
all the pips when you've got the whole

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.130 
all the pips when you've got the whole
way<00:03:04.370> through<00:03:04.400> have<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:05.209> like<00:03:05.630> it<00:03:05.870> has<00:03:06.019> this

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
way through have the like it has this

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.559 
way through have the like it has this
white<00:03:06.440> kind<00:03:06.709> of<00:03:06.769> bar<00:03:06.980> like<00:03:07.190> fades<00:03:07.519> in<00:03:07.910> and<00:03:08.390> it

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
white kind of bar like fades in and it

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:09.759 
white kind of bar like fades in and it
goes<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:08.810> whole<00:03:08.959> way<00:03:09.019> through<00:03:09.140> so<00:03:09.560> when<00:03:09.680> you

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
goes the whole way through so when you

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.220 
goes the whole way through so when you
do<00:03:09.890> like<00:03:10.040> a<00:03:10.069> fan<00:03:10.430> this<00:03:11.269> way<00:03:11.510> you<00:03:11.569> get<00:03:11.959> kind<00:03:12.200> of

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
do like a fan this way you get kind of

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.130 
do like a fan this way you get kind of
this<00:03:12.580> white<00:03:13.580> like<00:03:14.150> kind<00:03:14.330> of<00:03:14.390> cloud<00:03:14.720> there<00:03:14.989> if

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
this white like kind of cloud there if

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.530 
this white like kind of cloud there if
you<00:03:15.230> do<00:03:15.319> it<00:03:15.410> that<00:03:15.560> way<00:03:15.860> whoops<00:03:16.730> if<00:03:17.209> you<00:03:17.299> do<00:03:17.420> it

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
you do it that way whoops if you do it

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.380 
you do it that way whoops if you do it
that<00:03:17.690> way<00:03:17.930> and<00:03:18.340> it<00:03:19.340> kind<00:03:19.700> of<00:03:19.819> does<00:03:20.060> that<00:03:20.269> as
