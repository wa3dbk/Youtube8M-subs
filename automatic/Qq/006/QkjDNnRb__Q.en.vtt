00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.060
 the former mayor bendjo claimed 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.650
 today new video of 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.489
 video presentation presenting us 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.149
 Graphic card 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:34.149
 this is an era 9 390 x which we 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:38.170
 comes from xfx in its edition of the 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:41.170
 that the map has 8 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.659
 gigabytes of gddr 5 1 so as a reminder 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.059
 this is the evolution elsewhere 9 290 x and 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:48.250
 there already existed tunes our 290 x 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.350
 with hui i opted for gddr5 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.780
 so we will try to find out if 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.100
 the happy naming is interesting for 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.890
 the customer in terms of good news 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.119
 past performance normally 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.460
 the architect much better mastered in 

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:03.309
 terms of production so we can 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.530
 hoping for a bone is more consequent and 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.890
 so we will discover the graphics card 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.570
 what interests us really here 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.820
 so the cac and his manolo level the 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:18.070
 bundle one has a 6-pin adapter a 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:21.280
 adapter the tool a booklet and both 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.110
 classic dvd with drivers at 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.909
 map level lets you discover 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.450
 look and we see the heat pipes in 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.840
 copper 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.920
 at the back there are two fans 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.479
 90 mm to ensure cooling 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.950
 the card rather well finished even though the 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.780
 quiet is plastic but it's 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.149
 plastic of very good quality a priori 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.630
 Here again we see the heat pipes in 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:42.549
 copper 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.719
 in the back we find a very beautiful 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:48.670
 backplate at the video outputs on 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:52.479
 find two outputs dvi output hdmi 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.530
 a display output port the set is 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.969
 rather very pleasant to the eye 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.119
 the map will therefore logically need 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:04.420
 of a pineda pineda 8 pin to work 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:07.840
 at the level of gpu we find the whey in 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:12.610
 28 nanometer 2008 constantly stream 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:15.280
 processor 64 up and 176 its enemies the 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.480
 card has 8 gigabytes of gddr5 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.680
 in 512 bits 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:25.150
 the gpu is at 1090 me wers and the memory 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.110
 at 6 lierse the map is 25 cm long 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.230
 9 points 5 cm 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.030
 oh and 3 cm of money she is announced 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.250
 at the price of 467 euros 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.890
 so here we are going to make you a very test 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.970
 quickly and wanted to deliver in stride 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.970
 this is goodbye
