lot<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.320> intuition<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.579> just<00:00:41.899> letting<00:00:42.899> just

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
lot in intuition and just letting just

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.690 
lot in intuition and just letting just
pure<00:00:43.739> whatever<00:00:44.280> come<00:00:44.670> through<00:00:46.430> we<00:00:47.430> really

creative<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:05.689> guess<00:01:06.689> our<00:01:06.840> sound<00:01:07.200> it's

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
creative I guess our sound it's

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.859 
creative I guess our sound it's
different<00:01:07.920> because<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.520> our<00:01:08.610> taste<00:01:09.330> really

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
different because of our taste really

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.140 
different because of our taste really
it's<00:01:10.590> all<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:10.830> an<00:01:11.220> effort<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.549> try<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:11.909> make

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
it's all in an effort to try to make

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.670 
it's all in an effort to try to make
something<00:01:12.420> different<00:01:13.049> but<00:01:13.200> something<00:01:13.560> that

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
something different but something that

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:30.880 
something different but something that
we<00:01:13.799> all<00:01:13.830> like

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890

shooting rubberbands the Stars basically

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.010 
shooting rubberbands the Stars basically
expresses<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:36.060> way<00:01:36.209> I<00:01:36.240> felt<00:01:36.569> when<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.810> first

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
expresses the way I felt when I first

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.779

I<00:01:41.310> when<00:01:41.789> I<00:01:41.819> look<00:01:42.030> back<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.719> think<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:43.349> I

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
I when I look back on it I think of I

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:46.190

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
songwriting with my career with my life

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.219 
songwriting with my career with my life
I<00:04:36.639> just<00:04:36.789> want<00:04:36.969> to<00:04:37.060> get<00:04:37.270> up<00:04:37.509> in<00:04:37.749> the<00:04:37.870> morning<00:04:38.199> and

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
I just want to get up in the morning and

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.499 
I just want to get up in the morning and
get<00:04:38.650> up<00:04:38.800> quick<00:04:39.159> and<00:04:39.189> do<00:04:39.639> something<00:04:40.240> and<00:04:40.360> do

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 
get up quick and do something and do

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:41.850 
get up quick and do something and do
something<00:04:40.539> that<00:04:40.930> means<00:04:41.169> something<00:04:41.409> to<00:04:41.710> myself

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
something that means something to myself

00:04:41.860 --> 00:05:01.809 
something that means something to myself
and<00:04:42.370> hopefully<00:04:43.180> to<00:04:43.509> other<00:04:43.659> people

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:01.819 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:05.989 

so<00:05:02.819> the<00:05:02.969> wheel<00:05:03.150> was<00:05:03.360> a<00:05:03.389> song<00:05:03.719> of<00:05:04.759> strength<00:05:05.759> in

00:05:05.989 --> 00:05:05.999 
so the wheel was a song of strength in

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:08.719 
so the wheel was a song of strength in
who<00:05:06.300> you<00:05:06.360> are<00:05:06.479> and<00:05:07.139> what<00:05:07.319> you're<00:05:07.499> about<00:05:07.729> right

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
who you are and what you're about right

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:10.549 
who you are and what you're about right
you<00:05:08.999> feel<00:05:09.629> like<00:05:09.749> you're<00:05:09.899> in<00:05:09.960> the<00:05:10.020> world<00:05:10.229> to<00:05:10.409> do

00:05:10.549 --> 00:05:10.559 
you feel like you're in the world to do

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:13.189 
you feel like you're in the world to do
something<00:05:10.979> to<00:05:11.069> change<00:05:11.279> something<00:05:11.580> to<00:05:12.199> express

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 
something to change something to express

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.609 
something to change something to express
some<00:05:13.680> things<00:05:13.889> I<00:05:14.749> feel<00:05:15.749> like<00:05:15.930> we're<00:05:16.199> just<00:05:16.439> now

00:05:16.609 --> 00:05:16.619 
some things I feel like we're just now

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:19.010 
some things I feel like we're just now
you<00:05:16.889> know<00:05:17.789> the<00:05:18.240> wheels<00:05:18.419> are<00:05:18.599> just<00:05:18.629> started

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
you know the wheels are just started

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.309 
you know the wheels are just started
turning<00:05:19.349> and<00:05:20.339> then<00:05:20.550> hopefully<00:05:20.960> it'll<00:05:21.960> go<00:05:22.110> on

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:22.319 
turning and then hopefully it'll go on

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:27.109 
turning and then hopefully it'll go on
and<00:05:23.099> get<00:05:23.249> bigger<00:05:23.430> and<00:05:23.669> better<00:05:25.699> no<00:05:26.699> I<00:05:26.759> don't

00:05:27.109 --> 00:05:27.119 
and get bigger and better no I don't

00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:28.820 
and get bigger and better no I don't
think<00:05:27.180> shooting<00:05:27.689> rubberbands<00:05:27.930> stars<00:05:28.589> is<00:05:28.800> a

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
think shooting rubberbands stars is a

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.149 
think shooting rubberbands stars is a
futile<00:05:29.189> effort<00:05:29.460> at<00:05:29.729> all<00:05:29.879> I<00:05:30.270> think<00:05:30.869> that<00:05:31.649> if<00:05:31.770> you

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:32.159 
futile effort at all I think that if you

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:34.309 
futile effort at all I think that if you
see<00:05:32.430> anything<00:05:32.639> you<00:05:32.939> think<00:05:33.059> is<00:05:33.180> impossible<00:05:33.809> go

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:34.319 
see anything you think is impossible go

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:35.389 
see anything you think is impossible go
forward<00:05:34.620> and<00:05:34.680> do<00:05:34.770> it<00:05:34.889> anyway<00:05:34.949> you<00:05:35.189> can

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:35.399 
forward and do it anyway you can

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:37.939 
forward and do it anyway you can
surprise<00:05:35.669> yourself
