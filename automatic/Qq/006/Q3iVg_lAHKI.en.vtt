00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:14.079
 one in advance we will support 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.090
 may he turn on his heat please 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:17.350
 block out and go over this video again 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.390
 thanks for that 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.770
 Hello dear youtube community I am it 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.710
 lure again and today I want you 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:29.110
 show how her the problem with the 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:31.869
 can solve broken water tank or 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.730
 if he has the problem that this now 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.839
 no longer noticing water now 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.269
 in the tank or not 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:39.550
 yes, with the standard you have us 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:41.559
 you on the narrow relatively small 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.359
 Water tank in Vienna, yes, too bad 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.670
 the hand ran comes so there you come 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:48.399
 namely fast on the magnet of the 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.819
 getting under the tank qualifies for the same 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.280
 more 

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:54.579
 at annual co2 where i am now running 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.170
 also in the tank from there he is 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.690
 Of course, relatively spacious as you come 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.510
 wonderful also with the hand purely and 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.260
 Can the man against quite good 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.230
 to reach 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.020
 there is also a lot to consider 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.300
 I 'll go into that in detail so still 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.780
 before you now my subsequent 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.840
 Repair instructions followed very important 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.480
 Looks that the tank is really clean 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.430
 So decalcified is right for it 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.200
 in no case it is because of the circle 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.300
 like the parts but rather to 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.990
 citric acid and leave the whole thing 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.970
 I'd rather spend more time with him 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.520
 free from residues that looks too 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.080
 in the tank in the area where the 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.120
 Swimmer sits if there really no 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.190
 deposits are when then what 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.130
 you can also with the toothbrush 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.870
 go in there and try somehow 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.700
 this refusal to get away because in 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.440
 it is rule so that the float 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.200
 just not feeling down and down 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.240
 thus the machine no longer 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.960
 The tank is full 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.659
 or empty 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.329
 she just gets notified thank you 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.920
 now all that did not help then 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:02.319
 can you now the following 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.130
 Repair persist and try a lot 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:07.739
 Success with the standard bank is the 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.000
 magnet down here 

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:12.640
 I think I still see quite well and 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.430
 the silver down there is this hold 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.780
 Clamp the magnets in position 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.280
 He also thinks that he is not at 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.709
 So you can see the when her battle 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.920
 then she felt the magnet was out of his 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:29.230
 leadership was coming out and then loose in the 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:31.829
 thank you floating the following problem 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.370
 this is the right clip 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:37.049
 unfortunately designed so that relative 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.890
 is fragile 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.030
 I do not want to do that now 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.120
 continue to comment 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.709
 it is just like this and this one 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.260
 I have only cling here 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.099
 get out twice and it's already 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.319
 they broke through 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:53.260
 that means the risk is relative 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.269
 great that he tries to turn 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.829
 get out magnets that you the 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.459
 brace breaks then you have to 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:02.889
 Of course, that's how he looks somehow 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:06.730
 alternatively yes something finds what you 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:10.239
 there can attach so that the ball goes 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.220
 his position remains with the senseo 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.799
 Parente one comes very well to the 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.870
 actual magnets that's what the whole thing looks like 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.609
 but this one on this unit 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.359
 is not complete magnet but the 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:24.489
 real magnet sits up here 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:27.190
 up here at this point are there and 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:30.310
 the rest of the container is filled 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.030
 with two swim with each other 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:37.720
 water soak up the whole unit 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:42.069
 complain so that too 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.840
 moved down around this container 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.440
 trying to open the screwdriver 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.359
 between the ones who open the door 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.910
 get and levers the whole then 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:53.139
 just had to tend to 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.790
 be careful that you have the little ones here 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:57.010
 Do not mind if it happens 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.019
 Enter the whole thing later as you can see 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.760
 I can now have the magnets here 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.610
 in front 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.079
 in front of the camera the water tank is still 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.159
 not too old, you see here too 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:11.239
 such a few corrosion marks 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:13.650
 In the end, the whole thing is natural 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.689
 susceptible because of this container 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.650
 water penetrates when the whole 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:21.329
 of course now such a stick would that 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.370
 there is no water to penetrate 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.979
 then of course the magnet could be too 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.090
 do not corrode but that seems to him 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.389
 not to be wanted 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.949
 so you have against the magnet 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.139
 You can do it all clean again 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.100
 obstruct and check if it works 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.699
 I hope so 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.440
 if that is not the case, you can 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.610
 good last of course, the sensor 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.350
 still have slipped in the machine 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.229
 or be broken 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.610
 Of course you have to retrieve that 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.400
 is definitely in my channel 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.930
 or if he is his ceo playlist 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.300
 according to the video instructions where you 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.150
 you can see the machine opens and 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.120
 as well as the sensor arrives when I 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.919
 exactly know which part of the machine 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.530
 the sensor is then oriented 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:07.289
 at the beginning of which magnetic switch 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:09.599
 water tank because right here at the 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:13.970
 position within the machine on the 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:16.590
 sensor yes that was it essentially 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:20.220
 if one has never had a good idea 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:22.530
 how to make the magnet duration of pulsion 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.120
 the state can also easily protect in 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.580
 the comments or world with me 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.110
 send photos and then you can do the whole thing 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.940
 Try it if it's such a good idea 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.580
 then I like to do it formally 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.889
 video remains that year for the people 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.620
 the quasi have no problems and 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:40.250
 you do not want to come in the future 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:43.289
 that you connected the whole thing permanently 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:46.740
 Thanks for watching and 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:46.740
 Until next time
