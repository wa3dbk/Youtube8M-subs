00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
going to be cooked at 425 and it takes a

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.160 
going to be cooked at 425 and it takes a
little<00:03:19.920> bit<00:03:20.160> longer<00:03:20.430> because<00:03:20.730> of<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.210> egg<00:03:21.420> in

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.790 
little bit longer because of the egg in
it<00:03:22.770> however<00:03:23.400> it<00:03:23.940> really<00:03:24.180> is<00:03:24.510> a<00:03:24.870> very<00:03:25.320> quick
