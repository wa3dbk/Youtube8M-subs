00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
it because I think that for a very wide

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.190 
it because I think that for a very wide
audience<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:39.030> just<00:01:39.420> hits<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.780> sweet<00:01:39.930> spot

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
audience it just hits that sweet spot

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.289 
audience it just hits that sweet spot
it's<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.310> terrific<00:01:41.460> amount<00:01:42.030> of

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
it's just a terrific amount of

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.289 
it's just a terrific amount of
performance<00:01:42.780> for<00:01:42.950> $149<00:01:43.950> nice<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.030> think

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
performance for $149 nice and I think

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.030 
performance for $149 nice and I think
that<00:01:45.420> I'm<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:46.079> know<00:01:46.170> we're<00:01:46.590> giving<00:01:46.860> something

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
that I'm you know we're giving something

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.300 
that I'm you know we're giving something
to<00:01:47.159> people<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.210> they<00:01:48.479> just<00:01:48.950> would<00:01:49.950> never

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
to people that they just would never

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.830 
to people that they just would never
probably<00:01:50.670> have<00:01:51.000> before<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.390> price<00:01:51.810> point

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
probably have before that price point

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.100 
probably have before that price point
right<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:54.000> think<00:01:54.329> it's<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.540> terrific

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110

enabling<00:03:25.560> things<00:03:25.739> like<00:03:25.920> mantle<00:03:26.340> is<00:03:26.519> available

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
enabling things like mantle is available

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.090 
enabling things like mantle is available
to<00:03:27.239> a<00:03:27.269> lot<00:03:27.390> more<00:03:27.510> people<00:03:27.900> not<00:03:28.590> just<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.920> those

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
to a lot more people not just to those

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.740 
to a lot more people not just to those

that the kind of all four hundred dollar
graphics<00:03:31.140> cards<00:03:31.440> as<00:03:31.950> much<00:03:32.190> as<00:03:32.310> we<00:03:32.430> love<00:03:32.549> those

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
graphics cards as much as we love those

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.090 
graphics cards as much as we love those
yeah<00:03:33.180> of<00:03:33.390> course<00:03:33.690> a<00:03:34.650> lot<00:03:34.769> of<00:03:34.980> our<00:03:35.070> viewers

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
yeah of course a lot of our viewers

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.620 
yeah of course a lot of our viewers
definitely<00:03:35.790> have<00:03:35.880> those<00:03:36.000> cards<00:03:36.329> in<00:03:36.480> their

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
definitely have those cards in their

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.500 
definitely have those cards in their
systems<00:03:37.019> right<00:03:37.230> now<00:03:37.410> but<00:03:38.370> worth<00:03:39.269> upgrading

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
systems right now but worth upgrading

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.479 
systems right now but worth upgrading
versus<00:03:40.140> onboard<00:03:40.470> graphics<00:03:40.590> would<00:03:41.250> you<00:03:41.340> say

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
versus onboard graphics would you say

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.690 
versus onboard graphics would you say
definitely<00:03:41.730> maybe<00:03:42.480> or<00:03:42.840> not<00:03:43.170> at<00:03:43.320> all<00:03:43.380> I<00:03:43.700> think

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
definitely maybe or not at all I think

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.569 
definitely maybe or not at all I think
that<00:03:44.880> if<00:03:45.239> you<00:03:45.269> look<00:03:45.959> at<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.370> we're<00:03:47.370> onboard

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
that if you look at the we're onboard

graphics<00:03:59.459> point<00:04:00.260> but<00:04:01.260> for<00:04:01.380> many<00:04:01.470> people<00:04:01.680> they

graphics point but for many people they
want<00:04:02.100> more<00:04:02.280> they<00:04:02.850> want<00:04:03.060> those<00:04:03.209> higher<00:04:03.420> frame

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
want more they want those higher frame

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.900 
want more they want those higher frame
rates<00:04:03.989> indeed<00:04:04.680> if<00:04:04.769> that<00:04:04.890> wasn't<00:04:05.220> true<00:04:05.430> we

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
rates indeed if that wasn't true we

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.460 
rates indeed if that wasn't true we
wouldn't<00:04:06.209> have<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:06.540> enthusiasts<00:04:07.109> watching

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
wouldn't have the enthusiasts watching

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.870 
wouldn't have the enthusiasts watching
this<00:04:07.769> video<00:04:08.070> now<00:04:08.310> we<00:04:08.370> wouldn't<00:04:08.670> have<00:04:08.850> a

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
this video now we wouldn't have a

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.370 
this video now we wouldn't have a
graphics<00:04:09.450> card<00:04:09.480> business<00:04:09.780> we<00:04:09.959> do<00:04:10.109> that's

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
graphics card business we do that's

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.349 
graphics card business we do that's
absolutely<00:04:10.799> true<00:04:10.920> so<00:04:11.430> we<00:04:11.820> have<00:04:11.910> a<00:04:11.970> good<00:04:12.150> base

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
absolutely true so we have a good base

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:13.699 
absolutely true so we have a good base
but<00:04:12.780> I<00:04:12.810> think<00:04:13.019> for<00:04:13.109> a<00:04:13.170> lot<00:04:13.260> of<00:04:13.320> people<00:04:13.410> they're

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
but I think for a lot of people they're

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.949 
but I think for a lot of people they're
going<00:04:13.859> to<00:04:13.980> one<00:04:14.130> more<00:04:14.340> and<00:04:14.780> depending<00:04:15.780> on<00:04:15.840> their

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
going to one more and depending on their

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.990 
going to one more and depending on their
budget<00:04:16.350> to<00:04:16.470> do<00:04:16.620> so<00:04:16.829> we've<00:04:17.430> got<00:04:17.579> to<00:04:17.669> put<00:04:17.789> up<00:04:17.880> for

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
budget to do so we've got to put up for

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.969 
budget to do so we've got to put up for
every<00:04:18.150> need<00:04:18.359> excellent<00:04:19.320> so<00:04:19.530> what<00:04:19.739> would<00:04:19.859> you

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
every need excellent so what would you

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.409 
every need excellent so what would you
recommend<00:04:20.160> though<00:04:20.669> for<00:04:20.940> someone<00:04:21.180> out<00:04:21.269> there

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
recommend though for someone out there

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:22.550 
recommend though for someone out there
who<00:04:21.510> may<00:04:21.630> be<00:04:21.690> just<00:04:21.930> as<00:04:22.080> onboard<00:04:22.440> graphics

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
who may be just as onboard graphics

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.530 
who may be just as onboard graphics
wants<00:04:23.550> to<00:04:23.640> get<00:04:23.760> a<00:04:23.789> little<00:04:23.849> more<00:04:24.000> either<00:04:24.210> game

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
wants to get a little more either game

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.180 
wants to get a little more either game
aiming<00:04:24.780> I<00:04:24.900> mean<00:04:25.080> in<00:04:25.230> terms<00:04:25.350> of<00:04:25.500> our<00:04:25.680> sub<00:04:25.890> lineup

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
aiming I mean in terms of our sub lineup

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.070 
aiming I mean in terms of our sub lineup
would<00:04:26.280> you<00:04:26.400> just<00:04:26.580> go<00:04:26.670> straight<00:04:26.880> to<00:04:27.060> the<00:04:27.090> 265<00:04:27.780> or

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
would you just go straight to the 265 or

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.270 
would you just go straight to the 265 or
would<00:04:28.200> you<00:04:28.290> recommend<00:04:28.680> something<00:04:28.860> different

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
would you recommend something different

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.010 
would you recommend something different
well<00:04:29.910> again<00:04:30.150> it<00:04:30.420> would<00:04:30.540> depend<00:04:30.660> on<00:04:30.900> their

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
well again it would depend on their

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.400 
well again it would depend on their
budget<00:04:31.380> okay<00:04:31.740> in<00:04:32.310> an<00:04:32.640> ideal<00:04:32.790> world<00:04:33.120> yes<00:04:34.080> the

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
budget okay in an ideal world yes the

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.850 
budget okay in an ideal world yes the
simple<00:04:34.920> answer<00:04:35.010> is<00:04:35.220> x<00:04:36.060> 2<00:04:36.120> 65<00:04:36.750> in<00:04:36.990> fact<00:04:37.200> gone<00:04:37.710> by

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
simple answer is x 2 65 in fact gone by

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.400 
simple answer is x 2 65 in fact gone by
radon<00:04:38.250> 290x<00:04:38.820> right<00:04:39.330> but<00:04:39.810> we<00:04:39.930> don't<00:04:40.050> live<00:04:40.230> in<00:04:40.290> an

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
radon 290x right but we don't live in an

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.750 
radon 290x right but we don't live in an
ideal<00:04:40.680> world<00:04:40.740> and<00:04:41.070> not<00:04:41.130> everybody<00:04:41.340> has<00:04:41.700> that

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
ideal world and not everybody has that

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.150 
ideal world and not everybody has that
budget<00:04:42.360> right<00:04:42.690> and<00:04:42.900> so<00:04:43.110> what<00:04:43.650> I<00:04:43.680> would<00:04:43.830> say<00:04:44.130> to

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
budget right and so what I would say to

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.850 
budget right and so what I would say to
anybody<00:04:44.550> watching<00:04:45.090> this<00:04:45.120> is<00:04:45.510> consider<00:04:46.140> the

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
anybody watching this is consider the

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.430 
anybody watching this is consider the
kind<00:04:47.070> of<00:04:47.130> games<00:04:47.340> that<00:04:47.490> you<00:04:47.550> play<00:04:47.780> and<00:04:48.780> then<00:04:49.170> I

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
kind of games that you play and then I

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.200 
kind of games that you play and then I
would<00:04:49.920> get<00:04:50.070> the<00:04:50.160> best<00:04:50.310> card<00:04:50.580> you<00:04:50.700> can<00:04:50.910> for<00:04:51.120> the

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
would get the best card you can for the

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.970 
would get the best card you can for the
budget<00:04:51.330> that<00:04:51.510> you<00:04:51.690> have<00:04:51.870> right<00:04:52.350> maybe<00:04:52.650> look<00:04:52.860> at

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
budget that you have right maybe look at

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.620 
budget that you have right maybe look at
some<00:04:53.430> of<00:04:53.490> our<00:04:53.550> benchmarks<00:04:54.030> for<00:04:54.120> the<00:04:54.240> cards<00:04:54.540> we
