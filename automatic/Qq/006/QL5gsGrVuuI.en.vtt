had to split this up into two parts
hopefully<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:41.850> guys<00:00:42.000> don't<00:00:42.360> mind<00:00:42.600> as<00:00:42.930> we<00:00:43.530> fly

aimlessly<00:00:44.700> through<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.090> air<00:00:45.239> hopefully<00:00:45.750> I

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
aimlessly through the air hopefully I

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.720 
aimlessly through the air hopefully I
can<00:00:45.899> pull<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.350> off<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.190> going<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.550> be<00:00:47.700> a

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
can pull this off this is going to be a

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.439 
can pull this off this is going to be a
lot<00:00:48.000> harder<00:00:48.270> than<00:00:48.450> flying<00:00:48.899> into<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.590> chiliad

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
lot harder than flying into the chiliad

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.049 
lot harder than flying into the chiliad
UFO<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.840> course<00:00:52.110> flying<00:00:52.440> into<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.160> alien

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
UFO and of course flying into the alien

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.049 
UFO and of course flying into the alien
hippie<00:00:54.480> camp<00:00:54.750> UFO<00:00:55.440> which<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.550> have<00:00:56.670> done<00:00:56.850> both

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
hippie camp UFO which I have done both

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.540 
hippie camp UFO which I have done both
multiple<00:00:57.870> times<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.739> course<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.129> chiliad

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
multiple times I of course the chiliad

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.990 
multiple times I of course the chiliad
UFO<00:01:00.000> disappears<00:01:00.629> when<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:00.899> get<00:01:01.050> close<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.350> it

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
UFO disappears when you get close to it

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.640 
UFO disappears when you get close to it
but<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.660> one's<00:01:03.930> going<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.140> be<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.320> little<00:01:04.470> bit

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
but this one's going to be a little bit

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.580 
but this one's going to be a little bit
more<00:01:04.799> difficult<00:01:05.339> because<00:01:05.489> unlike<00:01:06.090> those<00:01:06.590> UFOs

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
more difficult because unlike those UFOs

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.219 
more difficult because unlike those UFOs
it's<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.580> really<00:01:08.970> awkward<00:01:09.000> position<00:01:09.720> and

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
it's in a really awkward position and

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.230 
it's in a really awkward position and
it's<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.220> little<00:01:11.460> bit<00:01:11.580> hard<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.970> pinpoint

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
it's a little bit hard to pinpoint

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.480 
it's a little bit hard to pinpoint
sometimes<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.290> hopefully<00:01:13.680> we<00:01:13.860> can<00:01:14.040> get<00:01:14.220> this

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
sometimes so hopefully we can get this

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.499 
sometimes so hopefully we can get this
and<00:01:14.990> I<00:01:15.990> guess<00:01:16.680> we<00:01:16.890> will<00:01:17.040> meet<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.400> guys<00:01:17.430> as<00:01:17.970> we

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.580 
of the san kudo UFO is this the secret
to<00:01:26.790> unlocking<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.479> jetpack<00:01:28.020> or<00:01:28.350> perhaps

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
to unlocking the jetpack or perhaps

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.460 
to unlocking the jetpack or perhaps
something<00:01:29.220> else<00:01:29.610> we<00:01:30.540> will<00:01:30.659> soon<00:01:30.930> find<00:01:30.960> out

give it a shot
maybe<00:02:08.070> I<00:02:08.220> requires<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.240> very<00:02:09.570> precise<00:02:10.350> striking

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
maybe I requires a very precise striking

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.640 
maybe I requires a very precise striking
point<00:02:11.460> to<00:02:12.180> really<00:02:12.420> make<00:02:12.660> this<00:02:12.840> thing<00:02:12.900> who

the<00:02:56.040> hangars<00:02:56.489> there's<00:02:56.790> underground<00:02:57.390> levels

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
the hangars there's underground levels

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.970 
the hangars there's underground levels
much<00:02:59.040> like<00:02:59.370> area<00:02:59.790> 51<00:03:00.030> we<00:03:00.720> can<00:03:00.870> expect<00:03:01.440> for<00:03:01.769> some

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
much like area 51 we can expect for some

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.040 
much like area 51 we can expect for some
really<00:03:02.310> crazy<00:03:02.670> things<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:03.209> be<00:03:03.390> found<00:03:03.660> under

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
really crazy things to be found under

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.800 
really crazy things to be found under
there<00:03:04.290> there's<00:03:04.920> a<00:03:05.010> lot<00:03:05.220> of<00:03:05.400> alien<00:03:05.940> influence

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
there there's a lot of alien influence

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.140 
there there's a lot of alien influence
here<00:03:07.110> at<00:03:07.230> San<00:03:07.470> Andreas<00:03:07.650> there's<00:03:08.160> three<00:03:08.670> UFOs

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
here at San Andreas there's three UFOs

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.720 
here at San Andreas there's three UFOs
that<00:03:09.180> can<00:03:09.510> be<00:03:09.630> found<00:03:09.930> flying<00:03:10.410> overhead<00:03:10.950> in<00:03:11.430> one

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
that can be found flying overhead in one

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.360 
that can be found flying overhead in one
under<00:03:12.180> water<00:03:12.420> so<00:03:13.260> it's<00:03:13.560> not<00:03:13.800> a<00:03:13.830> stretch<00:03:14.340> to

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
under water so it's not a stretch to

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.250 
under water so it's not a stretch to
think<00:03:14.820> that<00:03:15.330> there's<00:03:15.570> going<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:15.750> be<00:03:15.810> some

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
think that there's going to be some

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.670 
think that there's going to be some
aliens<00:03:16.830> and<00:03:17.370> some<00:03:17.720> you<00:03:18.720> know<00:03:18.840> UFO<00:03:19.440> technology

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
aliens and some you know UFO technology

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.810 
aliens and some you know UFO technology
found<00:03:20.580> somewhere<00:03:21.300> around<00:03:21.500> Zancudo<00:03:22.580> but<00:03:23.580> at

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
found somewhere around Zancudo but at

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.229 
found somewhere around Zancudo but at
the<00:03:24.030> same<00:03:24.269> time<00:03:24.510> like<00:03:24.989> we<00:03:25.200> mentioned<00:03:26.239> perhaps

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
the same time like we mentioned perhaps

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.259 
the same time like we mentioned perhaps
that<00:03:27.510> is<00:03:27.660> just<00:03:28.050> a<00:03:28.380> some<00:03:29.220> sort<00:03:29.430> of<00:03:29.519> a<00:03:29.610> project

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
that is just a some sort of a project

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.810 
that is just a some sort of a project
some<00:03:30.450> sort<00:03:30.660> of<00:03:30.720> military<00:03:30.930> project<00:03:31.890> maybe<00:03:32.580> they

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
some sort of military project maybe they

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.120 
some sort of military project maybe they
are<00:03:32.910> trying<00:03:33.239> to<00:03:33.299> create<00:03:33.660> UFO<00:03:34.290> technology<00:03:34.500> or

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
are trying to create UFO technology or

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.670 
are trying to create UFO technology or
maybe<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.549> aliens<00:03:36.120> have<00:03:36.390> given<00:03:36.720> them<00:03:37.080> you

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
maybe the aliens have given them you

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.820 
maybe the aliens have given them you
have<00:03:37.799> folk<00:03:38.010> technology<00:03:39.110> there<00:03:40.110> is<00:03:40.140> an<00:03:40.440> alien

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
have folk technology there is an alien

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.280 
have folk technology there is an alien
that<00:03:40.950> can<00:03:41.190> be<00:03:41.310> found<00:03:41.580> in<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.390> prologue<00:03:42.900> of<00:03:43.200> the

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
that can be found in the prologue of the

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.190 
that can be found in the prologue of the
game<00:03:43.680> so<00:03:44.130> that's<00:03:44.970> kind<00:03:45.240> of<00:03:45.300> proof<00:03:45.540> that<00:03:45.720> aliens

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
game so that's kind of proof that aliens

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.470 
game so that's kind of proof that aliens
do<00:03:46.410> exist

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
do exist

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.550 
do exist
Michael<00:03:48.480> was

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
Michael was

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.680 
Michael was
by<00:03:49.770> aliens<00:03:50.250> but<00:03:50.459> that<00:03:50.700> could<00:03:51.000> have<00:03:51.120> been<00:03:51.390> a

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
by aliens but that could have been a

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.010 
by aliens but that could have been a
hallucinate<00:03:53.090> hallucination<00:03:54.090> as<00:03:54.270> he<00:03:54.810> was

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
hallucinate hallucination as he was

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.620 
hallucinate hallucination as he was
under<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.650> influence<00:03:55.920> when<00:03:56.640> that<00:03:57.120> happens

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
under the influence when that happens

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.930 
under the influence when that happens
and<00:03:58.069> of<00:03:59.069> course<00:03:59.310> there's<00:03:59.489> a<00:03:59.550> lot<00:03:59.670> of<00:03:59.819> other

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
and of course there's a lot of other

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.089 
and of course there's a lot of other
alien<00:04:00.480> stuff<00:04:00.780> going<00:04:01.110> on<00:04:01.200> here<00:04:01.260> in<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.650> map<00:04:01.830> and

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
alien stuff going on here in the map and

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.089 
alien stuff going on here in the map and
we<00:04:02.310> think<00:04:02.610> that<00:04:02.670> fort<00:04:03.090> Zancudo<00:04:03.500> it's<00:04:04.500> probably

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
we think that fort Zancudo it's probably

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.550 
we think that fort Zancudo it's probably
holding<00:04:05.550> the<00:04:05.670> secrets<00:04:06.239> to<00:04:06.510> not<00:04:07.200> only<00:04:07.380> the

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
holding the secrets to not only the

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.910 
holding the secrets to not only the

day it is an open mystery many people

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.000

be<00:05:52.050> added<00:05:52.530> but<00:05:53.340> we<00:05:53.550> think<00:05:53.789> that<00:05:54.090> at<00:05:54.240> some<00:05:54.539> point

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
be added but we think that at some point

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.649 
be added but we think that at some point
we<00:05:55.139> will<00:05:55.410> fly<00:05:55.919> around<00:05:56.100> the<00:05:56.400> jet<00:05:56.669> pod<00:05:56.970> San

00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:57.659
