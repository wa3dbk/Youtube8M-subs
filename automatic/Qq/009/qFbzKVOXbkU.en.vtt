00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 who months of the last month 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:08.069
 for years through photography forums or 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.139
 has led twitter conversation which 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.139
 a topic is relatively common on the 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.150
 shoes are falling and that 's the wm big one 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.130
 dslr camera not necessarily off 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.920
 technical perspective but simple 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.470
 that the classic giants like canon 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.289
 sony nikon all in the area the scr 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.730
 lose and actually dsm the future 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.289
 is at all and everyone still today 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.980
 has replaced the first anyway 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.349
 lost 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.030
 I asked myself once completely abandoned 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.399
 this one is very nice here 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.870
 almost esoteric guided discussion is 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.370
 there's anything about it you can do that 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.260
 somehow to substantiate with numbers 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.809
 through mountains of 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.000
 selected metadata that these 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.309
 Japanese Association of all the larger ones 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.800
 camera manufacturer the grateful way 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.170
 also completely free public the 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.579
 pay statistics and disclose the 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.230
 Now you try a bit graphically 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.100
 to represent than that the ciba itself 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.100
 So, have fun 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.050
 on the spot another note the sepia 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.480
 or just is a composite Japanese 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.010
 Companies that means samsung takes place in 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.180
 these do not pay these statistics 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.100
 consideration 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.170
 but that is actually the only one 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.550
 companies larger companies in the 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.380
 area photography what are not 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.690
 so it is clear that such considerations 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.190
 Companies like light for hasselblad like 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.410
 or they are not in there either 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.670
 but I'll say all the big players on 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.560
 market that otherwise somehow plays a role 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.860
 so do so and the canon nikon 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.630
 pentax olympus fujifilm and and and the 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.820
 are all with too in the objective 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.180
 area sigma tamron they are all with 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.280
 in it 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.990
 So I say in big notes 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.119
 We thus have this impressive 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.670
 Samsung had last in the sm market 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.470
 a share of roughly 25 percent 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.850
 they have no first one at first 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.170
 just to give you that info a bit 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.990
 keep in mind 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.090
 How does the camera market generally look 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.380
 if you pay it once 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.180
 you can see there already 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.690
 First there was quite a valley after 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.850
 above 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.560
 that just means at the beginning of the 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.590
 digital photography of course always 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.120
 and always and always more sold 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.700
 compact cameras has the whole thing so um 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.220
 the year 2010 started 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.140
 this is also the time to stop 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.459
 smartphones have become increasingly popular 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.930
 that means relatively simple 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.030
 conclusions at least from me 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.160
 that smartphones are just many 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.720
 Compact cameras have made obsolete 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.799
 or at least simply no new ones 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.110
 were purchased 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.780
 but slowly you can see that too 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.360
 This trend has been saved a bit now 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.980
 that means the big descent is over 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.570
 quite interesting to come later 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.010
 but also the prices the 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.489
 average prices are also rising again 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.620
 on 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.180
 at the ard is dm camera sitting 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.640
 that was a bit different , too 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.350
 luckily so until 2012 13 also in the area 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.200
 numbers really neat to 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.540
 grow then there was also kinks you 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.160
 The swm cameras are already here 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.320
 not really doing it first 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.850
 replace ladies are all these wust 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.400
 pay off this could see really well 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.049
 but especially her tja perhaps 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.100
 Unfortunately, the data is separated 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:04.900
 for the scr and dsm cameras only since 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.790
 2012 means really long-term 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.560
 trends since the scm can exist 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.840
 Now do not make but I guess 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.360
 which one already sees quite well 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.879
 to separate a real man 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.170
 The first cameras added that this only 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.420
 are now fully extinct 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.860
 You can see that with the best little now 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.480
 Of course you can say yes that is 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.890
 now the worldwide consideration we 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.660
 see here in german and 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.910
 I have a European market 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.290
 the numbers for europe out again 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.319
 brought it gives me even extra time 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.819
 and yes, I would say that even 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.379
 still a bit conservative what 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.840
 that concerns us first 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.370
 even a little bigger share itself 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.830
 if we now samsung lined with 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.200
 Of course, a bit more will count 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:47.140
 but clearly it is with the gsm cameras 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.329
 is still not a great trend 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.340
 We'll see the first short there 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.170
 Summary 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.450
 I think the barracks still a whole 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.430
 Keep it interesting for a long time 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.620
 but another topic is another 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.510
 Contemplation and if you look at the 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.849
 average selling prices and 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.069
 English esp abbreviated views once 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:09.010
 So how expensive is the average 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.140
 become compact dsm or dslr camera 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.329
 there was a very nice valley ride 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.980
 down this clearly new technology 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.200
 everything will be cheaper 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.239
 especially in the dsl area you have indeed 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.850
 canon nikon and co first with the 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.680
 super profi started and go 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.070
 then always down and down 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.210
 ie up to the 300 euro group 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.770
 entry-level devices and synonymous with the slm 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.760
 it is now quite in 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:35.139
 this area down since 2009 10 group 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.849
 then again a trend now 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.440
 that hangs up slowly 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.820
 probably also with the smartphones 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.130
 simply connected by where 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.099
 smartphones all this cheap 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.419
 cameras have replaced year there were at 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:48.099
 many people at least with whom I 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.990
 spoke always such a trend as 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:51.310
 a statement maja so if I am me 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.260
 already a camera then get something 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.599
 better and you can see completely 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.910
 strong in the compact cameras there is the 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:00.190
 Price within the last three years 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:04.150
 increased by 50 percent 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:06.430
 that's a huge deal with dsds receivers 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.280
 it is much less but I say 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.470
 with 25 and 15 percent still 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.090
 a pretty nice even if you 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.310
 corrected the whole time around the 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.830
 inflation rate and this in japan super 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.390
 low that it is still really very 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.249
 very much so that you are very clear 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:24.549
 trend that the cameras are always faithful 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:26.979
 there are times spoken differently by 2012 

00:05:24.549 --> 00:05:30.189
 until 2015, the average is the 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.479
 sm camera has become 100 euros more expensive 

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:33.099
 that is definitely a whole 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:34.449
 neat amount and shows already in 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:37.209
 which direction is the whole 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:39.339
 develops a short party at the end 

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:42.339
 In my opinion, there is no one 

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:44.559
 right trend of dslr added the sm 

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:45.849
 Cameras that has somehow in such 

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:48.129
 a two-thirds to a third 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:50.079
 Relationship is leveled and I think 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:52.089
 This will happen in the near future 

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:53.919
 not as many do because of the camera 

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:55.509
 market is quite sluggish when your child is that 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.709
 will probably be even if you 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:58.329
 first decided on a system 

00:05:56.709 --> 00:06:01.149
 Maybe there was another lightning 

00:05:58.329 --> 00:06:01.839
 bought more objective other things 

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:03.549
 equipment 

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:05.829
 you just do not get there so fast 

00:06:03.549 --> 00:06:07.839
 this probably helps too 

00:06:05.829 --> 00:06:08.169
 established brands like canon nikon and 

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:09.939
 co 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:11.409
 there's a little bit longer in the game too 

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:12.610
 stay tuned even if there are innovations 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:14.439
 I would have on one side 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.949
 slightly faster than on the 

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:17.019
 other 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:19.719
 if you like the video is a bit too 

00:06:17.019 --> 00:06:21.249
 dry I can understand that 

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:23.109
 usually test on the channel 

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:25.449
 here, too, he cameras objective 

00:06:23.109 --> 00:06:27.069
 both like to have a look here too 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:27.579
 like to have another abo just there 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:29.559
 to let 

00:06:27.579 --> 00:06:31.539
 that was so far from me many thanks for 

00:06:29.559 --> 00:06:35.099
 watch and yes essence at the next 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:35.099
 Send this on sunday
