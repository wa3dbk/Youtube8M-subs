00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.110 
the texture in the style and and then we
can<00:02:46.410> match<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.740> wig<00:02:46.950> as<00:02:47.190> close<00:02:47.520> as<00:02:47.700> possible<00:02:47.760> to

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
their own hair because usually most

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.190 
their own hair because usually most
people<00:02:50.640> who<00:02:51.000> are<00:02:51.090> on<00:02:51.150> chemo<00:02:51.540> they<00:02:51.810> don't<00:02:52.020> want

people who are on chemo they don't want

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.020 
people who are on chemo they don't want
to<00:02:52.350> draw<00:02:52.500> attention<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.980> their<00:02:53.220> hair<00:02:53.400> when<00:02:53.880> it

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
to draw attention to their hair when it

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.190 
to draw attention to their hair when it
goes<00:02:54.180> so<00:02:54.390> they<00:02:54.480> actually<00:02:54.600> want<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.930> wig<00:02:55.080> that

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
goes so they actually want a wig that

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.170 
goes so they actually want a wig that
looks<00:02:55.410> exactly<00:02:55.710> like<00:02:55.920> themselves<00:02:56.250> if<00:02:57.000> they

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
looks exactly like themselves if they

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.760 
looks exactly like themselves if they
come<00:02:57.390> in<00:02:57.540> when<00:02:57.690> they've<00:02:57.810> lost<00:02:58.050> their<00:02:58.320> hair<00:02:58.560> I

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
come in when they've lost their hair I

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.710 
come in when they've lost their hair I
generally<00:02:59.610> ask<00:02:59.730> them<00:02:59.940> to<00:03:00.060> bring<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.270> photograph

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
generally ask them to bring a photograph

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.540 
generally ask them to bring a photograph
because<00:03:00.990> you<00:03:01.260> see<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.770> main<00:03:01.980> give<00:03:02.190> away<00:03:02.400> with

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
because you see the main give away with

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.700 
because you see the main give away with
the<00:03:02.640> wig<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:02.940> think<00:03:02.970> is<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.900> density<00:03:04.290> you<00:03:04.560> can

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
the wig I think is the density you can

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.350 
the wig I think is the density you can
change<00:03:05.070> your<00:03:05.220> style<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:05.850> can<00:03:05.880> change<00:03:06.240> your

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
change your style you can change your

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.210 
change your style you can change your
color<00:03:06.570> but<00:03:06.930> if<00:03:07.110> you've<00:03:07.260> got<00:03:07.440> really<00:03:07.710> fine<00:03:07.920> hair

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
color but if you've got really fine hair

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.400 
color but if you've got really fine hair
and<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:08.730> go<00:03:08.850> out<00:03:08.970> with<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.150> really<00:03:09.480> full<00:03:10.170> wig

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
and you go out with a really full wig

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.870 
and you go out with a really full wig
it's<00:03:10.650> going<00:03:10.860> to<00:03:10.890> be<00:03:11.010> obvious<00:03:11.340> that<00:03:11.400> it's<00:03:11.640> a<00:03:11.730> wig

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
it's going to be obvious that it's a wig

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.300 
it's going to be obvious that it's a wig
so<00:03:12.210> I<00:03:12.450> generally<00:03:13.080> think<00:03:13.110> if<00:03:13.920> you<00:03:14.070> get<00:03:14.220> the

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
so I generally think if you get the

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.040 
so I generally think if you get the
density<00:03:14.760> rice<00:03:14.940> that's<00:03:15.270> the<00:03:15.390> most<00:03:15.510> important

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
density rice that's the most important

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.960 
density rice that's the most important
thing<00:03:16.130> sometimes<00:03:17.130> people<00:03:17.340> might<00:03:17.610> want<00:03:17.820> to

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970
