00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.749 
this would be a little bit more feminine
and<00:01:49.110> less<00:01:49.290> harsh<00:01:49.590> than<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.070> one<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.490> I've

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
and less harsh than the one that I've

00:01:50.759 --> 00:02:05.520 
and less harsh than the one that I've
created<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.420> paper

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
to 90 percent resolution how painful is

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.530 
to 90 percent resolution how painful is
it<00:04:21.190> going<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:21.370> be<00:04:21.459> removing<00:04:21.880> the<00:04:22.090> tattoo<00:04:22.330> is

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.240 
it going to be removing the tattoo is
actually<00:04:22.660> more<00:04:22.930> painful<00:04:23.380> than<00:04:23.740> doing<00:04:24.160> a

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
actually more painful than doing a

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.480 
actually more painful than doing a
tattoo<00:04:24.400> itself<00:04:24.900> mainly<00:04:25.900> it's<00:04:26.140> because

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
tattoo itself mainly it's because

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.800 
tattoo itself mainly it's because

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
finally the energy right into the skin

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.750
