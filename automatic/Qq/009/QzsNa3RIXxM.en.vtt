00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
it's like a fish to them same front of

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.220 
it's like a fish to them same front of
me<00:02:18.830> and<00:02:19.100> look<00:02:19.250> at<00:02:19.340> that<00:02:19.370> I<00:02:19.760> just<00:02:20.420> chopped<00:02:21.020> it<00:02:21.050> up

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
me and look at that I just chopped it up

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.850 
me and look at that I just chopped it up
like<00:02:25.360> so<00:02:26.360> I<00:02:26.390> hadn't<00:02:26.750> had<00:02:27.020> a<00:02:27.050> suspicion<00:02:27.740> oh

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860
