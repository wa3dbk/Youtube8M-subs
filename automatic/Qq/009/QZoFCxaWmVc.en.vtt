00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.130 
now it's you know people are trying to
make<00:01:36.999> them<00:01:37.149> so<00:01:37.329> good<00:01:37.450> but<00:01:37.630> I<00:01:37.659> almost<00:01:37.869> think

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
make them so good but I almost think

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.169 
make them so good but I almost think
it's<00:01:38.320> hard<00:01:38.499> to<00:01:38.649> because<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.609> game<00:01:39.820> stories

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
it's hard to because the game stories

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:42.090 
it's hard to because the game stories
are<00:01:40.299> written<00:01:40.420> so<00:01:40.840> well<00:01:41.049> right<00:01:41.439> then<00:01:41.799> to<00:01:41.950> go

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
are written so well right then to go

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.550 
are written so well right then to go
back<00:01:42.340> it's<00:01:42.700> like<00:01:42.789> well<00:01:43.179> ok<00:01:43.749> it's<00:01:44.170> got<00:01:44.380> to<00:01:44.499> be

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
back it's like well ok it's got to be

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.050 
back it's like well ok it's got to be
better<00:01:44.679> than<00:01:44.859> the<00:01:45.130> story<00:01:45.340> that<00:01:45.490> I<00:01:45.520> get<00:01:45.759> to<00:01:45.850> play

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
better than the story that I get to play

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.179 
better than the story that I get to play
well<00:01:46.600> I<00:01:46.630> think<00:01:46.719> sometimes<00:01:47.259> that<00:01:47.740> they<00:01:47.859> have<00:01:48.039> to

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
well I think sometimes that they have to

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.249 
well I think sometimes that they have to
they<00:01:48.670> have<00:01:48.700> to<00:01:48.939> realize<00:01:49.210> it<00:01:49.359> it's<00:01:49.539> almost<00:01:49.630> come

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
they have to realize it it's almost come

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:51.660 
they have to realize it it's almost come
to<00:01:50.409> a<00:01:50.439> place<00:01:50.649> the<00:01:50.890> same<00:01:51.039> way<00:01:51.130> you<00:01:51.189> approach<00:01:51.490> a

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
to a place the same way you approach a

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.649 
to a place the same way you approach a
novel<00:01:52.240> you<00:01:52.530> have<00:01:53.530> to<00:01:54.060> not<00:01:55.060> really<00:01:55.359> worry<00:01:55.600> about

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
novel you have to not really worry about

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.149 
novel you have to not really worry about
the<00:01:55.869> people<00:01:56.079> who<00:01:56.229> have<00:01:56.259> read<00:01:56.590> it<00:01:56.619> or<00:01:56.799> played<00:01:57.009> it

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
the people who have read it or played it

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.249 
the people who have read it or played it
before<00:01:57.490> and<00:01:57.759> you<00:01:57.789> have<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:58.179> certain<00:01:58.929> elements

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
before and you have the certain elements

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.499 
before and you have the certain elements
the<00:01:59.499> ending<00:01:59.999> sometimes<00:02:00.999> have<00:02:01.119> to<00:02:01.179> change<00:02:01.359> up

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
the ending sometimes have to change up

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:02.340 
the ending sometimes have to change up
because<00:02:01.659> it's<00:02:01.780> out<00:02:01.869> there<00:02:02.049> and<00:02:02.140> it<00:02:02.229> gets

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
because it's out there and it gets

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.899 
because it's out there and it gets
spoiler<00:02:02.679> for<00:02:02.770> everybody<00:02:03.130> but<00:02:03.399> I<00:02:03.460> think<00:02:03.549> that

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
spoiler for everybody but I think that

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.760 
spoiler for everybody but I think that
yet<00:02:04.090> what<00:02:04.359> makes<00:02:04.659> it<00:02:04.869> true<00:02:05.229> I<00:02:05.259> think<00:02:05.409> you<00:02:05.619> have

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
yet what makes it true I think you have

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:06.929 
yet what makes it true I think you have
to<00:02:05.859> tell<00:02:06.009> especially<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.399> first<00:02:06.579> uncharred
