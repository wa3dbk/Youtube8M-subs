year but mess he's had a lot of injuries
and<00:01:46.520> he<00:01:47.520> can't<00:01:47.759> be<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.939> best<00:01:48.119> every<00:01:48.360> single

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
and he can't be the best every single

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.319 
and he can't be the best every single
year<00:01:48.840> surely<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:49.860> for<00:01:50.430> him<00:01:50.579> he's<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.880> pace<00:01:51.149> has

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
year surely but for him he's a pace has

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.810 
year surely but for him he's a pace has
gone<00:01:51.509> down<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.990> cincy<00:01:52.259> 410<00:01:52.860> his<00:01:53.280> dribbling<00:01:53.640> has

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
and heading up 5 i'm not exactly sure

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.090 
and heading up 5 i'm not exactly sure
how<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.689> gets<00:02:00.840> him<00:02:01.049> an<00:02:01.140> upgrade<00:02:01.409> from<00:02:01.530> 91<00:02:02.070> to

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
how that gets him an upgrade from 91 to

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.639 
how that gets him an upgrade from 91 to
94<00:02:02.700> when<00:02:02.850> some<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.090> his<00:02:03.210> key<00:02:03.420> stats<00:02:03.780> like<00:02:04.290> his

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
94 when some of his key stats like his

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.830 
94 when some of his key stats like his
like<00:02:05.070> his<00:02:05.189> pace<00:02:05.460> has<00:02:05.640> gone<00:02:05.850> down<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.119> touch<00:02:06.509> but

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
like his pace has gone down a touch but

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.809 
like his pace has gone down a touch but
that's<00:02:07.380> just<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.590> way<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.920> i<00:02:08.069> guess<00:02:08.129> an<00:02:08.520> EA

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
that's just the way is i guess an EA

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.669 
that's just the way is i guess an EA

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
his card is any good you think it'd be

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.090

have<00:02:33.360> been<00:02:33.390> so<00:02:33.690> realistically<00:02:34.200> now<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:35.190> LARM

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
have been so realistically now that LARM

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.370 
have been so realistically now that LARM
probably<00:02:35.760> would<00:02:36.000> have<00:02:36.060> been<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.210> 75<00:02:36.870> if<00:02:37.140> he<00:02:37.230> was

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
probably would have been a 75 if he was

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.530 
probably would have been a 75 if he was
that<00:02:37.530> source<00:02:37.770> situation<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.430> think<00:02:38.850> but<00:02:39.120> Alam

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
that source situation I think but Alam

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.720 
that source situation I think but Alam
took<00:02:40.020> a<00:02:40.110> massive<00:02:40.260> boost<00:02:40.560> there<00:02:41.160> in<00:02:41.310> fifa<00:02:41.610> 11

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730
