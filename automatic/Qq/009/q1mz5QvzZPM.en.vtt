this case is that on the corners on the
inside<00:01:33.970> of<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.390> case<00:01:34.630> you<00:01:35.350> have<00:01:35.650> heavy<00:01:36.130> duty

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
inside of the case you have heavy duty

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.150 
inside of the case you have heavy duty
rubber<00:01:36.880> now<00:01:37.690> this<00:01:37.900> is<00:01:38.110> extremely<00:01:38.350> important

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
rubber now this is extremely important
