people carry weight around here because

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.780 
people carry weight around here because
there's<00:03:06.109> so<00:03:06.260> many<00:03:06.349> toxins<00:03:07.099> that<00:03:07.280> are<00:03:07.340> built<00:03:07.640> up

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
there's so many toxins that are built up

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.460 
there's so many toxins that are built up
within<00:03:07.970> your<00:03:08.090> body<00:03:08.329> so<00:03:08.629> what<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.870> fat<00:03:09.109> flush

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
does is it goes in and it helps to start

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.410 
does is it goes in and it helps to start
loosening<00:03:12.980> up<00:03:13.220> those<00:03:13.430> toxins<00:03:13.459> so<00:03:14.150> that<00:03:14.299> you

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
loosening up those toxins so that you

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.210
