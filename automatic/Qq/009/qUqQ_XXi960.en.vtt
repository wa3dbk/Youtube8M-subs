out<00:03:11.549> stuff<00:03:11.879> where<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.239> players<00:03:12.480> just<00:03:12.840> just

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
out stuff where the players just just

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.620 
out stuff where the players just just
it's<00:03:14.129> not<00:03:14.250> obviously<00:03:14.609> the<00:03:14.819> stats<00:03:15.120> are<00:03:15.299> similar

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
it's not obviously the stats are similar

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.750 
it's not obviously the stats are similar
but<00:03:16.319> the<00:03:16.530> reason<00:03:16.769> for<00:03:17.160> him<00:03:17.250> being<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.549> cheap

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
but the reason for him being the cheap

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.879 
but the reason for him being the cheap
version<00:03:18.120> of<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.299> silver<00:03:18.750> version<00:03:18.959> is<00:03:19.470> because

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
version of the silver version is because

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.500 
version of the silver version is because
