00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
points right and that's called a euchre

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.190 
points right and that's called a euchre
I<00:01:31.310> don't<00:01:32.310> know<00:01:32.400> why<00:01:32.670> euchre<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.570> reserved<00:01:34.020> for

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
I don't know why euchre is reserved for

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.580 
I don't know why euchre is reserved for
setting<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.979> call<00:01:35.880> but<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.720> didn't<00:01:37.140> invent<00:01:37.409> a

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
setting a call but I didn't invent a

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.039 
setting a call but I didn't invent a
game<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.909> don't<00:01:39.270> know<00:01:39.390> that's<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.750> way<00:01:39.930> it

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
game so I don't know that's the way it

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.469 
game so I don't know that's the way it
is<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.350> take<00:01:40.799> if<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.369> set<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.970> opponent's

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
is you take if you set the opponent's

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.120 
is you take if you set the opponent's
contract<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:43.320> in<00:01:43.500> spades

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
contract like in spades

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.039 
contract like in spades
the<00:01:44.850> difference<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.509> take<00:01:45.840> two

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
the difference is that you take two

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.770 
the difference is that you take two
points<00:01:46.460> now<00:01:47.460> how<00:01:47.610> do<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.759> get<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:48.119> big<00:01:48.390> fat
