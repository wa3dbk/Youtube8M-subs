00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:09.830 
all three of these are the desert skiff

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.160 
all three of these are the desert skiff
the<00:00:10.830> first<00:00:11.099> one<00:00:11.460> right<00:00:12.150> here<00:00:12.570> this<00:00:13.110> is

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
the first one right here this is

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.810 
the first one right here this is
actually<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.740> smallest<00:00:14.040> one<00:00:14.400> as<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:14.790> can

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
actually the smallest one as you can

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.560 
actually the smallest one as you can
tell<00:00:15.179> it's<00:00:16.020> released<00:00:16.470> back<00:00:16.740> in<00:00:16.890> 2000<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:17.820> it

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
tell it's released back in 2000 and it

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.720 
tell it's released back in 2000 and it
was<00:00:18.720> by<00:00:19.020> itself<00:00:19.470> with<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:20.160> couple<00:00:20.640> of

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
was by itself with a couple of

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.790 
was by itself with a couple of
minifigures<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:22.080> was<00:00:22.199> pretty<00:00:22.410> cheap<00:00:22.619> it

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
minifigures and it was pretty cheap it

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.189 
minifigures and it was pretty cheap it
was<00:00:22.830> only<00:00:23.100> about<00:00:23.160> six<00:00:23.279> dollars<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:24.000> think<00:00:24.199> now

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
was only about six dollars I think now

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.470 
was only about six dollars I think now
this<00:00:25.500> one<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:26.369> really<00:00:26.640> can't<00:00:26.880> compare<00:00:27.330> the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
this one you really can't compare the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.720 
this one you really can't compare the
price<00:00:27.720> on<00:00:28.019> with<00:00:28.769> this<00:00:28.949> one<00:00:29.160> because<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.609> was

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
price on with this one because it was

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.190 
price on with this one because it was
released<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.269> 2006<00:00:30.929> as<00:00:31.289> part<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:33.360> Jabba's

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
released in 2006 as part of the Jabba's

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.560 
released in 2006 as part of the Jabba's
Sail<00:00:34.440> Barge<00:00:34.500> set<00:00:35.010> now<00:00:35.610> obviously<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.329> was

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
Sail Barge set now obviously this was

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.180 
Sail Barge set now obviously this was
the<00:00:36.719> smaller<00:00:36.989> part<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.440> set<00:00:37.649> Jabba's<00:00:38.040> Sail

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
the smaller part of the set Jabba's Sail

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.580 
the smaller part of the set Jabba's Sail
Barge<00:00:38.250> was<00:00:38.760> huge<00:00:39.090> compared<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:40.440> it's

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
Barge was huge compared to this so it's

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.709 
Barge was huge compared to this so it's
really<00:00:40.649> not<00:00:41.040> fair<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.399> talk<00:00:41.550> about<00:00:41.730> price<00:00:42.690> in

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
really not fair to talk about price in

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.850 
really not fair to talk about price in
comparison<00:00:43.969> because<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.660> know<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:46.590> really

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
comparison because you know you really

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.580 
comparison because you know you really
can't<00:00:47.600> compare<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.809> when<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.110> have<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.440> much

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
can't compare that when you have so much

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.439 
can't compare that when you have so much
else<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.420> set<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:53.280> it's<00:00:53.820> similar<00:00:54.270> to

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
else in that set and and it's similar to

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.819 
else in that set and and it's similar to
that<00:00:54.690> with<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.640> 2012<00:00:56.640> version<00:00:56.940> right<00:00:57.390> here<00:00:57.829> it

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
that with the 2012 version right here it

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.490 
that with the 2012 version right here it
also<00:00:59.190> came<00:00:59.699> with<00:00:59.760> these<00:01:00.059> are<00:01:00.300> like<00:01:00.480> pit<00:01:00.719> so

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
also came with these are like pit so

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.560 
also came with these are like pit so
it's<00:01:01.980> not<00:01:02.219> really<00:01:02.520> fair<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.879> talk<00:01:03.059> about<00:01:03.180> price

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
it's not really fair to talk about price

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.380 
it's not really fair to talk about price
on<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:03.989> one<00:01:04.229> either<00:01:04.700> but<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.880> basically

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
on this one either but I basically

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.370 
on this one either but I basically
wanted<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.930> review<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:08.340> kind<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.729> see<00:01:09.380> what

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
wanted to review and kind of see what

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.830 
wanted to review and kind of see what
you<00:01:10.530> guys<00:01:10.710> think<00:01:11.010> about<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:12.060> progression<00:01:12.810> of

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
you guys think about the progression of

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.550 
you guys think about the progression of
how<00:01:13.430> the<00:01:14.430> desert<00:01:14.760> skiff<00:01:15.180> has<00:01:15.720> changed<00:01:16.409> over

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
how the desert skiff has changed over

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.940 
how the desert skiff has changed over
the<00:01:16.770> years<00:01:17.090> like<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.210> said<00:01:18.450> this<00:01:19.080> was<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.560> first

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
the years like I said this was the first

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.429 
the years like I said this was the first
one<00:01:20.070> right<00:01:20.670> here<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.180> there's<00:01:21.930> really<00:01:22.140> no

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
one right here and there's really no

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.149 
one right here and there's really no
moveable<00:01:23.040> parts<00:01:24.110> except<00:01:25.110> for<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.860> know<00:01:25.890> this

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
moveable parts except for you know this

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.910 
moveable parts except for you know this
right<00:01:26.400> here<00:01:26.820> that's<00:01:27.810> basically<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:29.060> but<00:01:30.920> so

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
right here that's basically it but so

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.410 
right here that's basically it but so
there's<00:01:32.159> there's<00:01:32.610> your<00:01:32.820> first<00:01:33.030> one<00:01:33.390> right

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420

there that's you know kind of their

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.630 
there that's you know kind of their
starting<00:01:35.820> point<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:36.900> one<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.500> we<00:01:38.130> went

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
starting point and this one and we went

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.149 
starting point and this one and we went
for<00:01:39.540> quite<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.810> while<00:01:40.079> with<00:01:40.350> not<00:01:40.530> having<00:01:40.770> one

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
for quite a while with not having one

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.480 
for quite a while with not having one
this<00:01:41.759> was<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.119> 2000<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.920> one<00:01:44.189> was<00:01:44.369> in

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.730 
front here mine's coming off a little
bit<00:02:10.709> but<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.640> used<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.060> look<00:02:12.090> good

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.140 

and<00:02:15.740> you<00:02:16.040> can<00:02:16.190> also<00:02:16.900> adjust<00:02:17.900> these<00:02:18.940> much<00:02:19.940> like

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
and you can also adjust these much like

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.920
