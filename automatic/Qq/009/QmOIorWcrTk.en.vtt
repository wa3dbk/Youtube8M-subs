what we're able to do now is we can

based on the level that we have chosen

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.069 
based on the level that we have chosen
so<00:03:44.970> we've<00:03:45.120> chosen<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.630> collegiate<00:03:46.049> level

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
so we've chosen the collegiate level
