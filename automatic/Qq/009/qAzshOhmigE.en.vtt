00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:10.139
 hello now i want to talk to 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.630
 you about this form of fishing as running 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.860
 donka 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:20.369
 Well, when catching on the feeder, I had all sorts of 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:25.710
 situations but there was no blood and somehow 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:27.480
 once I caught two feeders I donâ€™t bite 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.109
 I think what to do needs to change something here 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.949
 began to change the length of the leads well 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:36.019
 experiment with Fedor well, that is 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:40.019
 we did not go but the fish do not like them 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:41.999
 nothing I did not lure well, but what to do 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:48.799
 here I think well, so I'm here a little 

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:53.719
 have fun I take off 1 Fedor I am changing 

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:55.739
 feeder rent a feeder 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.069
 I caught on paternoster 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:05.090
 I always catch on Fedor mainly on 

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:09.530
 paternoster well, I do not put a pear 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.530
 pear shaped cargo with swivel 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:20.789
 changing povodochek doing here at length there 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:22.439
 I do not remember make 60 centimeters turn on 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.570
 grandson hooks me on international 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.640
 qualifications I said already somewhere in 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.079
 mostly i use my nose small 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.359
 I'm 16 less I don't use my brain 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.820
 put a piece on 16 leashes at me 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:37.109
 there was a grandfather about length I say plus 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.130
 minus 60 centimeters 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:44.880
 Well, do not let us catch on the basis of the way 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.179
 Donkey that is, abandoned all the sinker 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.450
 lay down on the bottom of his little straighten 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:51.719
 myself 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.960
 she's kinda somewhere there but I don't know 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:58.579
 how many meters are there two and a half there how many 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:03.299
 In the bottom of the stoves downstream I slow down a little 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:07.770
 somewhere I will play with a rod 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.369
 catch gusterka got small white bream 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.370
 decline in 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:15.239
 to her box crowd more fun 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:18.690
 and after that I somehow always that 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:22.830
 when fishing on a side leash I do 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:27.390
 just as easy to change the offset we remove 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:30.659
 this video in the video about the lead 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.030
 am showing the bait I stood here like this 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:35.190
 swivel and it's all well there scarab 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.120
 to do it all I do it all 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:42.060
 bite off rather generally rented this one 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.890
 leash snap do well put a leash 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.849
 with the usual crochet is about to 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.510
 visibility put just big 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:54.299
 the hook that is, I mean stay well 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.030
 somewhere again there well what brackets 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.370
 long leash it is necessary 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.739
 you can experiment there meter 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:06.260
 60 centimeters can we can 30 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:10.019
 centimeters ie summit 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.940
 select all paste also this 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:16.549
 rigging 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:21.599
 leashes and so successfully catch white fish 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:25.700
 peaceful fish so to say no predator than 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:29.010
 Of course paternoster is bad in this case 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.629
 on current for current 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.760
 here it is very twisted 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:37.620
 everything seems to be not good but in 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.590
 principle also possible to catch the form 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.590
 nothing of course when fishing for 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.720
 detachable leash features such 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:52.139
 design very much to me like this 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.120
 way from such a knitting tap 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:56.720
 the leash is very sensitive here 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:02.359
 all amazing all clarity beautiful 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:06.419
 tired of us catching again peaceful fish all 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:10.379
 we put on 5 here we change the leash here 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:13.169
 we put the offset set let 's let 's catch on 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:15.840
 wobbler let's not get caught set let's 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:21.139
 on the spoon let's let's on the test stick 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.139
 for god's sake there is no let 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.400
 so went the fish caught again stopped 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:31.090
 rf again let's catch me all work 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.640
 what good is running donke you are on the move 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.190
 you are looking for the fish that is the most 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.750
 various places let's say yes with 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.060
 Fedor we sit and fed in one 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.070
 place everything is hard there we catch well somewhere 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.690
 other miss cool running donka you 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.090
 can pass even though kilometer bang 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.610
 how much 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:53.350
 also if here already said yes here 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:55.570
 use such here are the bags with two 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.710
 barbs color here when fishing on 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:01.600
 testers 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:03.660
 when catching the way it even happens 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.180
 use only here such cargo to 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.150
 just like when it comes to spinning 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.130
 use the paradise stick when fishing for 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:21.400
 running donk 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:25.260
 that is, less hooks that is, you always 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:29.740
 you can think of course with your head 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:34.270
 to diversify my fishing that is but 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:36.340
 if but not bite well sit there well 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.760
 no way but there are such cases of course there 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:42.750
 even professional athletes have such 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:45.340
 happens to be lured and lured cool 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:48.240
 bait cool but does not go well means 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:51.340
 so let's go if the mountain doesn't go to 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:54.310
 Magomed then Magomed will come on and on 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:58.080
 will do and we take we catch the undercarriage 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:02.110
 donkey get pleasure 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:05.050
 of course I came across a fish not like that 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:07.780
 too big to give there podlesch here 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:12.970
 roach gusterka we do not care at least 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:18.000
 some excitement come home anyway 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:24.790
 the word because we are looking for fish we 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:27.030
 throw in various places here and 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:31.509
 everything is in principle 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:38.620
 this catching running house is very exciting 

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:40.810
