00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.279
 to believe 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.400

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.440

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.500

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.340

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.030

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:45.360
 Please, I told you to open your typical karama. 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.500
 on page 42 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.500
 That's how you're going to be a director. 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.180
 hi jonas people do not want to work my 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.640
 friends requests from others 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.219
 You made it clear that they are not 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.219
 your students withholding please 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:14.380
 It's okay to be rebellious, to be yourself and 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.780
 does not respect the rules but they are 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.780
 rule csp immediately 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.289
 I told you to sit down with this 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.600
 Suspicious and rebellious to think with 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:31.119
 uncovered head 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.530
 if the two do not sit down right now it is not 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.640
 Suspension is this with I'm rebellious to do 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.679
 what you believe 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.280
 I will not admit that this is 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:45.130
 reveals of my partner against the idea of 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.789
 Doing what I think right reveals our 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:52.229
 impose being rebellious to question the 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.229
 Last time I'll talk 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:12.480
 that looks like her daughter's attack 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.870
 I do not know, it was not you who said here. 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.850
 I'm just a student and not only I 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.820
 I can not believe you lifted it too. 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:29.490
 hotel 80 up to a penny high 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:35.000
 I will overcome passing the inter ter 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:38.100
 Suspends we do something that I 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.600
 I do not teach in school any more, remember me 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:45.750
 I have more power over students not 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:47.190
 Do you know if he's going to play? 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.880
 you can not prove your 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.560
 students 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.770
 Do you think you have any power over a 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.920
 safety 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:00.420
 you spoke in an advantage 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.420
 You have every right, Mr. Director. 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.710
 that's your idea 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:18.570
 Of course I have not seen them is that 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:18.570
 I watch a lot of movies, movies 11 wins 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.400
 they knew how to mark you who taught 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.709
 we teacher now only decisions 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.019
 Pedro that will not even leave 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.299
 Unfortunately he's always leaving. 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.099
 latest we showed to them 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.109
 have shown that they have 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.000
 authoritarian are different things and 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:48.970
 unfortunately I had already told him 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.519
 showed that nothing is able to cope 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.889
 peaceful resistance as you have finished 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:57.599
 have shown that you have 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:57.599
 identity and courage 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:03.939
 but unfortunately nothing changed the jonas 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.500
 changed and I have no choice but to go 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:07.299
 though you do with the class how does the 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.760
 People will be able to face Jonas I 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.620
 just for one person I'm just more 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:16.840
 A person 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:19.180
 six are much stronger because you 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.880
 They are a united group you looked at 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.970
 people may have helped with more 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.610
 the action was yours 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:30.190
 Congratulations big thing is even said that 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.720
 the jonas changed nothing advanced study that 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.150
 said much 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.479
 showed that nothing will ever be the 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.849
 even though the power of intimidation was over 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.949
 if he wants to convince anyone of any 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:43.990
 It's going to have to be another way. 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:46.210
 Here you go, though. 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.280
 because I do not believe in his methods and 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.340
 When I do not believe in something, I do not 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.870
 I can do it right, too. 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.820
 also that the fact is not if you do 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.289
 he made the difference the difference that 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.360
 You are here to learn and the 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:01.630
 learning goes through this 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.240
 I 'm here to offer to 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.250
 teach something and if what I have to give 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.870
 It's different than Jonas War 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.510
 I can not do anything, I mean go 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.280
 help not running away from anything I 'm not in the 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.690
 Mine of you that I'm only here 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.190
 an employee was running away from 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.570
 whatever shape you 're not facing 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.830
 jonas far 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.500
 Do you remember what I said about being? 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.480
 rebel rebel is to be not accept 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:29.100
 levy is not accept what comes from 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:31.710
 out and understand and do because the 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:36.900
 movement comes from inside seeing the 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:39.240
 understanding it is the force it to accept 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.220
 a defeat will not bring any good 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:45.600
 will make the most angry yet 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:48.510
 he needs to understand the understanding he has 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:51.210
 that come from him and he needs to understand that 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.550
 to proceed in this way is nothing 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.190
 This will only work if it comes from you. 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.919
 not me because I felt because 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:01.800
 I believe in you or not 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:04.320
 Jonas cares very much about each of 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:07.110
 do you worry about the formation of 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.300
 do you care about the methods of 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.160
 schools in me he only had one 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.440
 opponent, he may even lose this 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.570
 battle but it turns out this 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:21.750
 here in a war where everyone ends up 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:25.380
 thus losing you a future only 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.910
 you have the power to make change jonas 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.490
 Do you think we'll get it? 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.560
 I do not think it matters who has to 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.310
 to believe 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:38.050
 It's you if we can 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:41.770
 you back absolutely yes 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.770
 That's why I'm not even going to say goodbye. 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.370
 So
