consists<00:01:38.869> of<00:01:38.929> five<00:01:39.259> capture<00:01:39.830> points<00:01:40.159> on<00:01:40.280> the

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
consists of five capture points on the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.160 
consists of five capture points on the
map<00:01:40.670> and<00:01:40.939> it<00:01:41.060> was<00:01:41.179> actually<00:01:41.479> three<00:01:41.780> on<00:01:41.899> some<00:01:42.080> of

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
map and it was actually three on some of

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.719 
map and it was actually three on some of
the<00:01:42.259> smaller<00:01:42.530> maps<00:01:42.799> now<00:01:43.310> when<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:43.579> game

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
the smaller maps now when the game

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.639 
the smaller maps now when the game
starts<00:01:44.179> the<00:01:44.360> center<00:01:44.810> capture<00:01:45.200> point<00:01:45.409> is<00:01:45.530> the

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
starts the center capture point is the

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.950 
starts the center capture point is the
active<00:01:46.070> one<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:46.820> idea<00:01:47.270> was<00:01:47.509> you<00:01:47.570> had<00:01:47.840> to

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
active one and the idea was you had to

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.929 
active one and the idea was you had to
capture<00:01:48.200> that<00:01:48.530> point<00:01:48.890> and<00:01:49.070> then<00:01:49.369> if<00:01:49.549> you<00:01:49.700> did

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
capture that point and then if you did

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:51.730 
capture that point and then if you did
you<00:01:50.119> could<00:01:50.299> move<00:01:50.450> on<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.899> next<00:01:51.110> one<00:01:51.500> and

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
you could move on to the next one and

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.649 
you could move on to the next one and
you<00:01:51.890> had<00:01:52.039> to<00:01:52.189> push<00:01:52.429> the<00:01:52.610> enemy<00:01:52.729> back<00:01:52.909> into

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
you had to push the enemy back into

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.779 
you had to push the enemy back into
their<00:01:53.810> spawn<00:01:54.170> now<00:01:54.679> if<00:01:54.920> you<00:01:55.069> actually<00:01:55.190> lost<00:01:55.610> the

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
their spawn now if you actually lost the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.249 
their spawn now if you actually lost the
flag<00:01:56.030> and<00:01:56.149> got<00:01:56.299> pushed<00:01:56.569> back<00:01:56.630> further<00:01:57.020> into

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
flag and got pushed back further into

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:58.630 
flag and got pushed back further into
your<00:01:57.350> own<00:01:57.470> spawn<00:01:57.830> then<00:01:58.009> you<00:01:58.069> have<00:01:58.220> to<00:01:58.340> win<00:01:58.520> that

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
your own spawn then you have to win that

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.820 
your own spawn then you have to win that
back<00:01:58.880> and<00:01:59.270> then<00:01:59.479> go<00:01:59.659> all<00:01:59.899> the<00:01:59.929> way<00:02:00.110> across<00:02:00.649> the

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
back and then go all the way across the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.490 
back and then go all the way across the
map<00:02:00.979> again<00:02:01.159> this<00:02:01.850> actually<00:02:02.270> led<00:02:02.450> to<00:02:02.479> a<00:02:02.840> ton<00:02:03.259> of

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
map again this actually led to a ton of

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.109 
map again this actually led to a ton of
fun<00:02:03.740> gunfire<00:02:04.280> it's<00:02:04.429> kind<00:02:04.610> of<00:02:04.700> similar<00:02:04.970> to

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
fun gunfire it's kind of similar to

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.880 
fun gunfire it's kind of similar to
hardpoint<00:02:05.720> in<00:02:05.869> some<00:02:06.080> ways<00:02:06.289> capturing<00:02:06.770> the

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
hardpoint in some ways capturing the

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.740 
hardpoint in some ways capturing the
point<00:02:07.099> and<00:02:07.520> then<00:02:07.610> all<00:02:07.759> being<00:02:07.939> centralized<00:02:08.569> in

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
point and then all being centralized in

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.600 
point and then all being centralized in
a<00:02:08.780> central<00:02:09.140> point<00:02:09.349> also<00:02:09.979> is<00:02:10.099> kind<00:02:10.280> of<00:02:10.429> unique

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
a central point also is kind of unique

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.550 
a central point also is kind of unique
it<00:02:10.940> had<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.239> momentum<00:02:11.510> system<00:02:12.170> in<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.349> bottom

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
it had the momentum system in the bottom

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.170 
it had the momentum system in the bottom
left<00:02:12.739> hand<00:02:12.799> corner<00:02:12.950> there<00:02:13.549> was<00:02:13.580> a<00:02:13.670> momentum

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
left hand corner there was a momentum

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.520 
left hand corner there was a momentum
bar<00:02:14.360> and<00:02:14.599> once<00:02:14.720> it<00:02:14.870> got<00:02:14.959> to<00:02:15.019> a<00:02:15.140> certain<00:02:15.380> point

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
bar and once it got to a certain point

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.170 
bar and once it got to a certain point
it<00:02:16.130> would<00:02:16.220> mean<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:16.400> you<00:02:16.519> would<00:02:16.610> capture<00:02:16.970> the

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
it would mean that you would capture the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.479 
it would mean that you would capture the
flag<00:02:17.510> even<00:02:18.019> quicker<00:02:18.260> now<00:02:18.830> although<00:02:19.010> this<00:02:19.280> was

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
flag even quicker now although this was

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.039 
flag even quicker now although this was
great<00:02:19.849> and<00:02:20.030> if<00:02:20.120> you<00:02:20.150> really<00:02:20.540> want<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:20.750> play<00:02:20.900> the

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
great and if you really want to play the

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.559 
great and if you really want to play the
objective<00:02:21.140> it<00:02:21.709> was<00:02:21.830> a<00:02:21.860> lot<00:02:22.130> of<00:02:22.160> fun<00:02:22.489> to<00:02:22.670> do<00:02:22.849> very

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
objective it was a lot of fun to do very

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.240 
objective it was a lot of fun to do very
much<00:02:23.810> a<00:02:23.840> massively<00:02:24.290> objective<00:02:24.799> based<00:02:25.010> game

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
much a massively objective based game

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.979 
much a massively objective based game
but<00:02:25.579> however<00:02:25.820> if<00:02:26.180> you<00:02:26.299> did<00:02:26.480> want<00:02:26.660> to<00:02:26.720> kind<00:02:26.930> of

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
but however if you did want to kind of

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.630 
but however if you did want to kind of
string<00:02:27.290> it<00:02:27.380> out<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:27.500> bit<00:02:27.620> and<00:02:27.920> just<00:02:28.070> rack<00:02:28.459> up<00:02:28.609> a

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
string it out a bit and just rack up a

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.550 
string it out a bit and just rack up a
ton<00:02:28.970> of<00:02:29.000> kills<00:02:29.299> you<00:02:29.450> kind<00:02:29.810> of<00:02:29.989> do<00:02:30.079> that<00:02:30.230> as<00:02:30.410> well

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
ton of kills you kind of do that as well

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.259 
ton of kills you kind of do that as well
it's<00:02:30.739> a<00:02:30.769> little<00:02:30.920> bit<00:02:31.070> sneaky<00:02:31.310> you<00:02:31.880> could<00:02:32.060> hold

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
it's a little bit sneaky you could hold

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.030 
it's a little bit sneaky you could hold
off<00:02:32.450> on<00:02:32.630> capturing<00:02:32.989> those<00:02:33.140> last<00:02:33.440> flags<00:02:33.739> and

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
off on capturing those last flags and

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.440 
off on capturing those last flags and
just<00:02:34.430> try<00:02:34.609> and<00:02:34.730> make<00:02:34.850> sure<00:02:35.090> that<00:02:35.269> you<00:02:35.329> actually

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
just try and make sure that you actually

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.090 
just try and make sure that you actually
just<00:02:35.750> got<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:35.870> town<00:02:36.170> of<00:02:36.319> kills<00:02:36.590> just<00:02:36.829> for<00:02:37.040> the

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
just got a town of kills just for the

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.590 
just got a town of kills just for the
fun<00:02:37.280> of<00:02:37.310> it<00:02:37.489> because<00:02:37.730> you<00:02:38.060> know<00:02:38.090> that's<00:02:38.390> one<00:02:38.540> of

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
fun of it because you know that's one of

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.940 
fun of it because you know that's one of
the<00:02:38.660> main<00:02:38.810> things<00:02:39.049> we<00:02:39.140> love<00:02:39.319> doing<00:02:39.530> call<00:02:39.859> of

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
the main things we love doing call of

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:40.360 
the main things we love doing call of
duty

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
duty

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.740 
duty
it's<00:02:40.459> just<00:02:40.640> out-and-out<00:02:41.030> slaying<00:02:41.359> getting<00:02:41.690> a

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
it's just out-and-out slaying getting a

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.390 
it's just out-and-out slaying getting a
ton<00:02:41.959> of<00:02:41.989> kills<00:02:42.319> getting<00:02:42.739> you<00:02:42.829> kill<00:02:43.040> streaks

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
ton of kills getting you kill streaks

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.370 
ton of kills getting you kill streaks
however<00:02:43.970> if<00:02:44.180> you<00:02:44.299> do<00:02:44.480> do<00:02:44.660> that<00:02:44.840> you<00:02:44.959> do<00:02:45.109> risk

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
however if you do do that you do risk

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.930 
however if you do do that you do risk
perhaps<00:02:45.799> not<00:02:46.040> even<00:02:46.069> winning<00:02:46.519> in<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.730> game

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
perhaps not even winning in the game

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.670 
perhaps not even winning in the game
because<00:02:47.150> at<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.569> end<00:02:47.600> of<00:02:47.810> a<00:02:47.870> time<00:02:48.140> limit<00:02:48.350> goes

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
because at the end of a time limit goes

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.770 
because at the end of a time limit goes
to<00:02:48.890> a<00:02:48.980> playoff<00:02:49.250> tie<00:02:49.609> at<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:49.880> end<00:02:50.090> wherein

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
to a playoff tie at the end wherein

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.509 
to a playoff tie at the end wherein
there's<00:02:51.019> just<00:02:51.230> one<00:02:51.410> centralized<00:02:51.950> flag<00:02:52.250> and

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
there's just one centralized flag and

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.190 
there's just one centralized flag and
whoever<00:02:52.790> captures<00:02:53.209> that<00:02:53.359> first<00:02:53.660> wins<00:02:54.079> the

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
whoever captures that first wins the

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.990 
whoever captures that first wins the
round<00:02:54.410> so<00:02:54.769> although<00:02:54.950> you<00:02:55.130> want<00:02:55.430> to<00:02:55.519> maybe<00:02:55.760> hold

depending<00:03:50.140> on<00:03:50.440> which<00:03:50.590> game<00:03:50.860> then<00:03:51.400> you

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
depending on which game then you

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.610 
depending on which game then you

actually win and you just can't get
enough<00:03:53.740> kills<00:03:54.130> just<00:03:54.459> by<00:03:54.610> camping<00:03:55.209> in<00:03:55.360> one

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
enough kills just by camping in one

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.480 
enough kills just by camping in one
sport<00:03:55.870> if<00:03:55.959> you<00:03:56.020> camp<00:03:56.290> in<00:03:56.440> one<00:03:56.590> spot<00:03:56.890> and<00:03:57.070> don't

play aggressive at all you'll never get
the<00:03:59.230> win<00:03:59.380> so<00:03:59.650> this<00:03:59.830> is<00:03:59.980> really<00:04:00.130> to<00:04:00.220> combat<00:04:00.700> that

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
the win so this is really to combat that

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.940 
the win so this is really to combat that
kind<00:04:01.330> of<00:04:01.420> overly<00:04:01.870> defensive<00:04:02.020> style<00:04:02.560> that<00:04:02.770> no

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
kind of overly defensive style that no

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.470 
kind of overly defensive style that no
one<00:04:03.130> really<00:04:03.310> likes<00:04:03.520> playing<00:04:03.850> kids<00:04:04.090> and<00:04:04.330> I

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
one really likes playing kids and I

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.820 
one really likes playing kids and I
think<00:04:04.720> it<00:04:04.810> does<00:04:04.959> a<00:04:04.990> really<00:04:05.050> good<00:04:05.380> job<00:04:05.530> of<00:04:05.590> it<00:04:05.770> I

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
think it does a really good job of it I

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.560 
think it does a really good job of it I
think<00:04:05.950> it's<00:04:06.220> I<00:04:06.400> do<00:04:06.459> and<00:04:06.730> black<00:04:06.880> ops<00:04:07.030> 2<00:04:07.300> as<00:04:07.450> well

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
think it's I do and black ops 2 as well

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.390 
think it's I do and black ops 2 as well

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
it's at number three at number two I've

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.950 
it's at number three at number two I've
decided<00:04:25.030> to<00:04:25.180> go<00:04:25.360> we've<00:04:25.510> searched<00:04:25.780> and

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
decided to go we've searched and

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.270 
decided to go we've searched and
destroyed<00:04:26.290> now<00:04:26.530> and<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:26.740> number<00:04:26.980> one<00:04:27.130> and

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
destroyed now and the number one and

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.800 
destroyed now and the number one and
number<00:04:27.370> two<00:04:27.520> picks<00:04:27.970> were<00:04:28.150> kind<00:04:28.360> of<00:04:28.419> difficult

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
number two picks were kind of difficult

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.180 
number two picks were kind of difficult
for<00:04:28.840> me<00:04:29.050> I<00:04:29.080> was<00:04:29.230> considering<00:04:29.620> putting<00:04:29.950> this<00:04:30.010> as

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
for me I was considering putting this as

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.220 
for me I was considering putting this as
number<00:04:30.430> one<00:04:30.640> but<00:04:31.120> this<00:04:31.270> is<00:04:31.390> my<00:04:31.570> personal<00:04:31.630> top<00:04:32.169> 5

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
number one but this is my personal top 5

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.780 
number one but this is my personal top 5
and<00:04:32.560> I've<00:04:32.620> probably<00:04:32.740> put<00:04:32.980> more<00:04:33.190> time<00:04:33.460> into<00:04:33.640> the

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
and I've probably put more time into the

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:34.890 
and I've probably put more time into the
number<00:04:33.970> one<00:04:34.090> choice<00:04:34.300> so<00:04:34.510> we'll<00:04:34.630> talk<00:04:34.780> about

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
number one choice so we'll talk about

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.510 
number one choice so we'll talk about
that<00:04:35.169> in<00:04:35.290> a<00:04:35.350> second<00:04:35.770> but<00:04:36.160> anyway

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
that in a second but anyway

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.670

watched<00:05:43.129> a<00:05:43.250> lot<00:05:43.370> of<00:05:43.400> my<00:05:43.580> videos<00:05:43.789> and<00:05:44.330> have

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 
watched a lot of my videos and have

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:46.210 
watched a lot of my videos and have
watch<00:05:44.569> my<00:05:44.750> gameplay<00:05:45.139> over<00:05:45.379> the<00:05:45.470> years<00:05:45.770> know

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
watch my gameplay over the years know

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.279 
watch my gameplay over the years know
it's<00:05:46.340> pretty<00:05:46.550> much<00:05:46.789> all<00:05:47.030> I<00:05:47.090> play<00:05:47.569> and<00:05:47.870> surely

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
it's pretty much all I play and surely

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:50.409 
it's pretty much all I play and surely
that<00:05:48.560> is<00:05:48.800> a<00:05:48.830> sign<00:05:49.129> of<00:05:49.460> a<00:05:49.550> really<00:05:49.729> great<00:05:50.090> game

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 
that is a sign of a really great game

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:52.330 
that is a sign of a really great game
mode<00:05:50.659> from<00:05:50.870> my<00:05:50.990> perspective<00:05:51.259> anyway<00:05:51.680> some

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
mode from my perspective anyway some

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.950 
mode from my perspective anyway some
people<00:05:52.370> don't<00:05:52.819> enjoy<00:05:52.909> it<00:05:53.150> as<00:05:53.360> much<00:05:53.389> but<00:05:53.870> I

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
people don't enjoy it as much but I

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.350 
people don't enjoy it as much but I
prefer<00:05:54.289> TDM<00:05:54.830> and<00:05:55.250> competitive<00:05:55.759> stuff<00:05:55.970> but<00:05:56.210> for

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
prefer TDM and competitive stuff but for

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.450 
prefer TDM and competitive stuff but for
me<00:05:56.479> domination<00:05:57.110> is<00:05:57.289> the<00:05:57.740> ultimate<00:05:58.069> game<00:05:58.280> mode

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
me domination is the ultimate game mode

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.459 
me domination is the ultimate game mode
I<00:05:58.550> think<00:05:58.759> it<00:05:58.879> was<00:05:58.969> perfected<00:05:59.389> in<00:05:59.780> black<00:06:00.020> ops<00:06:00.199> 2

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:00.469 
I think it was perfected in black ops 2

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:02.379 
I think it was perfected in black ops 2
because<00:06:01.069> you<00:06:01.159> get<00:06:01.400> the<00:06:01.580> extra<00:06:01.940> points<00:06:02.360> for

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:02.389 
because you get the extra points for

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:04.209 
because you get the extra points for
actually<00:06:02.719> getting<00:06:02.840> capture<00:06:03.409> kills<00:06:03.650> which<00:06:04.069> is

00:06:04.209 --> 00:06:04.219 
actually getting capture kills which is

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:05.559 
actually getting capture kills which is
something<00:06:04.520> that<00:06:04.639> could<00:06:04.759> really<00:06:04.819> boost<00:06:05.389> your

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:05.569 
something that could really boost your

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:07.209 
something that could really boost your
score<00:06:05.900> and<00:06:06.020> also<00:06:06.289> made<00:06:06.469> it<00:06:06.560> a<00:06:06.620> little<00:06:06.860> bit<00:06:07.069> more

00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:07.219 
score and also made it a little bit more

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:09.040 
score and also made it a little bit more
exciting<00:06:07.729> when<00:06:08.090> trying<00:06:08.360> to<00:06:08.389> capture<00:06:08.840> a<00:06:08.870> flag

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
exciting when trying to capture a flag

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.719 
exciting when trying to capture a flag
now<00:06:09.409> this<00:06:09.620> has<00:06:09.770> been<00:06:09.919> in<00:06:10.039> pretty<00:06:10.219> much<00:06:10.280> all<00:06:10.520> of

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:10.729 
now this has been in pretty much all of

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:12.580 
now this has been in pretty much all of
the<00:06:10.819> Call<00:06:11.030> of<00:06:11.060> Duty's<00:06:11.449> that<00:06:12.050> have<00:06:12.139> come<00:06:12.349> out<00:06:12.469> in

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
the Call of Duty's that have come out in

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.920 
the Call of Duty's that have come out in
recent<00:06:12.620> times<00:06:13.099> obviously<00:06:13.940> since<00:06:14.210> cod4<00:06:14.449> and

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
recent times obviously since cod4 and

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.290 
recent times obviously since cod4 and
the<00:06:15.560> idea<00:06:15.889> is<00:06:16.099> there's<00:06:16.430> free<00:06:16.669> flags<00:06:17.000> on<00:06:17.210> the

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
the idea is there's free flags on the

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.149 
the idea is there's free flags on the
map<00:06:17.539> you<00:06:17.930> have<00:06:18.050> to<00:06:18.199> capture<00:06:18.500> and<00:06:18.800> hold<00:06:18.919> those

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:19.159 
map you have to capture and hold those

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:21.100 
map you have to capture and hold those
points<00:06:19.699> if<00:06:19.969> you<00:06:20.180> actually<00:06:20.479> capture<00:06:20.659> a<00:06:20.870> point

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
points if you actually capture a point

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.320 
points if you actually capture a point
you<00:06:21.319> will<00:06:21.469> rack<00:06:21.680> up<00:06:21.860> score<00:06:22.219> the<00:06:22.699> more<00:06:22.879> capture

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
you will rack up score the more capture

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.670 
you will rack up score the more capture
points<00:06:23.629> that<00:06:23.750> you<00:06:23.840> have<00:06:23.870> the<00:06:24.289> faster<00:06:24.560> your

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:24.680 
points that you have the faster your

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.610 
points that you have the faster your
score<00:06:25.280> obviously<00:06:25.759> now<00:06:26.240> for<00:06:26.479> me<00:06:26.659> the<00:06:26.900> ideal<00:06:27.379> was

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
score obviously now for me the ideal was

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.559 
score obviously now for me the ideal was
always<00:06:28.039> to<00:06:28.219> just<00:06:28.400> capture<00:06:28.789> two<00:06:29.000> flags<00:06:29.360> and

00:06:29.559 --> 00:06:29.569 
always to just capture two flags and

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:31.089 
always to just capture two flags and
keep<00:06:29.719> them<00:06:29.870> kind<00:06:30.050> of<00:06:30.199> pending<00:06:30.680> because<00:06:30.830> one<00:06:31.069> of

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:31.099 
keep them kind of pending because one of

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:33.249 
keep them kind of pending because one of
the<00:06:31.340> annoyances<00:06:32.210> in<00:06:32.270> Call<00:06:32.569> of<00:06:32.599> Duty<00:06:33.050> is<00:06:33.229> the

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:33.259 
the annoyances in Call of Duty is the

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:35.769 
the annoyances in Call of Duty is the
fact<00:06:33.740> that<00:06:33.860> the<00:06:34.099> respawn<00:06:34.639> points<00:06:35.120> are<00:06:35.240> a<00:06:35.509> bit

00:06:35.769 --> 00:06:35.779 
fact that the respawn points are a bit

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:38.110 
fact that the respawn points are a bit
funky<00:06:36.289> sometimes<00:06:36.529> the<00:06:36.889> spawn<00:06:37.130> points<00:06:37.520> all

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 
funky sometimes the spawn points all

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.760 
funky sometimes the spawn points all
over<00:06:38.509> the<00:06:38.599> place<00:06:38.779> especially<00:06:38.930> in<00:06:39.289> TDM<00:06:39.740> and

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770 
over the place especially in TDM and

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.110 
over the place especially in TDM and
people<00:06:40.190> will<00:06:40.279> shoot<00:06:40.460> you<00:06:40.550> in<00:06:40.639> the<00:06:40.729> back<00:06:40.940> and

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 
people will shoot you in the back and

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.120 
people will shoot you in the back and
that<00:06:41.569> already<00:06:41.960> feel<00:06:42.110> fair<00:06:42.349> to<00:06:42.500> me<00:06:42.680> so<00:06:43.009> that's

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:43.130 
that already feel fair to me so that's

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.830 
that already feel fair to me so that's
was<00:06:43.250> always<00:06:43.580> drawn<00:06:43.909> to<00:06:43.940> domination<00:06:44.599> where<00:06:44.750> you

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 
was always drawn to domination where you

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.629 
was always drawn to domination where you
roughly<00:06:45.229> knew<00:06:45.469> where<00:06:45.770> the<00:06:45.919> enemy<00:06:45.949> would<00:06:46.340> spawn

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 
roughly knew where the enemy would spawn

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:48.610 
roughly knew where the enemy would spawn
and<00:06:46.909> why<00:06:47.210> also<00:06:47.449> would<00:06:47.779> never<00:06:48.020> ready<00:06:48.229> to<00:06:48.380> try<00:06:48.560> to

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:48.620 
and why also would never ready to try to

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.439 
and why also would never ready to try to
cap<00:06:48.889> free<00:06:49.159> flags<00:06:49.460> I<00:06:49.669> obviously<00:06:50.029> understand

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:50.449 
cap free flags I obviously understand

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:51.939 
cap free flags I obviously understand
the<00:06:50.539> importance<00:06:50.900> of<00:06:50.990> winning<00:06:51.139> the<00:06:51.319> game<00:06:51.529> at

the importance of winning the game at

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:53.320 
the importance of winning the game at
the<00:06:52.039> same<00:06:52.099> point<00:06:52.490> you<00:06:52.580> can<00:06:52.759> easily<00:06:53.150> win<00:06:53.300> the

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:55.310 
game with two flags so for me I just

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.159 
game with two flags so for me I just
have<00:06:55.729> loads<00:06:56.090> of<00:06:56.300> good<00:06:56.479> memories<00:06:56.870> of<00:06:56.900> playing

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:02.569 
long games close games and this game was

00:07:04.119 --> 00:07:04.129 
seen here actually the gameplay footage

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:06.010 
seen here actually the gameplay footage
was<00:07:04.550> from<00:07:04.639> a<00:07:04.759> black<00:07:04.940> ops<00:07:05.120> 2<00:07:05.330> domination<00:07:05.840> game

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:06.020 
was from a black ops 2 domination game

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.809 
was from a black ops 2 domination game
which<00:07:06.199> was<00:07:06.289> one<00:07:06.529> of<00:07:06.560> my<00:07:06.650> favorite<00:07:07.279> ones<00:07:07.460> of<00:07:07.580> all

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:09.979
