00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hi north this video i'm going to you 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.569
 give three elements that will you 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.859
 to better work the guitar 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.719
 to progress faster 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.059
 it's been a long time I beat and 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.710
 videos on that I'm going to give a lot of 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.210
 technique lately so here I 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.310
 am a bit of a special video for 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.580
 come back to those things that hold me to 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.590
 heart 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.330
 all these elements that allow for 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.439
 finally maybe spend a little less 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.230
 of time doing things law 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.000
 on hectare to go to 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.160
 the essential and therefore play what we 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.019
 Interested more quickly our two 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.059
 fellows with three things that cater to 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.440
 beginners as well as 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.460
 musicians or already a certain level 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.020
 so the first one is going to be skin her 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.610
 rabbits late so I will come back more 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.960
 late even if you do not necessarily want 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.170
 to make this word at first 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.660
 pau it's the cat the second thing this 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.270
 will be working slowly so I 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.149
 will come back and the third thing it will be 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.010
 not to scatter and to stay 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.199
 target specific points 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.829
 so I 'll give it all in six 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.049
 So am here you seem a first 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.119
 beautiful is the pinta even if you start 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.010
 the guitar here you may have 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.860
 the intention in a future more or less 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.470
 close regardless of putting yourself at 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.380
 solo to put to improvise 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.909
 and if you know already played there 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.060
 pentatonic in the parabolic it's 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.060
 it 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.840
 if you already have this range in them 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.270
 fingers he will then want improvised 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.619
 there will be more to choosing your notes to 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.990
 put the right notes you will be more 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.329
 to ask you to start the position 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.289
 she notes I have to do that you 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.270
 theirs is already in your fingers you 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.950
 will know already played this range and we this 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.079
 will be much simpler to go into 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.759
 improvisation because if you 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.859
 do not know well you'll be there 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.390
 will you know that it will play on 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:50.700
 the pinta and so you will need is 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.740
 what are called resolutions but 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.950
 you will spend your time looking for 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.899
 your resolutions where they are and two to 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.489
 look for your bertal position because 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.989
 that you will not know yet if you 

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:02.369
 start the sras would not recognize yet 

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:04.170
 very well 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.459
 the devil so suddenly if you 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.319
 already know the range he had 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:08.789
 well in your fingers if you know you 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.790
 to walk on it even before 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.220
 to improvise and well it will be a lot 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.430
 simpler for you to approach 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.920
 improvisation 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.810
 that's it and that's fine 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.980
 speak very quickly his parents this is where 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.739
 on it I'm going to open soon a 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.959
 class this lot in the private group 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.970
 so here I will post videos on 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.030
 to learn techniques from this lot 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.889
 to improvise and we exchange so has in 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.540
 sum the videos you will see me what 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:35.040
 you play and so I correct you ray 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.560
 I will explain to you a little bit 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.870
 improve it's all I told them 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.099
 a little later the second element that 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.930
 is going to be important she worked 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:48.180
 Slowly and any compounds 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.829
 why slowly because if you 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.090
 go quickly you will not have time to 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:54.329
 pay attention to your placement 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.880
 rhythmic audois you use and of 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:59.400
 remember everything when you play so 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.739
 work slowly and decomposing 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.329
