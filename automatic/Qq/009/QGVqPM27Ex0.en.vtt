00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:07.950
 good Come on, let's make this video 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.099
 here to demonstrate in versions for 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.500
 you, because this is an adaptation 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.070
 the child to ask a customer 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:21.600
 I put a rear whale that he 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.550
 wants to print and I'm here to 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.730
 people can not pass a millimeter 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:34.520
 Your paper friend will make the curve. 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:54.090
 then with a rear ac dc flag 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:01:10.549
 that I also play the role of her is a 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:10.549
 cast of 25 here also because it inserted 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:20.000
 staff to proceed with because 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:51.950
 Here the tray that will get stronger 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.950
 to insert 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.970
 woman with the ips will not pass the hat 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.030
 white and this time is the time it 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.130
 There's a pen here in the pen. 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.510
 I did it there so we did not 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.070
 lose here 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:12.280
 the printing was paper, so it's just 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:16.300
 tighten a little bit what is normal 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:22.660
 I do not want to ask innovation 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:30.790
 paper and beat him I gave him a 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:32.920
 A little more to have a second 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:38.910
 chance 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.910
 Let's squeeze a show here. 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.720
 the favela is right 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:06.120
 that started tea on leaving regret 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.950
 get the hang of it because I just did it 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.660
 collections are the first people to 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:15.060
 they are doing there then it is also ours 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.950
 experience but there as one picks up 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:22.440
 the way of the thing but still quite 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:24.330
 because there is no secret night the beginning and 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.230
 sometimes we also pick up a little 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:31.010
 But once you get the hang of it, it goes a long way. 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.010
 well the pressure 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:58.860
 It is such an impression on the quality of 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.080
 Image 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.959
 it takes a little longer to print 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.780
 great we could do there is a 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:11.150
 another is that the impression that ended 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.150
 I would like to be a more agile business 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:18.750
 But then I shouted that you 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.870
 makes any material if 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:25.680
 believe that it is not in that capacity 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:31.590
 that we could play online from there 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:36.180
 she was far from being someone of 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:42.350
 a soldier got the very quality 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.350
 good impression can see in the details 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.450
 really want 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:22.060
 here gave a smile 15 there because pvc 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:25.389
 Tammuz when he stop writing if 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:28.060
 he's a little bit up and 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:29.800
 there he ended up touching his tongue 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.770
 experience has reticence that pvc 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:36.370
 The old man I had there is just to make a 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:39.240
 test but I have it right here and it will not 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.240
 get in nowhere 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:17.060
 is installed a 250mm book works 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:21.590
 perfectly 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:23.969
 The hoses try to smile 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.009
 certinho installation you can work 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:31.939
 even with printer with the lid closed and 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:38.460
 which is not very common neither of them thinks 

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:41.270
 that the back flag of effect in 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.270
 acrylic 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:50.849
 no printer's there where I wanted 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:52.680
