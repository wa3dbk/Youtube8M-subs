00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
then I'm going to just try to show you

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.410 
then I'm going to just try to show you
another<00:01:02.500> way<00:01:02.800> to<00:01:02.859> approach<00:01:03.250> it<00:01:03.340> so<00:01:04.180> you<00:01:04.239> can

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
another way to approach it so you can

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.460 
another way to approach it so you can
have<00:01:04.570> fun<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.890> then<00:01:06.790> every<00:01:07.780> time<00:01:08.020> you<00:01:08.200> sit

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
have fun and then every time you sit

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.429 
have fun and then every time you sit
down<00:01:08.650> and<00:01:09.009> come<00:01:09.520> up<00:01:09.549> with<00:01:09.820> a<00:01:09.850> piece<00:01:10.090> of<00:01:10.240> music

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
down and come up with a piece of music

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.530 
down and come up with a piece of music
maybe<00:01:11.439> you<00:01:11.710> can<00:01:11.890> use<00:01:12.100> this<00:01:12.340> formula<00:01:12.970> to<00:01:13.330> just

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
maybe you can use this formula to just

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.420 
maybe you can use this formula to just
break<00:01:13.840> it<00:01:13.990> down<00:01:14.170> so<00:01:14.500> you<00:01:14.560> can<00:01:14.740> have<00:01:14.920> fun<00:01:15.189> so

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
break it down so you can have fun so

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:55.570 
break it down so you can have fun so
it's<00:01:15.580> not

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:03.050 

one<00:01:56.580> day<00:01:57.800> you<00:01:58.800> teach<00:01:59.039> us<00:02:00.979> not<00:02:01.979> knowing<00:02:02.399> that

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
one day you teach us not knowing that

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.029 
one day you teach us not knowing that
the<00:02:03.270> saxophone<00:02:03.990> was<00:02:04.350> going<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.649> play<00:02:04.770> some

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
the saxophone was going to play some

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.249 
the saxophone was going to play some
totally<00:02:05.490> different<00:02:05.520> than<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.539> clarinet<00:02:07.050> but

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
totally different than the clarinet but

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:14.100 
totally different than the clarinet but
I<00:02:07.289> had<00:02:07.470> a<00:02:07.500> big<00:02:07.800> year

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.170 

you
