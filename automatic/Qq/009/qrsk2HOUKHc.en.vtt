00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
another thing I've always wondered is

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.390 
another thing I've always wondered is
what<00:02:35.900> did<00:02:36.020> they<00:02:36.170> made<00:02:36.410> a<00:02:36.440> call<00:02:36.770> of<00:02:36.920> duty<00:02:36.950> game

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
what did they made a call of duty game

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.510 
what did they made a call of duty game
without<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:38.180> campaign<00:02:39.040> would<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.250> game

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
without the campaign would the game

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.760 
without the campaign would the game
still<00:02:40.910> do<00:02:41.180> well<00:02:41.420> let's<00:02:41.930> say<00:02:42.110> they<00:02:42.260> make<00:02:42.470> a<00:02:42.500> call

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
still do well let's say they make a call

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.650 
still do well let's say they make a call
of<00:02:42.890> duty<00:02:43.130> it<00:02:43.220> has<00:02:43.400> no<00:02:43.700> campaign<00:02:44.209> at<00:02:44.360> all<00:02:44.480> it's

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
of duty it has no campaign at all it's

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.220 
of duty it has no campaign at all it's
just<00:02:44.720> multiplayer<00:02:45.530> only<00:02:46.300> would<00:02:47.300> the<00:02:47.540> games<00:02:47.840> be

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
just multiplayer only would the games be

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.290 
just multiplayer only would the games be
even<00:02:48.620> better<00:02:48.800> would<00:02:49.100> they<00:02:49.280> have<00:02:49.459> more<00:02:49.730> content

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
even better would they have more content

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.020 
even better would they have more content
when<00:02:50.480> they<00:02:50.570> have<00:02:50.750> more<00:02:51.020> maps<00:02:51.550> would<00:02:52.550> they<00:02:52.760> have

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
when they have more maps would they have

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.820 
when they have more maps would they have
more<00:02:53.540> of<00:02:53.720> everything<00:02:53.840> because<00:02:54.290> there's<00:02:54.620> no

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
more of everything because there's no

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.860 
more of everything because there's no
campaign<00:02:55.340> it's<00:02:55.550> just<00:02:55.790> a<00:02:55.910> multiplayer<00:02:56.510> to<00:02:56.660> give

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
campaign it's just a multiplayer to give

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.440 
campaign it's just a multiplayer to give
you<00:02:56.989> maps<00:02:57.320> what<00:02:58.220> what<00:02:58.400> if<00:02:58.489> we<00:02:58.640> had<00:02:58.820> a<00:02:58.850> multi

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
you maps what what if we had a multi

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.330 
you maps what what if we had a multi
theme<00:02:59.870> the<00:03:00.110> multi-player<00:03:00.709> what<00:03:00.950> have<00:03:01.040> we<00:03:01.160> had

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
theme the multi-player what have we had

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.910 
theme the multi-player what have we had
some<00:03:01.610> maps<00:03:01.970> from<00:03:02.540> back<00:03:02.870> in<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.080> day<00:03:03.380> so

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
some maps from back in the day so

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.370 
some maps from back in the day so
futuristic<00:03:04.370> max<00:03:05.090> you<00:03:05.870> what<00:03:06.050> if<00:03:06.140> we<00:03:06.200> had<00:03:06.350> a

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
futuristic max you what if we had a

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.440 
futuristic max you what if we had a
mixture<00:03:06.770> we<00:03:06.950> had<00:03:07.040> some<00:03:07.250> old<00:03:07.430> guns<00:03:07.940> some<00:03:08.239> new

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
mixture we had some old guns some new

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.050 
mixture we had some old guns some new
guns<00:03:09.160> obviously<00:03:10.160> I<00:03:10.190> guess<00:03:10.489> the<00:03:10.640> new<00:03:10.790> guns

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
guns obviously I guess the new guns

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.490 
guns obviously I guess the new guns
would<00:03:11.209> be<00:03:11.330> better<00:03:11.570> than<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.870> old<00:03:12.020> guns<00:03:12.320> but

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
would be better than the old guns but

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.110 
would be better than the old guns but
they<00:03:12.620> could<00:03:12.800> splash

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.760 

I'm<00:03:17.120> sure<00:03:17.420> they<00:03:17.599> could<00:03:17.660> balance<00:03:17.990> out<00:03:18.349> the<00:03:18.380> guns

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
I'm sure they could balance out the guns

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.280 
I'm sure they could balance out the guns
give<00:03:19.160> it<00:03:19.310> advantages<00:03:20.030> disadvantages<00:03:20.209> to<00:03:21.110> make

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
give it advantages disadvantages to make

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.010 
give it advantages disadvantages to make
it<00:03:21.470> work<00:03:22.060> but<00:03:23.060> when<00:03:23.209> you<00:03:23.330> really<00:03:23.660> think<00:03:23.690> about

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
it work but when you really think about

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.650 
it work but when you really think about
it<00:03:24.400> where<00:03:25.400> are<00:03:25.550> they<00:03:25.700> making<00:03:25.970> their<00:03:26.239> money<00:03:26.420> are

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
it where are they making their money are

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.390 
it where are they making their money are
they<00:03:26.690> they're<00:03:27.260> not<00:03:27.440> really<00:03:27.770> making<00:03:28.130> their

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
they they're not really making their

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.820 
they they're not really making their
money<00:03:28.580> on<00:03:28.910> the<00:03:29.090> campaign<00:03:29.599> because<00:03:29.900> when<00:03:30.680> they

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
money on the campaign because when they

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.550 
money on the campaign because when they
do<00:03:30.890> stuff<00:03:31.310> like<00:03:31.400> DLC<00:03:32.180> they<00:03:32.810> never<00:03:33.080> give<00:03:33.380> you

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
do stuff like DLC they never give you

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.250 
do stuff like DLC they never give you
campaign<00:03:33.830> DLC<00:03:34.819> they<00:03:35.660> don't<00:03:35.840> ever<00:03:35.989> give<00:03:36.230> you

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
campaign DLC they don't ever give you

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.320 
campaign DLC they don't ever give you
some<00:03:36.620> more<00:03:36.860> additional<00:03:37.459> missions<00:03:37.970> they<00:03:38.120> just

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
some more additional missions they just

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.300 
some more additional missions they just
give<00:03:38.480> you<00:03:38.510> multiplayer<00:03:39.260> maps<00:03:39.709> and<00:03:40.040> stuff<00:03:40.100> like

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
give you multiplayer maps and stuff like

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.820 
give you multiplayer maps and stuff like
that<00:03:40.370> so<00:03:41.120> why<00:03:41.420> are<00:03:41.480> they<00:03:41.750> focusing<00:03:42.050> so<00:03:42.560> much<00:03:42.620> on

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
that so why are they focusing so much on

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.580 
that so why are they focusing so much on
the<00:03:43.790> campaign<00:03:44.330> it's<00:03:44.750> almost<00:03:45.019> like<00:03:45.200> they<00:03:45.380> feel

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
the campaign it's almost like they feel

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.100 
the campaign it's almost like they feel
like<00:03:45.860> okay<00:03:46.280> if<00:03:46.849> we<00:03:47.030> don't<00:03:47.090> have<00:03:47.330> a<00:03:47.360> campaign<00:03:47.900> we

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
like okay if we don't have a campaign we

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.630 
like okay if we don't have a campaign we
can't<00:03:48.380> release<00:03:48.650> a<00:03:48.709> call<00:03:49.010> to<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:49.220> game<00:03:49.430> because

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
can't release a call to the game because

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.690 
can't release a call to the game because
we<00:03:49.760> don't<00:03:49.910> have<00:03:49.940> a<00:03:50.120> theme<00:03:50.540> and<00:03:51.280> that<00:03:52.280> brings<00:03:52.550> me

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
we don't have a theme and that brings me

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.390 
we don't have a theme and that brings me
to<00:03:52.880> another<00:03:52.910> thought<00:03:53.720> is<00:03:53.870> how<00:03:54.140> come<00:03:54.440> they

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
to another thought is how come they

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.759 
to another thought is how come they
never<00:03:55.450> explored<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:56.660> possibility<00:03:57.410> of<00:03:57.440> an

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
never explored the possibility of an

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.720 
never explored the possibility of an
all-star<00:03:58.400> call<00:03:58.700> of<00:03:58.850> duty<00:03:59.060> game<00:04:00.370> you<00:04:01.370> know<00:04:01.519> how

TV shows like survivor they'll have like

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.130

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
they haven't done that in Call of Duty

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.190 
they haven't done that in Call of Duty
had<00:04:16.340> a<00:04:16.370> call<00:04:16.700> of<00:04:16.850> duty<00:04:17.090> all-star<00:04:17.690> game<00:04:17.959> they

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
had a call of duty all-star game they

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.900 
had a call of duty all-star game they
bring<00:04:18.470> back<00:04:18.500> a<00:04:18.709> lot<00:04:19.010> of<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.280> favorite<00:04:19.669> match

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
bring back a lot of the favorite match

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.210 
bring back a lot of the favorite match
from<00:04:20.600> all<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:21.109> call<00:04:21.289> of<00:04:21.440> duty's<00:04:21.709> a<00:04:21.739> lot<00:04:22.010> of<00:04:22.130> the

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
from all the call of duty's a lot of the

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.219 
from all the call of duty's a lot of the
guns<00:04:22.550> put<00:04:23.360> them<00:04:23.450> together<00:04:23.600> all<00:04:24.050> in<00:04:24.260> one<00:04:24.500> game<00:04:24.770> I

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
guns put them together all in one game I

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.210 
guns put them together all in one game I
guess<00:04:27.229> maybe<00:04:27.620> they<00:04:27.770> don't<00:04:27.860> want<00:04:28.039> to<00:04:28.100> do<00:04:28.190> that

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
guess maybe they don't want to do that

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.100 
guess maybe they don't want to do that
because<00:04:28.400> if<00:04:28.550> you<00:04:28.669> think<00:04:28.880> about<00:04:28.940> it<00:04:29.150> they<00:04:29.990> would

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
because if you think about it they would

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.690 
because if you think about it they would
basically<00:04:30.320> just<00:04:30.710> be<00:04:30.860> giving<00:04:31.010> us<00:04:31.250> stuff<00:04:31.460> that

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
basically just be giving us stuff that

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.510 
basically just be giving us stuff that
we've<00:04:31.850> already<00:04:32.030> bought<00:04:32.390> before<00:04:32.570> I<00:04:33.340> guess<00:04:34.340> that

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
we've already bought before I guess that

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.190 
we've already bought before I guess that
makes<00:04:34.700> sense<00:04:34.850> but<00:04:35.210> I<00:04:35.710> always<00:04:36.710> thought<00:04:37.070> about

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
makes sense but I always thought about

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.690 
makes sense but I always thought about
DLC<00:04:39.200> what<00:04:39.500> if<00:04:39.590> they<00:04:39.740> just<00:04:40.010> brought<00:04:40.250> back<00:04:40.490> all

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
DLC what if they just brought back all

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.820 
DLC what if they just brought back all
the<00:04:41.060> maps<00:04:41.330> from<00:04:41.539> previous<00:04:42.050> games<00:04:42.229> like<00:04:42.590> right

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
the maps from previous games like right

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.730 
the maps from previous games like right
now<00:04:43.070> we're<00:04:43.610> playing<00:04:43.850> black<00:04:44.180> ops<00:04:44.390> 2<00:04:44.750> what<00:04:45.620> if

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
now we're playing black ops 2 what if

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.800 
now we're playing black ops 2 what if
there<00:04:45.979> was<00:04:46.100> a<00:04:46.160> DLC<00:04:46.789> that<00:04:46.970> came<00:04:47.210> out<00:04:47.390> that<00:04:47.600> gave

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
there was a DLC that came out that gave

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.150 
there was a DLC that came out that gave
us<00:04:47.990> all<00:04:48.289> the<00:04:48.470> maps<00:04:48.740> from<00:04:49.280> the<00:04:49.460> first<00:04:49.729> black<00:04:50.060> ops

modern warfare 2 maps I mean they

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.890 
modern warfare 2 maps I mean they

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.740 
brought a couple of them back and they
played<00:05:15.740> they<00:05:16.639> played<00:05:16.910> for<00:05:17.240> the<00:05:17.300> most<00:05:17.510> part

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
played they played for the most part

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.020 
played they played for the most part
much<00:05:18.080> better<00:05:18.380> than<00:05:18.590> they<00:05:18.740> did<00:05:18.979> in<00:05:19.280> modern

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
much better than they did in modern

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.969 
much better than they did in modern
warfare<00:05:20.060> 2<00:05:20.600> because<00:05:20.900> there<00:05:21.080> were<00:05:21.169> new<00:05:21.560> tubes

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979

new tube fest you just saw new to flying
all<00:05:27.830> over<00:05:27.979> the<00:05:28.099> place<00:05:28.159> all<00:05:28.490> the<00:05:28.580> time

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
all over the place all the time

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.240 
all over the place all the time
but<00:05:29.480> in<00:05:29.600> the<00:05:29.690> modern<00:05:29.810> warfare<00:05:30.080> 3<00:05:30.350> version<00:05:31.070> it

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
but in the modern warfare 3 version it

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.210 
but in the modern warfare 3 version it
wasn't<00:05:31.880> like<00:05:32.030> that<00:05:32.240> so<00:05:33.020> that<00:05:33.950> you<00:05:34.160> know

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
wasn't like that so that you know

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.730 
wasn't like that so that you know
bringing<00:05:34.550> back<00:05:34.820> that<00:05:34.850> effect<00:05:35.740> that

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
bringing back that effect that

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.190 
bringing back that effect that
old-school<00:05:37.400> affect<00:05:38.210> the<00:05:38.360> memories<00:05:38.870> I<00:05:39.020> mean

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
old-school affect the memories I mean

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.080 
old-school affect the memories I mean
would<00:05:39.680> it<00:05:39.710> be<00:05:39.919> a<00:05:39.950> bad<00:05:40.220> idea<00:05:40.280> because<00:05:40.790> obviously

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
would it be a bad idea because obviously

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.420 
would it be a bad idea because obviously
we<00:05:41.450> want<00:05:41.600> new<00:05:41.810> stuff<00:05:42.110> and<00:05:42.290> what<00:05:42.410> new<00:05:42.620> maps<00:05:42.919> but

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
we want new stuff and what new maps but

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.400

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
some of the maps from the past were so

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.740 
some of the maps from the past were so
good<00:05:45.760> you<00:05:46.760> know<00:05:46.850> we<00:05:47.000> wouldn't<00:05:47.240> mind<00:05:47.480> playing
