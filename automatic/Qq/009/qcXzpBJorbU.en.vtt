00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
this mascara it's the volumizing one it

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.890 
this mascara it's the volumizing one it
costs<00:03:24.990> three<00:03:25.520> star<00:03:26.520> dollars<00:03:27.000> if<00:03:27.360> you<00:03:27.690> want<00:03:27.840> to

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
costs three star dollars if you want to

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.740 
costs three star dollars if you want to
buy<00:03:28.020> it<00:03:28.280> ok<00:03:29.280> so<00:03:29.670> you<00:03:29.760> just<00:03:29.910> put<00:03:29.970> that<00:03:30.180> on<00:03:30.480> you

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
buy it ok so you just put that on you

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.580 
buy it ok so you just put that on you
put<00:03:30.930> all<00:03:31.020> of<00:03:31.050> it<00:03:31.200> on<00:03:31.820> both<00:03:32.820> eyes<00:03:33.060> obviously<00:03:33.690> get

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
put all of it on both eyes obviously get

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.900 
put all of it on both eyes obviously get
this<00:03:34.740> probably<00:03:34.980> isn't<00:03:35.160> going<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.400> be<00:03:35.460> too<00:03:35.490> good

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
this probably isn't going to be too good

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.630 
this probably isn't going to be too good
but<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:36.960> probably<00:03:37.320> you<00:03:38.040> could<00:03:38.190> invent

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
but you probably you could invent

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.370 
but you probably you could invent
different<00:03:39.030> ways<00:03:39.150> to<00:03:39.180> do<00:03:39.540> it<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:40.230> could

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
different ways to do it and you could

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.160 
different ways to do it and you could
tell<00:03:40.980> me<00:03:41.160> pretty<00:03:42.030> much<00:03:42.180> I<00:03:42.390> go<00:03:42.660> around<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.020> eyes

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
tell me pretty much I go around the eyes

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.490 
tell me pretty much I go around the eyes
but<00:03:43.200> I<00:03:43.530> don't<00:03:43.710> do<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:44.010> pointy<00:03:44.960> ones<00:03:45.960> and<00:03:46.410> then

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
but I don't do the pointy ones and then

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.380 
but I don't do the pointy ones and then
side<00:03:46.710> I<00:03:46.890> did<00:03:47.160> too<00:03:47.250> pointy<00:03:47.760> ones<00:03:47.880> on<00:03:48.300> the

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
side I did too pointy ones on the

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.130 
side I did too pointy ones on the
outside<00:03:48.420> though<00:03:49.050> just<00:03:49.800> like<00:03:49.890> that<00:03:50.160> and

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
outside though just like that and

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.630 
outside though just like that and
because<00:03:52.140> one<00:03:52.530> can<00:03:52.680> see<00:03:52.950> that<00:03:53.130> in<00:03:53.250> a<00:03:53.340> way<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:53.580> I

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
because one can see that in a way and I

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:02.130 
because one can see that in a way and I
think<00:03:53.670> it's<00:03:54.000> pretty<00:03:54.180> cool<00:03:54.420> uh

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:09.230 

yeah<00:04:03.600> this<00:04:04.600> isn't<00:04:04.930> as<00:04:05.020> good<00:04:05.260> as<00:04:05.590> I<00:04:06.190> did<00:04:06.880> it<00:04:07.209> ah<00:04:08.160> I

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
yeah this isn't as good as I did it ah I

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.720 
yeah this isn't as good as I did it ah I
start<00:04:10.240> I<00:04:10.330> just<00:04:10.360> to<00:04:11.260> make<00:04:11.410> sure<00:04:11.470> I<00:04:11.650> got<00:04:11.890> all<00:04:12.280> that
