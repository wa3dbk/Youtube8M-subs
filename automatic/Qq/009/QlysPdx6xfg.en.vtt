00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:27.740
 here is another great place 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:29.990
 dense koryazhnik such places that there 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:35.480
 there was an asp sure to be on 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:38.450
 a strong string of place these than good 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:43.160
 that most anglers here don't catch 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:46.489
 Generally what kind of a fight was not considered here 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.290
 that itâ€™s impossible to catch two 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.800
 difficulty first lure any 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.300
 control of the court throws you 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.070
 Be sure to catch the second immediately. 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.340
 moment if even you catch on 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:02.149
 there is an awesome 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:06.400
 the problem is the fish we actually like these 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:10.090
 problems avoiding such covers 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:14.990
 there are wild company releases now 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:17.840
 the grant makes varice boiled down they didn't neigh 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.729
 my two hiding places are covered we set 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.159
 such a hook and general there allows 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.540
 problems avoid hitting exclusively 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:28.050
 also with vertical games so we usually 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.850
 just say so downstairs chicks a 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.210
 fish could at least somehow 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.130
 adequately pull we so here 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:42.110
 filing 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:42.110
 Koryazhke and in the presence of powerful braids 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:51.920
 vakvachuk question here 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.920
 now show how we do it 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.940
 and 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.950
 our 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.830
 Well 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.830
 we have 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.270
 we have
