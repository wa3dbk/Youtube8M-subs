00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
for spring in 2012 so sharp could you

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.880 
for spring in 2012 so sharp could you
know<00:01:15.299> take<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.630> little<00:01:15.840> break<00:01:16.080> them<00:01:16.290> don't<00:01:16.740> have

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
know take a little break them don't have

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.160 
know take a little break them don't have
to<00:01:17.009> work<00:01:17.159> in<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.520> lot<00:01:17.759> much<00:01:17.880> no<00:01:18.479> but<00:01:18.689> i'm<00:01:19.020> not

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
to work in a lot much no but i'm not

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.630 
to work in a lot much no but i'm not
sure<00:01:19.229> why<00:01:19.470> they're<00:01:19.650> delaying<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.220> because<00:01:20.549> i

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
sure why they're delaying this because i

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.550 
sure why they're delaying this because i
mean<00:01:20.820> basically<00:01:21.360> i<00:01:21.750> mean<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.049> phones<00:01:22.259> are<00:01:22.530> out

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
mean basically i mean the phones are out

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.859 
mean basically i mean the phones are out
there<00:01:23.009> suppose<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.490> they're<00:01:23.610> ready<00:01:23.880> but

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
there suppose that they're ready but

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.929 
there suppose that they're ready but
they<00:01:25.110> want<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.439> delay<00:01:25.770> before<00:01:26.130> they<00:01:26.430> launch<00:01:26.640> it

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
they want to delay before they launch it

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.840 
they want to delay before they launch it
I'm<00:01:27.780> sure<00:01:28.080> if<00:01:28.200> carriers<00:01:28.710> need<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.070> fix<00:01:29.250> one<00:01:29.820> of

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
I'm sure if carriers need to fix one of

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.700 
I'm sure if carriers need to fix one of
their<00:01:30.060> own<00:01:30.150> variants<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.780> phone<00:01:30.990> i'm<00:01:31.650> not

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
their own variants of the phone i'm not

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.700 
their own variants of the phone i'm not
sure<00:01:32.400> but<00:01:33.150> it's<00:01:33.659> going<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.930> come<00:01:34.140> here<00:01:34.500> with<00:01:34.680> a
