00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.580 
for it it was but it worked well which
is<00:01:54.790> really<00:01:54.970> good<00:01:55.120> at<00:01:56.050> the<00:01:56.140> moment<00:01:56.380> I<00:01:56.410> have<00:01:56.530> an

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
is really good at the moment I have an

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.780 
is really good at the moment I have an
ashtray<00:01:56.860> for<00:01:57.010> tea<00:01:57.310> which<00:01:57.430> I<00:01:57.520> use<00:01:57.640> in<00:01:57.670> my

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
ashtray for tea which I use in my

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.970 
ashtray for tea which I use in my
computer<00:01:58.210> and<00:01:58.360> that's<00:01:58.570> something<00:01:58.980> that

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
computer and that's something that

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.740 
computer and that's something that
really<00:02:00.760> helps<00:02:01.060> me<00:02:01.180> out<00:02:01.210> for<00:02:01.450> things<00:02:01.570> like

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
really helps me out for things like

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.020 
really helps me out for things like
counter-strike<00:02:02.200> Go<00:02:02.610> which<00:02:03.610> I've<00:02:03.760> recently

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
counter-strike Go which I've recently

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.540 
counter-strike Go which I've recently
taken<00:02:04.270> up<00:02:04.660> playing<00:02:05.020> there<00:02:05.410> is<00:02:05.560> so<00:02:05.890> much<00:02:06.190> sticky

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
taken up playing there is so much sticky

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.250 
taken up playing there is so much sticky
tape<00:02:06.700> for<00:02:07.150> protection<00:02:07.630> I<00:02:07.690> guess<00:02:07.840> nobody<00:02:08.140> can

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.260 
tape for protection I guess nobody can

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.660 
tape for protection I guess nobody can
steal<00:02:08.470> these<00:02:08.649> things<00:02:08.950> without<00:02:09.190> taking<00:02:09.490> a<00:02:09.520> long

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
steal these things without taking a long

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:10.790 
steal these things without taking a long
time

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
time

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.100 
time
so<00:02:11.800> I<00:02:12.070> suppose<00:02:12.660> sledgehammer<00:02:13.660> games<00:02:13.720> and

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
so I suppose sledgehammer games and

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.510 
so I suppose sledgehammer games and
Activision<00:02:14.440> partnered<00:02:14.890> up<00:02:15.010> at<00:02:15.160> Turtle<00:02:15.430> Beach

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
Activision partnered up at Turtle Beach

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.800 
Activision partnered up at Turtle Beach
which<00:02:15.760> they've<00:02:16.000> been<00:02:16.180> known<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.420> do<00:02:16.630> in<00:02:16.750> the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
which they've been known to do in the

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:17.360 
which they've been known to do in the
past

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
past

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.770 
past
so<00:02:18.370> it's<00:02:18.550> Bungie<00:02:18.940> with<00:02:19.120> their<00:02:19.270> halo<00:02:19.540> series

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
so it's Bungie with their halo series

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.900 
so it's Bungie with their halo series
and<00:02:20.020> stuff<00:02:20.170> like<00:02:20.320> that<00:02:20.580> I've<00:02:21.580> got<00:02:21.610> a<00:02:21.730> problem

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
and stuff like that I've got a problem

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.250 
and stuff like that I've got a problem
with<00:02:22.030> that<00:02:22.120> this<00:02:22.420> is<00:02:22.540> as<00:02:22.780> far<00:02:22.990> as<00:02:23.020> I<00:02:23.200> know

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
with that this is as far as I know

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.430 
with that this is as far as I know
limited<00:02:23.800> edition<00:02:24.220> so<00:02:24.490> it<00:02:24.910> will<00:02:25.300> be<00:02:26.020> something

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
limited edition so it will be something

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.380 
limited edition so it will be something
that<00:02:26.590> they'll<00:02:26.830> have<00:02:26.950> solved<00:02:27.280> for<00:02:27.390> a

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
that they'll have solved for a

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.210 
that they'll have solved for a
particular<00:02:29.170> amount<00:02:29.500> of<00:02:29.620> time<00:02:29.680> until<00:02:30.100> it's

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
particular amount of time until it's

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.910 
particular amount of time until it's
discontinued<00:02:30.910> so<00:02:31.900> nothing<00:02:32.260> in<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.440> box<00:02:32.620> there

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
discontinued so nothing in the box there

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.660 
discontinued so nothing in the box there
but<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.190> box<00:02:33.430> does<00:02:33.670> look<00:02:33.850> pretty<00:02:34.000> cool

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
but the box does look pretty cool

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:49.530 
but the box does look pretty cool
alright<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:41.490> loud<00:02:46.110> alright<00:02:47.110> so<00:02:47.530> I<00:02:48.520> don't<00:02:49.480> know

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
alright so loud alright so I don't know

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.990 
alright so loud alright so I don't know
if<00:02:49.600> they<00:02:49.720> can<00:02:49.780> focus<00:02:50.110> it<00:02:50.380> or<00:02:50.500> not<00:02:50.650> but<00:02:51.459> there<00:02:51.790> is

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
if they can focus it or not but there is

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.350 
if they can focus it or not but there is
obviously<00:02:52.680> a<00:02:53.680> detachable<00:02:54.190> microphone<00:02:54.580> which

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
obviously a detachable microphone which

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.170 
obviously a detachable microphone which
connects<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:56.200> headset<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:57.580> headset

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
connects to the headset the headset

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.760 
connects to the headset the headset
itself<00:02:58.420> which<00:02:58.690> actually<00:02:59.080> looks<00:02:59.470> very<00:02:59.530> cool

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
itself which actually looks very cool

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.600 
itself which actually looks very cool
fairly<00:03:02.770> thick<00:03:02.980> foam<00:03:03.250> padding<00:03:05.160> I've<00:03:06.160> got<00:03:06.400> quite

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
fairly thick foam padding I've got quite

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.380 
fairly thick foam padding I've got quite
a<00:03:06.670> big<00:03:06.820> head<00:03:07.060> so<00:03:07.420> hopefully<00:03:08.110> this<00:03:08.410> fits<00:03:08.739> me<00:03:08.920> but

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
a big head so hopefully this fits me but

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.420 
a big head so hopefully this fits me but
I'm<00:03:10.390> sure<00:03:10.600> it<00:03:10.690> will

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
I'm sure it will

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.020 
I'm sure it will
and<00:03:12.989> this<00:03:13.989> looks<00:03:14.440> to<00:03:14.620> be<00:03:14.760> accessories<00:03:15.760> and

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
and this looks to be accessories and

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.710 
and this looks to be accessories and
literature<00:03:16.810> and<00:03:17.590> it<00:03:17.739> tells<00:03:18.310> me<00:03:18.519> to<00:03:18.550> lift<00:03:18.910> so

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
literature and it tells me to lift so

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.509 
literature and it tells me to lift so
it's<00:03:20.110> even<00:03:20.380> telling<00:03:20.650> me<00:03:20.739> how<00:03:20.860> to<00:03:20.920> unbox<00:03:21.340> this

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
it's even telling me how to unbox this

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.540 
it's even telling me how to unbox this
like<00:03:21.940> it<00:03:22.060> was<00:03:22.150> meant<00:03:22.390> to<00:03:22.450> be<00:03:22.510> meant<00:03:23.019> to<00:03:23.080> be<00:03:23.550> so

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
like it was meant to be meant to be so

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.400 
like it was meant to be meant to be so

simple<00:03:49.890> I<00:03:50.070> it<00:03:51.060> reminds<00:03:51.540> me<00:03:51.660> very<00:03:51.750> much<00:03:51.960> of<00:03:52.080> when

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
simple I it reminds me very much of when

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.130 
simple I it reminds me very much of when
I<00:03:52.530> had<00:03:52.770> the<00:03:52.890> P<00:03:53.040> X<00:03:53.160> 21<00:03:53.550> very<00:03:53.880> similar<00:03:54.180> you<00:03:55.110> have

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
I had the P X 21 very similar you have

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.130 
I had the P X 21 very similar you have
obviously<00:03:55.770> the<00:03:56.300> cable<00:03:57.300> here<00:03:57.510> looks<00:03:57.840> to<00:03:58.020> be

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
obviously the cable here looks to be

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.720 
obviously the cable here looks to be
like<00:03:58.320> a<00:03:58.380> probably<00:03:59.220> one<00:04:01.130> or<00:04:02.130> one<00:04:02.430> and<00:04:02.460> a<00:04:02.580> half

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
like a probably one or one and a half

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.950 
like a probably one or one and a half
meter<00:04:03.060> cable<00:04:03.360> I<00:04:03.750> would<00:04:04.170> say<00:04:05.570> which<00:04:06.570> you<00:04:06.600> know<00:04:06.930> I

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.960 
meter cable I would say which you know I

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
much else to it basically the microphone

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.100 
much else to it basically the microphone
is<00:04:53.070> bendable<00:04:53.700> just<00:04:54.270> like<00:04:54.420> all<00:04:54.570> of<00:04:54.720> them<00:04:54.840> so<00:04:55.050> as
