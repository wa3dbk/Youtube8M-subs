00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.140
 officially comes across when you hit the market and then he is one of the first 

00:00:28.139 --> 00:00:31.220
 to buy electric cars impact from the dealer 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.730
 but especially whether these two sides camp have not ended the site 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.730
 links register 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.030
 When the crisis in Zeeland is nothing but once state version of windows 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.720
 media player 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.150
 the church of the government 64 HP and 180 nm torque 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.750
 Place a real car on November 12 in Utrecht 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.570
 then it falls he stands at the dealer 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.760
 after 8 years it is 130 kilometers 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.560
 so that is not a lot of strength to buy and i think info about one 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.710
 Twenty to fit in the city short distances that sort of thing 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.100
 charge in around 6 to 8 hours 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.290
 appletern both quickly from half an hour to 80 percent off after he 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.290
 itself too 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.560
 the final version of silence also doesn't look different for more info on 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.590
 The large screen uses that small groups that end up sitting vertically 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.990
 with a bit of a ps3 appearance 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.300
 of for example may be missing 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.650
 but technically it is wise 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.700
 you have even mentioned the package 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.720
 I am very bossy giving the room to too much in advance too 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.550
 behind the wheel just very good people from abroad work 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.640
 could better use the engine seated in the back 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.130
 the app is this under the seats bridge much more practical interior space 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.130
 is left 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.910
 what followed was, according to the car, a very actual Schiphol cave at low 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.329
 speeds a little gas are very fast a lot of money 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:12.759
 it is very pleasant 

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:16.139
 but the top speed is 130 kilometers per hour on long distances 

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:19.129
 Being a different story again says a lot about a new one that has to become money 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.719
 applied 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:25.159
 it can become very mature and somersaults are good and it is good 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:28.059
 never stand still just as quickly set foot at low speeds 

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:31.529
 and then the radius of action again appears to be the only point of criticism 130 

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:33.849
 miles of chase few 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.499
 the local authorities 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:39.389
 turn practical and the user yes maybe individuals as second or 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.039
 third car 

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:43.339
 there are people for it
