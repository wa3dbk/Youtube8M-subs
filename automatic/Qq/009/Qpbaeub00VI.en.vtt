00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 everything in today's movie food comes from 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.000
 a very beautiful Brazilian film but 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.250
 also a little sad 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.030
 storyteller he tells the 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.280
 history of roberto carlos ramos that was 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.929
 It was too small to be good because the 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.420
 mother believed that it was an institution 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.180
 of teaching among many things that 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.689
 happen and he becomes a close friend of a 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.420
 a French teacher who ends up 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.029
 adopting it in one of the situations it 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:36.989

 this recipe is originally 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.700
 made with roast beef that is harder 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.800
 than commercial chicken and more 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.930
 hard to find around here so it does 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.309
 with four whole chicken legs 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.469

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.930

 the year now hard the chicken 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.560
 canceled breno releases lots of fat 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.640
 so this does not get super 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.040
 greasy 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:57.860
 I take back what's left of a 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:03:01.190

 original would be left in the refrigerator one day 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.360
 to remove the fat from above but 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.459

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.530
 together until they start to brown 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.329

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.040
