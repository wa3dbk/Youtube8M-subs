00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.820
 ddp art wheel are 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.749
 absolutely ingrid 

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:10.619
 that the top speed is not 

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:14.409
 the ranking she is cool kart track fastest with 303 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.020
 that may have been the slipstream used to be full again 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.939
 there 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:24.839
 and now 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.839
 the entrance to the box 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.220
 Wettringen is coming back 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.070
 yes I always was 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.370
 issues 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.670
 I'm banging my head 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.920
 what was your active 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.840
 Kroetz 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.840
 this year is the drive 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.310
 Norbert Haug dares VW 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.350
 but a little faster now 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.890
 what was that for a safe navigate side closer and Sally looked round 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.280
 second pit stop not 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.820
 the British is not the right time in any case he is with great victory 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.130
 for us 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.410
 with each seven seconds needed which he does not go 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.240
 questionably think there's a correlation between two stalls 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.180
 given 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.400
 a Kieler with 6 2 short spots specified 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.710
 the scenery is curious what's going on 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.250
 here again the repetition 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.040
 What that shows I do not know uniform certainly spoken with 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.040
 Show the team for the newspaper that 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.150
 how fast he can continue 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.500
 here is the distance 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.500
 between the first two 

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:14.479
 Manfred Arndt currently charged 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:19.549
 the little Mercedes 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.500
 Leadership change still both vehicles on the top positions
