among Penn Staters I don't know really
how<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.880> started<00:01:06.329> but<00:01:06.600> let's<00:01:07.139> just<00:01:07.350> put<00:01:07.499> it

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
how it started but let's just put it

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.919 
how it started but let's just put it
this<00:01:07.619> way<00:01:07.889> over<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.700> years<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.899> just

00:01:09.919 --> 00:01:09.929 
this way over the years it just

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:12.020 
this way over the years it just
continued<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:10.920> continued<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.490> grow<00:01:11.639> as<00:01:11.999> a

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030
