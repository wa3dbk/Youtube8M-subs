a skin so structurally the car is still
all<00:01:04.739> intact<00:01:07.369> it's<00:01:08.369> just<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.760> matter<00:01:08.970> of

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060

I<00:01:35.579> mean<00:01:35.759> -<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.810> little<00:01:37.409> bit<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.680> will<00:01:37.860> be<00:01:38.280> a

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
I mean - a little bit that will be a

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.200 
I mean - a little bit that will be a
standout<00:01:38.939> feather<00:01:39.299> out<00:01:41.060> stripped<00:01:42.060> everything

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
standout feather out stripped everything

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.210 
standout feather out stripped everything
out<00:01:44.720> and<00:01:45.720> around<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.079> back<00:01:46.259> here<00:01:46.680> kind<00:01:47.100> of

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
out and around the back here kind of

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.819 
out and around the back here kind of
what<00:01:47.460> we<00:01:47.640> were<00:01:47.850> expecting<00:01:48.630> I've<00:01:49.380> already<00:01:49.680> put

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
what we were expecting I've already put

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.910 
what we were expecting I've already put
a<00:01:49.860> hammer<00:01:50.159> on<00:01:50.399> here<00:01:50.729> but<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.439> good<00:01:52.439> bit<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.740> mud

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
a hammer on here but a good bit of mud

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.060 
a hammer on here but a good bit of mud
in<00:01:53.070> here<00:01:53.340> too<00:01:53.579> much<00:01:53.729> mud<00:01:54.530> it's<00:01:55.530> left<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.829> bit<00:01:55.979> on

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
in here too much mud it's left a bit on

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.680 
in here too much mud it's left a bit on
the<00:01:56.189> floor<00:01:56.490> but<00:01:58.040> this<00:01:59.040> looks<00:01:59.250> like

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
the floor but this looks like

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.770 
the floor but this looks like
just<00:02:01.690> low-grade<00:02:02.370> old<00:02:03.370> school<00:02:03.640> bondo<00:02:04.090> bondo<00:02:04.480> so

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
just low-grade old school bondo bondo so

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.480 
just low-grade old school bondo bondo so
we're<00:02:05.320> gonna<00:02:05.410> metal<00:02:05.710> work<00:02:05.860> that<00:02:05.890> a<00:02:06.070> little<00:02:06.340> bit

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
we're gonna metal work that a little bit

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.430 
we're gonna metal work that a little bit
get<00:02:06.760> that<00:02:06.790> out<00:02:07.090> that's<00:02:07.270> probably<00:02:08.020> every<00:02:08.229> bit

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
get that out that's probably every bit

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.740 
get that out that's probably every bit
of<00:02:10.140> 3/16<00:02:11.140> deep<00:02:11.350> maybe<00:02:12.270> maybe<00:02:13.270> a<00:02:13.360> quarter-inch

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
of 3/16 deep maybe maybe a quarter-inch

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.800 
of 3/16 deep maybe maybe a quarter-inch
but<00:02:14.740> that's<00:02:14.980> got<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.280> go<00:02:15.510> so<00:02:16.510> we'll<00:02:16.630> get<00:02:16.750> that

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
but that's got to go so we'll get that

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.350 
but that's got to go so we'll get that
metal<00:02:17.260> work<00:02:17.380> get<00:02:17.650> that<00:02:17.800> back<00:02:17.980> into<00:02:18.190> shape<00:02:18.520> a

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
metal work get that back into shape a

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.090 
metal work get that back into shape a
little<00:02:19.960> bits<00:02:20.110> of<00:02:20.230> some<00:02:20.680> little<00:02:20.800> bits<00:02:21.010> of

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
little bits of some little bits of

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.220 
little bits of some little bits of
corrosion<00:02:21.610> here<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:24.810> don't<00:02:25.810> think<00:02:25.960> the<00:02:26.020> lights

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
corrosion here I don't think the lights

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.930 
corrosion here I don't think the lights
had<00:02:26.350> ever<00:02:26.470> been<00:02:26.680> out<00:02:26.830> it's<00:02:27.340> still<00:02:27.550> a<00:02:27.580> look<00:02:27.790> like

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
had ever been out it's still a look like

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.640 
had ever been out it's still a look like
they<00:02:28.090> had<00:02:28.210> the<00:02:28.300> original<00:02:28.510> butyl<00:02:29.050> rubber<00:02:29.080> so

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
they had the original butyl rubber so

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.750 
they had the original butyl rubber so
you<00:02:29.860> can<00:02:30.460> see<00:02:30.700> you<00:02:31.600> know<00:02:31.950> this<00:02:32.950> will<00:02:33.100> all<00:02:33.250> need

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
you can see you know this will all need

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.780 
you can see you know this will all need
to<00:02:33.880> be<00:02:33.970> metal<00:02:34.270> cleaned<00:02:34.980> but<00:02:35.980> nothing<00:02:36.550> alarming

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
to be metal cleaned but nothing alarming

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.290 
to be metal cleaned but nothing alarming
there<00:02:37.180> that'll<00:02:37.480> all<00:02:37.630> come<00:02:37.660> out<00:02:39.030> wire<00:02:40.030> wheel

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
there that'll all come out wire wheel

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.750 
there that'll all come out wire wheel
that<00:02:40.540> and<00:02:40.870> clean<00:02:41.350> it<00:02:41.530> and<00:02:41.709> then<00:02:41.770> naval<00:02:42.490> jelly

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
that and clean it and then naval jelly

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.850 
that and clean it and then naval jelly
and<00:02:42.970> get<00:02:43.180> it<00:02:43.270> all<00:02:43.390> sanded<00:02:43.780> in<00:02:44.050> smooth<00:02:44.410> so<00:02:44.680> we're

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
and get it all sanded in smooth so we're

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.100 
and get it all sanded in smooth so we're
good<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.130> go<00:02:45.209> then<00:02:46.209> we<00:02:46.330> came<00:02:46.420> back<00:02:46.660> to<00:02:46.840> a<00:02:46.870> Paul

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
good to go then we came back to a Paul

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.449 
good to go then we came back to a Paul
this<00:02:47.350> and<00:02:47.620> when<00:02:47.709> we<00:02:47.740> paint<00:02:48.070> they'll<00:02:48.250> be<00:02:48.340> no

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
this and when we paint they'll be no

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.090 
this and when we paint they'll be no
paint<00:02:48.700> line<00:02:48.910> this<00:02:49.090> will<00:02:49.240> all<00:02:49.420> just<00:02:49.630> be<00:02:49.720> one

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
paint line this will all just be one

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.260 
paint line this will all just be one

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
bumpers had been texture coated and well

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.800 
bumpers had been texture coated and well
it's<00:03:06.519> kind<00:03:06.760> of<00:03:06.820> struck<00:03:07.090> that<00:03:07.269> that<00:03:07.450> struck<00:03:07.690> me

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
it's kind of struck that that struck me

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.410 
it's kind of struck that that struck me
as<00:03:07.900> kind<00:03:08.080> of<00:03:08.200> odd<00:03:10.110> and<00:03:11.110> then<00:03:11.230> I<00:03:11.260> found<00:03:11.530> this<00:03:11.830> and

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
as kind of odd and then I found this and

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.020 
as kind of odd and then I found this and
you<00:03:13.420> know<00:03:14.400> start<00:03:15.400> to<00:03:15.430> put<00:03:15.610> two<00:03:15.760> and<00:03:15.790> two

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
you know start to put two and two

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.120 
you know start to put two and two
together<00:03:16.180> here<00:03:16.720> and<00:03:16.959> say<00:03:17.320> well<00:03:17.590> okay

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
together here and say well okay

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.790 
together here and say well okay
obviously<00:03:19.140> something<00:03:20.140> ran<00:03:20.290> into<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.590> back<00:03:20.769> of

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
obviously something ran into the back of

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.100 
obviously something ran into the back of
this<00:03:21.070> not<00:03:21.310> not<00:03:21.640> dramatic<00:03:22.420> that<00:03:22.570> something<00:03:22.930> did

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
this not not dramatic that something did

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.890 
this not not dramatic that something did
hit<00:03:23.320> the<00:03:23.440> back<00:03:23.590> of<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.800> car<00:03:24.010> here<00:03:24.690> so<00:03:25.690> if<00:03:25.810> we

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
hit the back of the car here so if we

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.479 
hit the back of the car here so if we
come<00:03:26.050> over<00:03:26.110> here<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:26.380> look<00:03:26.500> at<00:03:26.650> our<00:03:26.739> bumper<00:03:27.160> we

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
come over here and look at our bumper we

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.600 
come over here and look at our bumper we
did<00:03:27.700> strip<00:03:28.300> the<00:03:28.450> bumper<00:03:28.830> but<00:03:29.830> it's<00:03:29.980> not<00:03:30.160> it's

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
did strip the bumper but it's not it's

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.880 
did strip the bumper but it's not it's
not<00:03:30.760> completely<00:03:31.450> finished<00:03:32.080> but<00:03:32.350> can<00:03:32.650> we<00:03:32.739> take

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
not completely finished but can we take

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.620 
not completely finished but can we take
a<00:03:32.920> look<00:03:33.100> here<00:03:33.630> you<00:03:34.630> see<00:03:34.750> a<00:03:34.900> crack<00:03:35.200> here<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:36.760> a

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
a look here you see a crack here and a

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:44.190 
a look here you see a crack here and a
crack<00:03:37.930> here<00:03:39.269> and<00:03:40.269> you<00:03:40.959> see<00:03:41.260> a<00:03:41.290> crack<00:03:43.200> right

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
crack here and you see a crack right

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.449 
crack here and you see a crack right
here<00:03:45.150> so<00:03:46.150> what<00:03:46.630> that<00:03:46.810> tells<00:03:47.110> us<00:03:47.440> is<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:48.100> back

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
here so what that tells us is the back

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.580 
here so what that tells us is the back
of<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:48.670> car<00:03:48.850> been<00:03:49.090> tapped<00:03:49.330> at<00:03:49.510> one<00:03:49.690> point<00:03:49.930> and

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
of the car been tapped at one point and

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.830 
of the car been tapped at one point and
it's<00:03:51.250> not<00:03:51.760> at<00:03:51.880> all<00:03:51.970> coincidence<00:03:52.299> that<00:03:52.750> the

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
it's not at all coincidence that the

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.710 
it's not at all coincidence that the
crack<00:03:53.080> on<00:03:53.320> that<00:03:53.440> bumper<00:03:53.769> is<00:03:53.920> on<00:03:54.390> same<00:03:55.390> side

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
crack on that bumper is on same side

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.229 
crack on that bumper is on same side
where<00:03:56.080> the<00:03:56.170> damage<00:03:56.500> on<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.680> rear<00:03:57.010> pin<00:03:57.760> here<00:03:58.060> it

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
where the damage on the rear pin here it

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.789 
where the damage on the rear pin here it
is<00:03:58.390> so<00:03:59.820> another<00:04:00.820> shortcut<00:04:01.450> you<00:04:02.140> know<00:04:02.260> to<00:04:02.620> not

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
is so another shortcut you know to not

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.380 
is so another shortcut you know to not
repair<00:04:03.220> the<00:04:03.250> bumper<00:04:03.670> just<00:04:03.850> texture<00:04:04.269> the

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
repair the bumper just texture the

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.819 
repair the bumper just texture the
bumper<00:04:04.690> and<00:04:04.840> hide<00:04:05.049> it<00:04:05.340> so<00:04:06.340> there's<00:04:06.850> always

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
bumper and hide it so there's always

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.920 
bumper and hide it so there's always
always<00:04:08.829> a<00:04:09.100> story<00:04:09.519> behind<00:04:09.790> why<00:04:10.420> things<00:04:10.750> are

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
always a story behind why things are

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:11.809 
always a story behind why things are
done

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
done

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.350 
done
unfortunately<00:04:12.720> this<00:04:13.400> this<00:04:14.400> was<00:04:14.610> just<00:04:14.819> done<00:04:15.030> as

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
unfortunately this this was just done as

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.349 
unfortunately this this was just done as
a<00:04:15.390> quicky<00:04:15.720> quicky<00:04:16.229> blow<00:04:16.620> so<00:04:17.120> we're<00:04:18.120> gonna<00:04:18.239> get

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
a quicky quicky blow so we're gonna get

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.659 
a quicky quicky blow so we're gonna get
that<00:04:18.540> bumper<00:04:18.840> welded<00:04:19.199> up<00:04:19.320> you<00:04:19.979> know<00:04:20.070> be<00:04:20.430> group

that bumper welded up you know be group
those<00:04:20.880> out<00:04:21.120> and<00:04:21.329> we'll<00:04:21.510> TIG<00:04:22.049> weld<00:04:22.260> that<00:04:22.440> up

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
those out and we'll TIG weld that up

paddle wheel it back and then it'll take

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.080 
paddle wheel it back and then it'll take
a<00:04:25.320> skim<00:04:25.740> that<00:04:26.389> to<00:04:27.389> finish<00:04:27.570> it<00:04:27.810> right<00:04:28.020> but<00:04:28.260> this

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
the new clip waiting to go on we're

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.189 
the new clip waiting to go on we're
gonna<00:04:40.260> try<00:04:40.530> and<00:04:40.650> get<00:04:40.740> that<00:04:40.860> started<00:04:41.340> tomorrow

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
gonna try and get that started tomorrow

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.930 
gonna try and get that started tomorrow
and<00:04:43.199> I've<00:04:43.320> started<00:04:43.800> to<00:04:44.010> pop<00:04:44.220> some<00:04:44.520> of<00:04:44.550> the<00:04:44.699> spot

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
and I've started to pop some of the spot

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.640 
and I've started to pop some of the spot
walls<00:04:45.180> out<00:04:45.419> now<00:04:45.600> here<00:04:45.840> we<00:04:45.990> can<00:04:46.020> just<00:04:46.139> blow<00:04:46.500> it

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
walls out now here we can just blow it

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.740 
walls out now here we can just blow it
clean<00:04:46.889> through<00:04:47.280> this<00:04:48.210> we<00:04:48.360> don't<00:04:48.510> care<00:04:48.720> about

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
clean through this we don't care about

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.860 
clean through this we don't care about
the<00:04:49.080> base<00:04:49.620> structure<00:04:49.979> under<00:04:50.310> this<00:04:50.490> one<00:04:50.729> we<00:04:51.690> get

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
the base structure under this one we get

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.330 
the base structure under this one we get
rid<00:04:52.050> of<00:04:52.169> all<00:04:52.289> these<00:04:52.530> welds<00:04:53.010> and<00:04:53.100> I'm<00:04:53.190> gonna

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
rid of all these welds and I'm gonna

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.100 
rid of all these welds and I'm gonna
weld<00:04:53.639> up<00:04:53.850> each<00:04:54.030> one<00:04:54.270> of<00:04:54.389> those<00:04:54.510> holes<00:04:54.810> which

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
weld up each one of those holes which

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.770 
weld up each one of those holes which
isn't<00:04:55.289> gonna<00:04:55.560> be<00:04:55.710> fun<00:04:56.010> but<00:04:56.310> I<00:04:56.610> just<00:04:57.570> have<00:04:57.690> to

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
isn't gonna be fun but I just have to

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.750 
isn't gonna be fun but I just have to
take<00:04:57.960> our<00:04:58.139> time<00:04:58.350> and<00:04:58.410> not<00:04:58.770> get<00:04:58.949> ahead<00:04:59.220> and<00:04:59.639> not

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
take our time and not get ahead and not

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.510 
take our time and not get ahead and not
put<00:04:59.940> too<00:05:00.030> much<00:05:00.210> heat<00:05:00.479> in<00:05:03.440> so<00:05:04.440> when<00:05:04.860> we<00:05:05.010> do<00:05:05.250> that

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
put too much heat in so when we do that

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.550 
put too much heat in so when we do that
we'll<00:05:08.180> put<00:05:09.180> a<00:05:09.240> piece<00:05:09.449> of<00:05:09.479> aluminum<00:05:09.660> up<00:05:10.199> behind

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
we'll put a piece of aluminum up behind

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.580 
we'll put a piece of aluminum up behind
everything<00:05:11.330> that'll<00:05:12.330> help<00:05:12.479> us<00:05:12.690> heatsink<00:05:13.380> and

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
everything that'll help us heatsink and

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.250 
everything that'll help us heatsink and
also<00:05:14.580> help<00:05:14.789> to<00:05:14.940> keep<00:05:15.120> from<00:05:15.449> blowing<00:05:15.660> through

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
also help to keep from blowing through

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.529 
also help to keep from blowing through
if<00:05:16.949> things<00:05:17.220> do<00:05:17.430> go<00:05:17.639> mold<00:05:17.940> and<00:05:18.180> want<00:05:18.330> to<00:05:18.389> blow

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:18.539 
if things do go mold and want to blow

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:20.719 
if things do go mold and want to blow
through<00:05:18.810> this<00:05:18.960> we'll<00:05:19.139> be<00:05:19.169> behind<00:05:19.410> it<00:05:19.830> soaking

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
through this we'll be behind it soaking

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:23.029 
through this we'll be behind it soaking
and<00:05:20.820> wicking<00:05:21.180> the<00:05:21.270> heat<00:05:21.479> out<00:05:21.660> and<00:05:22.620> that's<00:05:22.949> a

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
and wicking the heat out and that's a

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.750 
and wicking the heat out and that's a
little<00:05:23.220> trick<00:05:23.550> you<00:05:23.699> can<00:05:23.820> also<00:05:24.000> use<00:05:25.760> coppers

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
little trick you can also use coppers

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.210 
little trick you can also use coppers
and<00:05:27.380> copper<00:05:28.380> or<00:05:28.470> brass<00:05:28.680> and<00:05:29.010> anything<00:05:29.190> that

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
and copper or brass and anything that

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
and copper or brass and anything that
won't<00:05:29.460> stick<00:05:30.120> in<00:05:30.300> but<00:05:31.370> now<00:05:32.370> that'll<00:05:32.970> help<00:05:33.120> keep

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
won't stick in but now that'll help keep

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.029 
won't stick in but now that'll help keep
things<00:05:33.690> in<00:05:33.870> check<00:05:33.900> and<00:05:34.260> balances<00:05:34.620> we<00:05:34.830> weld

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 
things in check and balances we weld

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:36.830 
things in check and balances we weld
here<00:05:35.310> and<00:05:35.940> then<00:05:36.030> we're<00:05:36.150> gonna<00:05:36.270> sheet<00:05:36.570> metal

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
here and then we're gonna sheet metal

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.379 
here and then we're gonna sheet metal
screw<00:05:37.080> this<00:05:37.229> down<00:05:37.470> first<00:05:38.039> get<00:05:38.849> all<00:05:39.000> the<00:05:39.210> metal

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389 
screw this down first get all the metal

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:41.570 
screw this down first get all the metal
fitted<00:05:39.840> and<00:05:39.990> sheet<00:05:40.199> metal<00:05:40.590> screwed<00:05:41.010> down<00:05:41.250> and

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
fitted and sheet metal screwed down and

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.210 
fitted and sheet metal screwed down and
then<00:05:42.330> we'll<00:05:42.930> clamp<00:05:43.349> or<00:05:43.620> anywhere<00:05:44.039> we're

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
then we'll clamp or anywhere we're

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.010 
then we'll clamp or anywhere we're
welding<00:05:44.430> we'll<00:05:44.820> be<00:05:44.970> clamping<00:05:45.419> very<00:05:45.690> tightly

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
welding we'll be clamping very tightly

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.640 
welding we'll be clamping very tightly
right<00:05:46.860> next<00:05:47.220> to<00:05:47.310> the<00:05:47.430> weld<00:05:47.870> such<00:05:48.870> that<00:05:49.199> we

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
right next to the weld such that we

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:55.490 
right next to the weld such that we
don't<00:05:49.919> end<00:05:50.160> up<00:05:50.400> with<00:05:50.639> any<00:05:51.320> gaps<00:05:52.669> just<00:05:54.289> to<00:05:55.289> try

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
don't end up with any gaps just to try

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.290 
don't end up with any gaps just to try
and<00:05:55.590> mimic<00:05:55.770> the<00:05:56.010> spot<00:05:56.280> weld<00:05:56.520> as<00:05:56.669> best<00:05:56.909> we<00:05:57.000> can

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
and mimic the spot weld as best we can

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.120 
and mimic the spot weld as best we can
we'll<00:05:57.930> clamp<00:05:58.139> right<00:05:58.409> next<00:05:58.740> to<00:05:58.860> where<00:05:58.979> we're

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
we'll clamp right next to where we're

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.180 
we'll clamp right next to where we're
gonna<00:05:59.220> puddle<00:05:59.880> up<00:06:00.000> and<00:06:00.270> plug<00:06:00.870> weld<00:06:01.110> so<00:06:01.919> this

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
gonna puddle up and plug weld so this

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.689 
gonna puddle up and plug weld so this
should<00:06:02.370> really<00:06:02.580> be<00:06:02.699> uneventful<00:06:03.180> I<00:06:03.419> do<00:06:03.630> need<00:06:04.050> to

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:04.699 
should really be uneventful I do need to

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:07.339 
should really be uneventful I do need to
do<00:06:05.699> need<00:06:05.849> to<00:06:05.940> trim<00:06:06.210> these<00:06:06.389> back<00:06:06.720> a<00:06:06.750> little<00:06:07.050> more

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:07.349 
do need to trim these back a little more

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:09.860 
do need to trim these back a little more
there<00:06:07.770> in<00:06:07.919> the<00:06:08.070> clip<00:06:08.610> that<00:06:08.639> I<00:06:08.940> bought<00:06:09.210> is<00:06:09.449> down

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
there in the clip that I bought is down

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.120 
there in the clip that I bought is down
to<00:06:10.050> here

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
to here

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.980 
to here
well<00:06:12.490> I<00:06:12.520> could<00:06:12.790> try<00:06:13.030> and<00:06:13.150> tease<00:06:13.300> this<00:06:13.510> factory

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
well I could try and tease this factory

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.860 
well I could try and tease this factory
join<00:06:14.320> off<00:06:14.530> the<00:06:14.920> other<00:06:15.070> roof<00:06:15.310> it's<00:06:16.300> not<00:06:16.600> a<00:06:16.630> good

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
join off the other roof it's not a good

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.540 
join off the other roof it's not a good
idea<00:06:17.020> we<00:06:17.350> found<00:06:17.560> a<00:06:17.620> bunch<00:06:17.860> of<00:06:18.010> lead<00:06:18.280> in<00:06:18.430> the

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
idea we found a bunch of lead in the

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.400 
idea we found a bunch of lead in the
other<00:06:18.670> side<00:06:21.150> and<00:06:22.150> it's<00:06:22.360> almost<00:06:22.600> like<00:06:22.780> at<00:06:23.290> the

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.410 
other side and it's almost like at the

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.080 
other side and it's almost like at the
factory<00:06:23.830> this<00:06:24.010> was<00:06:24.220> a<00:06:24.250> little<00:06:24.490> ill-fitting

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
factory this was a little ill-fitting

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.850 
factory this was a little ill-fitting
and<00:06:25.210> they<00:06:25.330> had<00:06:25.450> it<00:06:25.570> loaded<00:06:26.140> with<00:06:26.290> lead<00:06:26.530> to<00:06:26.770> the

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
and they had it loaded with lead to the

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.350 
and they had it loaded with lead to the
point<00:06:27.100> to<00:06:27.220> where<00:06:27.340> I<00:06:27.400> put<00:06:27.850> my<00:06:27.880> screwdriver

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
point to where I put my screwdriver

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.370 
point to where I put my screwdriver
right<00:06:28.690> through<00:06:28.840> the<00:06:28.930> lead

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380 
right through the lead

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.130 
right through the lead
we<00:06:30.340> know<00:06:30.490> that's<00:06:30.730> from<00:06:31.330> the<00:06:31.480> factory<00:06:31.900> so<00:06:32.020> we're

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.140 
we know that's from the factory so we're

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.090 
we know that's from the factory so we're
gonna<00:06:32.230> go<00:06:32.410> down<00:06:32.530> a<00:06:32.590> little<00:06:32.830> a<00:06:33.160> little<00:06:33.730> further

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:35.100 
gonna go down a little a little further

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.430 
gonna go down a little a little further
see<00:06:36.100> the<00:06:36.220> clips<00:06:36.490> here<00:06:37.110> you're<00:06:38.110> gonna<00:06:38.200> come

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.440 
see the clips here you're gonna come

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.080 
see the clips here you're gonna come
down<00:06:38.590> a<00:06:38.620> little<00:06:38.950> further<00:06:39.250> stay<00:06:39.820> away<00:06:40.030> from

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.090 
down a little further stay away from

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.610 
down a little further stay away from
this<00:06:40.450> joint<00:06:40.810> off<00:06:41.500> this<00:06:42.600> 9:44<00:06:43.600> roof<00:06:43.870> and<00:06:44.500> we'll

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:44.620 
this joint off this 9:44 roof and we'll

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.230 
this joint off this 9:44 roof and we'll
keep<00:06:44.740> this<00:06:45.010> and<00:06:45.340> then<00:06:45.460> we'll<00:06:45.580> make<00:06:45.700> this<00:06:45.880> a<00:06:45.940> TIG

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 
keep this and then we'll make this a TIG

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.890 
keep this and then we'll make this a TIG
weld<00:06:46.480> joint<00:06:46.810> here<00:06:47.140> and<00:06:48.330> hopefully<00:06:49.330> the<00:06:49.720> heat

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:49.900 
weld joint here and hopefully the heat

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.330 
weld joint here and hopefully the heat
won't<00:06:50.140> impact<00:06:50.470> this<00:06:50.710> and<00:06:50.890> I'm<00:06:50.950> hoping<00:06:51.190> I'll<00:06:51.310> be

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:51.340 
won't impact this and I'm hoping I'll be

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.670 
won't impact this and I'm hoping I'll be
able<00:06:51.430> to<00:06:51.640> tease<00:06:52.540> this<00:06:52.750> joint<00:06:53.110> off<00:06:53.290> I<00:06:53.530> can

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
able to tease this joint off I can

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.560 
able to tease this joint off I can
basically<00:06:53.950> grind<00:06:54.460> away<00:06:54.610> the<00:06:54.730> underbelly<00:06:55.210> if<00:06:55.450> I

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:55.570 
basically grind away the underbelly if I

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:57.090 
basically grind away the underbelly if I
need<00:06:55.780> you<00:06:55.900> to<00:06:55.990> get<00:06:56.110> it<00:06:56.290> out<00:06:56.410> without

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:57.100 
need you to get it out without

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.310 
need you to get it out without
destroying<00:06:57.670> that<00:06:57.910> joint<00:06:58.210> and<00:06:58.960> we'll<00:06:59.110> buck

00:06:59.310 --> 00:06:59.320 
destroying that joint and we'll buck

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:04.200 
destroying that joint and we'll buck
that<00:06:59.500> right<00:06:59.740> up<00:07:00.060> and<00:07:01.060> go<00:07:01.480> with<00:07:01.690> that<00:07:02.760> so<00:07:03.760> that

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.210 
that right up and go with that so that

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.330 
that right up and go with that so that
should<00:07:04.420> be<00:07:04.450> real<00:07:04.780> good<00:07:05.050> as<00:07:05.710> we<00:07:05.890> get<00:07:06.040> the<00:07:06.130> lid

should be real good as we get the lid
