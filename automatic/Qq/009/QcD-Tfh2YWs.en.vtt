00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.860
 Hello and welcome to it 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.279
 los angeles on learning software reviews 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.430
 today we are blocking in this series 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.460
 again in this further part that 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:28.619
 power supply in each case comes a network 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:31.949
 from sony for use without a model on it 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.140
 cable management and in this direction in 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.430
 the case like mine was already mentioned 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.910
 this is a bitfenix 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.090
 policy project housing this must 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.450
 we have a framework with these four 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.600
 we have to thumb-screw it first 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.420
 to solve 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:01:01.410
 and this frame is then accordingly 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:01:06.570
 can be attached to the power supply itself 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.700
 that it's a metal frame and who that 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.409
 screw it all over and see 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.409
 We'll be right back 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:19.020
 so four screws later, the whole looks 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.140
 because if someone asks himself now 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:26.010
 how these screws look 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.990
 in that case where is relatively short too and 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.820
 now this is the net itself 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.360
 frame 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.740
 Now we have the power supply including cable 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:52.729
 that from here everything and 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:52.729
 let carry out 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.940
 a dust filter in the countess floor and 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.320
 so it also lukasz zaluska and 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.360
 western drifting is already on 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.320
 has a cycle 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.970
 so now we have the net 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:14.930
 time differences we then accordingly 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.930
 I imagine different so pure 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.160
 so and now the whole thing will be one 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.160
 decision 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:40.080
 and now these are going to screw 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:43.740
 used to take everything a bit 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:50.130
 differently every first screw also consolidates 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:55.530
 here it does not matter if you cross 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:59.209
 to screw on or not and after we 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:03.510
 because all four screws have fastened 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:07.320
 the power supply is also moderately in 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:11.239
 this housing the whole thing not yet 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.140
 firmly watch that should hold 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.320
 maybe a power supply is involved 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.239
 motlanthe system can be quite good 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.060
 I do not say I do not have any 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.070
 time there and then you should now 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.760
 actually to the installation of the network 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:29.310
 in this operation radecki housing for 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.470
 the homeserver will be a set win me 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.150
 Thank you then for watching would 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.220
 me about comments rating and we 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.989
 Of course, I'm happy to subscribe 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.260
 Also look forward to seeing you next time 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:42.620
 set aside again and then the second 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.620
 round
