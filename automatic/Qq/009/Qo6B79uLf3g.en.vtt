00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:09.350
 the deep knowledge of the four 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.119
 elements inspired the American man to 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.610
 create one of the musical instruments 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:17.270
 most amazing of the time 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:20.630
 prehispanic the whistling vessels of 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:24.260
 water these instruments are executed with 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:27.110
 water this element is introduced into your 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.360
 interior and the movement of the vessel 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.300
 side to side produced by the 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.360
 performer causes water to travel through 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.010
 internal cavities of the instrument 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.520
 pushing the air and producing a 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.520
 whistle 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.500
 this complex acoustic design is the 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.870
 result of hundreds of years of 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.690
 research and development of the same 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.989
 instrument prototype by various 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.690
 prehispanic cultures the most 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:03.230
 old ones were in the chorrera culture 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.470
 south of ecuador and with an antiquity 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.540
 more than 3000 years 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.990
 not only the development is striking 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:16.140
 acoustic of the whistling vessels but 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:18.840
 also its complex ornamentations 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.050
 unlike other types of vessels that 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.240
 they fulfilled the function of utilitarian 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.860
 water whistling vessels are grouped 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.650
 inside the sound artifacts 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.250
 rituals 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.830
 besides generating a sound they invoked 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.460
 a ritual action 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:43.360
 in the vessels are represented from 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:48.470
 animals like monkeys dogs owls rats 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:52.370
 deer toads and various birds up 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:55.080
 group ritual coitus scenes and 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.530
 all kinds of characters 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.050
 is frequent in representations 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.409
 find musicians performing antaras and 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.109
 drums 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:12.650
 there are many models of vessels 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:15.069
 water whistlers there are 1 2 3 and 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.980
 up to 4 bodies 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.170
 according to the Andean tradition the 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.959
 construction of whistling vessels of 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.420
 water with greek harmonically the 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.659
 four elements so that the vessels 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.450
 have corporeality you need to model 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:35.410
 with clay the element that we 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:38.890
 Our pachamama offers the land 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.530
 the clay allowed to discover that when 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.040
 it is subjected to high temperatures 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:49.240
 through the fire it takes a consistency 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:53.410
 very solid allowing it to last for 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:56.200
 millenia these pots made of earth 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:00.250
 and fire contain inside 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:04.360
 the air element when we enter the 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.360
 fourth element the water produces the union 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.960
 harmonic of these four elements 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.960
 manifested in the sound
