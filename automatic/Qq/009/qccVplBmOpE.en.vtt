00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:13.670
 I fell and fell heavily 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.670
 I had everything in my head had intercepted 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:23.279
 we at adfc reject a general one 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:25.529
 Helmet duty from my son can not anymore 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.250
 Brakes and falls with his head off 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.570
 tal against the ex mother 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.390
 the brain gets a high 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:51.379
 speed is moving back and forth and 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:54.359
 there is bruise on we can in the 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.730
 matter that a typical pose 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:59.100
 Gray bother area small bleeding 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.140
 occurred these small hemorrhages are 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.030
 and they see here in this area they 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.220
 see also provide other where the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.130
 patient did not come off 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.830
 smaller hemorrhage also in the area of 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.680
 in the back part of it became one 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.920
 typical damage for example if 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.900
 one also the screen field we can from 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.590
 medical view only urgently 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.240
 recommend wearing a helmet and one 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.410
 deforestation of a dismissal at this 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.570
 to produce a fall 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.280
 and if you wear this helmet 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.530
 you have a high probability of that 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.770
 a part of the power survival 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.770
 become 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.159
 pedestrian 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.010
 from the cradle 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.850
 books for the 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.850
 must be behind bars 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.130
 day ahead 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:17.390
 So it's not my thing to puzzle 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:21.349
 I have the impression that it is more like that 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.209
 a puzzle task and I had to 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:27.380
 a whole while, and there and then 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:29.090
 think about it and me very much 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.579
 So I can concentrate a lot 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.989
 remember and must rather heavy pictures 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:40.790
 look at the pictures and keep pictures 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:42.769
 not not good in the head of mine 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.390
 accident i do not know anything at all so i am 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.680
 traveling by bike in berlin 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.660
 and can remember that me 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.269
 got on my bike 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.090
 I'm not able to drive anymore 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.579
 Remember as I drive several streets 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.530
 can not remember who crossed me 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.940
 how I fell 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.120
 I can not remember it either 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:09.500
 that I was picked up by the ambulance 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:13.069
 I fell and fell heavily 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.380
 I just caught everything with my head 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.980
 So I had a little wonder yet 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.050
 on the knee 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:24.010
 but a bit bled me though 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:27.980
 No one else had any such problems 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.170
 on the body but everything was was on 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.120
 head so I had a show in the face 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.010
 I had a laceration on my forehead 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.630
 I broke my ear 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.390
 I have mine 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.940
 two factors are involved in the skull and 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.610
 had around the failures I have 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.050
 it was only here that it became so clear 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.550
 I do not have that for a long time 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.090
 perceived and also not true 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.880
 want 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:55.100
 yes it strikes me bad already 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:57.850
 Remember patterns and all the strong ones 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.920
 and talk bad and so on 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:05.200
 lasts a long time overall 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:08.600
 all very long and i thought that i was 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:15.770
 I am fit again much faster and also 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:19.150
 faster load is his rule 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:22.850
 It's harder for me to think 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:27.040
 Often I am more exhausted than now 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.040
 of physical activities 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:34.719
 the same vision 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.719
 how should one cut to the car or 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:39.430
 he does not talk human 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.380
 no one discusses consistency like that anymore 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.370
 often at the beginning only for self-protection 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:53.960
 uncertain 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:56.540
 We are obliged by the adfc we reject one 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.440
 General helmets from the ground 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.050
 that gives you bad experiences 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.639
 Australia has one 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.620
 Helmet requirement has been introduced 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:05.540
 as a result, there are fewer 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.880
 people on wheel risen 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.400
 accident figures were not in the 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.770
 same dimensions back the result was 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.830
 So the cyclists still on the way 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.960
 are at a higher risk of accident and 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.240
 we fear that in germany 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.539
 could be exactly why reject 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.979
 we turn that light off so he has one 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:28.400
 protection has not been controversial 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:30.530
 but that may be we are the one 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.539
 opinion that much more to the 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.430
 Causes the causes of accidents work 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:36.470
 must instead of the accident consequences 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.280
 we want to fool around so we want accidents 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.470
 prevent 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.199
 We think that is much more effective 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.710
 as a small part of the head too 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:44.900
 protect 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.300
 no we are not against bicycle helmets 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.010
 We also recommend for children and 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.860
 to wear a helmet for older people 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.720
 because these populations come in 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.410
 the accident statistics above average 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.010
 often before 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:00.530
 Every year more and more people die in traffic 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.419
 pedestrians and significantly more drivers 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.669
 So it's not clear why 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:06.970
 Bikers just wear a helmet 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:06.970
 have to 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:13.920
 that for children should be as law 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.460
 what his eleven 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:19.880
 However, it contains only concrete 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.880
 to prepare fuel 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:30.990
 yes, that is the helmet of my son 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.139
 he is now four and a half years old and 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.850
 I also said my child must 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:36.930
 amazing thing was i thought mine 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.060
 child will need the helmet because he 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.680
 make my accident and fall down yourself 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.330
 but here is another story 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.590
 children must still on the walkway 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.960
 drive when they are so small because they are 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.850
 to practice and we wanted to go around the corner 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.980
 please bend I said please stop 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.900
 slower and in the moment comes too 

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.940
 A woman around the corner she does not look 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.500
 certainly not after my child and 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.750
 my son can not brake anymore and 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.500
 falls with his head from tal against the 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.940
 ex mother 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.010
 You can see the beautiful here 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.450
 it has turned out a bit 

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.919
 wanted the choice or finally a lot 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.389
 deeper still if you see this hole 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:08.190
 then you know clearly that would have 

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:13.460
 beautiful hole in the head of my 

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:13.460
 Therefore, helm can be child 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.920
 Otto Frank 

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:29.310
 which is very interesting for me 

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:31.699
 after the accident to watch that 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:34.680
 several of my friends and girlfriends 

00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:36.720
 Helmet bought directly after the 

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.900
 accident and this helmet now too 

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:43.349
 wear regularly and which the one 

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:45.440
 helmet at home have the wear the now 

00:07:43.349 --> 00:07:47.610
 just regularly and if they are 

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.560
 forgot then they drive again 

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:51.240
 home and then again home or 

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.819
 Also go home and get the 

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:56.069
 helm to you definitely definitely ask 

00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:58.020
 not without a helmet and that's what I think 

00:07:56.069 --> 00:08:00.650
 a very interesting observation 

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.650
 i am doing right now
