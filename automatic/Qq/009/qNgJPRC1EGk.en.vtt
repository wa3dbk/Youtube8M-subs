00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:33.210 

it's<00:01:27.110> like<00:01:27.260> I<00:01:27.350> don't<00:01:27.470> want<00:01:27.680> to<00:01:27.740> go<00:01:27.830> down<00:01:28.010> on<00:01:28.220> it

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:43.560 

that's<00:01:34.220> cuz<00:01:34.430> this<00:01:34.640> thing<00:01:34.850> has<00:01:35.060> to<00:01:35.240> rotate<00:01:35.420> I

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:50.020 

can't<00:01:44.570> remember<00:01:44.690> how<00:01:44.899> I<00:01:44.930> did<00:01:45.170> this<00:01:48.759> to<00:01:49.759> do<00:01:49.910> is

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
can't remember how I did this to do is

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.100 
can't remember how I did this to do is
they<00:01:50.149> have<00:01:50.300> that<00:01:50.990> right<00:01:51.170> there<00:01:51.229> has<00:01:51.649> to<00:01:51.679> rotate

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
they have that right there has to rotate

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.200 
they have that right there has to rotate
so<00:01:54.110> that<00:01:54.140> it'll<00:01:54.800> go<00:01:54.890> over<00:01:55.070> I'm<00:01:55.759> gonna<00:01:55.850> look<00:01:56.030> too

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
so that it'll go over I'm gonna look too

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.700 
so that it'll go over I'm gonna look too
close<00:01:56.450> they're<00:01:56.690> they'll<00:01:57.229> go<00:01:57.380> over<00:01:57.530> that

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
close they're they'll go over that

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.910 
close they're they'll go over that
little<00:01:57.860> bump<00:01:58.250> on<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:58.729> back<00:01:58.910> and<00:01:59.149> lock<00:01:59.300> it

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
little bump on the back and lock it

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.440 
little bump on the back and lock it
because<00:02:00.920> it<00:02:01.039> doesn't<00:02:01.190> torquing<00:02:01.729> and<00:02:02.090> torques
