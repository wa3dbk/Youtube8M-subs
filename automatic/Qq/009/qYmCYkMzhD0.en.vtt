pipe and the vending machines a

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:58.950 
pipe and the vending machines a
mechanical<00:00:57.070> marvel<00:00:57.550> so<00:00:57.969> the<00:00:58.210> way<00:00:58.359> I<00:00:58.390> figure<00:00:58.539> it

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
mechanical marvel so the way I figure it

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.900 
mechanical marvel so the way I figure it
what<00:00:59.589> if<00:00:59.710> we<00:00:59.859> shot<00:01:00.160> the<00:01:00.370> bullet<00:01:00.519> into

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
what if we shot the bullet into

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.970 
what if we shot the bullet into
something<00:01:01.329> that<00:01:01.570> didn't<00:01:02.050> actually<00:01:02.260> involve

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
something that didn't actually involve

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.470 
something that didn't actually involve
an<00:01:03.309> impact<00:01:03.850> like<00:01:04.089> say<00:01:04.930> a<00:01:05.110> vent<00:01:05.530> pipe<00:01:05.920> it<00:01:06.880> does

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480 
an impact like say a vent pipe it does

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.920 
an impact like say a vent pipe it does
one<00:01:08.050> thing<00:01:08.560> and<00:01:09.040> it<00:01:09.730> does<00:01:09.940> it<00:01:10.120> really<00:01:10.300> well<00:01:10.630> I

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
one thing and it does it really well I

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.190 
one thing and it does it really well I
like<00:01:11.260> that

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
like that

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.609 
like that
there<00:01:12.979> we<00:01:13.070> go<00:01:16.689> let's<00:01:17.689> remind<00:01:18.049> you<00:01:18.320> of<00:01:18.469> when<00:01:18.590> you

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
there we go let's remind you of when you

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.700 
there we go let's remind you of when you
used<00:01:18.740> to<00:01:19.009> hunt<00:01:19.189> Mastodon<00:01:20.320> it's<00:01:21.320> like<00:01:21.469> a<00:01:21.500> big

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
used to hunt Mastodon it's like a big

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:29.559 
used to hunt Mastodon it's like a big
macaroni<00:01:26.740> all<00:01:27.740> that<00:01:28.130> remains<00:01:28.520> is<00:01:28.789> for<00:01:28.850> atom<00:01:29.210> to

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:29.569 
macaroni all that remains is for atom to

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:31.870 
macaroni all that remains is for atom to
mount<00:01:29.840> and<00:01:30.079> secure<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.679> pipe<00:01:30.860> while<00:01:31.490> Jamie

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
mount and secure the pipe while Jamie

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.300 
mount and secure the pipe while Jamie
positions<00:01:32.539> a<00:01:32.659> fat<00:01:32.929> slab<00:01:33.259> of<00:01:33.289> ballistics<00:01:33.619> gel

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
positions a fat slab of ballistics gel

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.430 
positions a fat slab of ballistics gel
to<00:01:34.789> hopefully<00:01:35.179> catch<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:36.110> bullet

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.560 

at<00:01:40.800> this<00:01:41.160> point<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.550> may<00:01:41.700> be<00:01:41.730> wondering<00:01:41.850> what

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
at this point you may be wondering what

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.360 
at this point you may be wondering what
is<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.840> curve<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.590> bent<00:01:43.980> pipe<00:01:44.160> you're

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
is the curve of the bent pipe you're

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.650 
is the curve of the bent pipe you're
shooting<00:01:44.610> into<00:01:44.760> well<00:01:45.120> it's<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.480> good<00:01:45.600> question

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
shooting into well it's a good question

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.810 
shooting into well it's a good question
right<00:01:46.380> now<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:46.860> pipe<00:01:47.100> has<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.310> radius<00:01:47.670> of

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
right now this pipe has a radius of

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.120 
right now this pipe has a radius of
about<00:01:48.000> eighty<00:01:48.420> eight<00:01:48.750> inches<00:01:49.230> that<00:01:49.770> means<00:01:49.980> if

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
about eighty eight inches that means if

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.590 
about eighty eight inches that means if
it<00:01:50.190> was<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.370> complete<00:01:50.700> circle<00:01:51.150> it<00:01:51.390> would<00:01:51.510> be

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
it was a complete circle it would be

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.650 
it was a complete circle it would be
about<00:01:51.810> 15<00:01:52.410> feet<00:01:52.560> across<00:01:52.890> why<00:01:53.820> haven't<00:01:54.240> we<00:01:54.270> bent

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
about 15 feet across why haven't we bent

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.000 
about 15 feet across why haven't we bent
it<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.900> come<00:01:55.050> all<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.230> way<00:01:55.320> back<00:01:55.440> around<00:01:55.650> to

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
it to come all the way back around to

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.040 
it to come all the way back around to
the<00:01:56.070> gun<00:01:56.250> that's<00:01:57.030> simply<00:01:57.390> because<00:01:57.420> we're<00:01:57.900> not

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
the gun that's simply because we're not

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.080 
the gun that's simply because we're not
sure<00:01:58.290> this<00:01:58.470> is<00:01:58.620> going<00:01:58.800> to<00:01:58.950> work<00:01:59.130> at<00:01:59.370> all<00:01:59.670> so

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
sure this is going to work at all so

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.450 
sure this is going to work at all so
we're<00:02:00.510> going<00:02:00.660> to<00:02:00.840> incrementally<00:02:01.260> sneak<00:02:02.070> up<00:02:02.280> on

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
we're going to incrementally sneak up on

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.990 
we're going to incrementally sneak up on
it<00:02:02.490> why<00:02:03.030> put<00:02:03.270> all<00:02:03.360> our<00:02:03.390> eggs<00:02:03.600> in<00:02:03.750> one<00:02:03.810> basket

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
wow I had no idea it would be so

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.780 
wow I had no idea it would be so
pristine<00:02:32.629> look<00:02:33.590> at<00:02:33.739> that<00:02:33.890> it's<00:02:34.069> a<00:02:34.250> nice<00:02:34.489> little

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790

around<00:02:41.510> steel<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.290> return<00:02:42.890> with<00:02:42.920> a<00:02:43.190> vengeance

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
around steel and return with a vengeance

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.199 
around steel and return with a vengeance
it<00:02:44.180> penetrated<00:02:44.930> 14<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:45.799> a<00:02:45.860> half<00:02:45.890> inches<00:02:46.489> at

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
it penetrated 14 and a half inches at

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.680 
it penetrated 14 and a half inches at
which<00:02:47.840> would<00:02:48.080> cripple<00:02:48.349> the<00:02:48.620> shooter<00:02:49.690> our

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
which would cripple the shooter our

first in shallow has been on the pipe

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.600 
first in shallow has been on the pipe
gave<00:02:52.610> us<00:02:52.959> 622<00:02:53.959> feet<00:02:53.989> per<00:02:54.530> second<00:02:54.950> as<00:02:55.069> an<00:02:55.220> exit

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
gave us 622 feet per second as an exit

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.699 
gave us 622 feet per second as an exit
speed<00:02:55.849> which<00:02:56.180> means<00:02:56.450> it<00:02:56.629> was<00:02:56.780> fully<00:02:57.079> lethal

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
speed which means it was fully lethal

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.369 
speed which means it was fully lethal
not<00:02:58.459> only<00:02:58.640> that<00:02:58.760> but<00:02:58.970> if<00:02:59.329> you<00:02:59.480> look<00:02:59.629> at<00:02:59.810> how<00:03:00.079> far

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
not only that but if you look at how far

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.490 
not only that but if you look at how far
it<00:03:00.500> went<00:03:00.680> in<00:03:00.890> this<00:03:01.040> ballistics<00:03:01.640> gel<00:03:02.110> if<00:03:03.110> it<00:03:03.349> hit

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
it went in this ballistics gel if it hit

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.319 
it went in this ballistics gel if it hit
me<00:03:03.680> this<00:03:03.890> way<00:03:04.129> it<00:03:04.549> would<00:03:04.730> have<00:03:04.790> gone<00:03:04.879> clean

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
me this way it would have gone clean

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:10.710 
me this way it would have gone clean
through<00:03:05.360> me

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.280 

so<00:03:11.350> now<00:03:11.590> to<00:03:11.650> ramp<00:03:12.190> up<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.610> a<00:03:12.640> fitting<00:03:13.210> finale

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
so now to ramp up to a fitting finale

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.650 
so now to ramp up to a fitting finale
the<00:03:14.290> machines<00:03:14.740> redeployed<00:03:15.100> to<00:03:15.820> give<00:03:16.060> maximum

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
the machines redeployed to give maximum

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.560 
the machines redeployed to give maximum
curve<00:03:17.170> for<00:03:17.530> their<00:03:17.710> bending<00:03:18.010> but<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:19.030> plan<00:03:19.330> is

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
curve for their bending but the plan is

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.050 
curve for their bending but the plan is
to<00:03:19.600> wrestle<00:03:20.320> the<00:03:20.440> pipe<00:03:20.680> almost<00:03:21.460> back<00:03:21.730> in<00:03:21.940> a

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
to wrestle the pipe almost back in a

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.050 
to wrestle the pipe almost back in a
circle<00:03:25.290> 23-inch<00:03:26.290> radius<00:03:26.880> that's<00:03:27.880> pretty

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
circle 23-inch radius that's pretty

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.440 
circle 23-inch radius that's pretty
tight<00:03:28.360> that's<00:03:28.750> pretty<00:03:28.960> tight<00:03:30.000> more<00:03:31.000> friction

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
tight that's pretty tight more friction

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.350 
tight that's pretty tight more friction
decreases<00:03:31.960> the<00:03:32.770> chance<00:03:33.070> of<00:03:33.220> success<00:03:33.700> but

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
decreases the chance of success but

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.080 
decreases the chance of success but
they're<00:03:34.630> both<00:03:34.840> optimistic<00:03:35.710> let's<00:03:36.550> go<00:03:36.700> see<00:03:36.940> how

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
they're both optimistic let's go see how

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.240 
they're both optimistic let's go see how
it<00:03:37.210> fits<00:03:37.510> I<00:03:37.780> think<00:03:38.050> it's<00:03:38.170> gonna<00:03:38.320> work<00:03:38.410> I'm

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
it fits I think it's gonna work I'm

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.660 
it fits I think it's gonna work I'm
feeling<00:03:39.580> so<00:03:39.760> good<00:03:39.910> about<00:03:39.970> this<00:03:40.680> in<00:03:41.680> fact<00:03:42.040> Adams

well<00:04:14.590> the<00:04:14.890> final<00:04:15.220> speed<00:04:15.430> will<00:04:15.610> be<00:04:15.700> determined

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
well the final speed will be determined

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.009 
well the final speed will be determined
by the<00:04:16.419> high-speed<00:04:16.870> camera

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.710 

we<00:04:22.919> got<00:04:23.160> a<00:04:23.460> final<00:04:24.060> exit<00:04:24.690> speed<00:04:25.849> 338<00:04:26.849> feet<00:04:27.419> per

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
we got a final exit speed 338 feet per

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.339 
we got a final exit speed 338 feet per
second<00:04:28.139> yes<00:04:28.680> a<00:04:28.949> kill<00:04:29.430> shot<00:04:29.990> that<00:04:30.990> would<00:04:31.199> be<00:04:31.319> a

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:31.349 
second yes a kill shot that would be a

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:35.300 
second yes a kill shot that would be a
kill<00:04:31.650> shot<00:04:31.889> well<00:04:32.659> potentially<00:04:33.659> lethal<00:04:34.310> nice

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
kill shot well potentially lethal nice

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.300 
kill shot well potentially lethal nice
work<00:04:36.349> I'm<00:04:37.349> all<00:04:37.530> happy<00:04:37.770> now

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.200 

there's<00:04:40.910> no<00:04:41.300> doubt<00:04:41.600> it's<00:04:41.840> a<00:04:42.110> stunning<00:04:42.650> result

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
there's no doubt it's a stunning result

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.570 
there's no doubt it's a stunning result
but<00:04:44.210> we<00:04:44.420> know<00:04:44.450> that<00:04:44.840> the<00:04:44.960> myth<00:04:45.200> has<00:04:45.440> meandered

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
but we know that the myth has meandered

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.080 
but we know that the myth has meandered
somewhat<00:04:46.580> from<00:04:46.880> its<00:04:47.060> ricochet<00:04:47.690> roots<00:04:49.090> but

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
somewhat from its ricochet roots but

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.880 
somewhat from its ricochet roots but
what's<00:04:50.300> the<00:04:50.420> takeaway<00:04:50.690> from<00:04:50.960> this<00:04:51.140> myth<00:04:51.470> well

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
what's the takeaway from this myth well

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.040 
what's the takeaway from this myth well
we<00:04:52.640> know<00:04:52.940> that<00:04:52.970> people<00:04:53.360> get<00:04:53.570> killed<00:04:53.840> by

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.120 
ricochets that's not the point the point
is<00:04:56.270> that<00:04:56.480> a<00:04:56.540> bullet<00:04:56.780> bouncing<00:04:57.530> off<00:04:57.650> three
