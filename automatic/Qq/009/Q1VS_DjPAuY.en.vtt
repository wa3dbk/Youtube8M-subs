00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:06.149
 a new technology promises to revolutionize the speech of your house is the bugre 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:09.369
 main candidate for dvd successor 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:13.049
 only that barely reached the stores there are also news launched by a bank 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:13.730
 public 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.049
 strong competitor to the internet 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.660
 the report by mônica sanches with the collaboration of jorge pontual 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.700
 heard by the government 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.930
 I feel like taking home thorn 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.780
 on the same date of operation the imagination allowed 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.160
 some more memories and new values 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.010
 6 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.190
 the consumer is always in doubt 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.190
 I hope new technology is in a hurry. 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.010
 story of a single metropolitan ticket goes 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.760
 the chapters some protagonists that there is panel of the senate 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.490
 at the end of the 80's this system that the seaside 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.540
 lost space lost the war completely to accumulate rs 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.780
 soon there were people who invested 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.330
 at the time as it is public today the number of undecided 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.790
 all the product of the market 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.120
 the whole day 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.570
 reigned absolute for several years 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.670
 but now 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.719
 will it be worth buying the latest news 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.830
 so far the first question that comes paulo 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.720
 points 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.790
 in the last season to less than half the time 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.390
 formerly commented 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.270
 You can buy 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.530
 because the technology is not great 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.530
 it only now depends on the medium-sized cost in which the passion for what 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.970
 like every launch 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.660
 the king still has car the price of the record player that also yielded had 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.300
 to go with me varies from one thousand to two thousand and two hundred reais in the Brazilian market 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.309
 but the investment is not around 

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:16.919
 not guilty of maximum power only with high definition televisions and a good 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:19.009
 sound system 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:24.439
 specialized in new media ethevaldo siqueira is one of the 150 thousand Brazilians 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.439
 I have everything right here at home. 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:37.079
 irreducible the Russian six speakers and will not have the effect we have 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:38.099
 an ipê room 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.579
 as a result 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.579
 it will have a mysterious voice left and right 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:46.229
 were years of research 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.099
 then digital high-definition images 

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:56.869
 the dispute 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:58.659
 and that two days before the break 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:00.849
 the two consortia 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.989
 led by the actions of inventor of the vehicle the other by the fans 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.809
 with hd dvd that lost strength in battle 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:14.039
 Italy or even played salary from February last year 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.189
 brunei philippines left the dispute to enter the dominated market what 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:22.029
 you should 

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:24.529
 bury in March 

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:29.819
 instead of the traditional red laser I do the rain of the end allows reading 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.989
 of much more information printed on the disc that even looks like the 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.409
 victor's performance does not have the same 12cm 

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:45.469
 but the difference is in the ability the dvd is to store four point seven in 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:52.719
 every ten against Brunei 25 to 2 hours of audio and video on the rise 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:55.719
 definition 

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:03.619
 put two hours of high-definition images and sound math cities 

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:06.510
 Northeast is an industry victory 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.329
 but same place already last week 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:14.010
 because pictures of movies today also surf the internet 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:20.829
 just as he the fifth secretary with seven download videos 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.069
 in hd is that it may be in the condition of your blu-ray player 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:26.729
 obsolete 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.580
 jorge pontual has a lot of people doing it there in the United States a lot of people 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.129
 still not wet if the most connected companies did not disclose numbers 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:40.310
 but it is known that millions of Americans instead of buying or renting the discs 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.120
 are preferring to watch over the internet is much cheaper 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.330
 getting easier and faster every day the carioca joão paulo de mattos lives there 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.189
 three years in new york 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:54.479
 I like to watch movies on the TV. 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.319
 I used to buy dvds but before long it changed. 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:01.759
 now he watches movies over the internet 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:04.599
 You could buy rocks from the movie. 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:05.830
 I understand 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.990
 stretching 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.610
 a temporary one is that you have a device that you watch sportv 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.889
 there are many ways to get the movies 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:18.889
 that the cheapest lusa is a service called in this litigation 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:24.860
 cost equivalent to 21 reais per month, he can see how many movies the 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.050
 normal by in high definition 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.190
 this connection between the tv and netflix server is done through this box 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.900
 he bought for the equivalent of 215 reais you 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:39.009
 the csa 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:40.839
 their website 

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:45.550
 and I can the constituent power I want the image quality in high 

00:05:45.549 --> 00:05:50.869
 definition is the same as the criminal king's speech today would cost almost 90 reais 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:56.430
 another service that joão paulo musa when he wants to buy a movie is the 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.900
 father had others in the wahidi era where he allowed himself to store the film in 

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:02.430
 three computers 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.820
 even without having the disc são paulo now owns the movie that can see and review the 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.849
 all you want 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:11.789
 So if you have this option, I'll study others. 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:15.259
 that you have no physical disk but you have 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:20.490
 can be cassel now monica the problem does not deliver the points so easy no 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.009
 he has a gun and both 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:24.070
 she punctuated 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.849
 it's another equipment 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:26.689
 of a family 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:29.689
 I have a popular Brazilian brand. 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.279
 the videogame 

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:35.279
 the sense of reality of the game is much greater 

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:37.520
 together with the audio 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.520
 behind the wrapping 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.340
 henrique do not keep a carrier 

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:54.379
 the next generation videogame also plays movies 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:59.839
 and the minister a weakness of the format the small supply of content 

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:03.439
 she 

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:05.389
 the industry recognizes 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:11.160
 because it has little to offer but promises changes the paper has already won in 2009 and 

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:15.290
 12 in the beginning they started to comment the consumer to have access to the launches 

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:16.550
 real estate 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:21.509
 simultaneously the releases on dvd and we are not treated as happened 

00:07:21.509 --> 00:07:22.719
 in the old days 

00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:23.819
 I did not expect 

00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:26.849
 there is no answer for all parties 

00:07:26.849 --> 00:07:31.279
 it depends on the budget of each one in front how much she enjoys movies than 

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:33.509
 I played mostly my team 

00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:38.099
 from the desire to be among the first to have a novelty at home 

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:44.369
 playing 

00:07:44.369 --> 00:07:47.109
