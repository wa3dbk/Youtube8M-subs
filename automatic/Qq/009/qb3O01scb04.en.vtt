00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 and now let's talk a little with 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.540
 our friend just lama we are going to give him 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.830
 the welcome we are going to refresh with 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.420
 these wonderful stories that we 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.429
 brings the lord just lamas that we like 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.480
 so much and that we enjoy here always 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.480
 just welcome as he walks 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.539
 the situation is great I like it 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.820
 much with the waves with the part of 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.939
 up two colors to two colors and 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.939
 good does not speak spanish 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:38.989
 I'm not saying it's a cheap suit 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:52.760
 that's why apart because it's a story 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.760
 the guys who practice pretty well 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.050
 spectacular and with a lot of adrenaline to 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.600
 that those who do not know the 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.420
 Longboard is a variant of skateboarding but 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.909
 a little longer the table this is born 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.670
 in California in the 60s hand 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.189
 the beings 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.350
 according to what I read tired of not being able 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.270
 grab the waves that they intended to 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.310
 continue or look for an alternative that 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.130
 allow to live almost the same adrenaline 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.110
 It is there that the first table of the 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.950
 shoulder of course requires a 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:28.310
 physical activity well prepared strong and 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:32.960
 this sport is usually styled for 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:35.310
 make descents and well steep runs 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.290
 degree of activity you can throw yourself 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.200
 by the canyon use it in a flat place 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.939
 and kicking your longboard and choosing that 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.200
 method transports and something is good 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.820
 I'm sure that anyone can be there 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.890
 go downhill you have to be a little bit more 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.939
 but yes, here we are going to see a descent 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.939
 super entity this happened 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.749
 [Music] 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.090
 we live what we were young 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.189
 passionate about the longboard or a 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.670
 extreme sport that grows day by day in 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.670
 our country 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.990
 [Music] 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.710
 in california in the usa 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:24.920
 in the 60s and here Argentina or is calculated 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.140
 that about 10 years ago more or less that 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.180
 practice is the difference between skateboarding 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.210
 and longboard and skateboarding is used 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.200
 usually for testing 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.850
 of jump 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.770
 twists 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.350
 has harder wheels more direction 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.319
 hard shorter table this more 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:48.170
 flexible maneuverable 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.170
 It has more movement besides the size 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.069
 [Music] 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.920
 how much speed does it take to take the hype 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:01.569
 the record is at one hundred and thirty-one 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:06.159
 that made it a handle 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:11.070
 and the average speed of the descent of 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:11.840
 Descent is between 70 and 80 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.730
 [Music] 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:20.160
 [Applause] 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:22.620
 [Music] 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.800
 we protect ourselves with leather suits that 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:30.220
 they are like this has hips 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:33.460
 knee pads and with integral helmets like 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:38.610
 this one that are carbon fiber and fiber 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.610
 of glass and are chords to the discipline 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:46.150
 there are longboard tracks in the country 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:49.599
 which are national or provincial routes 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.739
 that are usually cut to develop the 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.739
 practice demands 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.890
 we take the air and we are 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.920
 quite complicated because we do not have 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:04.820
 a space we practice here in 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:08.370
 the square miter in recoleta but we have 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:11.940
 to take care of many of the cars 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.760
 calculate the traffic lights to avoid 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:18.209
 accidents and what we demand is that a 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:21.709
 place to be able to practice as 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.709
 any other sport 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:30.840
 as a group we manage the unit 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.560
 help inclusion sleep travel 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.280
 the world 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.200
 doing downloads that strange what message 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.410
 you would give a young man who wants to start 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:44.850
 to practice this sport that skates that 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.850
 skate and continue skating 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:55.160
 [Music] 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.610
 for these good longboard youngsters 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.480
 Aires are demanding a place to 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.640
 be able to skate 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.100
 there are many skate parks but there is no 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.240
 no clue shoulder in Buenos Aires 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.680
 it is still not dangerous 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.960
 There were many accidents in CÃ³rdoba 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.550
 many but of life so they 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.350
 they demand a place where they can 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.840
 practice this sport a very sport 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:22.410
 practiced by women is also like this is 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.670
 pretty much on the three axes and how do you 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.280
 I counted before just you can also 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.590
 use quietly for your neighborhood without 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.390
 need to use it in ravines there not 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.240
 you are so much protection and helmets more 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.440
 Starting your guard lion transports 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.820
 connected deserted deserted if many 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.830
 guys use it as a means of transportation 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.240

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:51.590
 when it reflects what wakeboarding and 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:51.590
