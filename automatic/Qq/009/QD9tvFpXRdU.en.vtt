hey guys coming from revolution x-games

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.490 
hey guys coming from revolution x-games
here<00:00:03.000> and<00:00:03.240> today<00:00:03.570> I'm<00:00:03.720> going<00:00:03.899> to<00:00:04.020> talk<00:00:04.319> about

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
here and today I'm going to talk about

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.550 
here and today I'm going to talk about
Marcus<00:00:05.160> I'm<00:00:05.940> going<00:00:06.569> to<00:00:06.750> split<00:00:07.140> this<00:00:07.379> video

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
Marcus I'm going to split this video

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.190 
Marcus I'm going to split this video
into<00:00:07.770> four<00:00:08.460> different<00:00:08.700> sections<00:00:09.120> what<00:00:09.990> the

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
into four different sections what the

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.240 
into four different sections what the
markers<00:00:10.620> are<00:00:10.830> for<00:00:11.240> why<00:00:12.240> markers<00:00:12.809> make

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
markers are for why markers make

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.430 
markers are for why markers make
hallucinations<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:15.240> personalities<00:00:16.199> of

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
hallucinations and the personalities of

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.480 
hallucinations and the personalities of
the<00:00:16.830> markers<00:00:18.439> first<00:00:19.439> off<00:00:19.710> I'm<00:00:19.920> going<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.189> talk

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
the markers first off I'm going to talk

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.029 
the markers first off I'm going to talk
about<00:00:20.789> what<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.150> markers<00:00:21.600> are<00:00:21.840> for<00:00:21.949> there<00:00:22.949> are

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
about what the markers are for there are

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.880 
about what the markers are for there are
two<00:00:23.250> theories<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.820> this<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.300> very<00:00:24.689> one<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.529> up

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
two theories to this and very one is up

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.060 
two theories to this and very one is up
in<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:27.330> series<00:00:27.779> something<00:00:28.380> showed<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.920> the

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
in the series something showed that the

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.820 
in the series something showed that the
markers<00:00:29.460> are<00:00:29.760> made<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.810> make<00:00:31.050> way<00:00:31.260> for<00:00:31.289> more

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
markers are made to make way for more

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.060 
markers are made to make way for more
advanced<00:00:32.340> species<00:00:32.960> the<00:00:33.960> Necker<00:00:34.320> moths<00:00:34.680> are

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
advanced species the Necker moths are

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.180 
advanced species the Necker moths are
made<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:36.030> kill<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.540> more<00:00:36.780> inferior<00:00:37.410> race

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
made to kill the more inferior race

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.600 
made to kill the more inferior race
which<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.059> humans<00:00:39.540> aliens<00:00:40.610> beforehand

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
which is the humans aliens beforehand

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.660 
which is the humans aliens beforehand
had<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.030> marker<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:43.200> told<00:00:43.800> them<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.309> build<00:00:44.550> a

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
had a marker that told them to build a

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.479 
had a marker that told them to build a
marker<00:00:45.059> for<00:00:45.090> humans<00:00:45.719> they<00:00:46.620> then<00:00:46.950> sent<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
marker for humans they then sent the

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.400 
marker for humans they then sent the
black<00:00:47.700> marker<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.180> earth<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
black marker to earth and the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.040 
black marker to earth and the
Necromorphs<00:00:50.160> took<00:00:50.730> out<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.210> alien<00:00:51.690> race

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
Necromorphs took out the alien race

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.000 
Necromorphs took out the alien race
which<00:00:52.850> supports<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.030> theory<00:00:54.680> this<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
which supports the theory this is the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.910 
which supports the theory this is the
second<00:00:56.969> theory<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.989> fear<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
second theory and this fear is that the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.060 
second theory and this fear is that the
markers<00:00:59.399> are<00:00:59.730> only<00:01:00.180> meant<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.780> bring<00:01:01.050> life<00:01:01.320> but

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
markers are only meant to bring life but

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.880 
markers are only meant to bring life but
is<00:01:02.219> damaged<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.539> makes<00:01:03.780> Necromorphs<00:01:04.710> in

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
is damaged so it makes Necromorphs in

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.050 
is damaged so it makes Necromorphs in
dead<00:01:05.850> space<00:01:06.150> martyr<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.770> scientists<00:01:08.549> took<00:01:08.790> a

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
dead space martyr to scientists took a

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.750 
dead space martyr to scientists took a
piece<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.350> black<00:01:10.590> marker<00:01:11.040> these<00:01:11.400> two

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
piece of the black marker these two

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.940 
piece of the black marker these two
scientists<00:01:12.330> went<00:01:12.720> insane<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.560> killed<00:01:13.799> each

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
scientists went insane and killed each

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.850 
scientists went insane and killed each
other<00:01:14.420> afterwards<00:01:15.420> other<00:01:15.960> scientists

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
other afterwards other scientists

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.940 
other afterwards other scientists
decided<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.580> bring<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.970> out<00:01:18.119> from<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.570> ocean

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
decided to bring it out from the ocean

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.880 
decided to bring it out from the ocean
the<00:01:19.950> neck<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.369> more<00:01:20.610> fabric<00:01:21.000> appeared<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.140> the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
the neck of more fabric appeared and the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.010 
the neck of more fabric appeared and the
scientists<00:01:23.549> got<00:01:23.820> information<00:01:24.119> on<00:01:24.570> how<00:01:24.960> to

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
scientists got information on how to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.740 
scientists got information on how to
build<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.830> markers<00:01:26.280> i<00:01:26.490> think<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.540> this

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
build the markers i think that this

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.770 
build the markers i think that this
information<00:01:27.990> was<00:01:28.740> tainted<00:01:29.340> because<00:01:29.790> they<00:01:30.540> got

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
information was tainted because they got

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.190 
information was tainted because they got
this<00:01:30.960> information<00:01:31.320> from<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.950> damage<00:01:32.430> marker

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
this information from a damage marker

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.499 
this information from a damage marker
which<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.229> why<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.740> red<00:01:35.100> market<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.820> marker

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
which is why the red market and marker

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.730 
which is why the red market and marker
side<00:01:36.990> werewolves<00:01:37.590> made<00:01:37.920> only<00:01:38.210> neck<00:01:39.210> lamothe
