I<00:01:45.090> thought<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.390> was<00:01:45.509> super<00:01:45.780> cool<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:47.159> for

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
I thought that was super cool and so for

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.800 
I thought that was super cool and so for
the<00:01:47.460> crust<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:48.060> actually<00:01:48.299> kept<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.689> pretty

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
graham crackers so first I'm going to

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.580 
graham crackers so first I'm going to
make<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.509> crust<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.020> I'm<00:02:04.140> just<00:02:04.229> going<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.439> pop

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
make the crust and I'm just going to pop

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.440 
make the crust and I'm just going to pop
all<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.920> these<00:02:05.040> ingredients<00:02:05.219> in<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.090> then<00:02:06.240> mix

all of these ingredients in and then mix

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.940 
all of these ingredients in and then mix
them<00:02:06.600> together<00:02:06.750> until<00:02:07.170> they<00:02:07.439> form<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.710> really

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
them together until they form a really

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.140 
them together until they form a really
kind<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.190> nice

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:09.150 
kind of nice

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.700 
kind of nice
I'm<00:02:10.150> just<00:02:10.300> gonna<00:02:10.420> pour<00:02:10.660> this<00:02:10.870> straight<00:02:11.170> in<00:02:11.380> and

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
I'm just gonna pour this straight in and

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.560 
I'm just gonna pour this straight in and
I'm<00:02:11.830> using<00:02:12.010> a<00:02:12.310> springform<00:02:12.790> pan<00:02:13.090> this<00:02:13.240> is<00:02:13.300> about

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
I'm using a springform pan this is about

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.200 
I'm using a springform pan this is about
I<00:02:13.600> think<00:02:13.780> like<00:02:14.110> a<00:02:14.140> 9-inch<00:02:14.680> springform

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
I think like a 9-inch springform

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.700 
I think like a 9-inch springform
cheesecake<00:02:16.210> is<00:02:16.420> not<00:02:16.750> a<00:02:16.780> cake<00:02:17.170> that<00:02:17.410> you<00:02:17.500> can

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
cheesecake is not a cake that you can

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.730 
cheesecake is not a cake that you can
flip<00:02:18.340> over<00:02:18.610> it's<00:02:19.120> a<00:02:19.240> cake<00:02:19.450> that<00:02:19.750> you<00:02:20.230> literally

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
flip over it's a cake that you literally

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.110 
flip over it's a cake that you literally
have<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.130> be<00:02:21.160> able<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.340> take<00:02:21.520> the<00:02:21.640> bottom<00:02:21.970> out

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
have to be able to take the bottom out

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.270 
have to be able to take the bottom out
so<00:02:22.540> I<00:02:22.570> always<00:02:23.170> make<00:02:23.350> it<00:02:23.380> in<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.620> springform<00:02:24.040> pan

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
so I always make it in a springform pan

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.190 
so I always make it in a springform pan
and<00:02:24.880> so<00:02:25.000> to<00:02:25.090> prep<00:02:25.270> it<00:02:25.420> it's<00:02:25.570> super<00:02:25.840> simple<00:02:25.960> I'm

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
and so to prep it it's super simple I'm

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.630 
and so to prep it it's super simple I'm
just<00:02:26.320> going<00:02:26.440> to<00:02:26.500> press<00:02:26.740> it<00:02:26.920> down<00:02:27.100> until<00:02:27.460> it's

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
just going to press it down until it's

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.240 
just going to press it down until it's
really<00:02:27.820> even<00:02:28.030> so<00:02:28.960> this<00:02:29.110> is<00:02:29.230> good<00:02:29.380> to<00:02:29.500> go<00:02:29.530> so<00:02:29.890> I'm

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
really even so this is good to go so I'm

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.070 
really even so this is good to go so I'm
going<00:02:30.460> to<00:02:30.520> set<00:02:30.730> this<00:02:30.850> aside<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.570> get<00:02:31.690> started

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
going to set this aside and get started

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.770 
going to set this aside and get started
on<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.320> filling<00:02:32.760> so<00:02:33.760> for<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.120> filling<00:02:34.540> it's

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
on the filling so for the filling it's

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.150 
on the filling so for the filling it's
pretty<00:02:35.050> simple<00:02:35.410> I'm<00:02:35.620> just<00:02:35.740> going<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:35.920> mix

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
pretty simple I'm just going to mix

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.100 
pretty simple I'm just going to mix
everything<00:02:36.610> together<00:02:36.850> a<00:02:37.300> little<00:02:37.600> at<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.810> time

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
everything together a little at a time

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.260 
everything together a little at a time
so<00:02:38.440> I'm<00:02:38.680> first<00:02:38.920> starting<00:02:39.070> with<00:02:39.370> my<00:02:39.790> one<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.240> a

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
so I'm first starting with my one and a

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.330 
so I'm first starting with my one and a
half<00:02:40.360> pounds<00:02:40.570> of<00:02:40.960> cream<00:02:41.290> cheese<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:41.890> it's

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
half pounds of cream cheese and it's

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.500 
half pounds of cream cheese and it's
really<00:02:42.670> important<00:02:43.150> it's<00:02:43.270> room<00:02:43.480> temperature

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
really important it's room temperature

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.780 
really important it's room temperature
it<00:02:44.110> makes<00:02:44.320> a<00:02:44.470> huge<00:02:44.770> difference<00:02:44.830> in<00:02:45.430> terms<00:02:45.460> of

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
it makes a huge difference in terms of

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.160 
it makes a huge difference in terms of
the<00:02:45.850> texture<00:02:46.180> then<00:02:46.690> I'm<00:02:46.750> going<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:46.930> add<00:02:47.020> the

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
the texture then I'm going to add the

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.010 
the texture then I'm going to add the
sugar<00:02:48.090> then<00:02:49.090> I'm<00:02:49.150> gonna<00:02:49.240> start<00:02:49.420> adding<00:02:49.780> one

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
sugar then I'm gonna start adding one

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.870 
sugar then I'm gonna start adding one
egg<00:02:50.230> at<00:02:50.350> a<00:02:50.410> time<00:02:50.520> so<00:02:51.520> this<00:02:51.940> is<00:02:52.000> egg<00:02:52.450> one<00:02:53.880> I'm

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
egg at a time so this is egg one I'm

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.000 
egg at a time so this is egg one I'm
gonna<00:02:55.030> add<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.270> next<00:02:55.510> egg<00:02:55.780> you<00:02:56.710> want<00:02:56.860> to<00:02:56.920> do

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
gonna add the next egg you want to do

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.380 
gonna add the next egg you want to do
one<00:02:57.160> at<00:02:57.250> a<00:02:57.310> time<00:02:57.460> because<00:02:57.670> otherwise<00:02:57.910> you<00:02:58.270> kind

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
one at a time because otherwise you kind

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.090 
one at a time because otherwise you kind
of<00:02:58.510> end<00:02:58.660> up<00:02:58.840> overworking<00:02:59.410> it<00:02:59.680> a<00:02:59.740> little<00:02:59.890> bit

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
of end up overworking it a little bit

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.070 
of end up overworking it a little bit
because<00:03:00.520> this<00:03:00.700> is<00:03:00.910> dairy<00:03:01.360> you<00:03:01.660> don't<00:03:01.840> want<00:03:02.020> it

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
because this is dairy you don't want it

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.430 
because this is dairy you don't want it
