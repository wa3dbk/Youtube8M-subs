00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
that's a good question let's see one of

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.690 
that's a good question let's see one of
the<00:02:13.140> first<00:02:13.170> things<00:02:13.650> if<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:13.950> look<00:02:14.070> at<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.400> a

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
the first things if you look at the a

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:22.970 
the first things if you look at the a
melody<00:02:15.090> how<00:02:15.209> we<00:02:15.270> start<00:02:15.630> out<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:22.440> this<00:02:22.590> is<00:02:22.650> true

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
melody how we start out and this is true

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.240 
melody how we start out and this is true
of<00:02:23.100> any<00:02:23.360> almost<00:02:24.360> any<00:02:24.540> old-time<00:02:25.020> tune<00:02:25.320> you

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
of any almost any old-time tune you

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.010 
of any almost any old-time tune you
don't<00:02:26.459> necessarily<00:02:27.030> have<00:02:27.209> to<00:02:27.240> attack<00:02:27.990> that

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
don't necessarily have to attack that

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.640 
don't necessarily have to attack that
first<00:02:28.470> note<00:02:28.709> right<00:02:28.950> there<00:02:28.980> on<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.430> first<00:02:29.580> beat

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.260 

there's<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.740> lot<00:02:34.920> of<00:02:35.070> fun<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.459> can<00:02:35.640> have<00:02:35.670> with

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
there's a lot of fun you can have with

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.180 
there's a lot of fun you can have with
say<00:02:36.630> brushes<00:02:37.050> even<00:02:39.440> just<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.530> plain<00:02:40.739> old<00:02:40.770> hammer

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
say brushes even just a plain old hammer

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:52.610 
say brushes even just a plain old hammer
on<00:02:45.290> you<00:02:46.290> don't<00:02:46.440> have<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.770> go<00:02:51.200> so<00:02:52.200> that's<00:02:52.380> one

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
on you don't have to go so that's one

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.640 
on you don't have to go so that's one
thing<00:02:53.030> same<00:02:54.030> thing<00:02:54.209> holds<00:02:54.480> true<00:02:54.540> for<00:02:54.750> that

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
thing same thing holds true for that

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.940 
thing same thing holds true for that
second<00:02:56.130> chunk<00:02:56.760> of<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.090> melody<00:03:00.470> so<00:03:01.470> if<00:03:01.860> you

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
second chunk of the a melody so if you

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.520 
second chunk of the a melody so if you
play<00:03:02.100> it<00:03:02.160> in<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.489> standard<00:03:02.940> obedient<00:03:03.930> bum<00:03:04.320> ditty

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
play it in a standard obedient bum ditty

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.729 
play it in a standard obedient bum ditty
it's<00:03:08.030> or<00:03:09.030> we<00:03:09.989> could<00:03:10.140> apply<00:03:10.290> that<00:03:10.500> same

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
it's or we could apply that same

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.910 
it's or we could apply that same
principle<00:03:11.100> we<00:03:11.430> just<00:03:11.610> talked<00:03:11.790> about<00:03:11.880> and<00:03:12.920> go

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
principle we just talked about and go

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.090 
principle we just talked about and go
into<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.310> note<00:03:14.459> e<00:03:14.489> though<00:03:15.890> that's<00:03:16.890> not<00:03:17.040> the

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
into the note e though that's not the

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.250 
into the note e though that's not the
right<00:03:17.280> no<00:03:17.489> so<00:03:17.760> let's<00:03:17.910> slide<00:03:18.150> into<00:03:18.450> it<00:03:20.780> so<00:03:21.780> so

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
right no so let's slide into it so so

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:29.520 
right no so let's slide into it so so
far<00:03:22.440> we<00:03:22.650> have

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:37.600 

instead<00:03:30.530> of

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.000 

so<00:03:38.610> those<00:03:38.760> are<00:03:38.880> minor<00:03:39.030> differences<00:03:39.830> one<00:03:40.830> thing

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
so those are minor differences one thing

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.830 
so those are minor differences one thing
that<00:03:41.160> you<00:03:41.220> may<00:03:41.340> notice<00:03:41.520> that<00:03:41.670> I'm<00:03:41.849> doing<00:03:41.880> just

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
that you may notice that I'm doing just

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.180 
that you may notice that I'm doing just
naturally<00:03:43.319> is<00:03:43.380> I<00:03:43.590> don't<00:03:43.650> hit<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.010> fifth

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
naturally is I don't hit the fifth

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.339 
naturally is I don't hit the fifth
string<00:03:44.489> as<00:03:44.790> often<00:03:45.270> as<00:03:45.540> a<00:03:45.599> lot<00:03:45.870> of<00:03:45.900> people<00:03:46.200> do

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
string as often as a lot of people do

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.870 
string as often as a lot of people do
it's<00:03:49.349> up<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.590> you<00:03:49.739> I<00:03:49.980> just<00:03:50.130> don't<00:03:50.550> like<00:03:50.640> to<00:03:50.760> hit

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
it's up to you I just don't like to hit

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.120 
it's up to you I just don't like to hit
the<00:03:50.970> fifth<00:03:51.180> string<00:03:51.390> every<00:03:52.020> chance<00:03:52.770> I<00:03:52.920> get

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
the fifth string every chance I get

00:03:53.130 --> 00:04:01.220 
the fifth string every chance I get
I<00:03:53.280> like<00:03:53.520> to<00:03:53.640> leave<00:03:53.819> some<00:03:53.850> space<00:03:54.300> in<00:03:54.780> a<00:03:54.900> tune<00:04:00.230> and

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
I like to leave some space in a tune and

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.759 
I like to leave some space in a tune and
here<00:04:02.030> we<00:04:03.030> could<00:04:03.390> swing<00:04:03.959> it<00:04:03.989> a<00:04:04.140> little<00:04:04.170> bit<00:04:04.500> like

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
here we could swing it a little bit like

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:10.940 
here we could swing it a little bit like
this<00:04:07.819> and<00:04:08.819> what<00:04:09.150> was<00:04:09.269> that<00:04:09.620> that<00:04:10.620> was<00:04:10.769> me

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
this and what was that that was me

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.780 
this and what was that that was me
sliding<00:04:11.370> up<00:04:11.489> and<00:04:13.069> then<00:04:14.069> instead<00:04:14.610> of<00:04:14.670> just

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
sliding up and then instead of just

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:21.890 
sliding up and then instead of just
going<00:04:15.180> boom<00:04:16.019> Diddy<00:04:16.440> boom<00:04:16.799> baby<00:04:17.250> I'm<00:04:17.609> going<00:04:20.900> and

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
going boom Diddy boom baby I'm going and

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.600 
going boom Diddy boom baby I'm going and
I<00:04:22.019> have<00:04:22.109> no<00:04:22.290> idea<00:04:22.560> how<00:04:22.710> to<00:04:22.770> break<00:04:23.010> that<00:04:23.130> down<00:04:23.340> so

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
I have no idea how to break that down so

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:30.760 
I have no idea how to break that down so
I'll<00:04:23.700> just<00:04:23.820> play<00:04:24.240> it<00:04:24.389> slowly<00:04:28.040> there<00:04:29.040> is<00:04:29.280> a

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
I'll just play it slowly there is a

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.159 
I'll just play it slowly there is a
minute<00:04:31.770> pull<00:04:31.889> off<00:04:32.070> oh<00:04:32.360> and<00:04:33.360> a<00:04:33.419> hammer<00:04:33.630> on<00:04:33.750> and

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
minute pull off oh and a hammer on and

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:35.600 
minute pull off oh and a hammer on and
I'm<00:04:34.260> hitting<00:04:34.680> it<00:04:34.740> at<00:04:34.860> the<00:04:34.919> same<00:04:35.070> time<00:04:35.130> I<00:04:35.340> hammer

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
I'm hitting it at the same time I hammer

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.690 
I'm hitting it at the same time I hammer
it<00:04:35.760> down<00:04:35.820> I'm<00:04:36.060> not<00:04:36.180> sure<00:04:36.389> why<00:04:37.190> probably<00:04:38.190> not

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
it down I'm not sure why probably not

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:44.719 
it down I'm not sure why probably not
necessary<00:04:42.620> so<00:04:43.620> the<00:04:43.740> whole<00:04:43.890> thing<00:04:44.070> so<00:04:44.220> far<00:04:44.430> the

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
necessary so the whole thing so far the

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:50.300 
necessary so the whole thing so far the
whole<00:04:44.850> a<00:04:44.970> part

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.730 

and<00:04:51.480> I<00:04:52.480> just<00:04:52.720> noticed<00:04:53.020> I<00:04:53.110> did<00:04:53.260> one<00:04:53.410> thing<00:04:53.590> that

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
and I just noticed I did one thing that

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.380 
and I just noticed I did one thing that
I<00:04:53.770> didn't<00:04:54.100> mention<00:04:54.220> and<00:04:54.670> that<00:04:54.700> is<00:04:54.850> leave<00:04:55.180> some

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
I didn't mention and that is leave some

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.310 
I didn't mention and that is leave some
more<00:04:55.540> space<00:04:55.950> so<00:04:56.950> we<00:04:57.280> were<00:04:57.400> talking<00:04:57.550> about

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
more space so we were talking about

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:10.350 
more space so we were talking about
brush<00:05:05.100> after<00:05:06.100> that<00:05:06.220> brush<00:05:06.520> you<00:05:09.210> can<00:05:10.210> just

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
brush after that brush you can just

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.900 
brush after that brush you can just
leave<00:05:10.540> that<00:05:10.750> let<00:05:11.320> them<00:05:11.470> think<00:05:11.650> about<00:05:11.830> it<00:05:14.910> so

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
leave that let them think about it so

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:23.820 
leave that let them think about it so
when<00:05:16.030> you<00:05:16.120> put<00:05:16.270> those<00:05:16.390> two<00:05:16.570> together<00:05:22.830> there's

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
when you put those two together there's

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.440 
when you put those two together there's
a<00:05:23.890> little<00:05:24.100> bit<00:05:24.190> of<00:05:24.220> space<00:05:24.490> there<00:05:24.790> and<00:05:24.820> space<00:05:25.210> is

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
a little bit of space there and space is

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.920 
a little bit of space there and space is
good<00:05:26.910> that's<00:05:27.910> a<00:05:28.060> frog<00:05:28.300> if<00:05:28.540> you<00:05:28.630> heard<00:05:28.810> a

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
good that's a frog if you heard a

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:38.730 
good that's a frog if you heard a
strange<00:05:29.230> noise

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.410 

so<00:05:39.740> we<00:05:39.860> can<00:05:40.010> have<00:05:40.160> that<00:05:40.250> same<00:05:40.310> idea<00:05:40.790> with<00:05:41.000> the

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:41.420 
so we can have that same idea with the

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.150 
so we can have that same idea with the
brush<00:05:41.630> going<00:05:42.050> into<00:05:42.530> the<00:05:42.620> note<00:05:42.770> instead<00:05:43.040> of

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
brush going into the note instead of

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.580 
brush going into the note instead of
just<00:05:43.250> sitting<00:05:43.460> hitting<00:05:44.180> it<00:05:44.240> right<00:05:44.420> on<00:05:44.600> when<00:05:45.380> we

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
just sitting hitting it right on when we

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.710 
just sitting hitting it right on when we
get<00:05:46.130> halfway<00:05:46.370> through<00:05:46.520> that<00:05:46.730> a<00:05:46.820> melody<00:05:47.360> so

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
get halfway through that a melody so

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:58.210 
get halfway through that a melody so
here's<00:05:48.020> what<00:05:48.140> we've<00:05:48.260> got<00:05:48.380> so<00:05:48.590> far

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.680 

I<00:05:59.590> like<00:06:00.590> to<00:06:00.740> throw<00:06:00.980> in<00:06:01.190> brushes<00:06:01.910> because

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
I like to throw in brushes because

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.030 
I like to throw in brushes because
they're<00:06:03.110> a<00:06:03.730> dynamic<00:06:04.730> change<00:06:05.090> from<00:06:05.930> just<00:06:06.890> the

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.040 
they're a dynamic change from just the

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.300 
they're a dynamic change from just the
fin<00:06:08.500> there's<00:06:09.500> a<00:06:09.620> lot<00:06:09.770> of<00:06:09.920> there's<00:06:10.160> more

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
fin there's a lot of there's more

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.130 
fin there's a lot of there's more
variety<00:06:10.460> there's<00:06:10.970> more<00:06:11.150> texture<00:06:11.540> when<00:06:11.900> you<00:06:11.990> do

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:12.140 
variety there's more texture when you do

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.620 
variety there's more texture when you do
that<00:06:12.320> I<00:06:12.530> think<00:06:13.160> that<00:06:13.490> also<00:06:13.730> I<00:06:13.910> am<00:06:14.210> adding

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 
that I think that also I am adding

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.780 
that I think that also I am adding
something<00:06:15.230> I<00:06:15.290> didn't<00:06:15.530> point<00:06:15.710> out<00:06:15.890> but<00:06:16.580> let's

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:16.790 
something I didn't point out but let's

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.120 
something I didn't point out but let's
just<00:06:16.990> go<00:06:17.990> through<00:06:18.170> that<00:06:18.260> a<00:06:18.320> melody<00:06:18.770> a<00:06:18.800> couple

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130 
just go through that a melody a couple

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:30.180 
just go through that a melody a couple
of<00:06:19.220> times<00:06:19.460> and<00:06:19.790> then<00:06:20.450> we'll<00:06:20.660> go<00:06:20.810> on<00:06:20.960> to<00:06:21.230> the<00:06:21.260> B

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.190 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:41.290 

Oh

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.950 

one<00:06:42.300> thing<00:06:42.480> I'm<00:06:42.600> doing<00:06:43.160> it's<00:06:44.160> a<00:06:44.250> lot<00:06:44.400> of<00:06:44.570> what<00:06:45.570> I

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 
one thing I'm doing it's a lot of what I

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.740 
one thing I'm doing it's a lot of what I
think<00:06:46.470> ken<00:06:46.800> Pearlman<00:06:47.250> called<00:06:47.610> em<00:06:47.880> skipping<00:06:48.600> in

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:48.750 
think ken Pearlman called em skipping in

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:54.320 
think ken Pearlman called em skipping in
one<00:06:49.110> of<00:06:49.230> his<00:06:49.350> books<00:06:49.590> instead<00:06:50.520> of<00:06:50.670> going<00:06:53.330> I'm

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:54.330 
one of his books instead of going I'm

00:06:54.330 --> 00:07:02.300 
one of his books instead of going I'm
skipping<00:06:55.050> some<00:06:55.200> of<00:06:55.470> the<00:06:55.680> bits<00:07:00.980> it's<00:07:01.980> the<00:07:02.070> same

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:02.310 
skipping some of the bits it's the same

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:03.740 
skipping some of the bits it's the same
rhythmic<00:07:02.730> patterning<00:07:03.210> that<00:07:03.330> I<00:07:03.390> was<00:07:03.540> doing

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:03.750 
rhythmic patterning that I was doing

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:15.940 
rhythmic patterning that I was doing
here<00:07:03.930> with<00:07:04.020> the<00:07:04.170> pull<00:07:04.440> off<00:07:04.560> and<00:07:04.740> hammer<00:07:04.920> on

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:15.950 

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:23.280 

sunset<00:07:16.950> of<00:07:16.980> Oh

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:23.290 

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:41.590 

so<00:07:24.290> that<00:07:24.440> was<00:07:24.650> instead<00:07:25.280> of

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:41.600 

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.500 

and<00:07:42.600> I'm<00:07:42.930> going<00:07:43.110> to<00:07:43.140> stop<00:07:43.380> this<00:07:43.560> for<00:07:43.800> now<00:07:43.920> and

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:44.510 
and I'm going to stop this for now and

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.000 
and I'm going to stop this for now and
we'll<00:07:45.510> do<00:07:45.630> the<00:07:45.810> B<00:07:46.080> melody<00:07:46.440> in<00:07:46.650> another

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.010 
we'll do the B melody in another

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:49.640 
we'll do the B melody in another
recording
