00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
bit different right there right there

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.640 
bit different right there right there
where<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.080> camera<00:01:19.320> underneath<00:01:21.500> there's<00:01:22.500> the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
where the camera underneath there's the

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.609 
where the camera underneath there's the
first<00:01:22.830> point<00:01:23.210> and<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.659> second<00:01:24.960> point<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.290> over

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
first point and the second point is over

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.179

welds you might be thinking that's a
spotty<00:03:23.989> well<00:03:24.230> job<00:03:24.470> because<00:03:24.680> it's<00:03:24.799> only<00:03:24.889> welded

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
spotty well job because it's only welded

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.830 
spotty well job because it's only welded
here<00:03:25.400> than<00:03:25.579> here<00:03:25.880> but<00:03:26.329> if<00:03:26.419> we<00:03:26.510> look<00:03:26.660> on<00:03:26.750> the

opposite side whoever it's not Walden

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.390 
opposite side whoever it's not Walden
it's<00:03:29.510> on<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.780> obverse<00:03:30.349> side<00:03:30.410> it's<00:03:31.160> welded
