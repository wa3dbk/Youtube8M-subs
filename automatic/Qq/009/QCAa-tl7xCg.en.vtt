00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
get in there there we go

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.120 
get in there there we go
helps<00:01:15.930> when<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.110> splits<00:01:16.530> right<00:01:16.710> up<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.009> middle

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
helps when it splits right up the middle

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.300 
helps when it splits right up the middle
like<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.930> so<00:01:18.930> inside<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:19.560> see<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.100> little

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
like that so inside we see this little

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.359 
like that so inside we see this little
pollen<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.710> take<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.890> off

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.120 

suppose<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.460> could<00:01:26.610> be<00:01:26.670> using<00:01:26.850> like<00:01:27.710> more<00:01:28.710> tools

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
suppose I could be using like more tools

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.640 
suppose I could be using like more tools
for<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:29.579> but<00:01:30.350> I'm<00:01:31.350> impatient<00:01:33.229> so<00:01:34.229> there's

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
for this but I'm impatient so there's

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.109 
for this but I'm impatient so there's
the<00:01:34.829> pollen<00:01:36.409> and<00:01:37.460> I'm<00:01:38.460> gonna<00:01:38.610> stick<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.090> right

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
the pollen and I'm gonna stick it right

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.130 
the pollen and I'm gonna stick it right
on<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.509> end<00:01:41.180> where<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.329> came<00:01:42.509> off<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:42.990> this

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
on the end where it came off so this

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.719 
on the end where it came off so this
would<00:01:43.290> be<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.439> self<00:01:43.950> cross<00:01:46.610> it'll<00:01:47.610> be

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
would be a self cross it'll be

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.060 
would be a self cross it'll be
interesting<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.240> see<00:01:48.479> what<00:01:48.630> happens<00:01:49.070> if

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
interesting to see what happens if

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.870 
interesting to see what happens if
anything<00:01:52.250> get<00:01:53.250> on<00:01:53.399> there

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
anything get on there

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.630 
anything get on there
this<00:01:54.479> might<00:01:54.689> be<00:01:54.720> too<00:01:55.110> old<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:56.130> might<00:01:56.340> not<00:01:56.490> be

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
this might be too old it might not be

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.700 
this might be too old it might not be
working<00:01:57.500> but<00:01:59.840> it's<00:02:00.840> at<00:02:01.049> least<00:02:01.079> showing<00:02:01.590> you

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
working but it's at least showing you

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.209 
working but it's at least showing you
how<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.009> do<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:03.710> don't<00:02:04.710> know<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:04.979> I'll

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
how to do it I don't know that I'll

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.290 
how to do it I don't know that I'll
actually<00:02:05.460> get<00:02:05.909> anything<00:02:06.180> from<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:08.090> get<00:02:09.090> off<00:02:09.270> of

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
actually get anything from it get off of

focus sorry this is the first time I've
used<00:02:24.500> my<00:02:24.860> phone<00:02:24.890> to<00:02:25.280> make<00:02:25.370> a<00:02:25.430> video<00:02:26.650> it's<00:02:27.650> not

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
used my phone to make a video it's not

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.880 
used my phone to make a video it's not
the<00:02:30.500> best<00:02:30.800> I<00:02:31.310> guess

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
the best I guess

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:39.250 
the best I guess
back<00:02:33.890> up<00:02:34.100> a<00:02:34.220> little<00:02:37.690> I'm<00:02:38.690> just<00:02:38.720> rubbing<00:02:39.110> that

back up a little I'm just rubbing that
pollen<00:02:39.740> rate<00:02:40.040> on<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.880> tip<00:02:41.120> and<00:02:42.400> hopefully

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
pollen rate on the tip and hopefully

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.680 
pollen rate on the tip and hopefully
it'll<00:02:43.610> swell<00:02:44.060> up<00:02:44.270> and<00:02:44.390> make<00:02:44.570> a<00:02:44.600> seed<00:02:44.900> pod<00:02:45.940> um<00:02:46.940> I

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
it'll swell up and make a seed pod um I

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.060 
it'll swell up and make a seed pod um I
already<00:02:48.320> did<00:02:48.620> it<00:02:48.650> earlier<00:02:49.130> on<00:02:50.890> what's<00:02:51.890> this
