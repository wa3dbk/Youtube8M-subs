00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
put this in the optical mods series but

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.469 
put this in the optical mods series but
that<00:02:04.770> because<00:02:05.130> i<00:02:05.190> haven't<00:02:05.340> done<00:02:05.520> one<00:02:05.580> in<00:02:05.910> a

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
that because i haven't done one in a

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.999 
that because i haven't done one in a
while<00:02:06.510> and<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.229> technically<00:02:07.620> odds<00:02:07.830> come

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
while and it is technically odds come

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.350 
while and it is technically odds come
watch<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.310> know<00:02:08.429> this<00:02:08.640> from<00:02:08.880> a<00:02:08.970> long<00:02:09.090> time<00:02:09.240> ago

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
watch you know this from a long time ago

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.930
