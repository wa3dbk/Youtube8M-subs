00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:03.470 

we<00:00:02.580> actually<00:00:02.820> started<00:00:03.030> off<00:00:03.120> pretty<00:00:03.330> well<00:00:03.389> I

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
we actually started off pretty well I

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.999 
we actually started off pretty well I
mean<00:00:03.570> we<00:00:03.689> got<00:00:03.810> a<00:00:03.840> basket<00:00:04.500> right<00:00:04.529> away

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
mean we got a basket right away

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.140 
mean we got a basket right away
and<00:00:05.190> then<00:00:05.640> all<00:00:05.730> of<00:00:05.759> a<00:00:05.819> sudden<00:00:05.879> you<00:00:06.120> know

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
and then all of a sudden you know

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.059 
and then all of a sudden you know
justice<00:00:06.779> weren't<00:00:06.960> falling<00:00:07.200> and<00:00:07.529> once<00:00:07.680> we

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
justice weren't falling and once we

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.379 
justice weren't falling and once we
realized<00:00:08.429> that<00:00:08.519> we<00:00:08.639> got<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.880> ball<00:00:09.030> inside<00:00:09.330> and

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
realized that we got the ball inside and

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.360 
realized that we got the ball inside and
then<00:00:10.260> once<00:00:10.440> we<00:00:10.559> saw<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.740> ball<00:00:10.920> go<00:00:11.160> through<00:00:11.190> the

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
then once we saw the ball go through the

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.950 
then once we saw the ball go through the
net<00:00:11.550> I<00:00:11.730> think<00:00:11.910> that's<00:00:12.030> when<00:00:12.240> they<00:00:12.719> started

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
net I think that's when they started

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.089 
net I think that's when they started
knocking<00:00:13.110> down<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.620> once<00:00:13.740> we<00:00:13.860> started

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
knocking down and once we started

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.189 
knocking down and once we started
getting<00:00:14.190> our<00:00:14.370> transition<00:00:14.820> going<00:00:15.020> that's<00:00:16.020> just

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
getting our transition going that's just

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.310 
getting our transition going that's just
when<00:00:16.320> we're<00:00:16.470> at<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.770> best<00:00:17.660> so<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:18.720> was<00:00:19.289> a

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
when we're at the best so I was a

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.490 
when we're at the best so I was a
struggle<00:00:19.770> but<00:00:19.949> we<00:00:20.330> fought<00:00:21.330> we<00:00:22.140> knew<00:00:22.260> we<00:00:22.380> had<00:00:22.470> to

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
struggle but we fought we knew we had to

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.320 
struggle but we fought we knew we had to
lock<00:00:22.769> down<00:00:22.980> they<00:00:23.310> were<00:00:23.369> making<00:00:23.970> some<00:00:24.150> pretty

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
lock down they were making some pretty

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.790 
lock down they were making some pretty
tough<00:00:24.630> shots<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.170> know<00:00:25.260> coming<00:00:25.590> off<00:00:25.680> the

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
tough shots you know coming off the

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.890 
tough shots you know coming off the
screen<00:00:25.920> is<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.400> even<00:00:26.939> banked<00:00:27.300> one<00:00:27.449> in<00:00:27.660> like

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
screen is it even banked one in like

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.630 
screen is it even banked one in like
they<00:00:28.470> were<00:00:28.529> just<00:00:28.710> knocking<00:00:29.039> down<00:00:29.160> everything

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
they were just knocking down everything

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.460 
they were just knocking down everything
so<00:00:29.880> we<00:00:30.060> know<00:00:30.179> we<00:00:30.330> had<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.539> step<00:00:30.750> up<00:00:30.869> on<00:00:31.080> defense

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
so we know we had to step up on defense

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.049 
so we know we had to step up on defense
and<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.920> think<00:00:32.309> we<00:00:32.369> did<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.489> good<00:00:32.640> job<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.940> doing

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
and I think we did a good job of doing

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.590 
and I think we did a good job of doing
that<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.510> mean<00:00:33.719> it's<00:00:33.930> hard<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.200> make<00:00:34.380> shots<00:00:35.600> at

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
that I mean it's hard to make shots at

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.880 
that I mean it's hard to make shots at
the<00:00:36.809> Final<00:00:37.110> Four<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:38.750> I<00:00:39.750> thought<00:00:40.020> once<00:00:40.739> we

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
the Final Four and I thought once we

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.790 
the Final Four and I thought once we
settled<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:42.469> got<00:00:43.469> our<00:00:44.180> kind<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.239> rhythm<00:00:45.510> I

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
settled in and got our kind of rhythm I

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.740 
settled in and got our kind of rhythm I
thought<00:00:46.800> we<00:00:46.950> played<00:00:47.210> one<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.360> best<00:00:48.539> games

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
thought we played one of the best games

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.779 
thought we played one of the best games
that<00:00:48.930> we<00:00:49.050> played<00:00:49.260> all<00:00:49.440> year<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.980> think<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.640> key

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
that we played all year I think the key

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.639 
that we played all year I think the key
person<00:00:51.210> there<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.420> Kia<00:00:51.780> Stokes<00:00:52.079> coming<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.500> and

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
person there is Kia Stokes coming in and

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.799 
person there is Kia Stokes coming in and
playing<00:00:52.739> great<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.370> know<00:00:53.520> if<00:00:53.820> she's<00:00:54.120> coming

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
playing great you know if she's coming

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.569 
playing great you know if she's coming
in<00:00:55.079> aggressive<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.770> she's<00:00:55.920> looking<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.250> score

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
in aggressive and she's looking to score

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.590 
in aggressive and she's looking to score
and<00:00:56.699> she's<00:00:56.850> looking<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.210> play<00:00:57.360> great<00:00:57.539> defense

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
and she's looking to play great defense

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.869 
and she's looking to play great defense
for<00:00:58.109> us<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.649> makes<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.190> lot<00:00:59.370> harder<00:00:59.430> for

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
for us it makes it a lot harder for

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.099 
for us it makes it a lot harder for
people<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.180> guard<00:01:00.420> us<00:01:00.480> when<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:00.719> have<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:00.960> big

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
people to guard us when we have that big

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.510 
people to guard us when we have that big
lineup<00:01:01.320> we<00:01:01.739> knew<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.219> would<00:01:02.340> be

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
lineup we knew that that would be

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.340 
lineup we knew that that would be
challenging<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.300> we<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.840> know<00:01:03.930> seen<00:01:04.140> other

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
challenging and we you know seen other

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.460 
challenging and we you know seen other
teams<00:01:04.619> but<00:01:05.090> you<00:01:06.090> know<00:01:06.180> just<00:01:06.479> like<00:01:06.630> just<00:01:07.290> some

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
teams but you know just like just some

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.039 
teams but you know just like just some
of<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.790> unforced<00:01:08.790> errors<00:01:09.240> they<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.930> then

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
of the unforced errors they and then

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.830 
of the unforced errors they and then
also<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:10.979> think<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.310> defense<00:01:11.729> just<00:01:12.479> total

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
also I think on defense just total

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.600 
also I think on defense just total
breakdowns<00:01:13.320> where<00:01:13.530> we<00:01:13.619> gave<00:01:13.770> up<00:01:13.799> layups<00:01:14.369> and

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
breakdowns where we gave up layups and

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.950 
breakdowns where we gave up layups and
then<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.820> turnovers<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.479> like<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.720> Moriah

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
then the turnovers to like to Moriah

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.990 
then the turnovers to like to Moriah
Jefferson<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.770> think<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.250> makes<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.700> harder<00:01:17.970> for

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
Jefferson I think it makes it harder for

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.340 
Jefferson I think it makes it harder for
other<00:01:18.240> teams<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.450> score<00:01:18.509> inside<00:01:18.930> obviously

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
other teams to score inside obviously

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.230 
other teams to score inside obviously
when<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.770> have<00:01:19.890> three<00:01:20.490> girls<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.850> over<00:01:21.030> six

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
when you have three girls that over six

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.179 
when you have three girls that over six
feet<00:01:21.360> tall<00:01:21.600> or<00:01:21.780> six<00:01:22.259> three<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.619> over<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:23.100> know

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
feet tall or six three and over you know

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.740 
feet tall or six three and over you know
makes<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.520> really<00:01:24.090> o'clock<00:01:24.330> at<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.509> Blaine

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
makes it really o'clock at the Blaine

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.780 
makes it really o'clock at the Blaine
which<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.110> know<00:01:25.200> she<00:01:25.409> does<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.830> great<00:01:26.040> job<00:01:26.100> no

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
which I know she does a great job no

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.310 
which I know she does a great job no
post<00:01:27.000> enough<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.390> she<00:01:27.420> can't<00:01:27.900> get<00:01:27.990> going<00:01:28.140> I

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
post enough so she can't get going I

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.899 
post enough so she can't get going I
think<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.650> helps<00:01:28.890> us<00:01:29.040> we<00:01:29.400> have<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:29.790> many

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
think that helps us we have so many

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.780 
think that helps us we have so many
offensive<00:01:30.750> threats<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.979> know<00:01:32.100> one

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
offensive threats that you know one

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.219 
offensive threats that you know one
person<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.240> bound<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.600> start<00:01:33.810> making<00:01:33.960> some

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
person is bound to start making some

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.660 
person is bound to start making some
shots<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.740> think<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.400> was<00:01:35.520> definitely

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
shots I think that was definitely

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.609 
shots I think that was definitely
confidence<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.900> helped<00:01:37.140> going<00:01:37.350> into<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
confidence that helped going into the

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.289 
confidence that helped going into the
game<00:01:37.799> but<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.520> know<00:01:38.549> if<00:01:38.729> shots<00:01:38.970> aren't<00:01:39.180> gonna

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
game but you know if shots aren't gonna

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.460 
game but you know if shots aren't gonna
fall<00:01:39.570> I'm<00:01:39.659> gonna<00:01:39.780> just<00:01:39.960> try<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.170> be<00:01:40.350> aggressive

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
fall I'm gonna just try to be aggressive

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.590 
fall I'm gonna just try to be aggressive
and<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.220> think<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.520> did<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.729> really<00:01:41.820> good<00:01:42.479> job

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
and I think I did a really good job

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.510 
and I think I did a really good job
getting<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.140> free-throw<00:01:43.320> line<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.860> then

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
getting to the free-throw line and then

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.010 
getting to the free-throw line and then
eventually<00:01:44.820> things<00:01:45.210> started<00:01:45.540> going<00:01:45.659> my<00:01:45.899> way

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
eventually things started going my way

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.270 
eventually things started going my way
offensively<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.829> know<00:01:47.070> they're<00:01:47.250> very

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
offensively you know they're very

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.810 
offensively you know they're very
talented<00:01:47.610> players<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:49.130> you<00:01:50.130> know<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.250> think<00:01:50.460> I

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
talented players and you know I think I

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.429 
talented players and you know I think I
think<00:01:51.000> different<00:01:51.810> people<00:01:52.110> on<00:01:52.259> our<00:01:52.380> team

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
think different people on our team

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.069 
think different people on our team
worked<00:01:53.100> hard<00:01:53.220> defensively<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.149> them<00:01:54.600> maybe

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
worked hard defensively on them maybe

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.219 
worked hard defensively on them maybe
the<00:01:55.290> first<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:56.189> know<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.310> first<00:01:56.460> half<00:01:57.229> olena

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
the first you know the first half olena

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.380 
the first you know the first half olena
struggled<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.890> little<00:01:58.979> bit<00:01:59.130> but<00:01:59.490> she

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
struggled a little bit but she

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.499 
struggled a little bit but she
definitely<00:02:00.659> got<00:02:01.020> her<00:02:01.200> rhythm<00:02:01.500> going<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.509> you

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
definitely got her rhythm going and you

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.690 
definitely got her rhythm going and you
know<00:02:03.540> maybe<00:02:03.960> just<00:02:04.079> took<00:02:04.409> Stokes<00:02:05.159> coming<00:02:05.520> in

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
know maybe just took Stokes coming in

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.280 
know maybe just took Stokes coming in
and<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.360> know<00:02:06.420> helping<00:02:06.689> them<00:02:06.780> relax<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.229> little

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
and you know helping them relax a little

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.830 
and you know helping them relax a little
bit<00:02:07.530> but<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:08.670> think<00:02:09.000> they're<00:02:09.149> their<00:02:09.330> big<00:02:09.509> lineup

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
bit but I think they're their big lineup

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.220 
bit but I think they're their big lineup
was<00:02:10.110> disruptive<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.890> mean

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
was disruptive I mean

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.229 
was disruptive I mean
and<00:02:11.680> Stewie<00:02:12.129> when<00:02:12.400> we<00:02:12.489> post<00:02:12.700> up<00:02:12.849> I<00:02:12.970> think<00:02:13.030> it

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
and Stewie when we post up I think it

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:14.820 
and Stewie when we post up I think it
just<00:02:13.390> gives<00:02:13.480> another<00:02:13.569> look<00:02:13.930> I<00:02:14.260> think<00:02:14.409> the<00:02:14.620> post

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
just gives another look I think the post

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.280 
just gives another look I think the post
players<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.569> coaches<00:02:16.780> did<00:02:17.049> a<00:02:17.110> good<00:02:17.230> job

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
players and the coaches did a good job

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.930 
players and the coaches did a good job
getting<00:02:17.470> me<00:02:17.799> in<00:02:17.890> positions<00:02:18.370> where<00:02:18.610> I<00:02:18.640> could

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
getting me in positions where I could

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.460 
getting me in positions where I could
score<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.390> when<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.569> got<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.959> ball<00:02:20.140> you<00:02:20.170> know

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
score and when I got the ball you know

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.470 
score and when I got the ball you know
Stephanie<00:02:20.980> Kia<00:02:21.250> Stewie<00:02:21.670> they<00:02:21.940> all<00:02:22.090> came<00:02:22.330> to

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
Stephanie Kia Stewie they all came to

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.630 
Stephanie Kia Stewie they all came to
screen<00:02:22.720> for<00:02:22.959> me<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:23.260> I<00:02:23.470> just<00:02:24.129> tried<00:02:24.430> to<00:02:24.459> attack

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
screen for me and I just tried to attack

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.580 
screen for me and I just tried to attack
them<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:25.360> you<00:02:25.959> know<00:02:26.080> thankfully<00:02:26.440> they

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
them and you know thankfully they

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.080 
them and you know thankfully they
weren't<00:02:26.739> hitting<00:02:27.010> shots<00:02:27.159> I'm<00:02:27.610> on<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.849> outside

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
weren't hitting shots I'm on the outside

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.640 
weren't hitting shots I'm on the outside
as<00:02:28.360> much<00:02:28.420> as<00:02:28.599> they<00:02:28.780> normally<00:02:29.080> do<00:02:29.410> so<00:02:29.530> I<00:02:29.590> think

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
as much as they normally do so I think

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.080 
as much as they normally do so I think
that<00:02:29.890> definitely<00:02:29.980> helps<00:02:30.340> is<00:02:30.459> because<00:02:30.879> if<00:02:31.000> they

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
that definitely helps is because if they

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.369 
that definitely helps is because if they
can't<00:02:31.239> establish<00:02:31.360> inside<00:02:31.840> game<00:02:32.019> is<00:02:32.140> hard<00:02:32.290> for

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
can't establish inside game is hard for

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:33.660 
can't establish inside game is hard for
them<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:32.590> establish<00:02:32.890> an<00:02:32.980> outside<00:02:33.220> game<00:02:33.400> but

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
them to establish an outside game but

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.070 
them to establish an outside game but
we're<00:02:33.790> really<00:02:33.910> excited<00:02:34.060> you<00:02:34.599> know<00:02:34.629> this<00:02:34.900> is
