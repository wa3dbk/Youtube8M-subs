went for 68 70 paste centre-backs

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.520 
went for 68 70 paste centre-backs
because<00:03:58.490> it's<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:59.360> pace<00:03:59.600> is<00:03:59.840> very<00:04:00.080> will<00:04:00.290> be<00:04:00.500> a

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
because it's the pace is very will be a

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.740 
because it's the pace is very will be a
very<00:04:00.800> important<00:04:01.490> I<00:04:01.640> think<00:04:01.700> in<00:04:02.090> FIFA<00:04:02.540> 12

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
very important I think in FIFA 12

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.310 
very important I think in FIFA 12
because<00:04:03.220> there<00:04:04.220> are<00:04:04.430> a<00:04:04.459> lot<00:04:05.330> of<00:04:05.360> players<00:04:05.900> with

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
because there are a lot of players with

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.650 
because there are a lot of players with
very<00:04:06.650> very<00:04:06.920> good<00:04:07.130> pace<00:04:07.430> and<00:04:07.760> the<00:04:07.940> lot<00:04:08.480> of

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
very very good pace and the lot of

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.440 
very very good pace and the lot of
players<00:04:08.900> with<00:04:09.290> very<00:04:09.620> bad<00:04:09.860> space<00:04:10.160> for<00:04:10.970> example

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
players with very bad space for example

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.380 
players with very bad space for example
I<00:04:11.540> have<00:04:11.570> already<00:04:11.959> seen<00:04:12.530> a<00:04:12.670> bronze<00:04:13.670> player<00:04:14.000> with

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
I have already seen a bronze player with

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.289 
I have already seen a bronze player with
the<00:04:14.420> pace<00:04:14.780> of<00:04:14.810> 96<00:04:15.770> and<00:04:16.010> I<00:04:16.549> have<00:04:16.670> already<00:04:16.850> seen

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
the pace of 96 and I have already seen

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.110 
the pace of 96 and I have already seen
gold<00:04:17.540> payers<00:04:18.049> with<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.560> pace<00:04:18.799> of<00:04:19.040> 27<00:04:19.970> or

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
gold payers with the pace of 27 or

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.900 
gold payers with the pace of 27 or
something<00:04:20.600> for<00:04:20.810> example<00:04:21.229> fun<00:04:21.830> boonton<00:04:22.340> who<00:04:22.790> is

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
something for example fun boonton who is

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.820 
something for example fun boonton who is
a<00:04:22.940> world-class<00:04:23.390> centre-back<00:04:24.169> in<00:04:24.350> my<00:04:24.500> opinion

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
a world-class centre-back in my opinion

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.620 
a world-class centre-back in my opinion
he<00:04:25.100> plays<00:04:25.340> for<00:04:25.640> Bayern<00:04:26.030> Munich<00:04:26.330> and

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
he plays for Bayern Munich and

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.440 
he plays for Bayern Munich and
something<00:04:27.230> like<00:04:27.670> 27<00:04:28.670> paste<00:04:28.970> which<00:04:29.270> is

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
something like 27 paste which is

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.980 
something like 27 paste which is
absolutely<00:04:29.870> ridiculous<00:04:30.320> in<00:04:30.980> my<00:04:31.010> opinion<00:04:31.460> but

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
absolutely ridiculous in my opinion but

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.440 
absolutely ridiculous in my opinion but
that's<00:04:32.990> the<00:04:33.230> ratings<00:04:33.680> of<00:04:33.860> fifa<00:04:34.220> 12<00:04:34.490> and<00:04:34.730> this

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
that's the ratings of fifa 12 and this

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.860 
that's the ratings of fifa 12 and this
is<00:04:35.630> the<00:04:35.780> first<00:04:35.810> rare<00:04:36.320> player<00:04:36.620> i<00:04:36.650> buy<00:04:37.600> he<00:04:38.600> plays

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
is the first rare player i buy he plays

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.770 
is the first rare player i buy he plays
for<00:04:39.110> pre-move<00:04:39.820> plymouth<00:04:40.820> sorry<00:04:41.300> and<00:04:41.540> he<00:04:41.660> has

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
for pre-move plymouth sorry and he has

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.130 
for pre-move plymouth sorry and he has
an<00:04:41.930> 81<00:04:42.380> base<00:04:43.040> and<00:04:43.340> he<00:04:43.490> is<00:04:43.520> a<00:04:43.640> rare<00:04:43.940> player<00:04:44.690> so<00:04:45.110> I

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
an 81 base and he is a rare player so I

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:50.890 
an 81 base and he is a rare player so I
decided<00:04:45.890> to<00:04:46.190> buy<00:04:46.370> him<00:04:46.670> and<00:04:46.880> I<00:04:47.570> buy<00:04:48.230> a<00:04:49.100> a<00:04:49.900> minimum

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
decided to buy him and I buy a a minimum

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.000 
decided to buy him and I buy a a minimum
of<00:04:51.050> 2<00:04:51.290> players<00:04:51.470> for<00:04:51.980> each<00:04:52.100> position<00:04:52.340> so<00:04:54.010> we

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
of 2 players for each position so we

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.850 
of 2 players for each position so we
will<00:04:55.190> almost<00:04:55.480> certainly<00:04:56.480> fill<00:04:57.020> up<00:04:57.200> the<00:04:57.530> squad

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
will almost certainly fill up the squad

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.190 
will almost certainly fill up the squad

two guys as you can imagine but in that
position<00:05:16.840> pace<00:05:17.840> is<00:05:17.870> not<00:05:18.230> the<00:05:18.350> most<00:05:18.560> important

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
position pace is not the most important

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.790

the<00:05:22.400> most<00:05:22.610> important<00:05:23.300> thing<00:05:23.540> and<00:05:23.720> the<00:05:23.840> next

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
the most important thing and the next

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.330 
the most important thing and the next
position<00:05:24.230> is<00:05:24.590> the<00:05:24.770> central<00:05:25.130> attacking

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
position is the central attacking

is<00:05:59.390> an<00:05:59.540> in-form<00:06:00.100> bronze<00:06:01.100> the<00:06:01.310> striker<00:06:01.670> who

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
is an in-form bronze the striker who

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.630 
is an in-form bronze the striker who
plays<00:06:02.270> for<00:06:02.510> morecambe<00:06:03.080> per<00:06:03.320> carton<00:06:03.920> but<00:06:04.580> he

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:04.640 
plays for morecambe per carton but he

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.880 
plays for morecambe per carton but he
was<00:06:05.060> something<00:06:05.750> like<00:06:05.900> fifteen<00:06:06.380> thousand

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:06.890 
was something like fifteen thousand

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.820 
was something like fifteen thousand
thousand<00:06:07.880> coins<00:06:08.150> and<00:06:08.540> his<00:06:08.840> rating<00:06:09.290> wasn't<00:06:09.710> a

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
thousand coins and his rating wasn't a

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.380 
thousand coins and his rating wasn't a
bad<00:06:10.040> good<00:06:10.750> die<00:06:11.750> by<00:06:12.020> a<00:06:12.050> Khufu<00:06:12.680> with<00:06:13.040> a<00:06:13.070> 61<00:06:13.970> rated

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:14.390 
bad good die by a Khufu with a 61 rated

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.620

rare bronze player he has a pace of 81 I

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:23.130 
rare bronze player he has a pace of 81 I
think<00:06:18.110> that<00:06:18.770> that<00:06:19.210> player<00:06:20.210> alone<00:06:20.930> cost<00:06:21.380> 100

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:23.140 
think that that player alone cost 100

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.230 
think that that player alone cost 100
1600<00:06:24.140> coins<00:06:24.410> and<00:06:24.680> he<00:06:24.830> was<00:06:25.040> the<00:06:25.310> most<00:06:25.850> expensive

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 
1600 coins and he was the most expensive

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.160 
1600 coins and he was the most expensive
player<00:06:27.200> in<00:06:27.560> the<00:06:27.830> whole<00:06:28.010> squad<00:06:28.460> but<00:06:28.730> I<00:06:29.210> really

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:30.170 
player in the whole squad but I really

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.380 
player in the whole squad but I really
wanted<00:06:30.500> to<00:06:30.560> get<00:06:30.800> a<00:06:30.860> very<00:06:31.250> good<00:06:31.400> striker<00:06:32.000> all

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:32.390 
wanted to get a very good striker all

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:37.240 
wanted to get a very good striker all
the<00:06:32.630> other<00:06:32.780> players<00:06:33.170> cost<00:06:34.300> 200<00:06:35.300> or<00:06:35.600> 250<00:06:36.350> or<00:06:36.650> 300

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.250 
the other players cost 200 or 250 or 300
