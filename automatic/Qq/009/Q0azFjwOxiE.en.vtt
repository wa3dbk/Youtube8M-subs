00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
you to put money on yeah I think I've

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.870

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
done quite well out this world cup so

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.550 
done quite well out this world cup so
far<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.330> might<00:01:15.450> be<00:01:15.600> shy<00:01:15.780> like<00:01:16.020> sticking<00:01:16.409> a

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
far so I might be shy like sticking a

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.859 
far so I might be shy like sticking a
few<00:01:16.740> quid<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.159> one<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.689> sometimes<00:01:18.689> when

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
few quid on this one and sometimes when

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.359 
few quid on this one and sometimes when
you've<00:01:18.990> got<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.170> clear<00:01:19.680> winner<00:01:19.920> which<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:20.220> think

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
you've got a clear winner which I think

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.280 
you've got a clear winner which I think
we<00:01:20.430> have<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:20.850> one<00:01:21.090> it's<00:01:21.600> worth<00:01:21.900> betting<00:01:22.170> a

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
we have in this one it's worth betting a

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.050 
we have in this one it's worth betting a
little<00:01:22.470> bit<00:01:22.560> heavy<00:01:22.740> on<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.250> especially

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
little bit heavy on it and especially

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.249 
little bit heavy on it and especially
you<00:01:24.330> can<00:01:24.420> find<00:01:24.659> one<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.810> those<00:01:24.930> odds<00:01:25.170> that

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
you can find one of those odds that

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.039 
you can find one of those odds that
gives<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> draw<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.600> get<00:01:27.600> your<00:01:27.720> money<00:01:27.869> back

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
gives you a draw and get your money back

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.230 
gives you a draw and get your money back
sorta<00:01:28.350> beds<00:01:28.560> are<00:01:29.130> definitely<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.880> best<00:01:30.030> on

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
sorta beds are definitely the best on

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.210 
sorta beds are definitely the best on
that<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.659> think<00:01:30.930> Colombia<00:01:31.350> I've<00:01:31.770> got<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.040> class

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
that I think Colombia I've got the class

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.490 
that I think Colombia I've got the class
and<00:01:32.460> they<00:01:32.640> will<00:01:32.759> come<00:01:32.970> out<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.210> top<00:01:33.390> ok<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:34.350> you

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
and they will come out on top ok so you

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.109 
and they will come out on top ok so you
or<00:01:34.619> you'd<00:01:34.770> maybe<00:01:34.979> maybe<00:01:35.460> advise<00:01:35.790> doing<00:01:35.970> the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
or you'd maybe maybe advise doing the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.420 
or you'd maybe maybe advise doing the
draw<00:01:36.299> no<00:01:36.450> bet<00:01:36.479> Columbia<00:01:37.140> just<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.100> case<00:01:38.280> that

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
draw no bet Columbia just in case that

they're<00:02:22.650> they're<00:02:22.980> not<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:23.550> keen<00:02:23.790> on<00:02:23.910> these

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
they're they're not so keen on these

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.280 
they're they're not so keen on these
double<00:02:24.360> beds<00:02:24.569> but<00:02:24.750> because<00:02:24.900> they<00:02:25.020> say<00:02:25.170> that

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
double beds but because they say that

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.410 
double beds but because they say that
you've<00:02:25.530> got<00:02:25.680> more<00:02:25.950> chance<00:02:26.220> of<00:02:26.430> losing<00:02:26.700> but<00:02:27.330> in

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
you've got more chance of losing but in

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.090 
you've got more chance of losing but in
this<00:02:27.630> case<00:02:27.959> you<00:02:28.319> know<00:02:28.410> sometimes<00:02:28.770> obviously

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
this case you know sometimes obviously

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.710 
this case you know sometimes obviously
they<00:02:29.160> do<00:02:29.220> go<00:02:29.459> for<00:02:29.640> these<00:02:29.700> double<00:02:30.270> chance<00:02:30.450> bets

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
they do go for these double chance bets

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.120 
they do go for these double chance bets
but<00:02:31.170> in<00:02:31.290> this<00:02:31.410> case<00:02:31.620> would<00:02:31.800> you<00:02:31.860> say<00:02:32.100> that

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
but in this case would you say that

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.070 
but in this case would you say that
that's<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.400> good<00:02:32.550> bet<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:32.700> take<00:02:32.940> yeah<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:33.900> think

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
that's a good bet to take yeah I think

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.110 
that's a good bet to take yeah I think
that<00:02:34.380> you<00:02:34.590> talk<00:02:34.980> absolute<00:02:35.520> sense<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.000> do

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
that you talk absolute sense and I do

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.670 
that you talk absolute sense and I do
think<00:02:36.330> it's<00:02:36.420> worth<00:02:36.570> her<00:02:36.780> it's<00:02:37.290> definitely

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
think it's worth her it's definitely

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.199 
think it's worth her it's definitely
worth<00:02:37.770> a<00:02:37.920> punt<00:02:38.070> you<00:02:38.580> got<00:02:38.730> remember<00:02:39.090> with

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
worth a punt you got remember with

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.970 
worth a punt you got remember with
gambling<00:02:39.630> sometimes<00:02:40.110> you've<00:02:40.260> got<00:02:40.350> to<00:02:40.380> am<00:02:40.620> best

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
gambling sometimes you've got to am best

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.010 
gambling sometimes you've got to am best
hard<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:41.820> win<00:02:42.000> hard<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:42.510> I<00:02:42.540> think<00:02:42.690> this<00:02:42.750> is<00:02:42.900> one

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
hard to win hard and I think this is one

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.809 
hard to win hard and I think this is one
of<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.170> occasions<00:02:43.620> we're<00:02:43.800> going<00:02:44.489> on<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.670> little

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
bit of a limb and will definitely pay

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.550 
bit of a limb and will definitely pay

predict here mike is the correct score

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.070

so do you have a critical for us I do

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.290 
so do you have a critical for us I do
I've<00:02:55.860> looked<00:02:56.100> in<00:02:56.220> my<00:02:56.430> crystal<00:02:56.459> ball<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.030> it

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
I've looked in my crystal ball and it

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.910 
I've looked in my crystal ball and it
does<00:02:57.480> columbia<00:02:58.110> going<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.320> win<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.709> going<00:02:58.860> to

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
does columbia going to win and going to

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.370 
does columbia going to win and going to
be<00:02:58.980> 21<00:02:59.220> and<00:02:59.670> that's<00:03:00.390> at<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.510> very<00:03:00.750> decent<00:03:00.959> line

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
be 21 and that's at a very decent line

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.050 
be 21 and that's at a very decent line
21<00:03:01.769> so<00:03:02.070> you<00:03:02.160> can<00:03:02.250> see<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.400> decent<00:03:02.700> return<00:03:02.760> on

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
21 so you can see a decent return on
