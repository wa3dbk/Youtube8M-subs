00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 Y 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.280
 how about friends welcome to this video 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.110
 again this time I bring you the 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.820
 design of the flag of mexico design 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.220
 that they have asked me as they do not imagine 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.570
 that now they have asked for it a lot and good 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.610
 some time ago I saw this same style 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.170
 on a flag of the USA so I said 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.070
 why not do the same but with the 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.750
 Mexico 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.790
 so here it is I hope you like them 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.550
 it looks amazing in his gun on his card 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.620
 of player and good also on the other hand 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.510
 its very simple history so I hope 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.250
 that they like first of all that they are going to 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.710
 take a half circle they will do 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.600
 of the second red from top to bottom and 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.880
 they are going to put it just at that height 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.190
 if you are of those who say sara I 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.160
 I miss a little bit where as soon as 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.630
 to which there is no or how to put figures 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.940
 with the x button once they have 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.350
 some figure can press it and 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.540
 can activate what has been the 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.950
 grid that's a way in how 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.720
 you can guide yourself so that you do not 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.270
 lose then since they activate it 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.070
 can see how, or rather, what 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.920
 part of the grid I put every 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.960
 figure is going to be much simpler and 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.640
 well after that we take that figure 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.000
 that will go the second green from above 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.460
 down 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.890
 after that they will copy and paste with 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.450
 back and with start something else that can 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.700
 to do is simply I made the same 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.740
 page and take it but I say so that 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.250
 be a little faster just 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.060
 Copy and paste and they will put it exactly 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.060
 at that height 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.170
 after they do this they are going to take 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.730
 again the same figure that is in 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.830
 page number 4 that is the one of 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.510
 tools and they are going to put it in 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.550
 the top part nothing but the 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.010
 figure they will throw a little more and 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.600
 for that they press their right stick and 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.300
 who press it can play a little 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.979
 more with the figures and this time the 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.570
 green I did not do it but in this that 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.790
 it follows that if white if they are going to have to 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.190
 Stretch it a little bit more and it's like 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.509
 I say they press their right stick they make it 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.850
 a little more let's say lengthened and ready 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:05.100
 after that since they have well 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.540
 accommodated nothing else there look at the 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.459
 part of the grid where you have to 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.470
 to be everything if it does not remain believe me 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.510
 it is not so father then as it is 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.740
 they fix well we're going to go to the layer 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.570
 number one and after that they will take 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.970
 that figure they saw they are going to press 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.130
 back so that the figure makes a flip or 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.430
 they turn it around to stretch in such a way 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.760
 that they stay like that they make it a little bit 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:32.460
 concave but not so much 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:36.510
 and more or less have to go 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:39.500
 so after that they copy and paste the van 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.500
 to be white 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.299
 that way and in the top 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.430
 have to go a little to the side 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.980
 left of where was the target of 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.700
 above and at the bottom you have to 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.480
 go exactly in the same white as 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.519
 you can see there 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.349
 and finally they just copy and 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.569
 they stick it in red and nothing else 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.220
 stuffed now maybe now I do not have 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.099
 a lot of sense still what we're going to 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.569
 do or better said this design but 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.610
 to have more sense yet 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.840
 let's take the symbol of the mean 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:15.480
 column as you can see there we take it 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.730
 what we do color black light 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.739
 and we give a little and we go to the side 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:24.299
 left this so that it is below 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:27.840
 of the ones to say the best I do not say it 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.860
 the layers that we just put in such 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.770
 so that they stay like this 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.020
 and they do what they do 80 percent of 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.420
 opacity by the way for this press 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.360
 the eve and it's going to go down the 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.110
 opacity after they do the same and what 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.420
 put on the bottom 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.850
 but it was not that they stay like this again 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.550
 they stretch they stretch they stretch and they do 80 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.350
 percent 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.760
 it's very important that steven because if 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.260
 no, we will not be friends 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.130
 then once they select the 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.350
 figure remember the right stick is 100 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.570
 and then after this as much as they can and already 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.950
 they put it because if they leave it like that, believe me 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.200
 that is going to look very, very bad 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.630
 then then do the same with the 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.120
 part of above and obviously this has 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.330
 to go over all the layers in 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.230
 this occasion miley 78 percent one goes 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.900
 to go up 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.480
 the other goes and down again we repeat 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.640
 the process you go black stretch it the most 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.400
 that can 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:27.500
 lb in the case of the playstation I think that 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.690
 it is son we stay in the names what 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.940
 I feel but it is also with has to be with 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.070
 that of something after that take that 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.470
 figure that will go 9 percent of 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.930
 opacity make it white and they will 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.419
 put just like that 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.280
 we repeat the process but with the part 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.169
 from above and obviously you do not have to go 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.729
 with the layer up or better 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.740
 said with the with the fold of the flag 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:52.430
 up to the top but with the one that goes in 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.050
 medium and also to finish the 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.389
 design can add the eagle because 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.090
 if it would not look like the flag of italy 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:01.310
 but you saw I did not want to get into much 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.500
 detail with question of the eagle 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.810
 because I wanted it to be an emblem 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.050
 easy to do for everyone 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:13.070
 so I put it then for that 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:15.740
 they take the light of the numbers in the 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.750
 letters take mex and they put it just 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.330
 in the middle they do it yellow 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:23.030
 because he looks very father with that color I 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.770
 I tried white I tried not to know of different 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.020
 colors and it looks a lot better with the 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.550
 yellow so try 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.370
 just as it is well in its 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:34.220
 screens and with each of the letters 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.110
 with the m with the e and with the x and how 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.940
 you can see it's been pretty good despite 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.680
 other than the eagle of the flag of 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.930
 Mexico 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.430
 and good friends this is the emblem I hope 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.190
 that you liked and if so by 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.780
 please share the video was one of the 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.910
 more orders for which I ask for your 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.810
 likes like you and see you in the
