he's done it now we have snapped back
into<00:02:13.709> place<00:02:14.900> but<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.170> other<00:02:16.410> one<00:02:16.620> wasn't

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
into place but the other one wasn't

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.600 
into place but the other one wasn't
really<00:02:17.580> snap<00:02:17.850> back<00:02:18.290> very<00:02:19.290> good<00:02:19.500> now<00:02:19.709> so<00:02:20.099> if<00:02:20.370> we

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
really snap back very good now so if we

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.280 
really snap back very good now so if we
hold<00:02:20.909> this<00:02:21.720> at<00:02:22.049> the<00:02:22.290> rear

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
hold this at the rear

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.220 
hold this at the rear
and<00:02:23.620> then<00:02:23.920> both<00:02:24.310> of<00:02:24.459> this<00:02:24.549> on<00:02:24.849> the<00:02:25.000> arm<00:02:25.390> you<00:02:26.049> can

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
and then both of this on the arm you can

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.559 
and then both of this on the arm you can
see<00:02:26.560> those<00:02:26.860> two<00:02:27.099> pieces<00:02:27.370> will<00:02:27.790> snap<00:02:28.090> forward

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
see those two pieces will snap forward

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.140 
see those two pieces will snap forward
but<00:02:28.840> does<00:02:29.590> not<00:02:29.769> seem<00:02:30.040> to<00:02:30.069> be<00:02:30.310> a<00:02:30.340> little<00:02:30.909> bit<00:02:31.030> of

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
but does not seem to be a little bit of

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
but does not seem to be a little bit of
a<00:02:31.239> fault<00:02:31.540> where<00:02:32.099> the<00:02:33.099> two<00:02:33.400> arms<00:02:33.909> don't<00:02:34.180> seem<00:02:34.989> to

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
a fault where the two arms don't seem to

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.500 
a fault where the two arms don't seem to
want<00:02:35.319> to<00:02:35.349> stay<00:02:35.680> back<00:02:35.950> at<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.849> same<00:02:37.090> time<00:02:37.360> you

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
want to stay back at the same time you

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.589 
want to stay back at the same time you
can<00:02:37.689> see<00:02:38.019> that<00:02:38.530> one<00:02:38.709> will<00:02:38.890> stay<00:02:39.220> but<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.360> other

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
can see that one will stay but the other

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.039 
can see that one will stay but the other
one<00:02:40.810> it<00:02:41.049> doesn't<00:02:41.230> want<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:41.769> stay<00:02:42.329> so<00:02:43.329> that<00:02:43.659> is<00:02:43.989> a

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
one it doesn't want to stay so that is a

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.800 
one it doesn't want to stay so that is a
little<00:02:44.680> bit<00:02:44.829> weak<00:02:45.040> there<00:02:45.489> you<00:02:45.579> go<00:02:45.819> they<00:02:46.569> are

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
little bit weak there you go they are

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.309 
little bit weak there you go they are
now<00:02:47.049> in<00:02:47.349> place<00:02:47.680> they<00:02:48.400> will<00:02:48.670> stay<00:02:48.970> back<00:02:49.209> but<00:02:50.140> you

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
now in place they will stay back but you

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.429 
now in place they will stay back but you
really<00:02:50.680> need<00:02:50.859> to<00:02:51.599> work<00:02:52.599> with<00:02:52.840> it<00:02:52.959> to<00:02:53.140> get<00:02:53.290> them

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:53.439 
really need to work with it to get them

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.770 
really need to work with it to get them
to<00:02:53.620> stay<00:02:53.980> in<00:02:54.250> a<00:02:54.430> place<00:02:54.640> but<00:02:55.060> it<00:02:55.180> is<00:02:55.329> a<00:02:55.359> very<00:02:55.599> good

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
to stay in a place but it is a very good

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.869 
to stay in a place but it is a very good
action<00:02:56.280> once<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:58.840> is<00:02:58.870> activated<00:02:59.620> so<00:03:00.549> they<00:03:00.700> are

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
action once it is activated so they are
