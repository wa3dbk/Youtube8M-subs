00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
heat and they're gonna go away now as

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:33.490 
heat and they're gonna go away now as
I'm<00:01:32.240> adding<00:01:32.420> this<00:01:32.720> heat<00:01:32.930> this<00:01:33.140> is<00:01:33.259> another

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
I'm adding this heat this is another

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.139 
get a stretch so I'm putting a pretty
extreme<00:01:48.080> stretch<00:01:48.470> here<00:01:48.770> in<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:49.310> vinyl<00:01:49.520> you

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
extreme stretch here in the vinyl you

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.600 
extreme stretch here in the vinyl you
can<00:01:50.330> see<00:01:50.569> how<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:51.619> image<00:01:52.250> is<00:01:52.399> distorted

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
can see how the the image is distorted

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.760 
can see how the the image is distorted
we've<00:01:53.450> lost<00:01:53.690> a<00:01:53.840> little<00:01:53.990> bit<00:01:54.140> of<00:01:54.259> color<00:01:54.530> right

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
we've lost a little bit of color right

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.789 
we've lost a little bit of color right
in<00:01:54.979> here<00:01:55.509> typically<00:01:56.509> a<00:01:56.630> graphic<00:01:57.319> like<00:01:57.470> this<00:01:57.649> is

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
in here typically a graphic like this is

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.100 
in here typically a graphic like this is
going<00:01:57.979> to<00:01:58.039> have<00:01:58.130> to<00:01:58.250> be<00:01:58.340> replaced<00:01:58.929> if<00:01:59.929> you're

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
going to have to be replaced if you're

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.730 
going to have to be replaced if you're
using<00:02:00.289> the<00:02:00.500> DPF<00:02:00.890> 6000<00:02:01.490> XRP<00:02:01.929> with<00:02:02.929> our<00:02:03.049> 3220

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
using the DPF 6000 XRP with our 3220

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.529 
using the DPF 6000 XRP with our 3220
laminate<00:02:04.299> simply<00:02:06.580> pull<00:02:07.580> all<00:02:07.850> of<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.179> vinyl

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
laminate simply pull all of the vinyl

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.359 
laminate simply pull all of the vinyl
apart<00:02:08.840> so<00:02:08.989> no<00:02:09.170> adhesive<00:02:09.619> is<00:02:09.709> touching<00:02:10.039> itself

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
apart so no adhesive is touching itself

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.070 
apart so no adhesive is touching itself
first<00:02:10.610> so<00:02:11.090> you<00:02:11.180> want<00:02:11.330> to<00:02:11.390> spread<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:11.780> vinyl

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
first so you want to spread the vinyl

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.750 
first so you want to spread the vinyl
apart<00:02:12.410> and<00:02:12.680> then<00:02:13.100> we're<00:02:13.250> just<00:02:13.400> going<00:02:13.549> to<00:02:13.609> take

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
apart and then we're just going to take

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.900 
apart and then we're just going to take
the<00:02:13.910> heat<00:02:14.060> gun<00:02:14.299> just<00:02:14.720> like<00:02:14.780> this<00:02:15.730> touch<00:02:16.730> it

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
the heat gun just like this touch it

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.910 
the heat gun just like this touch it
gently<00:02:17.120> with<00:02:17.450> heat<00:02:17.630> and<00:02:18.470> we're<00:02:18.590> gonna<00:02:18.650> bring

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
gently with heat and we're gonna bring

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.949 
gently with heat and we're gonna bring
all<00:02:19.100> of<00:02:19.459> that<00:02:19.609> right<00:02:19.940> back<00:02:20.180> exactly<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.840> way

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
all of that right back exactly the way

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:21.460 
all of that right back exactly the way
it<00:02:21.079> was

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
it was

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.690 
it was
one<00:02:21.800> king<00:02:22.070> of<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.370> world

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.730 

have<00:02:28.660> a<00:02:28.720> little<00:02:28.870> bit<00:02:29.020> of<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.170> crease<00:02:29.380> in<00:02:29.410> the

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
have a little bit of a crease in the

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.100 
have a little bit of a crease in the
liner<00:02:30.070> here<00:02:30.340> so<00:02:30.550> that's<00:02:30.730> why<00:02:30.910> it's<00:02:31.780> not<00:02:31.840> going

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
liner here so that's why it's not going

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.930 
liner here so that's why it's not going
back<00:02:32.260> absolutely<00:02:32.470> perfect<00:02:33.070> up<00:02:33.190> here<00:02:33.400> also<00:02:33.580> I

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
back absolutely perfect up here also I

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.470 
back absolutely perfect up here also I
think<00:02:34.210> it's<00:02:34.300> going<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.510> straighten<00:02:34.870> this<00:02:34.960> out

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
think it's going to straighten this out

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.720 
think it's going to straighten this out
we<00:02:37.480> come<00:02:37.660> back<00:02:37.780> in<00:02:38.020> touch<00:02:39.010> this<00:02:39.130> with<00:02:39.310> heat<00:02:39.490> and

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
we come back in touch this with heat and

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.820 
we come back in touch this with heat and
you'll<00:02:40.120> see<00:02:40.360> how<00:02:40.540> this<00:02:40.690> goes<00:02:40.870> back<00:02:41.110> absolutely

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
you'll see how this goes back absolutely

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.589 
you'll see how this goes back absolutely
perfectly<00:02:42.220> flat

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.420 

so<00:02:49.140> we'd<00:02:49.290> be<00:02:49.439> able<00:02:49.499> to<00:02:49.650> take<00:02:49.859> the<00:02:50.010> same<00:02:50.219> piece

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
so we'd be able to take the same piece

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.670 
so we'd be able to take the same piece
put<00:02:50.760> bubbles<00:02:51.090> in<00:02:51.209> it<00:02:51.239> put<00:02:52.109> creases<00:02:52.349> and

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
put bubbles in it put creases and

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.069 
put bubbles in it put creases and
wrinkles<00:02:52.829> in<00:02:53.159> it<00:02:53.189> put<00:02:53.879> a<00:02:53.909> size<00:02:54.450> of<00:02:54.629> the<00:02:54.749> strips

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
wrinkles in it put a size of the strips

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:56.599 
wrinkles in it put a size of the strips
on<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.230> vinyl<00:02:55.530> all<00:02:55.859> with<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.129> same<00:02:56.310> piece

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
on the vinyl all with the same piece

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.580 
on the vinyl all with the same piece
within<00:02:57.299> a<00:02:57.420> few<00:02:57.569> seconds<00:02:57.959> of<00:02:58.049> each<00:02:58.139> other<00:02:58.290> and

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
within a few seconds of each other and

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.890 
within a few seconds of each other and
what<00:02:59.159> do<00:02:59.249> we<00:02:59.340> have<00:02:59.489> now<00:02:59.760> a<00:03:00.030> perfectly<00:03:00.719> flat

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
what do we have now a perfectly flat

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.330 
what do we have now a perfectly flat
piece<00:03:01.200> of<00:03:01.349> vinyl<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:01.799> is<00:03:01.889> ready<00:03:02.129> to<00:03:02.189> be

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
piece of vinyl that is ready to be

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.920 
piece of vinyl that is ready to be
applied<00:03:02.549> if<00:03:02.999> you<00:03:03.090> come<00:03:03.269> in<00:03:03.389> close<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:03.749> be<00:03:03.870> able
