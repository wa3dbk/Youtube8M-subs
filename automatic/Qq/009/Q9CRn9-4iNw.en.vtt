00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 hello is seven tons of her one 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.680
 new who you talk to and give today 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.540
 I you five 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.540
 don'ts when creating a logo 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.299
 months of a meeting with how is that going 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.490
 and we were eating and opposite the 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.359
 There was a hairdresser in the street who had a hairdresser 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.590
 logo 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.539
 where quite a few things 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.240
 could be improved and then I thought 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.529
 of a job not the video 5 dead before 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.910
 make a logo 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.519
 so let's start right away at the 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.210
 first don't and that is texts 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.940
 pulling that out is actually the same 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.590
 principle as with a photo and with one 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.149
 photo is also so that when you go 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.910
 and that you too in proportion 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.129
 must do and not just the horizontal 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.930
 ash had scales and if you did that with text 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.180
 then b-cell is the fack you go it 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.950
 very quickly see that it is stretched 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.140
 solution for this is for example 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.059
 just could get him who already 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.699
 instead because you have an audio or 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.079
 take a helvetia and it goes 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.710
 because as you see 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.140
 it is not really nice weather on one 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.450
 second death is too much brucellosis or 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.439
 actually the shadow a little too much present 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.180
 to be 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.490
 and as you can see it is very bad 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.710
 distracting if you like the shadow too much 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.360
 hard set and far too much used 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.130
 for example, you can click on an object 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.409
 use a little lightly 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.930
 but sits on every object and does a lot 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.189
 also wishes that will distract and that wants 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.110
 you don't 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.119
 the shadows of a little subtle 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.200
 so don't keep it too clear 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.200
 present sizes 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.960
 there are too many logos in to the third death 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.700
 a logo and as you see when you put your logo in it 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.560
 had put a praise is a 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.780
 you shouldn't be a bit crazy 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.420
 and what you know is able to do is choose 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.729
 for a logo and really focus on it 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:50.140
 that works out a bit well instead 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:52.450
 of logos are going to combine the fourth 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.340
 don't ice and can be unclear 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.500
 as you see if the text is too small 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.270
 that you can't read well or that 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.550
 is the pics ago so i get you 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.500
 anyway to most logos just 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.810
 to make truss in the vector program 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.700
 ilustrator and to see if the 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.649
 text is legible you might have 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.869
 print it out or ask someone else 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.330
 the text is easy to read from me 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.400
 sometimes it could be because you like the text 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.780
 I put you b what the state but you 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.230
 should be different who might 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.090
 not read at all than bad 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.550
 color combination they are just some 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.519
 colors that don't go well together and 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.319
 some are just also complementary it 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.110
 means that they really are very, very bright 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.180
 face each other and that is fine 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.519
 sometimes you just want a logo that 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.660
 has a lot of contrast in colors and 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.090
 the very stand out 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.310
 but if you use too many colors 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.799
 that do not fit well together then it goes 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.299
 that are very distracting and that you 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.160
 also no longer good where to look 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.959
 as is the case with these examples 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.950
 not nice for you to open this 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.630
 look at logos 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.370
 the is not because they are super ugly 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.620
 but that is because they are complementary 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.630
 use colors and therefore the many colors 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.130
 use that does not fit well together 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.110
 there are enough sites where you can look 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.150
 or colors match together like mine 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.739
 look for which colors with which 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.420
 colors match and used is not 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.920
 too much complementary color 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.690
 I am very curious what you think of it 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.580
 found this video so let it be 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.319
 know in the response and i am too 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.209
 wondering if you know more boxes 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.250
 i have one of these even more boxes on it 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.410
 blog so click on the top right to view it 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.980
 to see extra tones that you can do a lot 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.840
 to learn 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.310
 don't forget to subscribe to how 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.360
 goes that and see you next 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.360
 times bye
