00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.859
 If we want to create a full cloud from scratch, we will first need to: a fleet of large aircraft 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:10.650
 Or hundreds of hot air balloons to carry hundreds of tons of water into the sky 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.860
 Then somehow we will need to vaporize all that liquid into small enough droplets 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.530
 Of the spray to float. In short, it will not be easy work though 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.610
 Our atmosphere is able to pump one cloud after another all over the world at altitudes 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.270
 Up to 20 kilometers above sea level, using water and gases loaded along the surface of the earth. 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.070
 For example, cumulus clouds begin 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.970
 When solar energy evaporates the water from the oceans, plants and soil break through the bonds 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.309
 Keep the water molecules together. Thus the air pile collects moisture at the top, and the air descends 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.360
 Warm and heavy around her pressing and pushing it up, as if it was a hot air balloon invisible 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.629
 It is amazing that the load of this balloon is not driven down, but in fact, the more 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.550
 The amount of water vapor it carries before its rise becomes lighter. 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.039
 This is so strange, because water vapor is like nitrogen 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.780
 And oxygen, which make up the majority of the atmosphere. Basic physics imposes a gas density 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.850
 Given the same number of molecules regardless of the quality of these molecules. And that water 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.220
 Composed of the combination of H + H + O, which in turn is lighter than two for both nitrogen and oxygen N. So it has warm air 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.810
 The wetness is more buoyant than the warm and dry air. When the invisible balloon rises, the pressure 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.610
 The low abroad allows inflation to be maintained, which spreads its internal heat out and reduces 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.920
 Temperature. Eventually the air cools higher enough to condense water vapor 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.970
 There are drops to look from afar like a thin line of clouds. And whenever 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.780
 The rest of the balloon rose, steam temperature continued to decrease and condensation on the same height, 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.759
 Creating a flat-bottom cloud to show its rising out of nothingness. 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.780
 As the molecules of water vapor condense together into liquid droplets, 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.950
 It releases the energy it absorbed from the Earth's surface when evaporation. and this is 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.810
 Which would lift the surrounding area from the air, lift it and suck more wet air behind it. 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.770
 Which cools and intensifies the air and releases heat that increases lift and strengthens 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.319
 Upstream. Even in small cumulus clouds, total absolute energy is the process of condensation 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:18.010
 very big. Equivalent to about 270 tonnes of tri-nitrotoluene. And if the amount of water vapor is much greater 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.090
 Emitted energy can produce high clouds of clouds in the upper atmosphere with violent currents 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:31.090
 Thunderstorms and grapefruit-sized colds. This is definitely not a good atmosphere to use hot air balloons.
