my<00:03:21.040> first<00:03:21.340> thought<00:03:21.549> to<00:03:21.760> begin<00:03:21.850> with<00:03:22.150> is<00:03:22.299> that

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
my first thought to begin with is that

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.660 
my first thought to begin with is that
this<00:03:22.810> isn't<00:03:23.019> really<00:03:23.380> gonna<00:03:23.530> go<00:03:24.220> anywhere<00:03:24.609> I

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
this isn't really gonna go anywhere I

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.699 
this isn't really gonna go anywhere I
really<00:03:24.880> think<00:03:25.209> I<00:03:25.299> really<00:03:25.510> want<00:03:25.720> to<00:03:25.959> and<00:03:26.170> the

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
really think I really want to and the

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.020 
really think I really want to and the
only<00:03:26.799> reason<00:03:27.040> I<00:03:27.190> say<00:03:27.340> it<00:03:27.489> might<00:03:27.640> not<00:03:27.819> go

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
only reason I say it might not go

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.150 
only reason I say it might not go
anywhere<00:03:28.239> is<00:03:28.600> because<00:03:29.470> I<00:03:29.500> think<00:03:29.709> there's<00:03:30.069> a

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
anywhere is because I think there's a

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.220 
anywhere is because I think there's a
lot<00:03:30.430> of<00:03:30.910> powerful<00:03:31.239> people<00:03:31.540> who<00:03:31.810> won't<00:03:31.959> want

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
lot of powerful people who won't want

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.340 
lot of powerful people who won't want
this<00:03:32.410> phone<00:03:32.620> out<00:03:32.650> and<00:03:33.959> because<00:03:34.959> I<00:03:35.049> think<00:03:35.079> it's

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
this phone out and because I think it's

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.680 
this phone out and because I think it's
gonna<00:03:35.500> really<00:03:35.769> stop<00:03:36.220> how<00:03:37.030> much<00:03:37.269> money<00:03:37.510> we

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
gonna really stop how much money we

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.090 
gonna really stop how much money we
spend<00:03:37.720> on<00:03:38.049> mobile<00:03:38.410> phones<00:03:38.650> and<00:03:38.829> how<00:03:38.950> much

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
spend on mobile phones and how much

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.890 
spend on mobile phones and how much
stuff<00:03:39.280> we<00:03:39.400> throw<00:03:39.639> away<00:03:39.730> and<00:03:40.180> it's<00:03:40.720> really

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
stuff we throw away and it's really

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.930 
stuff we throw away and it's really
gonna<00:03:41.139> slow<00:03:41.440> down<00:03:41.470> sales<00:03:41.980> for<00:03:42.280> Samsung<00:03:42.760> and

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
gonna slow down sales for Samsung and

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.830
