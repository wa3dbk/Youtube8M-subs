00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.369
 Hi all 

00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:04.800
 as many already know for the purpose of the yu-gi-oh series 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.179
 five of those will come out a new series called yu-gi-oh 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:09.179
 fecsa al 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.619
 just like the previous series will introduce a new way of 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:15.319
 invocation and a new type of monsters 

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:18.949
 I mean the invocation this day the outer monsters 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.820
 So far this type of invocation is only taken into account 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.449
 level of the monsters compared to the synch invocation which 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.319
 requires a monster singer from Las Tunas 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:33.539
 these new monsters will not have level but rather range so they 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:37.670
 letters that are directed on the level of monsters will not affect the 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.370
 outer monsters 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.200
 this series will air on April 11, 2011 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.790
 its protagonist will be the panacea as the one who apparently will break him with a 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.560
 I start the outline of main characters in terms of their personality 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.580
 he will also have his consulting friends who enjoy my site 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.110
 apparently from hurricanes and it will be a rival to help him this in his position 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.030
 since in the predecessor series there is always a great rivalry between two 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.290
 characters 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.250
 astral seems to be that it is intended to give the series mysticism 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.610
 that characterized the original series that will accompany in battles altuna doing 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.350
 a possible reference to the relationship that the pharaoh came to tennis itf and 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.840
 that weakens and I think we will do the series like five of s will be developed 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.990
 in the future and equal 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.780
 a new system will be implemented in flights 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.030
 for now it is unknown if it took a new mechanics as they were the raid 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.820
 Hindu or turbo duels 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.850
 given the characteristics shown in the advances, it is observed that 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.040
 they will be normal duels as usual in the original and gx 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.200
 although as happened with his predecessor series that were not expected and that 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.360
 At the beginning they were brutally criticized and in the end many ended up 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.160
 like missing a chance to fecsa at 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.060
 the same is expected by many who effectively take back the old 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.140
 concepts for which the saga itself was a success 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.430
 in short that only time will tell 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.950
