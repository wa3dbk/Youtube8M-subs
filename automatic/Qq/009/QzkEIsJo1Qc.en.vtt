weapon<00:00:39.690> speed<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.559> one<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.149> then<00:00:42.149> adding<00:00:42.570> a

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
weapon speed to one and then adding a

weapon speed to one and then adding a
subtracting<00:00:43.200> from<00:00:43.379> there<00:00:44.210> so<00:00:45.210> we're<00:00:45.329> going<00:00:45.450> to

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
subtracting from there so we're going to

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.010 
subtracting from there so we're going to
go<00:00:45.719> down<00:00:46.320> here<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:47.570> display<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.600> sample

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
go down here and I display the sample

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.920 
go down here and I display the sample
suppose<00:00:49.969> real<00:00:50.969> quick<00:00:51.360> some<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.690> those<00:00:51.750> way

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
suppose real quick some of those way

00:00:51.930 --> 00:01:13.520 
suppose real quick some of those way
lift<00:00:52.170> cases<00:00:52.320> up<00:01:11.720> so<00:01:12.720> first<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.229> all<00:01:13.350> we're

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
lift cases up so first of all we're

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.580 
lift cases up so first of all we're
going<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.710> make<00:01:13.890> these<00:01:14.070> guys<00:01:14.340> unkillable<00:01:18.590> just

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
going to make these guys unkillable just

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.609 
going to make these guys unkillable just
so<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:19.950> they<00:01:20.100> don't<00:01:20.400> die<00:01:21.020> while<00:01:22.020> I'm<00:01:22.170> testing

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
so that they don't die while I'm testing

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.469 
so that they don't die while I'm testing
this<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:22.979> I'm<00:01:23.670> going<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.880> give<00:01:24.000> myself<00:01:24.210> that

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
this so I'm going to give myself that

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.450 
this so I'm going to give myself that
mode<00:01:24.900> as<00:01:25.080> well<00:01:25.880> and<00:01:26.880> first<00:01:27.720> up<00:01:28.020> we've<00:01:28.409> got

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
mode as well and first up we've got

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.940 
mode as well and first up we've got
manifest<00:01:29.460> set<00:01:29.840> so<00:01:30.840> this<00:01:31.110> slows<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.560> targets

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
manifest set so this slows the targets

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.310 
manifest set so this slows the targets
movement<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.520> attack<00:01:32.790> speeds<00:01:33.090> by<00:01:33.270> 40%<00:01:33.659> and

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
movement and attack speeds by 40% and

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.319 
movement and attack speeds by 40% and
then<00:01:34.829> they<00:01:34.979> gradually<00:01:35.369> return<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.000> normal

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
then they gradually return to normal

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.600 
then they gradually return to normal
after<00:01:36.450> 10<00:01:36.780> seconds<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.829> it's<00:01:37.979> kind<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.369> my

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
after 10 seconds so it's kind of a my

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.420 
after 10 seconds so it's kind of a my
tapering<00:01:39.150> effect<00:01:40.640> and<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:43.770> way<00:01:43.890> we<00:01:44.100> check

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
tapering effect and the way we check

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:53.149 
tapering effect and the way we check
this<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.020> console<00:01:51.680> we<00:01:52.680> can<00:01:52.710> see<00:01:53.009> that

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
this is in the console we can see that

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.520 
this is in the console we can see that
his<00:01:53.280> weapons<00:01:53.700> feat<00:01:53.909> mø<00:01:54.090> has<00:01:54.270> been<00:01:54.450> reduced<00:01:54.780> 0.6

his weapons feat mø has been reduced 0.6
or<00:01:55.799> 60%<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.729> high<00:01:56.880> speed<00:02:00.170> sadly<00:02:01.170> he's<00:02:01.350> not

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
or 60% of high speed sadly he's not

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.420 
or 60% of high speed sadly he's not
attacking<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.189> I'll<00:02:02.310> pass<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.729> on<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:03.030> guy<00:02:04.430> so

as you can see he does a type floor

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.770 
as you can see he does a type floor
and<00:02:09.190> then<00:02:09.940> gradually<00:02:10.570> over<00:02:10.600> time<00:02:12.570> they<00:02:13.570> will

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
and then gradually over time they will

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.650 
and then gradually over time they will
they<00:02:14.350> will<00:02:14.500> return<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:14.860> normal<00:02:15.270> after<00:02:16.270> I<00:02:16.600> do

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
they will return to normal after I do

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:23.510 
they will return to normal after I do
that<00:02:16.810> one<00:02:17.170> more<00:02:17.350> time<00:02:17.380> here<00:02:18.300> so<00:02:19.300> he's<00:02:19.420> at<00:02:19.570> 0.6

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.220 

couple<00:02:24.520> seconds<00:02:24.910> go<00:02:25.060> by<00:02:25.090> zero<00:02:25.720> point<00:02:25.930> six

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
couple seconds go by zero point six

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:34.820 
couple seconds go by zero point six
eight<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:29.220> nine<00:02:30.220> zero<00:02:30.490> point<00:02:30.700> eight<00:02:30.850> four<00:02:31.210> and

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
then finally he's back at one so next up

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.750 
then finally he's back at one so next up
we've<00:02:40.480> got<00:02:40.510> school<00:02:41.200> mahes<00:02:41.560> this<00:02:42.190> is<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.430> cloak

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
we've got school mahes this is a cloak

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.270 
we've got school mahes this is a cloak
effect<00:02:43.150> that<00:02:43.360> reduces<00:02:43.810> everybody's<00:02:44.530> movement

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
effect that reduces everybody's movement

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.300 
effect that reduces everybody's movement
and<00:02:45.430> attack<00:02:45.520> speed<00:02:45.880> by<00:02:46.630> thirty<00:02:46.930> percent<00:02:47.310> for

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
and attack speed by thirty percent for

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.990 
and attack speed by thirty percent for
thirty<00:02:48.520> seconds<00:02:49.800> I'm<00:02:50.800> going<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:51.040> test<00:02:51.250> this

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.430 

everybody<00:02:55.000> attacks<00:02:55.420> just<00:02:55.690> a<00:02:55.870> little<00:02:56.260> bit

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
everybody attacks just a little bit

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:04.890 
everybody attacks just a little bit
slower<00:02:56.820> for<00:02:57.820> the<00:02:57.910> time<00:02:58.150> being<00:03:03.600> so<00:03:04.600> as<00:03:04.690> you<00:03:04.810> can

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
slower for the time being so as you can

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.700 
slower for the time being so as you can
see<00:03:05.110> his<00:03:05.170> weapon<00:03:05.530> speed<00:03:05.740> mode<00:03:05.920> is<00:03:06.100> 0.7<00:03:07.500> or<00:03:08.500> it's

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
see his weapon speed mode is 0.7 or it's

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.010 
see his weapon speed mode is 0.7 or it's
supposed<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:09.160> be<00:03:09.540> now<00:03:10.540> here's<00:03:10.810> where<00:03:10.960> the

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
supposed to be now here's where the

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.470 
supposed to be now here's where the
stacking<00:03:11.500> comes<00:03:11.710> into<00:03:11.980> play<00:03:12.190> I<00:03:12.430> can<00:03:13.090> have<00:03:13.270> both

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
stacking comes into play I can have both

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.360 
stacking comes into play I can have both
of<00:03:13.510> these<00:03:13.780> debuffs<00:03:14.290> active<00:03:14.800> on<00:03:14.950> them<00:03:15.130> at<00:03:15.220> the

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
of these debuffs active on them at the

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.040 
of these debuffs active on them at the
same<00:03:15.550> time<00:03:16.680> so<00:03:17.680> if<00:03:17.800> I<00:03:17.920> cast<00:03:18.780> manifest<00:03:19.780> set

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
same time so if I cast manifest set

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:26.550 
same time so if I cast manifest set
mount<00:03:21.750> one<00:03:22.750> to<00:03:23.020> a<00:03:23.050> tag<00:03:24.930> you<00:03:25.930> can<00:03:25.959> see<00:03:26.290> that<00:03:26.470> he

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
mount one to a tag you can see that he

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.100 
mount one to a tag you can see that he
attacks<00:03:26.860> really<00:03:27.580> really<00:03:27.880> slow<00:03:28.150> so<00:03:28.450> he's<00:03:28.959> at

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
attacks really really slow so he's at

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.810 
attacks really really slow so he's at
point<00:03:29.380> three<00:03:29.440> eight<00:03:29.739> right<00:03:30.070> now<00:03:30.100> that's<00:03:30.489> point

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
point three eight right now that's point

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.330 
point three eight right now that's point
three<00:03:31.150> and<00:03:31.180> then<00:03:31.510> he's<00:03:31.660> recovering<00:03:32.230> from<00:03:32.530> the

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
three and then he's recovering from the

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.500 
three and then he's recovering from the
manifest<00:03:33.730> set<00:03:35.820> give<00:03:36.820> them<00:03:36.970> a<00:03:37.000> little<00:03:37.270> bit<00:03:37.390> of

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
manifest set give them a little bit of

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:44.190 
manifest set give them a little bit of
time<00:03:37.720> nice<00:03:38.080> at<00:03:38.350> point<00:03:38.590> four<00:03:38.860> six<00:03:42.930> twenty<00:03:43.930> six

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
time nice at point four six twenty six

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.520 
time nice at point four six twenty six
to<00:03:44.550> going<00:03:45.550> to<00:03:45.610> go<00:03:45.700> back<00:03:45.880> up<00:03:45.910> 2.7<00:03:49.380> actually<00:03:50.380> he's

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
to going to go back up 2.7 actually he's

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.320 
to going to go back up 2.7 actually he's
back<00:03:50.739> at<00:03:50.920> point<00:03:51.160> one<00:03:51.400> because<00:03:51.820> both<00:03:51.850> of<00:03:52.060> the

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
back at point one because both of the

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.100 
back at point one because both of the
effects<00:03:52.630> were<00:03:52.840> off<00:03:54.630> so<00:03:55.630> now<00:03:55.750> we're<00:03:55.930> going<00:03:56.020> to

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
effects were off so now we're going to

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:03.050 
effects were off so now we're going to
make<00:03:56.290> these<00:03:56.470> guys<00:03:56.680> killable<00:04:00.060> of<00:04:01.200> twenty<00:04:02.200> and

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
make these guys killable of twenty and

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.910 
make these guys killable of twenty and
you<00:04:05.310> that<00:04:06.310> slash<00:04:06.820> your<00:04:07.000> ID<00:04:07.500> but<00:04:08.500> luckily<00:04:08.709> I

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
you that slash your ID but luckily I

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.040 
you that slash your ID but luckily I
wrote<00:04:09.220> it<00:04:09.340> down<00:04:09.370> so<00:04:09.820> that<00:04:09.850> just<00:04:10.540> in<00:04:10.690> case<00:04:10.870> this

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
wrote it down so that just in case this

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:28.430 
wrote it down so that just in case this
happens<00:04:12.630> what<00:04:13.630> is<00:04:13.780> it<00:04:13.959> five<00:04:14.940> CEEC

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.990 

all<00:04:29.440> right<00:04:29.590> so<00:04:29.800> next<00:04:30.040> step<00:04:30.340> we've<00:04:30.520> got<00:04:30.760> the

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
all right so next step we've got the

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.190 
all right so next step we've got the
spell<00:04:31.300> energized

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
spell energized

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.830 
spell energized
so<00:04:32.590> restoration<00:04:33.250> spell<00:04:33.550> it<00:04:34.360> increases<00:04:34.810> your

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
so restoration spell it increases your

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.980 
so restoration spell it increases your
own<00:04:35.140> movement<00:04:35.650> and<00:04:35.740> entice<00:04:36.010> peace<00:04:36.340> by<00:04:37.000> 20%<00:04:37.420> for

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
own movement and entice peace by 20% for

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.990 
own movement and entice peace by 20% for
20<00:04:38.260> seconds<00:04:41.190> so<00:04:42.190> this<00:04:42.460> is<00:04:42.640> what<00:04:42.790> my<00:04:42.940> normal

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
20 seconds so this is what my normal

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.170 
20 seconds so this is what my normal
attack<00:04:43.630> speed<00:04:43.900> looks<00:04:44.140> like<00:04:46.980> and<00:04:47.980> here<00:04:48.820> is<00:04:48.940> me

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
attack speed looks like and here is me

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.720 
attack speed looks like and here is me
energized<00:04:51.330> and<00:04:52.710> I<00:04:53.710> also<00:04:53.920> move<00:04:54.310> around<00:04:54.430> a

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
energized and I also move around a

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.360 
energized and I also move around a
little<00:04:54.850> bit<00:04:55.090> faster<00:04:55.740> probably<00:04:56.740> can't<00:04:57.010> really

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
little bit faster probably can't really

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.160 
little bit faster probably can't really
notice<00:04:57.880> the<00:04:58.030> difference<00:04:58.060> it's<00:04:58.600> not<00:04:58.690> a<00:04:58.780> huge

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 
notice the difference it's not a huge

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:04.920 
notice the difference it's not a huge
change<00:05:02.460> the<00:05:03.460> next<00:05:03.790> up<00:05:03.940> we've<00:05:04.150> got<00:05:04.180> energized

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
change the next up we've got energized

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.630 
change the next up we've got energized
other<00:05:05.230> which<00:05:05.710> does<00:05:05.920> the<00:05:06.100> same<00:05:06.280> thing<00:05:06.520> as

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
other which does the same thing as

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.060 
other which does the same thing as
energized<00:05:07.090> but<00:05:07.300> for<00:05:07.510> a<00:05:07.540> target<00:05:07.990> so<00:05:08.920> we're

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
energized but for a target so we're

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:15.510 
energized but for a target so we're
going<00:05:09.190> to<00:05:09.280> check<00:05:09.520> out<00:05:09.700> Ratliff<00:05:14.250> there<00:05:15.250> we<00:05:15.370> go

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
going to check out Ratliff there we go

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.030 
going to check out Ratliff there we go
he's<00:05:15.760> at<00:05:15.910> one<00:05:16.530> the<00:05:17.530> cast<00:05:17.770> energized<00:05:18.280> other<00:05:18.630> and

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
he's at one the cast energized other and

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:26.010 
he's at one the cast energized other and
he<00:05:21.040> goes<00:05:21.220> to<00:05:21.400> 1.2<00:05:24.570> that's<00:05:25.570> going<00:05:25.780> to<00:05:25.870> wear<00:05:25.960> off

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
he goes to 1.2 that's going to wear off

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.660 
he goes to 1.2 that's going to wear off
in<00:05:26.320> just<00:05:26.560> a<00:05:26.680> little<00:05:26.710> bit<00:05:27.010> and<00:05:27.280> I'll<00:05:27.400> show<00:05:27.640> you

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:27.670 
in just a little bit and I'll show you

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.120 
in just a little bit and I'll show you
that<00:05:28.060> all<00:05:28.780> three<00:05:29.110> of<00:05:29.140> these<00:05:29.260> effects<00:05:29.650> can<00:05:29.770> stay

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
that all three of these effects can stay

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.940 
that all three of these effects can stay
just<00:05:30.580> fine<00:05:30.820> on<00:05:31.060> the<00:05:31.180> same<00:05:31.390> actor<00:05:31.840> and<00:05:32.350> now<00:05:32.710> I'll

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
just fine on the same actor and now I'll

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.080 
just fine on the same actor and now I'll
revert<00:05:33.310> back<00:05:33.520> to<00:05:33.760> normal<00:05:35.640> once<00:05:36.640> that<00:05:36.910> wears

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
revert back to normal once that wears

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:47.130 
revert back to normal once that wears
off<00:05:45.630> there<00:05:46.630> we<00:05:46.750> go

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 
off there we go

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.200 
off there we go
so<00:05:47.590> I'm<00:05:47.650> going<00:05:47.830> to<00:05:47.920> cast<00:05:48.130> all<00:05:48.400> my<00:05:48.550> head<00:05:48.700> first

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.590 

then<00:05:52.210> we're<00:05:52.360> going<00:05:52.540> to<00:05:52.570> check<00:05:52.810> he's<00:05:53.470> at<00:05:53.620> 0.7<00:05:54.220> or

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 
then we're going to check he's at 0.7 or

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.690 
then we're going to check he's at 0.7 or
it's<00:05:55.600> supposed<00:05:55.930> to<00:05:56.020> be<00:05:56.430> and<00:05:57.430> I'll<00:05:57.520> let<00:05:57.670> a

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
it's supposed to be and I'll let a

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.690 
it's supposed to be and I'll let a
couple<00:05:58.000> seconds<00:05:58.540> go<00:05:58.690> by<00:05:59.400> then<00:06:00.400> we're<00:06:00.520> going<00:06:00.670> to

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:00.700 
couple seconds go by then we're going to

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.630 
couple seconds go by then we're going to
cast<00:06:00.970> energized<00:06:01.560> or<00:06:02.560> excuse<00:06:03.040> me<00:06:03.130> energized

wait<00:06:14.850> a<00:06:14.880> couple<00:06:15.090> more<00:06:15.420> seconds<00:06:16.020> and<00:06:17.360> then

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
wait a couple more seconds and then

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.120 
wait a couple more seconds and then
we're<00:06:18.510> going<00:06:18.630> to<00:06:18.690> catch<00:06:18.930> manifests<00:06:19.770> app<00:06:19.920> on

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
we're going to catch manifests app on

we're going to catch manifests app on
them<00:06:21.590> which<00:06:22.590> should<00:06:22.620> take<00:06:23.160> him<00:06:23.340> down<00:06:23.520> to<00:06:23.670> 0.5

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.230 
them which should take him down to 0.5

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.190 
them which should take him down to 0.5
so<00:06:25.230> he's<00:06:25.380> at<00:06:25.500> 0.5<00:06:25.920> for<00:06:26.130> the<00:06:26.220> moment<00:06:27.080> then<00:06:28.080> we

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:28.200 
so he's at 0.5 for the moment then we

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.080 
so he's at 0.5 for the moment then we
wait<00:06:28.380> a<00:06:28.410> little<00:06:28.500> bit<00:06:28.890> and<00:06:29.190> he's<00:06:29.700> going<00:06:29.880> to<00:06:29.970> be

four<00:06:40.220> point<00:06:41.220> eight<00:06:41.340> two<00:06:41.900> so<00:06:42.900> energized<00:06:43.530> just

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:43.950 
four point eight two so energized just

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.900

is going to wear off in a bit nice back
at<00:06:48.060> point<00:06:48.330> seven<00:06:48.600> because<00:06:48.960> energized<00:06:49.530> just

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830 
at point seven because energized just

at point seven because energized just
wore<00:06:50.010> off<00:06:50.840> and<00:06:51.840> then<00:06:52.020> pretty<00:06:52.260> song<00:06:52.590> school

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:56.060 
mahes wears off he's back at point one

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.800 
mahes wears off he's back at point one
so<00:06:57.060> that's<00:06:57.270> basically<00:06:57.780> it<00:06:58.080> um<00:06:59.780> you're<00:07:00.780> not
