difficult<00:00:46.739> for<00:00:47.250> me<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.610> withstand<00:00:47.820> multiple

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
difficult for me to withstand multiple

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.490 
difficult for me to withstand multiple
hits<00:00:49.260> or<00:00:50.160> leads<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.789> tell<00:00:51.090> when<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.660> could<00:00:52.140> and

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
hits or leads to tell when I could and

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.970

when<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.829> could<00:00:53.160> not<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.610> fact<00:00:53.910> get<00:00:54.300> hit<00:00:57.980> and

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
when I could not in fact get hit and

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.279 
when I could not in fact get hit and
back<00:00:59.280> on<00:00:59.550> up<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.030> go<00:01:00.149> over<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.510> way<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.079> just

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
back on up and go over this way and just

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.520 
back on up and go over this way and just
let<00:01:01.649> yourself<00:01:02.100> fall<00:01:02.370> down<00:01:03.019> yeah<00:01:04.019> we've<00:01:04.229> seen

let yourself fall down yeah we've seen
this<00:01:04.739> already<00:01:05.070> like<00:01:05.580> three<00:01:05.880> or<00:01:06.000> four<00:01:06.030> times

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
this already like three or four times

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.230 
this already like three or four times
I'm<00:01:07.590> vaguely<00:01:07.950> considering<00:01:08.700> maybe<00:01:08.880> just

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
I'm vaguely considering maybe just

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.670 
I'm vaguely considering maybe just
skipping<00:01:09.510> through<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.020> all<00:01:10.170> but<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.470> don't

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
skipping through it all but I don't

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.620 
skipping through it all but I don't
whatever<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:12.290> don't<00:01:13.290> know<00:01:13.650> anymore<00:01:14.330> anyway<00:01:15.330> a

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
whatever I don't know anymore anyway a

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.410 
whatever I don't know anymore anyway a
metal<00:01:16.140> ring<00:01:16.380> with<00:01:16.590> back<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.700> then<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:18.210> don't

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
metal ring with back and then just don't

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.179 
metal ring with back and then just don't
get<00:01:18.630> caught<00:01:18.930> off<00:01:19.140> facing<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.740> side<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:19.979> the

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
get caught off facing the side of the

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.469 
get caught off facing the side of the
screen<00:01:20.430> on<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.729> side<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.150> screen<00:01:21.420> and

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
screen on the side of the screen and

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.590 
screen on the side of the screen and
stuff<00:01:21.930> like

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
stuff like

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.640 
stuff like
I<00:01:22.920> guess<00:01:23.920> and<00:01:24.360> head<00:01:25.360> back<00:01:25.570> on<00:01:25.630> up<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:28.600> keep<00:01:29.470> on

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
I guess and head back on up and keep on

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.320 
I guess and head back on up and keep on
going<00:01:32.340> maybe<00:01:33.340> it's<00:01:33.549> just<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.850> fact<00:01:34.119> that<00:01:34.210> I

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
going maybe it's just the fact that I

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.120 
going maybe it's just the fact that I
used<00:01:34.509> to<00:01:34.630> be<00:01:34.750> a<00:01:34.780> big<00:01:34.990> safe<00:01:35.229> state<00:01:35.530> abuser<00:01:35.830> but

got<00:02:22.989> a<00:02:23.019> phone<00:02:23.230> call<00:02:23.260> I<00:02:23.530> gotta<00:02:23.739> take<00:02:26.100> turns<00:02:27.100> out

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
got a phone call I gotta take turns out

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.039 
got a phone call I gotta take turns out
that<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.640> phone<00:02:27.820> call<00:02:28.090> was<00:02:28.120> actually<00:02:28.630> for<00:02:28.870> my

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
that the phone call was actually for my

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.789 
that the phone call was actually for my
roommate<00:02:29.530> who<00:02:29.739> is<00:02:29.769> not<00:02:30.070> here<00:02:30.310> at<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.459> moment

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
roommate who is not here at the moment

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.100 
roommate who is not here at the moment
and<00:02:32.799> just<00:02:32.980> there<00:02:33.340> we<00:02:33.489> go<00:02:33.610> all<00:02:34.060> right<00:02:34.390> perhaps

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
and just there we go all right perhaps

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.840 
and just there we go all right perhaps
I'm<00:02:35.290> letting<00:02:35.590> go<00:02:35.709> of<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:35.829> whole<00:02:36.040> bug<00:02:36.310> net<00:02:36.549> the

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
I'm letting go of the whole bug net the

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.440 
I'm letting go of the whole bug net the
most<00:02:37.239> inopportune<00:02:37.600> times<00:02:38.290> my<00:02:38.799> problem

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
most inopportune times my problem

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.960 
most inopportune times my problem
alrighty<00:02:40.739> well<00:02:41.739> now<00:02:42.010> I<00:02:42.040> think<00:02:42.280> we<00:02:42.489> got<00:02:42.579> to<00:02:42.850> go

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
alrighty well now I think we got to go

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.759 
alrighty well now I think we got to go
underneath<00:02:43.480> this<00:02:43.840> boat<00:02:44.140> in<00:02:44.320> order<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.620> get

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
underneath this boat in order to get

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.020 
underneath this boat in order to get
anywhere<00:02:45.070> so<00:02:45.489> we're<00:02:45.700> gonna<00:02:45.790> go<00:02:46.030> do<00:02:46.239> that

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
anywhere so we're gonna go do that

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.759 
anywhere so we're gonna go do that
alrighty<00:02:50.910> million<00:02:51.910> times<00:02:52.209> already<00:02:52.739> yeah<00:02:53.739> I

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
alrighty million times already yeah I

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.289 
alrighty million times already yeah I
guess<00:02:54.070> we<00:02:54.250> haven't<00:02:54.489> actually<00:02:54.700> been<00:02:55.060> here

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
guess we haven't actually been here

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:56.970 
guess we haven't actually been here
before<00:02:55.450> those<00:02:55.959> these<00:02:56.320> corners<00:02:56.829> do

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
before those these corners do

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.759 
before those these corners do
occasionally<00:02:57.519> look<00:02:57.730> about<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.120> same

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
occasionally look about the same

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.559 
occasionally look about the same
alrighty

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
alrighty

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.479 
alrighty
I'm<00:03:02.260> not<00:03:02.439> gonna<00:03:02.530> bother<00:03:02.709> taking<00:03:03.040> that<00:03:03.280> boat

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
I'm not gonna bother taking that boat

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.130 
I'm not gonna bother taking that boat
because<00:03:03.760> i<00:03:03.819> think<00:03:04.060> it<00:03:04.180> just<00:03:04.209> goes<00:03:04.510> places<00:03:04.840> we

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
because i think it just goes places we

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.039 
because i think it just goes places we
don't<00:03:05.319> need<00:03:05.469> to<00:03:05.620> go<00:03:05.849> and<00:03:06.849> yay<00:03:07.180> slingshotting

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
don't need to go and yay slingshotting

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.800 
don't need to go and yay slingshotting
really<00:03:08.680> well<00:03:08.829> I<00:03:09.129> look<00:03:09.909> go<00:03:10.150> ahead<00:03:10.180> move<00:03:10.510> the

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
really well I look go ahead move the

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.140 
really well I look go ahead move the
slingshot<00:03:11.349> I<00:03:11.620> don't<00:03:12.189> know<00:03:12.280> how<00:03:12.549> accurate<00:03:13.120> that

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
slingshot I don't know how accurate that

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.069 
slingshot I don't know how accurate that
is<00:03:13.329> or<00:03:13.629> whatever<00:03:13.900> but<00:03:14.170> you<00:03:14.319> know<00:03:16.079> anyway

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
is or whatever but you know anyway

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.809 
is or whatever but you know anyway
looking<00:03:17.469> at<00:03:17.590> that<00:03:17.709> shield<00:03:18.040> you<00:03:18.250> might<00:03:18.459> not<00:03:18.670> be

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
looking at that shield you might not be

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.879 
looking at that shield you might not be
able<00:03:18.939> to<00:03:19.120> tell<00:03:19.359> the<00:03:19.569> 32x<00:03:20.349> doesn't<00:03:20.769> actually

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
able to tell the 32x doesn't actually

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:24.270 
able to tell the 32x doesn't actually
support<00:03:21.609> transparency<00:03:22.829> however<00:03:23.829> it<00:03:24.069> could

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
support transparency however it could

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.309 
support transparency however it could
just<00:03:24.459> be<00:03:24.579> this<00:03:24.849> video<00:03:25.180> frame<00:03:25.480> rate<00:03:25.719> is<00:03:25.870> bad<00:03:26.079> and

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
just be this video frame rate is bad and

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.390 
just be this video frame rate is bad and
you<00:03:26.590> can<00:03:26.829> completely<00:03:27.310> town<00:03:28.500> so<00:03:29.500> yeah<00:03:29.709> in<00:03:30.370> a

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
you can completely town so yeah in a

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.399 
you can completely town so yeah in a
good<00:03:30.579> frame<00:03:30.819> rate<00:03:31.180> transparency<00:03:32.049> support

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:32.409 
good frame rate transparency support

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:35.429 
good frame rate transparency support
really<00:03:32.620> isn't<00:03:33.010> very<00:03:33.040> significant<00:03:34.439> tech

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:35.439 
really isn't very significant tech

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:36.720 
really isn't very significant tech
sometimes<00:03:35.889> you<00:03:36.069> can<00:03:36.219> pretend<00:03:36.519> to<00:03:36.609> be

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
sometimes you can pretend to be

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.729 
sometimes you can pretend to be
transparent<00:03:37.239> by<00:03:37.510> just<00:03:37.719> removing<00:03:37.900> black<00:03:38.439> lines

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
transparent by just removing black lines

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.920 
transparent by just removing black lines
and<00:03:39.040> adding<00:03:39.250> parent<00:03:39.849> stuff<00:03:40.060> scissoring<00:03:40.629> all

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
and adding parent stuff scissoring all

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.649 
and adding parent stuff scissoring all
kinds<00:03:41.290> of<00:03:41.379> crazy<00:03:41.620> things<00:03:41.739> like<00:03:42.159> that<00:03:42.659> yeah

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:43.659 
kinds of crazy things like that yeah

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:45.659 
kinds of crazy things like that yeah
just<00:03:44.139> removing<00:03:44.500> any<00:03:44.769> outlines<00:03:45.129> the<00:03:45.310> whole<00:03:45.519> lot

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:45.669 
just removing any outlines the whole lot

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:47.490 
just removing any outlines the whole lot
to<00:03:45.819> making<00:03:46.150> an<00:03:46.269> object<00:03:46.389> transparent<00:03:47.260> add<00:03:47.439> a

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
to making an object transparent add a

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.800 
to making an object transparent add a
little<00:03:47.680> bit<00:03:47.799> of<00:03:47.889> Piper<00:03:48.129> maybe<00:03:48.459> our<00:03:48.849> whole

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
little bit of Piper maybe our whole

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.270 
little bit of Piper maybe our whole
bunch<00:03:49.989> of<00:03:50.109> ways<00:03:50.230> you<00:03:50.290> can<00:03:50.500> do<00:03:50.739> things<00:03:50.949> make

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
bunch of ways you can do things make

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.619 
bunch of ways you can do things make
them<00:03:51.430> seem<00:03:51.609> transparent<00:03:52.180> when<00:03:52.269> they<00:03:52.359> really

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:52.629 
them seem transparent when they really

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.309 
them seem transparent when they really
aren't<00:03:54.030> so<00:03:55.030> yeah

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.440 

sega<00:03:58.129> has<00:03:58.159> not<00:03:58.519> been<00:03:58.730> one<00:03:58.939> to<00:03:59.120> typically

support hardware transparencies up until
the<00:04:02.180> Dreamcast<00:04:02.629> actually<00:04:03.230> and<00:04:03.379> then<00:04:03.530> all<00:04:03.709> of<00:04:03.739> a

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
the Dreamcast actually and then all of a

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:05.470 
the Dreamcast actually and then all of a
sudden<00:04:03.889> they<00:04:04.219> really<00:04:04.489> sonic<00:04:04.879> adventure<00:04:05.299> with

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
sudden they really sonic adventure with

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.179 
sudden they really sonic adventure with
the<00:04:05.629> chaos<00:04:05.959> monster<00:04:06.560> and<00:04:06.680> stuff<00:04:06.950> to

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:07.189 
the chaos monster and stuff to

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:10.449 
the chaos monster and stuff to
demonstrate<00:04:08.180> that<00:04:08.359> back<00:04:08.689> I<00:04:09.099> argue<00:04:10.099> that<00:04:10.280> was

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
demonstrate that back I argue that was

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.160 
demonstrate that back I argue that was
the<00:04:10.579> only<00:04:10.670> reason<00:04:10.999> they<00:04:11.329> featured<00:04:11.780> our

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
the only reason they featured our

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.190 
the only reason they featured our
favorite<00:04:12.650> little<00:04:12.920> water<00:04:13.099> monster<00:04:13.670> any<00:04:13.819> night

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
favorite little water monster any night

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.140 
favorite little water monster any night
so<00:04:15.200> yeah<00:04:15.439> let's<00:04:15.739> go<00:04:15.920> slowly<00:04:16.370> with<00:04:16.639> this<00:04:16.820> and

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
so yeah let's go slowly with this and

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.719 
so yeah let's go slowly with this and
wait<00:04:17.359> a<00:04:17.389> minute<00:04:17.690> why<00:04:18.470> did<00:04:18.650> SPO<00:04:19.070> get<00:04:19.280> bench<00:04:19.489> oh

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
wait a minute why did SPO get bench oh

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.610 
wait a minute why did SPO get bench oh
that's<00:04:22.389> great<00:04:23.389> for<00:04:23.599> not<00:04:23.750> thanking<00:04:23.960> my<00:04:24.289> cunning

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
that's great for not thanking my cunning
