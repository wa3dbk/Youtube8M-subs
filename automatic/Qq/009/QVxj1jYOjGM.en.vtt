last with some of the peach water just

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.580 
last with some of the peach water just

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
because it makes it a little bit easy

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.920 
because it makes it a little bit easy
easier<00:02:18.590> for<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.099> blender<00:02:20.440> to<00:02:21.440> get<00:02:21.650> everything

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
easier for the blender to get everything
