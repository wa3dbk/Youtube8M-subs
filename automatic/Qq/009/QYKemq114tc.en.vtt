masturbating but you look at the first

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.740 
masturbating but you look at the first
game<00:04:20.160> but<00:04:20.220> Clairol<00:04:20.820> tried<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:21.239> get<00:04:21.510> passed

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
Clairol that video game

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.550 
Clairol that video game
does<00:04:27.680> beat<00:04:28.310> masturbation<00:04:29.300> because<00:04:29.690> the<00:04:30.380> very

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
does beat masturbation because the very

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.800 
does beat masturbation because the very
first<00:04:30.860> game<00:04:31.220> was<00:04:31.850> called<00:04:32.180> my<00:04:32.450> name<00:04:32.660> is

addiction and and that's about being

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.860 
addiction and and that's about being
addicted<00:04:36.710> to<00:04:36.920> pornography<00:04:37.340> so<00:04:38.180> this<00:04:38.600> is<00:04:38.840> a
