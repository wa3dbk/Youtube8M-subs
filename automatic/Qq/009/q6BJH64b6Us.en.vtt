00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
what's up everyone I just wanted to do a

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.140 
what's up everyone I just wanted to do a
quick<00:00:05.040> little<00:00:05.160> update<00:00:05.339> video<00:00:05.940> on<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.390> SE<00:00:06.870> 4

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.330 

because<00:00:12.150> it<00:00:13.049> still<00:00:13.410> works<00:00:13.620> great<00:00:13.920> I<00:00:13.950> still

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
because it still works great I still

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.930 
because it still works great I still
love<00:00:14.519> it<00:00:14.700> but<00:00:15.330> what<00:00:15.420> I've<00:00:15.570> done<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:15.839> actually

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
love it but what I've done is actually

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:24.009 
love it but what I've done is actually
get<00:00:17.940> rid<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.150> all<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:22.340> coating<00:00:23.340> on<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.580> blade

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:24.019 
get rid of all the coating on the blade

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:26.269 
get rid of all the coating on the blade
which<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.199> find<00:00:25.500> really<00:00:25.740> makes<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.250> huge

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
which I find really makes a huge

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.810 
which I find really makes a huge
difference<00:00:26.609> in<00:00:30.080> the<00:00:31.080> cutting<00:00:31.470> performance

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
difference in the cutting performance

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.520 
difference in the cutting performance
I've<00:00:32.820> left<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:34.550> intact<00:00:35.930> all<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.200> way<00:00:37.260> around

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
I've left it intact all the way around

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:45.170 
I've left it intact all the way around
the<00:00:37.680> handle<00:00:40.010> coil<00:00:41.010> everywhere<00:00:43.789> but<00:00:44.789> where<00:00:45.000> is

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
the handle coil everywhere but where is

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.670 
the handle coil everywhere but where is
necessary<00:00:45.899> I've<00:00:46.289> left<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.800> there<00:00:48.620> taking<00:00:49.620> it

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
necessary I've left it there taking it

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.880 
necessary I've left it there taking it
off<00:00:49.860> on<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.219> spine<00:00:51.320> I'm<00:00:52.320> actually<00:00:52.530> going<00:00:52.800> to

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
off on the spine I'm actually going to

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.729 
off on the spine I'm actually going to
square<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.399> spine<00:00:53.969> up<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.329> little<00:00:54.510> bit<00:00:57.739> so

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
square that spine up a little bit so

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.720 
square that spine up a little bit so
it'll<00:00:58.890> strike<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.250> rod<00:00:59.579> better

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.620 

I<00:01:03.530> used<00:01:05.450> sandpaper<00:01:07.250> this<00:01:08.250> side<00:01:08.490> came<00:01:08.729> out<00:01:08.939> just

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
I used sandpaper this side came out just

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.399 
I used sandpaper this side came out just
about<00:01:09.930> perfect<00:01:11.659> the<00:01:12.659> other<00:01:12.780> side<00:01:13.080> they've<00:01:13.260> got

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
about perfect the other side they've got

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.560 
about perfect the other side they've got
a<00:01:13.439> couple<00:01:13.650> little<00:01:13.950> spots<00:01:16.310> touch<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.520> up<00:01:17.670> but

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
a couple little spots touch it up but

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.910 
a couple little spots touch it up but
then<00:01:18.720> it'll<00:01:18.900> be<00:01:19.020> ready<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.439> go<00:01:19.470> it's<00:01:19.770> just

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
then it'll be ready to go it's just

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.690 
then it'll be ready to go it's just
gonna<00:01:20.100> put<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.460> anyway<00:01:20.909> be<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:21.780> 1095<00:01:22.320> but<00:01:25.700> still

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
gonna put in anyway be in 1095 but still
