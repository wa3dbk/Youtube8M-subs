wall<00:00:00.810> up<00:00:00.960> guys<00:00:01.199> Edie's<00:00:01.829> ex<00:00:02.010> bounty<00:00:02.370> here<00:00:02.550> today

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
wall up guys Edie's ex bounty here today

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.880 
wall up guys Edie's ex bounty here today
with<00:00:03.120> some<00:00:03.560> 32<00:00:04.560> now<00:00:04.830> kill<00:00:05.400> confirmed<00:00:05.609> with<00:00:06.420> the

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:06.890 
with some 32 now kill confirmed with the

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.580 
with some 32 now kill confirmed with the
fat<00:00:08.360> so<00:00:09.360> this<00:00:09.540> is<00:00:09.570> actually<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.230> assault

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
fat so this is actually the assault

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.189 
fat so this is actually the assault
rifle<00:00:10.650> you<00:00:11.389> lock<00:00:12.389> around<00:00:12.809> level<00:00:13.799> 70<00:00:15.109> think<00:00:16.109> is

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
rifle you lock around level 70 think is

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.490 
rifle you lock around level 70 think is
around<00:00:16.379> level<00:00:16.740> late<00:00:17.039> 70s<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.810> lot<00:00:19.470> of

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
around level late 70s and a lot of

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.160 
around level late 70s and a lot of
people<00:00:20.029> I've<00:00:21.029> been<00:00:21.180> using<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:21.689> recently<00:00:21.810> and

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
people I've been using it recently and

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.710 
people I've been using it recently and
saying<00:00:22.439> it's<00:00:22.590> probably<00:00:22.830> one<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.160> best<00:00:23.340> in

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
saying it's probably one of the best in

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.349 
saying it's probably one of the best in
my<00:00:24.720> opinion<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:25.560> probably<00:00:26.490> isn't<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.849> best<00:00:26.910> I

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
my opinion it probably isn't the best I

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.480 
my opinion it probably isn't the best I
mean<00:00:27.390> but<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.199> put<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.710> top<00:00:28.920> three<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.369> be

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
mean but I put it in the top three to be

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.820 
mean but I put it in the top three to be
honest<00:00:29.789> my<00:00:30.539> top<00:00:30.779> one<00:00:30.929> would<00:00:31.080> probably<00:00:31.590> be<00:00:31.679> the

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
honest my top one would probably be the

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.389 
honest my top one would probably be the
ACR<00:00:32.899> number<00:00:33.899> two<00:00:34.079> would<00:00:34.200> probably<00:00:34.260> be<00:00:35.130> the

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
ACR number two would probably be the

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.650 
ACR number two would probably be the
time<00:00:35.730> 95<00:00:36.270> due<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.809> its<00:00:36.960> just<00:00:37.440> one<00:00:37.710> hit<00:00:38.040> and

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
time 95 due to its just one hit and

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.240 
time 95 due to its just one hit and
basically<00:00:39.660> one<00:00:40.020> tap<00:00:40.350> kill<00:00:40.770> because<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.100> get

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
basically one tap kill because you get

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.130 
basically one tap kill because you get
free<00:00:41.460> hit<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.820> course<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.450> basically<00:00:42.899> at<00:00:43.079> the

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
free hit of course and basically at the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.020 
free hit of course and basically at the
farmers<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.559> mine<00:00:43.710> warfare<00:00:43.860> two<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.520> then

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
farmers of mine warfare two and then

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.779 
farmers of mine warfare two and then
this<00:00:45.239> because<00:00:45.980> it<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.160> such<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.340> great<00:00:47.520> weapon

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
this because it is such a great weapon

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.260 
this because it is such a great weapon
so<00:00:48.480> I'll<00:00:48.570> sort<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.840> going<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.500> ym<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.940> such<00:00:51.149> a

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
so I'll sort of going to ym it is such a

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.729 
so I'll sort of going to ym it is such a
great<00:00:51.360> weapon<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:52.170> probably<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.530> main<00:00:52.710> thing

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
great weapon and probably the main thing

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.880 
great weapon and probably the main thing
is<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:54.030> very<00:00:54.600> little<00:00:54.960> recoil<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.800> you

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
is the very little recoil that you

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.270 
is the very little recoil that you
actually<00:00:56.100> get<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:57.559> now<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.890> weapon

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
actually get and now this weapon

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.250 
actually get and now this weapon
actually<00:00:59.609> has<00:00:59.699> an<00:00:59.850> extremely<00:01:00.449> high<00:01:00.930> rate<00:01:01.199> of

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
actually has an extremely high rate of

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.130 
actually has an extremely high rate of
fire<00:01:01.469> almost<00:01:02.430> comparable<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:03.090> SMGs<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:04.019> be

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
fire almost comparable to SMGs to be

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.500 
fire almost comparable to SMGs to be
honest<00:01:04.470> but<00:01:05.189> um<00:01:05.489> coupled<00:01:06.060> with<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.270> having

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
honest but um coupled with it having

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.890 
honest but um coupled with it having
hardly<00:01:07.850> barely<00:01:08.850> any<00:01:09.060> recoil<00:01:09.720> makes<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.619> such<00:01:11.040> a

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
hardly barely any recoil makes it such a

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.789 
hardly barely any recoil makes it such a
vicious<00:01:12.900> weapon<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.590> use<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:14.130> but<00:01:15.590> having<00:01:16.590> no

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
vicious weapon to use and but having no

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.590 
vicious weapon to use and but having no
recall<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.810> so<00:01:19.070> fast<00:01:20.070> fire<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:21.119> does<00:01:21.450> actually

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
recall and so fast fire it does actually

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.200 
recall and so fast fire it does actually
have<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.990> lowest<00:01:22.530> damage<00:01:23.009> them<00:01:23.310> for<00:01:24.030> all<00:01:24.090> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
have the lowest damage them for all the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.039 
have the lowest damage them for all the
assault<00:01:24.509> rifles<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.950> yeah<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:27.509> don't<00:01:27.689> get<00:01:28.020> a

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
assault rifles so yeah you don't get a

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.920 
assault rifles so yeah you don't get a
walk<00:01:28.920> technically<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.939> probably<00:01:30.240> do<00:01:30.420> get<00:01:30.750> us

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
walk technically you probably do get us

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.530 
walk technically you probably do get us
faster<00:01:31.409> kill<00:01:31.590> if<00:01:31.740> not<00:01:31.950> faster<00:01:32.270> but<00:01:33.270> it's<00:01:33.420> all

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
faster kill if not faster but it's all

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.450 
faster kill if not faster but it's all
about<00:01:33.689> your<00:01:33.900> aiming<00:01:34.049> if<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.500> get<00:01:34.799> all<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.280> hit

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
about your aiming if you get all you hit

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.280 
about your aiming if you get all you hit
some<00:01:35.670> guys<00:01:35.909> going<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.270> go<00:01:36.360> down<00:01:36.600> first<00:01:36.900> and

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
some guys going to go down first and

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.460 
some guys going to go down first and
that's<00:01:37.740> why<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:37.890> file<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.310> such<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> good<00:01:39.119> weapon

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
that's why I file is such a good weapon

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.440 
that's why I file is such a good weapon
and<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:40.710> sup<00:01:40.890> side<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.220> SMG<00:01:41.880> rate<00:01:42.210> of

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
and so I sup side the SMG rate of

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.080 
and so I sup side the SMG rate of
failure<00:01:43.130> really<00:01:44.130> gives<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.520> weapon<00:01:44.939> what

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
failure really gives this weapon what

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.840 
failure really gives this weapon what
makes<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.570> I'm<00:01:45.689> really<00:01:46.380> good<00:01:46.560> because<00:01:46.920> as<00:01:47.549> soon

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
makes it I'm really good because as soon

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.149 
makes it I'm really good because as soon
as<00:01:48.060> you're<00:01:48.270> seeing<00:01:48.600> someone<00:01:48.930> you're<00:01:49.619> pumping

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
as you're seeing someone you're pumping

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.539 
as you're seeing someone you're pumping
bullets<00:01:50.340> in<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.850> because<00:01:51.720> it's<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.049> fast<00:01:52.549> it

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
bullets in and because it's so fast it

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.639 
bullets in and because it's so fast it
does<00:01:53.970> actually<00:01:54.119> have<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.600> compensate<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.380> just

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
does actually have to compensate it just

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.039 
does actually have to compensate it just
actually<00:01:55.799> have<00:01:56.180> normal<00:01:57.180> mugs<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.810> much

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
actually have normal mugs that much

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.530 
actually have normal mugs that much
longer<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.590> think<00:01:58.799> it's<00:01:58.979> around<00:01:59.189> 45<00:02:00.119> rounds

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
longer I think it's around 45 rounds

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.499 
longer I think it's around 45 rounds
compared<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.380> normal<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.310> sort<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:02.640> 30<00:02:03.030> in

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
compared to the normal of sort of 30 in

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.870 
compared to the normal of sort of 30 in
the<00:02:03.630> assault<00:02:03.930> rifles<00:02:04.469> which<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.520> most<00:02:05.729> of

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
the assault rifles which and most of

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.609 
the assault rifles which and most of
them<00:02:05.969> cope<00:02:06.240> with<00:02:06.479> because<00:02:06.630> then<00:02:06.869> got<00:02:07.200> as<00:02:07.350> fast

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
them cope with because then got as fast

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.529 
them cope with because then got as fast
a<00:02:07.770> fire<00:02:08.009> but<00:02:08.310> with<00:02:08.670> this<00:02:08.879> weapon<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.450> know

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
a fire but with this weapon you know

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.639 
a fire but with this weapon you know
you're<00:02:09.629> going<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.780> be<00:02:09.840> burning<00:02:10.319> through<00:02:10.530> the

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
you're going to be burning through the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.490 
you're going to be burning through the
ammo<00:02:10.920> quite<00:02:11.340> quick<00:02:11.730> see<00:02:12.360> that's<00:02:12.660> why<00:02:12.900> I'm<00:02:13.140> the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
ammo quite quick see that's why I'm the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.250 
ammo quite quick see that's why I'm the
got<00:02:13.590> this<00:02:13.710> sort<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.300> bigger<00:02:15.300> rounds<00:02:15.780> on<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.050> an

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
got this sort of bigger rounds on it an

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.230 
got this sort of bigger rounds on it an
extended<00:02:16.980> mag<00:02:17.130> even<00:02:17.460> increases<00:02:17.880> that<00:02:17.940> even

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
extended mag even increases that even

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.850 
extended mag even increases that even
more<00:02:18.450> on<00:02:18.570> I<00:02:18.660> don't<00:02:18.870> know<00:02:19.110> what<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.590> actual

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
more on I don't know what the actual

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.180 
more on I don't know what the actual
number<00:02:20.130> counties<00:02:20.700> but<00:02:21.030> i<00:02:21.630> think<00:02:22.590> it<00:02:22.740> is<00:02:22.770> around

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
number counties but i think it is around

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.900 
number counties but i think it is around
the<00:02:24.030> eighties<00:02:25.280> so<00:02:26.280> that<00:02:26.430> makes<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:26.760> really

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
the eighties so that makes it really

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.310 
the eighties so that makes it really
good<00:02:27.090> if<00:02:27.210> you<00:02:27.300> want<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.480> play<00:02:27.570> extended<00:02:28.110> mugs

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
good if you want to play extended mugs

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.890 
good if you want to play extended mugs

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
on it and it probably is a good

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.600 
on it and it probably is a good
attachment<00:02:31.170> that<00:02:31.530> extended<00:02:32.010> bug<00:02:32.160> because<00:02:32.400> you

bothered about the iron sights i think

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.010 
bothered about the iron sights i think
the<00:03:02.400> pretty<00:03:02.580> decent<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:03.540> know<00:03:03.660> they<00:03:03.780> get<00:03:03.900> the

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
the pretty decent you know they get the

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.710 
the pretty decent you know they get the
job<00:03:04.230> done<00:03:04.260> but<00:03:04.680> enough<00:03:04.950> an<00:03:05.070> amazing<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.880> it's

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
job done but enough an amazing and it's

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.960 
job done but enough an amazing and it's
not<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.110> best<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.560> on<00:03:07.709> science<00:03:08.130> so<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.820> red

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
not the best of on science so the red

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.220 
not the best of on science so the red
dot<00:03:09.180> sight<00:03:09.420> will<00:03:09.570> probably<00:03:09.600> a<00:03:10.050> good

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
dot sight will probably a good

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.760 
dot sight will probably a good

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
to use that but yeah also you may

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.009 
to use that but yeah also you may

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
recognize that the m father actually has

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.410 
recognize that the m father actually has
the<00:03:31.100> slowest<00:03:32.100> reload<00:03:32.580> ton<00:03:32.850> of<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.150> assault

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
the slowest reload ton of the assault

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.600 
the slowest reload ton of the assault
rifles<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:34.170> if<00:03:35.160> it<00:03:35.310> gets<00:03:35.489> into<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:36.260> wrong<00:03:37.610> i

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
rifles and if it gets into the wrong i

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.880 
rifles and if it gets into the wrong i
think<00:03:39.000> it's<00:03:39.120> around<00:03:39.239> three<00:03:39.810> seconds<00:03:40.590> I'm<00:03:40.709> not

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
think it's around three seconds I'm not

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.850 
think it's around three seconds I'm not
sure<00:03:41.130> and<00:03:41.630> as<00:03:42.630> you<00:03:42.720> can<00:03:42.840> see<00:03:42.870> quite<00:03:43.380> accurate

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
sure and as you can see quite accurate

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.530 
sure and as you can see quite accurate
there<00:03:44.070> you<00:03:44.370> can<00:03:44.579> burst<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:45.150> but<00:03:45.299> you<00:03:45.390> probably

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
there you can burst it but you probably

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.960 
there you can burst it but you probably
don't<00:03:45.660> need<00:03:45.870> to<00:03:46.019> burst<00:03:46.230> it<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:46.650> but<00:03:47.640> yeah<00:03:47.820> it

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
don't need to burst it and but yeah it

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.580 
don't need to burst it and but yeah it
does<00:03:48.120> actually<00:03:48.209> have<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.570> slowest<00:03:49.170> reload

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
does actually have the slowest reload

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.220 
does actually have the slowest reload
time<00:03:49.890> and<00:03:50.880> to<00:03:51.420> be<00:03:51.510> honest<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.780> number<00:03:52.110> one

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
time and to be honest the number one

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.600 
time and to be honest the number one
assault<00:03:52.530> rifle<00:03:52.829> for<00:03:52.920> me<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.130> ACR<00:03:53.400> does

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
assault rifle for me the ACR does

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.640 
assault rifle for me the ACR does
actually<00:03:53.760> have<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.060> shortest<00:03:54.269> so<00:03:54.750> reload

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
actually have the shortest so reload

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.690 
actually have the shortest so reload
time<00:03:55.950> is<00:03:56.070> a<00:03:56.100> big<00:03:56.400> thing<00:03:56.670> for<00:03:56.730> me<00:03:57.410> so<00:03:58.410> it<00:03:59.130> depends

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
time is a big thing for me so it depends

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.280 
time is a big thing for me so it depends
how<00:03:59.790> you're<00:04:00.120> playing<00:04:00.390> but<00:04:00.690> slive<00:04:01.019> hands

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
how you're playing but slive hands

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.580 
how you're playing but slive hands

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
probably to be really good on this gun

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.319 
probably to be really good on this gun
although<00:04:04.590> for<00:04:05.250> my<00:04:05.400> player<00:04:05.730> are<00:04:05.970> usually

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
although for my player are usually

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.569 
although for my player are usually
scavenger<00:04:06.989> cuz<00:04:07.230> usually<00:04:07.410> I'm<00:04:07.709> keeping<00:04:08.370> alive

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
scavenger cuz usually I'm keeping alive

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.390 
scavenger cuz usually I'm keeping alive
and<00:04:08.910> running<00:04:09.180> out<00:04:09.450> of<00:04:09.480> bullets<00:04:09.630> and<00:04:10.230> see<00:04:10.620> yeah

and running out of bullets and see yeah

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.780 
and running out of bullets and see yeah
that's<00:04:11.579> why<00:04:11.730> I'm<00:04:11.850> using<00:04:13.280> but<00:04:14.280> definitely

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
that's why I'm using but definitely

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.670 
that's why I'm using but definitely
sleight<00:04:15.030> of<00:04:15.060> hand<00:04:15.299> or<00:04:15.600> get<00:04:16.350> you<00:04:16.440> out<00:04:16.530> of<00:04:16.560> those

sleight of hand or get you out of those
type<00:04:16.950> situations<00:04:17.579> if<00:04:17.729> you<00:04:17.790> need<00:04:17.940> a<00:04:18.000> reload

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
type situations if you need a reload

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.270 
type situations if you need a reload
quickly<00:04:18.540> because<00:04:18.870> if<00:04:19.500> you're<00:04:19.680> going<00:04:19.919> in<00:04:20.040> there

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
just like I'll get a quick go on this

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.080 
just like I'll get a quick go on this
game<00:05:19.570> see<00:05:19.870> what<00:05:20.020> can<00:05:20.229> do<00:05:20.410> in<00:05:20.680> fee<00:05:21.130> to<00:05:21.340> know<00:05:21.580> kill

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
game see what can do in fee to know kill

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.350

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.270 
confirmed and in Kill Confirmed is
probably<00:05:25.630> I<00:05:26.080> really<00:05:26.530> do<00:05:26.650> like<00:05:26.830> it<00:05:26.889> to<00:05:27.190> be

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
probably I really do like it to be

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.150 
probably I really do like it to be
honest<00:05:27.460> because<00:05:27.960> it's<00:05:28.960> sort<00:05:29.229> of<00:05:29.380> it<00:05:29.710> bridges

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
honest because it's sort of it bridges

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.430 
honest because it's sort of it bridges
the<00:05:30.400> gap<00:05:30.580> between<00:05:30.789> team<00:05:31.419> deathmatch<00:05:31.990> and<00:05:32.260> sort

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
can be quite long tdms can be quite sure

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.010 
can be quite long tdms can be quite sure
if<00:05:36.550> you're<00:05:36.760> gonna<00:05:36.849> kill<00:05:37.090> confirmed<00:05:37.330> it<00:05:37.720> seems

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
if you're gonna kill confirmed it seems

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.430 
if you're gonna kill confirmed it seems
to<00:05:38.229> be<00:05:38.380> a<00:05:38.590> bit<00:05:39.340> and<00:05:39.940> longer<00:05:40.479> than<00:05:40.630> TDM<00:05:41.110> although

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
to be a bit and longer than TDM although

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.029 
to be a bit and longer than TDM although
it<00:05:41.560> is<00:05:41.680> them<00:05:42.419> basically<00:05:43.419> you<00:05:43.900> do<00:05:44.380> sort<00:05:44.830> of<00:05:44.889> get

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 
it is them basically you do sort of get

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:46.589 
it is them basically you do sort of get
the<00:05:45.130> same<00:05:45.340> amount<00:05:45.370> of<00:05:45.729> kills<00:05:45.940> because<00:05:46.270> you<00:05:46.450> go

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:46.599 
the same amount of kills because you go

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:48.719 
the same amount of kills because you go
up<00:05:46.780> to<00:05:46.990> the<00:05:47.530> same<00:05:47.770> number<00:05:47.950> but<00:05:48.130> you<00:05:48.580> actually

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:48.729 
up to the same number but you actually

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:50.520 
up to the same number but you actually
have<00:05:48.970> to<00:05:49.180> collect<00:05:49.479> the<00:05:49.599> tax<00:05:49.840> this<00:05:50.050> time<00:05:50.260> so

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
have to collect the tax this time so

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.710 
have to collect the tax this time so
people<00:05:50.710> can<00:05:51.039> deny<00:05:51.669> the<00:05:51.729> taxi<00:05:52.270> you<00:05:52.389> have<00:05:52.479> to<00:05:52.599> get

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 
people can deny the taxi you have to get

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.330 
people can deny the taxi you have to get
more<00:05:52.930> kills<00:05:53.200> so<00:05:53.410> you<00:05:53.470> usually<00:05:53.590> ends<00:05:54.070> up<00:05:54.160> with

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
more kills so you usually ends up with

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.700 
more kills so you usually ends up with
instead<00:05:54.760> of<00:05:54.970> being<00:05:55.180> 75<00:05:55.750> kills<00:05:56.199> of<00:05:56.320> the<00:05:56.380> team<00:05:56.560> in

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
instead of being 75 kills of the team in

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.600 
instead of being 75 kills of the team in
TDM<00:05:57.130> ends<00:05:57.370> up<00:05:57.460> being<00:05:57.610> around<00:05:57.880> 90<00:05:58.449> so<00:05:59.260> of<00:05:59.320> course

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
TDM ends up being around 90 so of course

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.189 
TDM ends up being around 90 so of course
also<00:06:00.610> you<00:06:00.940> can<00:06:00.970> get<00:06:01.270> longer<00:06:01.449> kill<00:06:01.750> streaks<00:06:02.080> and

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:02.199 
also you can get longer kill streaks and

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:05.850 
also you can get longer kill streaks and
stuff<00:06:02.440> like<00:06:02.620> that<00:06:02.680> and<00:06:04.110> so<00:06:05.110> yeah<00:06:05.320> a<00:06:05.349> big<00:06:05.590> fan<00:06:05.830> of
