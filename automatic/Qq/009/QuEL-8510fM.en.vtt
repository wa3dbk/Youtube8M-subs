femoris it attaches to this tissue and

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.450 
femoris it attaches to this tissue and
it<00:00:48.149> sends<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.690> branch<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.680> has<00:00:50.070> been<00:00:50.250> removed

pick<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.020> Sartorius<00:02:16.470> up<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.310> do<00:02:17.490> not<00:02:17.820> have<00:02:18.000> this

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
pick the Sartorius up I do not have this

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.970 
pick the Sartorius up I do not have this
dissected<00:02:18.840> out<00:02:18.960> for<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.260> but<00:02:19.410> that's<00:02:19.680> the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
dissected out for you but that's the

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
dissected out for you but that's the

vastus medialis the quadriceps on the
inside<00:02:24.450> this<00:02:25.320> is<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.770> vastus<00:02:26.250> lateralis

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
inside this is the vastus lateralis

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.330 
inside this is the vastus lateralis
underneath<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.630> fashion<00:02:28.080> Lata<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.560> then

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
underneath that fashion Lata and then

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.460 
underneath that fashion Lata and then
you<00:02:29.700> don't<00:02:29.910> see<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.270> but<00:02:30.600> actually<00:02:31.320> it's

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
you don't see it but actually it's

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.220 
you don't see it but actually it's
probably<00:02:31.890> underneath<00:02:32.700> here<00:02:33.180> I'll<00:02:33.900> have<00:02:34.110> to

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
probably underneath here I'll have to

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.870 
probably underneath here I'll have to
get<00:02:34.320> that<00:02:34.530> rectus<00:02:34.980> force<00:02:35.370> goes<00:02:35.580> right<00:02:35.850> down

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
get that rectus force goes right down

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.230 
get that rectus force goes right down

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
digital extensor see that very tiny okay

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.640 
digital extensor see that very tiny okay
this<00:03:30.060> is<00:03:30.269> the<00:03:30.510> superficial<00:03:31.310> digital<00:03:32.310> flexor

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
this is the superficial digital flexor

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.050 
this is the superficial digital flexor
right<00:03:34.650> here<00:03:34.980> it<00:03:35.400> actually<00:03:35.610> is<00:03:35.940> very

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
right here it actually is very

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.810 
right here it actually is very
intimately<00:03:36.750> attached<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.739> gastroc<00:03:38.250> this

intimately attached to the gastroc this

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.210 
intimately attached to the gastroc this
is<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.269> medial<00:03:39.900> hip<00:03:40.140> or<00:03:40.380> the<00:03:40.500> lateral<00:03:40.799> head<00:03:41.010> of

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
is the medial hip or the lateral head of

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.170 
is the medial hip or the lateral head of
the<00:03:41.310> gastrocnemius<00:03:41.750> there's<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:42.870> right<00:03:43.470> here

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
the gastrocnemius there's it right here

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.789 
the gastrocnemius there's it right here
and<00:03:45.180> this<00:03:45.540> is<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:45.989> medial<00:03:46.350> head<00:03:46.380> of<00:03:46.590> the

and this is the medial head of the

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.150 
and this is the medial head of the
gastrocnemius<00:03:47.780> two<00:03:48.780> heads<00:03:49.019> and<00:03:49.290> they<00:03:49.680> make<00:03:49.920> up

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
gastrocnemius two heads and they make up

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.250 
gastrocnemius two heads and they make up
the<00:03:50.310> Achilles<00:03:50.730> tendon<00:03:50.760> which<00:03:51.600> is<00:03:51.780> right<00:03:51.989> there

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
the Achilles tendon which is right there

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.180 
the Achilles tendon which is right there
okay<00:03:53.390> now<00:03:54.390> the<00:03:54.450> inside

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
okay now the inside

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:04.710 
okay now the inside
okay<00:03:58.350> what<00:03:59.350> was<00:03:59.500> this<00:03:59.650> one<00:04:02.370> sillas<00:04:03.510> this<00:04:04.510> one

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
okay what was this one sillas this one

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.460 
okay what was this one sillas this one
underneath<00:04:05.050> the<00:04:05.320> gracilis<00:04:06.210> adductor<00:04:07.470> this

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
underneath the gracilis adductor this

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.730 
underneath the gracilis adductor this
one<00:04:08.880> pectineus<00:04:09.880> and<00:04:10.600> then<00:04:10.810> your<00:04:10.990> Sartorius

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
one pectineus and then your Sartorius

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.820 
one pectineus and then your Sartorius
okay<00:04:12.430> what's<00:04:13.030> this<00:04:13.300> big<00:04:13.630> beam<00:04:13.960> in<00:04:14.350> this<00:04:14.500> area

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
okay what's this big beam in this area

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.720 
okay what's this big beam in this area
right<00:04:14.980> here<00:04:16.140> femoral<00:04:17.140> triangle<00:04:17.500> okay<00:04:18.310> and

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
right here femoral triangle okay and

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.500 
right here femoral triangle okay and
then<00:04:19.269> basically<00:04:20.700> the<00:04:21.700> only<00:04:21.850> other<00:04:22.120> ones<00:04:22.330> you

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
then basically the only other ones you

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.730 
then basically the only other ones you
have<00:04:22.690> to<00:04:22.840> know<00:04:23.020> is<00:04:23.170> by<00:04:23.380> removing<00:04:24.010> the<00:04:24.910> gastroc

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
have to know is by removing the gastroc

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.690 
have to know is by removing the gastroc
okay<00:04:26.740> like<00:04:27.460> this<00:04:27.700> lifting<00:04:28.120> that<00:04:28.300> up<00:04:29.220> this<00:04:30.220> at

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
okay like this lifting that up this at

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.680 
okay like this lifting that up this at
an<00:04:31.090> angle<00:04:31.300> is<00:04:31.720> the<00:04:32.050> popliteus<00:04:32.770> or<00:04:33.070> popliteal

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
an angle is the popliteus or popliteal

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.640 
an angle is the popliteus or popliteal
this<00:04:34.690> one<00:04:34.930> right<00:04:35.710> here<00:04:36.150> this<00:04:37.150> one<00:04:37.510> between<00:04:38.290> the

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
this one right here this one between the

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.520 
this one right here this one between the
superficial<00:04:39.190> digital<00:04:39.820> flexor<00:04:40.360> and<00:04:40.530> the

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
superficial digital flexor and the

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.740 
superficial digital flexor and the
popliteus<00:04:42.130> is<00:04:42.430> a<00:04:42.640> belly<00:04:42.940> of<00:04:43.150> the<00:04:43.300> deep<00:04:43.510> digital

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
popliteus is a belly of the deep digital

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:54.360 
popliteus is a belly of the deep digital
flexor<00:04:46.440> okay<00:04:48.660> questions<00:04:50.970> okay<00:04:51.970> good
