 the new Audi a8 violates driver assistance systems in an innovative way 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.009
 with and Kristian s 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.999
 It can categorize driving situations and preventative measures 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:22.989
 Introduce occupant protection

 Unger Pauli praised inspired with Audi Side Assist 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.420
 The comprehensive complete package is provided by Audi Pre Sense Kloster

 Pauli Vorsprung durch Technik for the case of the cases pauli-profis 1 Basic 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.020
 uses information from the electronic stabilization program ESP the SPD 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.560
 this provided details for hardening the corresponding 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.010
 Shock absorbers for more stability 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.690
 Adjusted for situation and equipment, Bau headed the Brisanz Basic measures 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.860
 for preventive occupant protection 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.120
 Activation of the hazard warning lights penalties the good 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.620
 such as closing windows and sunroof 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.619
 the lane change assistant Paulis is that 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.080
 Monitors the sorcerer flowing traffic 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.990
 Radar sensors allow the detection of vehicles from 70 meters and in the dead

 Winkel Werth im upcoming lane change a vehicle in 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.390
 Danger zone and is recognized by the system 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.000
 If the driver is visually warned he can cancel the lane change in good time 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.250
 Pauli's goal is to use this sensor technology and guide in forecasting 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.980
 Danger from behind, the measures for preventive occupant protection 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.729
 CC with memory function 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:57.560
 imagine driving one for which Hack &amp; VÃ¶lkers take their positions 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.899
 In dense traffic is now more comfortable thanks to Goalie saves the 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:04.200
 Frustration with stop &amp; go function 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.349
 the driver activates the system and the adaptive cruise control system 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.220
 monitors the traffic ahead by means of two radar sensors 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.699
 Sensors of the parking aid by Dirk Anger 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:20.199
 Acceleration and deceleration then takes over the system 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:24.759
 Napoli Presets Front uses these sensors to solve critical situations 

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:26.389
 to recognize flowing traffic 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:30.579
 There were two critical situations to the vehicle ahead and acoustic 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:34.609

 There is a noticeable Rok and the seat belts are convicted 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.429
 if he still does not react a partial braking begins 

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:50.309
 if the driver intervenes no accident may still be avoided 

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:54.829
 the impact is unavoidable and the driver does not respond directed Pauli

 A high-range thermal imager captures the ahead range 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.949
 Animals and humans can be recognized early 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:20.139
 recognized pedestrians in the range between about 15 to 20 meters marked that

 System money 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:24.469
 the system should predict a risk of collision

 Lane Keeping Assist Pauli Gelenkes is the intelligent companion on landes- 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:37.579
 and multi-lane road 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.849
 time and again he makes the lane markings in front of the vehicle 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:44.769
 he approaches a recognized boundary line and red the lane
