 The first leg was a real treat for all basketball lovers and the 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:33.949
 The winner was literally decided in the last second as 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:37.160
 Diamantidis missed a threefold goal

 During this time, they have several times made a threesome litter Lackovic 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.080
 Morris Navarro and that's how they took the lead 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.170
 the lead was then held until the end of the game 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.450
 the guests had the opportunity to make 7 but made some dubious decisions 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.330
 the judge in favor of the home team have the Spaniard the way to victory 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.880
 little relieved 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.030
 however that may be, the Spaniards have won and they have 6700 79 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.980
 own fans showed that they can find their way back into the game 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.650
 Coach Pasquale has used most of the players for this encounter 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.410
 only in it did not play 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.100
 It was a bit of a surprise in the last quarter Rubia very often on the bench 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.610
 where the coach fits Coal on Lackovic has left a lot 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.800
 Kubica scored 12 points and scored 3 assists 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:58.370
 to Baku has 13 points and 3 assists listed while the logic 12 points 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.210
 and the son scored 10 points 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.490
 the Spaniards have missed nine free throws 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.170
 Tonight, the team from Barcelona to try their own game 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.829
 play similar to the first leg 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:15.340
 they should only improve the game from the free throw line 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:19.089
 maybe they should throw on the threesome in this encounter 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:22.209
 Just like the game under the basket 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:29.540
 prospective lineup Barcelona Rubio Navarro Vazquez according to Way Anderson 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.930
 the crew of Panathinaikos is certainly still mourning for the minimal 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.459
 Defeat against Barcelona 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.730
 The coach Zeljko Obradovic has come to some judges' decisions 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.409
 annoyed especially in the last three to four minutes 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.719
 But just like Barcelona, ​​they should try this game as fast as possible 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:53.149
 possible to forget and devote to the meeting of today 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.999
 It will not be easy, but the victory in the second leg would be one for the Greeks 

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:03.390
 Great Satisfaction for all the wrong that it was done to them 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.319
 In the first leg, the coach of Barcelona Haikou Fotsis has focused and 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.229
 So he scored only two points but also 8 rebounds 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:17.139
 later he admitted his mistake because the diamond is stopped 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:21.060
 who once again proved to be a great player 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.469
 should stop 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:25.619
 He has led the team all the time 

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:32.079
 he scored 26 points 4 rebounds 2 assists a block and a steal 

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:38.119
 Drake Nicholas has spent a very long time on the floor almost 29 

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:39.219
 minutes 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.219
 During this time he scored 16 points 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.489
 Bautista started the game from the bank but then he got his 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.319
 Chance and was one of the best players in with 15 points and six rebounds 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.709
 this game 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:59.349
 Similar to Barcelona, ​​they get a 47% two throw for each point 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:05.939
 53% three litter and therefore it is not surprising that the game with 165 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:12.399
 scored points ended 20 points more than the bookmakers offered 

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:16.729
 Expected formation Panathinaikos presides over Nicholas 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:22.079
 Diamantidis Kahlert is Bautista though Georg Haas though it's here at two 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.849
 top clubs one wonders if the players many tired and exhausted 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:29.419
 this first encounter are 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.770
 most importantly, even that is not injured and that the coaches 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.309
 Pasquale and Obradovic can count on all players 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.349
 It is unlikely that they will play the offensive game from the first encounter 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:46.759
 will repeat because the defense of both teams now much stronger 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:51.810
 and this time you will be more attentive to Diamantidis and Navarro 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.139
 The Spaniards are closer to a win, especially because of the advantage of the 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:01.740
 first game but we doubt that victory will be convincing
