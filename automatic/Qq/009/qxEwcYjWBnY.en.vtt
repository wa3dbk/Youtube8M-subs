00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:19.360
 have special weather conditions 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:22.419
 influence on traffic in the Netherlands too 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.919
 the rail here is bothered by it 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:24.700
 Dutch railways will be intensive 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:26.980
 used 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.610
 it is 1 of the busiest rail networks 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.700
 7000 kilometers in the world 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:37.660
 track 404 stations 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:40.090
 72 100 points and 11 1680 are 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.129
 offer space for more than 55 under train 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.679
 journeys per day 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.789
 the ns carries 1.2 million with this 

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:47.789
 travelers a day 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.489
 the timetable is a complex 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.579
 interplay of available tracks and 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.260
 changes trains and staff 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.940
 under normal circumstances there is 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.800
 room for small adjustments in the 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.780
 timetable 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.330
 but if there are too many disruptions 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.040
 can disrupt train traffic and 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.040
 travelers in the encounter 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.580
 take a busy train, for example 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.050
 node as utrecht central with 120 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.050
 train movements per hour 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.160
 some trains return here others make 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.950
 a stopover 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.560
 be shunted away or go on a 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.479
 drive a different route 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.070
 the staff also sometimes switch to one 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.210
 other train 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.280
 all according to a tightly planned schedule 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.600
 Suppose a broken bill or defect 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.240
 train outside of utrecht 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.300
 the track is blocking on that part 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.009
 can then run fewer or no trains 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.479
 but other trains, for example, those 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.500
 on utrecht central 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.800
 may then not be on time 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.110
 leave for a next ride on this one 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.850
 way creates a local problem 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.240
 delays in other parts of it 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.180
 country 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.280
 under normal circumstances the 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.820
 timetable in the event of disruptions so quickly 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.820
 possibly recovered 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.610
 that is no longer possible as on several 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.130
 places disturbance shortly after each other 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.080
 and arise 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.210
 then the number to execute 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.850
 timetable adjustments 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.190
 simply too large and then it is possible 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.880
 train traffic in parts of the country up to 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.880
 come to a standstill 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.000
 in bad weather it is possible 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.150
 necessary to have more space 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.980
 create on the rail network it 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.810
 preventive adjustment of the 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.450
 timetable 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.000
 the ns then runs nationwide with 20% less 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.320
 trains in the Randstad 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.930
 drives about half the number 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.640
 trains because of this there is more time 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.110
 remedy disturbances 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.090
 also, the rail can be easier to 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.470
 drive a malfunction and there is more 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.470
 reserve staff available 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.510
 together with weather specialists and according to 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.120
 strict protocols are decided 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.210
 when an adjusted timetable 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.210
 is necessary 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.670
 fewer trains means less chance 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.830
 traffic jams and for the traveler 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.610
 it also keeps travel information that way 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.610
 longer current 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.250
 because there are fewer trains 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.600
 the bell printer on a number of routes 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.610
 in the train 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.010
 put where possible and s longer 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.569
 trains in 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.920
 to adjust the adjusted timetable 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.740
 being able to drive is one day 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.660
 preparation time is necessary this way 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:33.520
 the travelers can also timely via 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.520
 various media are informed 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.380
 despite all efforts it is still possible 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.720
 happen that a disruption occurs 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.890
 adjusting the timetable 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.870
 reduces the chance of train traffic 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.700
 comes to a halt and offers more 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.700
 predictability for the traveler
