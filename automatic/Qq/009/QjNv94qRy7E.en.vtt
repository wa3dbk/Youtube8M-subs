hey I'm Andrew - for audio holics I

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.509 
hey I'm Andrew - for audio holics I
didn't<00:00:06.509> realize<00:00:06.960> how<00:00:07.350> horrible<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:08.040> preamp

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
didn't realize how horrible the preamp

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.280 
didn't realize how horrible the preamp
was<00:00:08.760> that<00:00:08.970> I<00:00:09.030> was<00:00:09.179> using<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.630> feed<00:00:09.750> my<00:00:09.929> audio

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
was that I was using to feed my audio

engine<00:00:10.620> 5<00:00:10.860> plus<00:00:11.160> speakers<00:00:11.639> now<00:00:12.330> we<00:00:12.900> reviewed

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
engine 5 plus speakers now we reviewed

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.860 
engine 5 plus speakers now we reviewed
these<00:00:13.590> speakers<00:00:14.099> earlier<00:00:14.670> this<00:00:14.849> year<00:00:14.910> for<00:00:15.719> my

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
these speakers earlier this year for my

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.810 
these speakers earlier this year for my
listening<00:00:16.260> tests<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:16.830> used<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.220> variety<00:00:17.400> of

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
listening tests I used a variety of

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.210 
listening tests I used a variety of
sources<00:00:18.210> including<00:00:18.449> iPhone<00:00:19.380> blu-ray<00:00:19.920> player

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
sources including iPhone blu-ray player

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.509 
sources including iPhone blu-ray player
and<00:00:20.430> stereo<00:00:21.210> outputs<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.930> an<00:00:22.050> AV<00:00:22.380> receiver<00:00:22.769> but

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
and stereo outputs of an AV receiver but

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.849 
and stereo outputs of an AV receiver but
after<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.029> review<00:00:24.420> we<00:00:25.320> hooked<00:00:25.560> up<00:00:25.740> the

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
after the review we hooked up the

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.349 
after the review we hooked up the
speaker's<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.460> know<00:00:26.580> back<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.970> my<00:00:27.119> laptop

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
speaker's you know back to my laptop

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.650 
speaker's you know back to my laptop
using<00:00:27.960> an<00:00:28.050> external<00:00:28.349> hybrid<00:00:28.859> microphone<00:00:29.340> DAC

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
using an external hybrid microphone DAC

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.089 
using an external hybrid microphone DAC
that<00:00:30.660> was<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.470> mistake

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
that was a mistake

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.040 
that was a mistake
now<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:32.759> wondered<00:00:33.149> why<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.329> clarity<00:00:33.899> and

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
now I wondered why the clarity and

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.080 
now I wondered why the clarity and
top-end<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.800> 8th<00:00:34.920> 5<00:00:35.219> plus<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.730> seemed<00:00:36.000> a

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
top-end of the 8th 5 plus it seemed a

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.970 
top-end of the 8th 5 plus it seemed a
bit<00:00:36.210> lacking<00:00:36.510> all<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.050> sudden<00:00:37.380> when<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:37.800> had

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
bit lacking all of a sudden when I had

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.889 
bit lacking all of a sudden when I had
previously<00:00:38.520> found<00:00:38.700> them<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.000> be<00:00:39.030> well<00:00:39.300> pretty

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
previously found them to be well pretty

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.760 
previously found them to be well pretty
darn<00:00:40.170> good<00:00:40.379> then<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.670> connected<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.300> thing

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
darn good then I connected this thing

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.490 
darn good then I connected this thing

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
speakers or amplifier now in our case we

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.440 
speakers or amplifier now in our case we
were<00:01:10.409> using<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.860> amplify<00:01:11.310> tape<00:01:11.520> 5<00:01:12.150> plus

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
were using the amplify tape 5 plus

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.990 
were using the amplify tape 5 plus
speakers<00:01:12.900> using<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.920> device<00:01:14.189> like<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.520> is

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
speakers using a device like this is

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.350 
speakers using a device like this is
great<00:01:15.630> for<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> number<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.500> reasons<00:01:16.830> for<00:01:17.700> one<00:01:17.939> it

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
great for a number of reasons for one it

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.179 
great for a number of reasons for one it
gives<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.840> much<00:01:19.020> better<00:01:19.200> quality<00:01:19.920> than<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
gives you much better quality than the

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.219 
gives you much better quality than the
onboard<00:01:20.700> sound<00:01:20.970> device<00:01:21.299> which<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.720> just<00:01:22.020> there

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
onboard sound device which is just there

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.920 
onboard sound device which is just there
to<00:01:22.409> get<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.740> job<00:01:22.770> done<00:01:23.189> as<00:01:23.720> inexpensively<00:01:24.720> as

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
to get the job done as inexpensively as

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.620 
to get the job done as inexpensively as
possible<00:01:25.610> secondly<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.790> gives<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.450> more

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
possible secondly it gives you more

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.539 
possible secondly it gives you more
options<00:01:27.689> now<00:01:28.500> let's<00:01:28.920> go<00:01:29.130> over<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.400> physical

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
options now let's go over the physical

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.240 
options now let's go over the physical
features<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.390> you'll<00:01:30.689> see<00:01:30.900> what<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.049> mean<00:01:31.250> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
features and you'll see what I mean the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.789 
features and you'll see what I mean the
front<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:33.030> fairly<00:01:33.390> plain<00:01:33.780> with<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> single

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
front is fairly plain with a single

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.920 
front is fairly plain with a single
volume<00:01:35.040> knob<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.700> headphone<00:01:36.360> jack<00:01:36.689> for

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
volume knob and headphone jack for

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.630 
volume knob and headphone jack for
plugging<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.560> your<00:01:37.590> headphones<00:01:38.400> which

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
plugging in your headphones which

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.880 
plugging in your headphones which
incidentally<00:01:39.299> mutes<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.020> rear<00:01:40.229> outputs<00:01:40.680> now

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
incidentally mutes the rear outputs now

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.429 
incidentally mutes the rear outputs now
this<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.579> good<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.090> it's<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.810> way<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:42.990> want<00:01:43.320> a

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
this is good and it's the way you want a

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.859 
this is good and it's the way you want a
system<00:01:43.799> like<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.220> work<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.790> white<00:01:45.540> LED

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
lets you know the DAC is receiving power

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.120 
lets you know the DAC is receiving power
from<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.479> USB<00:01:48.750> interface<00:01:49.079> there's<00:01:49.890> no
