stitch<00:00:14.730> works<00:00:15.089> really<00:00:15.660> well<00:00:15.990> for<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.650> curling

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100

stitch works really well for the curling
I<00:00:17.340> like<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.240> use<00:00:18.480> about<00:00:18.779> five<00:00:19.230> rows<00:00:19.770> at<00:00:20.699> the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.130 
beginning five rows at the end and maybe
five<00:00:22.980> stitches<00:00:23.460> along<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.880> side<00:00:24.119> with<00:00:24.930> my

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140

whatever stitch I like but it works
really<00:00:32.250> well<00:00:32.700> for<00:00:32.759> reverse<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:34.380> did<00:00:34.620> take

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
really well for reverse and it did take

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.950 
really well for reverse and it did take
me<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> while<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:36.030> get<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.360> hang<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.750> this

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
me a while to to get the hang of this

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.650 
me a while to to get the hang of this
stitch<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.590> start<00:00:38.040> picking<00:00:38.309> up<00:00:38.399> speed<00:00:38.660> so

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
stitch and start picking up speed so

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.990 
stitch and start picking up speed so
don't<00:00:40.110> worry<00:00:40.290> if<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.890> think<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.579> you're<00:00:41.700> not

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
don't worry if you think that you're not

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.540 
don't worry if you think that you're not
going<00:00:42.149> quickly<00:00:42.570> enough<00:00:43.020> because<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.309> does

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
going quickly enough because it does

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.180 
going quickly enough because it does
take<00:00:44.850> some<00:00:44.879> practice<00:00:45.649> what<00:00:46.649> you're<00:00:46.770> doing

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
take some practice what you're doing

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.729 
take some practice what you're doing
with<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.399> reverse<00:00:47.910> stitch<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.840> are<00:00:49.140> using

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
with a reverse stitch is you are using

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.850 
with a reverse stitch is you are using
the<00:00:49.860> vertical<00:00:50.100> bar<00:00:50.750> however<00:00:51.750> you're<00:00:52.350> using

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
the vertical bar however you're using

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.000 
the vertical bar however you're using
the<00:00:52.949> vertical<00:00:53.399> bar<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.239> back<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:55.010> your

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
the vertical bar in the back and your

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.119 
the vertical bar in the back and your
hook<00:00:56.340> stays<00:00:56.820> behind<00:00:57.629> your<00:00:57.960> work<00:00:58.199> that's<00:00:58.859> what

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
hook stays behind your work that's what

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.760 
hook stays behind your work that's what
makes<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.550> so<00:00:59.730> difficult<00:00:59.969> because<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:01.320> can't

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
makes it so difficult because you can't

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.039 
makes it so difficult because you can't
really<00:01:02.010> see<00:01:02.129> what<00:01:02.699> you're<00:01:02.820> doing<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:03.359> what<00:01:03.989> I'm

alright<00:01:56.430> now<00:01:56.670> keep<00:01:56.909> doing<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.829> side<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:59.130> side

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
alright now keep doing that side to side

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.999 
alright now keep doing that side to side
motion<00:02:00.890> in<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.159> back<00:02:02.399> until<00:02:03.500> you<00:02:04.500> have<00:02:04.530> ten

loops<00:02:05.340> on<00:02:05.579> your<00:02:05.610> hook<00:02:05.759> now<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.600> see<00:02:06.869> what<00:02:07.049> has

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
loops on your hook now you see what has

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.130 
loops on your hook now you see what has
happened<00:02:07.250> here<00:02:08.250> is

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
happened here is

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.880 
happened here is
the<00:02:10.680> top<00:02:11.039> closing<00:02:11.820> chain<00:02:12.350> when<00:02:13.350> you<00:02:13.500> stitch

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
the top closing chain when you stitch

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.290 
the top closing chain when you stitch
when<00:02:14.520> you<00:02:14.610> close<00:02:14.910> each<00:02:15.560> row<00:02:16.560> this<00:02:17.400> top<00:02:17.790> closing

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
when you close each row this top closing

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.840 
when you close each row this top closing
chain<00:02:18.680> falls<00:02:19.680> over<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.340> front

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
chain falls over to the front

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.850 
chain falls over to the front
you're<00:02:21.210> literally<00:02:21.600> pushing<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.620> front

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
you're literally pushing it to the front

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.010 
you're literally pushing it to the front
of<00:02:22.950> your<00:02:23.130> work<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.700> that's<00:02:24.150> what<00:02:24.450> helps<00:02:24.810> with

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
of your work and that's what helps with

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.490 
of your work and that's what helps with
the<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:26.640> curling<00:02:27.150> is<00:02:27.330> that<00:02:27.810> you're<00:02:28.020> pushing

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
the the curling is that you're pushing

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.040 
the the curling is that you're pushing
some<00:02:29.010> rows<00:02:29.250> forward<00:02:29.940> since<00:02:30.690> you<00:02:30.870> work

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
some rows forward since you work

it<00:02:35.130> causes<00:02:35.820> some<00:02:36.090> curling<00:02:37.160> but<00:02:38.160> if<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.520> will

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
it causes some curling but if you will

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
happened here that the closing chain has

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.230 
happened here that the closing chain has
fallen<00:04:24.039> through<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.430> front<00:04:24.759> of<00:04:24.880> your<00:04:25.030> work

and makes a ridge there pull through two

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.430 
and makes a ridge there pull through two
until<00:04:30.520> you<00:04:30.610> have<00:04:30.789> one<00:04:31.120> loop<00:04:31.449> on<00:04:31.600> your<00:04:31.660> hook<00:04:31.780> now

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
until you have one loop on your hook now

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.950 
until you have one loop on your hook now
see<00:04:33.039> here<00:04:33.310> it<00:04:33.400> is<00:04:33.550> I<00:04:34.199> have<00:04:35.199> a<00:04:35.229> ridge<00:04:35.669> here<00:04:36.669> and

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
see here it is I have a ridge here and

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.779 
see here it is I have a ridge here and
that<00:04:37.960> is<00:04:38.169> the<00:04:38.350> closing<00:04:38.680> chain<00:04:39.250> that's<00:04:39.550> the

that is the closing chain that's the

that is the closing chain that's the

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
yarn over and pull through to see it's a

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.390 
yarn over and pull through to see it's a

chain it's just a chain there it's a

chain it's just a chain there it's a

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
closing chain and what has happened is

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.150 
closing chain and what has happened is
that<00:04:48.310> it<00:04:48.430> has<00:04:48.580> fallen<00:04:48.910> over<00:04:49.270> to<00:04:49.570> the<00:04:49.660> front

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
that it has fallen over to the front
