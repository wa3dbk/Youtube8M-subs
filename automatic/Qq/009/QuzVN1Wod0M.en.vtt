if<00:00:12.830> for<00:00:13.070> some<00:00:13.099> reason<00:00:13.610> your<00:00:13.759> power<00:00:13.940> button<00:00:14.269> is

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
if for some reason your power button is

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.810 
if for some reason your power button is
broken<00:00:17.349> here's<00:00:18.349> a<00:00:18.410> workaround<00:00:18.830> you<00:00:19.430> can<00:00:19.610> do

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
broken here's a workaround you can do

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.230 
broken here's a workaround you can do
it's<00:00:20.570> not<00:00:20.810> a<00:00:20.869> fix<00:00:21.349> it's<00:00:21.680> a<00:00:21.800> workaround<00:00:22.220> this<00:00:23.029> is

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
it's not a fix it's a workaround this is

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.400 
it's not a fix it's a workaround this is
a<00:00:23.270> power<00:00:23.539> button<00:00:25.329> you<00:00:26.329> can<00:00:26.509> see<00:00:26.750> how<00:00:26.929> small

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
a power button you can see how small

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.640 
a power button you can see how small
this<00:00:27.650> is<00:00:28.060> to<00:00:29.060> work<00:00:29.210> on<00:00:29.390> a<00:00:29.449> scale<00:00:29.929> trying<00:00:30.349> to<00:00:30.439> fix

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
this is to work on a scale trying to fix

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.630 
this is to work on a scale trying to fix
a<00:00:30.830> button<00:00:31.130> like<00:00:31.250> that<00:00:31.519> is<00:00:31.730> near<00:00:31.970> impossible<00:00:33.640> so

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
a button like that is near impossible so

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.150 
a button like that is near impossible so
there<00:00:35.000> is<00:00:35.120> a<00:00:35.330> workaround<00:00:35.839> I'm<00:00:36.199> not<00:00:36.980> going<00:00:37.100> to

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
there is a workaround I'm not going to

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.799 
there is a workaround I'm not going to
call<00:00:37.339> it<00:00:37.370> a<00:00:37.550> fix<00:00:37.850> because<00:00:38.150> it's<00:00:38.330> not<00:00:38.510> a<00:00:38.540> nice

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
call it a fix because it's not a nice

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.860 
call it a fix because it's not a nice
one<00:00:39.760> but<00:00:40.760> if<00:00:40.910> it's<00:00:41.059> between<00:00:41.420> throwing<00:00:41.660> your

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
one but if it's between throwing your

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.700 
one but if it's between throwing your
iPod<00:00:42.260> away<00:00:42.610> or<00:00:43.610> iPhone<00:00:44.059> away<00:00:44.360> and<00:00:44.870> doing<00:00:45.559> this

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
iPod away or iPhone away and doing this

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.939 
iPod away or iPhone away and doing this
it<00:00:45.980> might<00:00:46.129> be<00:00:46.160> worth<00:00:46.489> it<00:00:47.230> and<00:00:48.230> you<00:00:48.289> can<00:00:48.559> see<00:00:48.800> on

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
it might be worth it and you can see on

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.450 
it might be worth it and you can see on
the<00:00:49.100> back<00:00:49.340> of<00:00:49.610> this<00:00:49.760> button<00:00:51.100> the<00:00:52.100> ribbon

coming out and on the left there it is

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:58.330 
coming out and on the left there it is
on<00:00:56.600> the<00:00:56.899> left<00:00:57.140> and<00:00:57.379> on<00:00:57.500> the<00:00:57.530> right<00:00:57.680> of<00:00:58.219> the

on the left and on the right of the
ribbon<00:00:58.640> you<00:00:58.760> see<00:00:58.940> those<00:01:00.910> copper<00:01:01.910> lines<00:01:02.269> coming

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
ribbon you see those copper lines coming

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.190 
ribbon you see those copper lines coming
down<00:01:03.460> those<00:01:04.460> are<00:01:04.699> the<00:01:04.789> wires<00:01:05.059> for<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:05.810> on<00:01:05.990> and

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
down those are the wires for the on and

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.490 
down those are the wires for the on and
off<00:01:06.320> and<00:01:06.740> you<00:01:07.420> can't<00:01:08.420> solder<00:01:08.750> them<00:01:09.110> you<00:01:09.289> can't

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
off and you can't solder them you can't

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.930 
off and you can't solder them you can't
do<00:01:09.619> anything<00:01:09.890> with<00:01:10.190> them<00:01:10.340> if<00:01:10.490> you<00:01:10.640> happen<00:01:10.910> to

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
do anything with them if you happen to

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.719 
do anything with them if you happen to
break<00:01:11.149> your<00:01:11.390> ribbon<00:01:11.690> cable<00:01:12.050> it's<00:01:13.009> over<00:01:13.429> you're

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
break your ribbon cable it's over you're

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.429 
break your ribbon cable it's over you're
not<00:01:13.880> going<00:01:14.030> to<00:01:14.090> be<00:01:14.210> able<00:01:14.300> to<00:01:14.420> fix<00:01:14.690> it<00:01:14.930> it's<00:01:15.170> too

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
not going to be able to fix it it's too

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:28.780 
not going to be able to fix it it's too
small

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:37.380 

so<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.940> workaround<00:01:30.330> I<00:01:30.900> found

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.480 

as<00:01:38.010> and<00:01:39.010> this<00:01:39.280> is<00:01:39.460> again<00:01:39.790> only<00:01:40.000> if<00:01:40.210> you<00:01:40.360> have<00:01:40.540> to

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
as and this is again only if you have to

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.480 
as and this is again only if you have to
drill<00:01:42.490> a<00:01:42.520> hole<00:01:42.900> in<00:01:43.900> the<00:01:44.050> back<00:01:44.260> of<00:01:44.500> your<00:01:44.710> iPhone

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
drill a hole in the back of your iPhone

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.430 
drill a hole in the back of your iPhone
and<00:01:46.860> along<00:01:47.860> here<00:01:48.340> see<00:01:49.330> there's<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:49.690> power

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
and along here see there's the power

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.570 
and along here see there's the power
button<00:01:50.920> and<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:52.119> cable<00:01:53.190> literally<00:01:54.190> runs

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
button and the cable literally runs

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.560 
button and the cable literally runs
right<00:01:55.000> where<00:01:55.210> you're<00:01:55.360> looking<00:01:55.810> so<00:01:56.080> it's<00:01:56.619> just

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
right where you're looking so it's just

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.910 
right where you're looking so it's just
the<00:01:58.570> hole<00:01:58.750> allows<00:01:59.080> it<00:01:59.290> to<00:01:59.320> come<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.680> the<00:01:59.770> other

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
the hole allows it to come to the other

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.070 
the hole allows it to come to the other
side<00:02:00.340> of<00:02:00.550> the<00:02:00.610> metal<00:02:00.909> and<00:02:01.090> now<00:02:01.630> we<00:02:01.690> can<00:02:01.930> run

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
side of the metal and now we can run

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.780 
side of the metal and now we can run
along<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.500> back<00:02:02.710> see<00:02:03.040> how<00:02:03.130> it<00:02:03.220> goes<00:02:03.369> up<00:02:03.580> there

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
along the back see how it goes up there

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.890 
along the back see how it goes up there
now<00:02:04.780> what<00:02:04.990> you<00:02:05.170> can<00:02:05.350> do<00:02:05.560> is<00:02:06.570> there's<00:02:07.570> these<00:02:07.840> two

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
now what you can do is there's these two

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.720 
now what you can do is there's these two
copper<00:02:10.080> wires<00:02:11.080> and<00:02:11.500> if<00:02:11.590> I<00:02:11.770> touch<00:02:12.130> any<00:02:12.459> piece<00:02:12.700> of

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
copper wires and if I touch any piece of

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.020 
copper wires and if I touch any piece of
metal<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.300> them<00:02:14.250> it's<00:02:15.250> like<00:02:15.459> I<00:02:15.610> push<00:02:15.820> the

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
metal to them it's like I push the

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.949 
metal to them it's like I push the
button<00:02:18.570> so<00:02:19.570> I'll<00:02:20.110> show<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:20.590> here<00:02:21.040> I<00:02:21.840> turn<00:02:22.840> it

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
button so I'll show you here I turn it

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:31.110 
button so I'll show you here I turn it
on<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:25.739> you<00:02:26.739> can<00:02:26.980> hear<00:02:27.310> it<00:02:27.340> click<00:02:27.459> shut<00:02:30.120> so

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
on and you can hear it click shut so

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.530 
on and you can hear it click shut so
again<00:02:31.930> really<00:02:32.470> stupid<00:02:33.070> but<00:02:33.340> if<00:02:33.640> that's<00:02:34.269> all

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
again really stupid but if that's all

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.080 
again really stupid but if that's all
you<00:02:34.690> can<00:02:34.870> do<00:02:35.280> go<00:02:36.280> ahead<00:02:36.370> and<00:02:36.580> drill<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:36.820> hole

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
you can do go ahead and drill a hole

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.390 
you can do go ahead and drill a hole
pull<00:02:37.420> it<00:02:37.540> through<00:02:37.870> shave<00:02:38.650> off<00:02:38.920> a<00:02:38.950> little<00:02:39.250> bit

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
pull it through shave off a little bit

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.850 
pull it through shave off a little bit
of<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:39.610> plastic<00:02:40.209> to<00:02:40.500> expose<00:02:41.500> some<00:02:41.739> of<00:02:41.769> the

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
of the plastic to expose some of the

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.420 
of the plastic to expose some of the
wires<00:02:42.100> and<00:02:42.459> then<00:02:43.620> you've<00:02:44.620> gotta<00:02:44.920> want<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.310> get

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
wires and then you've gotta want to get

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.860 
wires and then you've gotta want to get
a<00:02:45.459> case<00:02:46.980> because<00:02:47.980> that's<00:02:48.640> really<00:02:49.150> hokey

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.940 

having<00:02:52.870> YRC<00:02:53.739> so<00:02:54.100> it's<00:02:54.610> not<00:02:54.880> so<00:02:55.269> bad<00:02:55.950> it's

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
having YRC so it's not so bad it's

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.910 
having YRC so it's not so bad it's
stupid<00:02:57.519> but<00:02:57.760> it's<00:02:57.910> not<00:02:58.120> so<00:02:58.360> bad

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920
