00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
olive oil in my hand and you can heat

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.490 
olive oil in my hand and you can heat
your<00:01:53.680> oil<00:01:54.040> up<00:01:54.460> which<00:01:54.700> will<00:01:54.940> turn<00:01:55.810> into<00:01:56.050> a<00:01:56.200> hot

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
your oil up which will turn into a hot

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.770 
your oil up which will turn into a hot
oil<00:01:56.770> treatment<00:01:57.400> which<00:01:58.060> is<00:01:58.270> I<00:01:58.510> don't<00:01:58.690> know

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
oil treatment which is I don't know

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.320 
oil treatment which is I don't know
which<00:01:59.350> is<00:01:59.530> also<00:01:59.740> pre-poo<00:02:00.430> I<00:02:00.610> think<00:02:00.820> a<00:02:00.910> pre-poo

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
which is also pre-poo I think a pre-poo

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330 
which is also pre-poo I think a pre-poo
is<00:02:01.450> just<00:02:01.630> using<00:02:01.900> the<00:02:02.080> oil<00:02:02.260> straight<00:02:02.680> from<00:02:02.920> you

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
is just using the oil straight from you

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.340 
is just using the oil straight from you
know<00:02:03.460> your<00:02:03.820> bottle<00:02:04.210> and<00:02:04.420> then<00:02:04.840> how<00:02:05.050> all<00:02:05.259> your

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
know your bottle and then how all your

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.890 
know your bottle and then how all your
treatments<00:02:05.830> are<00:02:05.950> heating<00:02:06.400> the<00:02:06.430> oil<00:02:06.550> up<00:02:07.030> so

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
treatments are heating the oil up so

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.199 
treatments are heating the oil up so
they<00:02:08.140> both<00:02:08.320> creep<00:02:08.679> who's<00:02:08.920> but<00:02:09.280> how<00:02:09.910> all<00:02:10.090> your

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
they both creep who's but how all your

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.550 
they both creep who's but how all your
treatment<00:02:10.600> is<00:02:10.660> using<00:02:10.959> hot<00:02:11.170> oil

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
treatment is using hot oil

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.790 
treatment is using hot oil
I<00:02:11.680> don't<00:02:12.070> heat<00:02:12.280> my<00:02:12.430> oil<00:02:12.640> up<00:02:13.000> um<00:02:13.900> just<00:02:14.530> because<00:02:14.620> I

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
I don't heat my oil up um just because I

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.840 
I don't heat my oil up um just because I
don't<00:02:14.920> really<00:02:15.070> think<00:02:15.160> it<00:02:15.400> makes<00:02:15.550> a<00:02:15.670> big

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
don't really think it makes a big

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.000 
don't really think it makes a big
difference<00:02:15.880> for<00:02:16.480> my<00:02:16.570> hair<00:02:16.870> it<00:02:17.080> works<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.830> same

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
difference for my hair it works the same

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.060 
difference for my hair it works the same
way<00:02:18.340> so<00:02:18.420> this<00:02:19.420> is<00:02:19.600> just<00:02:19.810> like<00:02:20.019> doing<00:02:20.440> less<00:02:20.680> and

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
way so this is just like doing less and

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.640 
way so this is just like doing less and
it<00:02:21.130> works<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.519> same<00:02:21.700> way<00:02:21.910> so<00:02:22.720> when<00:02:23.080> I<00:02:23.110> start<00:02:23.500> to

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
it works the same way so when I start to

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.130 
it works the same way so when I start to
do<00:02:23.860> when<00:02:24.790> I<00:02:24.850> put<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.090> oil<00:02:25.120> on<00:02:25.450> my<00:02:25.570> hair<00:02:25.840> and

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
do when I put the oil on my hair and

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.890 
do when I put the oil on my hair and
then<00:02:26.650> I<00:02:26.769> just<00:02:26.920> pull<00:02:27.220> pieces<00:02:27.760> apart<00:02:28.269> and<00:02:28.510> I<00:02:28.600> just

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
then I just pull pieces apart and I just

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.390 
then I just pull pieces apart and I just
finger<00:02:29.470> detangle<00:02:29.950> through<00:02:30.220> like<00:02:30.640> this<00:02:30.850> and

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
finger detangle through like this and

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.220 
finger detangle through like this and
why<00:02:33.400> are<00:02:33.459> you<00:02:33.519> doing<00:02:33.700> this<00:02:33.910> you<00:02:33.970> can<00:02:34.180> feel<00:02:34.480> the

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
why are you doing this you can feel the

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.690 
why are you doing this you can feel the
shed<00:02:35.470> hairs<00:02:35.680> come<00:02:35.920> out<00:02:36.070> I<00:02:36.100> have<00:02:36.370> stuff<00:02:36.580> in<00:02:36.610> my

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
shed hairs come out I have stuff in my

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.250 
shed hairs come out I have stuff in my
hand<00:02:37.030> I<00:02:37.239> don't<00:02:37.630> know<00:02:37.690> if<00:02:37.750> you<00:02:37.840> guys<00:02:37.959> would<00:02:38.110> be

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
hand I don't know if you guys would be

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.050 
hand I don't know if you guys would be
able<00:02:38.320> to<00:02:38.470> see<00:02:38.739> them<00:02:38.920> but<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:42.400> shed<00:02:42.610> hairs<00:02:42.850> come

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
able to see them but the shed hairs come

00:02:43.060 --> 00:03:04.350 
able to see them but the shed hairs come
out

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.400 

so<00:03:05.360> once<00:03:05.569> you<00:03:05.690> feel<00:03:05.870> like<00:03:05.900> your<00:03:06.170> hair<00:03:06.380> is

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
so once you feel like your hair is

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.490 
so once you feel like your hair is
detangled<00:03:07.400> enough<00:03:08.030> well<00:03:08.480> enough<00:03:08.780> then<00:03:09.590> I<00:03:10.300> just

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
detangled enough well enough then I just

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.630 
detangled enough well enough then I just
split<00:03:12.500> it<00:03:12.740> in<00:03:12.890> a<00:03:13.010> two<00:03:13.250> strand<00:03:13.520> twist<00:03:15.520> and<00:03:16.520> my

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
two strand twist so that doesn't get

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.949
