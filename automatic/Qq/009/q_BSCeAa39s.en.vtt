00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.250
 hamburg against braunschweig also hamburg 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.530
 would have studied properly now 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:19.140
 After the bold, yes, I say the third 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:24.029
 league manager has practically offended say 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.199
 I was good 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.199
 Of course Brunswick is also under 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.519
 Print the cut a team with a 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.599
 point against a team with zero points 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.790
 Of course that is not so nazi 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.840
 but I'll say the pressure is too 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.690
 100% hamburg in this game is that 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.079
 probably the dream against there one 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.160
 I need a relatively solid first half 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.180
 say the second half has one 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.719
 actually quite good with them 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.719
 like 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:55.320
 should one say there for a moment, yes, good ones 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.750
 did trek that was a bit 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.890
 inexperience against frankfurt that must 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.250
 one has to say so have one 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.879
 little 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.379
 especially the 2 0 missed that was 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.180
 an own stupidity the other way 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.880
 aigner was then stopped that was the case 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.170
 a little bit stupid but good 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.200
 after all , it must really see what 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.369
 Brunswick can handle the season 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.479
 Brunswick is and remains for me 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.479
 still losing number one 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.350
 they will also be in my eyes 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.520
 They certainly stay well 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.070
 maybe that is they are the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.329
 role of leads occupy leads yes 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.640
 also made many good games and then 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.479
 are down maybe they are 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.850
 now not so classic that the 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.740
 classical team what then rises where 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.590
 one says or comes as a surprise now 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.579
 or so if you are going down now 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.930
 probably not surprising anyone 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.180
 it depends only on the procured question 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.020
 how or maybe the miracle of 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:55.290
 I do not know what to do with it 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.520
 kumbela looks like who has last 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:04.750
 One 6 90 minutes 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:06.310
 nonsense otherwise I believe 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.899
 Brunswick has no red card 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.420
 cashed later had a white straight 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:19.030
 Not in any case Hamburg is now 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:21.730
 the question is because because that 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.019
 yes still eye and jansen is injured him 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:31.989
 will still suspend two people 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:35.880
 Lincoln was then on football 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:38.380
 talk what's okay that's your tip 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.530
 say braunschweig point is first 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:47.019
 think carefully and win 1 0 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:48.220
 machine was in the hustle and bustle 1 1 1 i know 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:52.380
 not maybe you have to have one 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.380
 let's go wild again on the grill
