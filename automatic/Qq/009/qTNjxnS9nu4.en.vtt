00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.100

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:09.950
 brought a new video of how to install 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.450
 nothing more and nothing less than the texas 2 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.140
 Many people have asked me enough 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.430
 porter england 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.430
 then why 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.609
 let's go to the next page I think that 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.610
 clear clear leave in a link of the 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.610
 description is that 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.640
 here we are assigned 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.640
 the charge 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.740
 we give you the download code mentioned 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.630
 I charge them because I have it 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:04.320
 things that happen before back can only 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:11.270
 be supported by the last version 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.270
 that would be this the 2.1 points 0.2 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:20.450
 how and when listening to the eco parts kariñas 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.450
 touch charging in four parts 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:29.190
 the other parts stress 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.610
 we give 2 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.990
 and execute 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.060
 and ask us where we have to 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.300
 let's keep this we select where 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.080
 save this 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.860
 how we use what we extract here 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.860
 Double click 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.090
 We wait a while for it to open because it's 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.090
 a file of an arrived 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:07.420
 well explain how to do it open in 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:09.670
 the place where we have the xxv order 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.290
 from there to the folder we see all the 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.470
 files will be another one that is bad 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.060
 after two pretty 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.200
 and here it does not come out at all 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.110
 there 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.790
 let's paste 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.110
 our 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.110
 one button file 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.960
 is this 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.150
 we paste it here 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.380
 this I have them as it is to play in 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.300
 the player and see them the zombies 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.890
 well clear that the description comes with 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.110
 this but studies to see the 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.110
 servers that do not carry the one from behind 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.110
 All this 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.470
 now it's going to come out it 's grape loaded 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.940
 the dt craft we give you a question of giving 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.250
 double click on this link 97 how it is 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.020
 that is going to say good we give double 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.230
 click we wait about 5 minutes if we 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.020
 they say 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.600
 you think you installed correctly 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:16.360
 or to create 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.300
 is reading event no no you do not see how 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.730
 say it 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.030
 once this is over and it's going to come out 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.030
 A) Yes 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.569
 and now we select the folder not in 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.569
 let's say the xxv ​​order in my case 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.950
 Control control located in room 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.930
 because it does not allow me to install to me 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.410
 because I already have it installed here 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.410
 you and it will leave you 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:07.220
 ready ah 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:14.860
 later 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:18.430
 second once the two double click and 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.430
 we wait a while 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:27.290
 if it is a subject, it does not have many mysteries 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.180
 what does have to be updated is 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.040
 It is necessarily necessary because 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.460
 some previous versions of the game 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:38.650
 they can not stand and they can not stand it 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.560
 behind or just do not load it 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.120
 so it's quite necessary, of course, that 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.850
 if you have any version of the export of 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.889
 so older that they catch you is 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.100
 excellent but in this version you're going to 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:54.180
 to be able to play online in garena or 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.880
 directly from the body 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.249
 for the original game is the same we 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.609
 to be 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:03.889
 to the folder to the folder of this act 

00:05:01.609 --> 00:05:06.229
 we limit ourselves to 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:08.379
 Now I'm waiting for the 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:08.379
 tec 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.830
 and despite it has already been installed 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.830
 which indeed correctly 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:21.649
 I'm going to take out the trap so they can see what's 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.649
 game 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:30.889
 or the people and we're back and we're back 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:34.509
 here with the craft how we put it 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:38.090
 let's go to extra extensions 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:39.439
 we selected the one from kraft is this 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.820
 also to look for the link they want it 

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:47.230
 Of course, if you want it 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:51.150
 we play made just campaign 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.150
 identification of back 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.639
 and start the game and there you will start 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.020
 load the game so nothing folks that 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:02.909
 that's it 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.430
 they understand they subscribe they download what 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:07.050
 install what they kill bill watterson and 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:11.270
 beat luis keep hyper material to 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.270
