how<00:00:00.420> you<00:00:00.480> place<00:00:00.870> your<00:00:01.170> paper<00:00:01.380> pattern<00:00:01.829> on<00:00:02.010> your

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
how you place your paper pattern on your

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.450 
how you place your paper pattern on your
fabric<00:00:02.639> does<00:00:03.240> matter<00:00:03.689> so<00:00:04.319> make<00:00:04.740> sure<00:00:04.770> that<00:00:05.009> you

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
fabric does matter so make sure that you

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.970 
fabric does matter so make sure that you
have<00:00:05.879> your<00:00:05.910> pattern<00:00:06.810> in<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:07.259> direction<00:00:07.589> that

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
have your pattern in a direction that

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.669 
have your pattern in a direction that
you<00:00:08.220> want<00:00:08.660> okay<00:00:09.660> in<00:00:09.870> this<00:00:09.960> case<00:00:10.200> bill<00:00:10.440> does<00:00:10.559> it

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
you want okay in this case bill does it

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:11.900 
you want okay in this case bill does it
matter<00:00:10.830> as<00:00:11.010> long<00:00:11.040> as<00:00:11.250> its<00:00:11.370> up<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.700> down

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
matter as long as its up and down

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.169 
matter as long as its up and down
straight<00:00:12.300> across<00:00:13.070> also<00:00:14.070> you'll<00:00:14.700> want<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.000> make

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
straight across also you'll want to make

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.970 
straight across also you'll want to make
sure<00:00:15.210> that<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:15.660> cut<00:00:15.900> one<00:00:16.170> piece<00:00:16.199> with<00:00:16.949> the

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
sure that you cut one piece with the

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.040 
sure that you cut one piece with the
right<00:00:17.400> side<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.850> fabric<00:00:18.029> facing<00:00:18.420> up<00:00:18.779> and

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
right side of the fabric facing up and

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.349 
right side of the fabric facing up and
then<00:00:19.800> another<00:00:20.010> piece<00:00:20.400> with<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.699> right<00:00:20.970> side

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
then another piece with the right side

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.900 
then another piece with the right side
of<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.720> fabric<00:00:21.900> facing<00:00:22.260> down<00:00:22.800> if<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.609> do<00:00:23.789> them

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
of the fabric facing down if you do them

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.029 
of the fabric facing down if you do them
both<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.480> same<00:00:24.510> then<00:00:25.410> when<00:00:25.529> you<00:00:25.619> go<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.800> put

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
both the same then when you go to put

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.150 
both the same then when you go to put
these<00:00:26.250> together<00:00:26.460> you'll<00:00:27.330> have<00:00:27.890> one<00:00:28.890> right

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
these together you'll have one right

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.400 
these together you'll have one right
side<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.550> one<00:00:29.699> wrong<00:00:29.970> side<00:00:30.269> facing<00:00:30.480> out<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.050> you

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
side of one wrong side facing out so you

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.799 
side of one wrong side facing out so you
want<00:00:31.590> one<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:31.859> each<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:33.030> fastest<00:00:33.510> way<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.630> do

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
want one of each the fastest way to do

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.450 
want one of each the fastest way to do
this<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.260> go<00:00:34.649> ahead<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.040> fold<00:00:35.219> your<00:00:35.399> fabric

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
this is to go ahead and fold your fabric

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.940 
this is to go ahead and fold your fabric
in<00:00:35.820> half<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:37.079> can<00:00:37.170> do<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.410> wrong<00:00:37.620> sides

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
in half and you can do that wrong sides

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.880 
in half and you can do that wrong sides
together<00:00:38.100> or<00:00:38.460> right<00:00:38.670> sides<00:00:38.940> together<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.890> lay

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
together or right sides together and lay

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.389 
together or right sides together and lay
your<00:00:41.309> pattern<00:00:41.850> onto<00:00:42.230> your<00:00:43.230> fabric<00:00:43.680> pin<00:00:44.160> in

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
your pattern onto your fabric pin in

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.279 
your pattern onto your fabric pin in
place<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.820> then<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.000> can<00:00:45.090> cut<00:00:45.300> out<00:00:45.450> if<00:00:45.690> you're

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
place and then you can cut out if you're

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.049 
place and then you can cut out if you're
not<00:00:46.379> comfortable<00:00:46.649> with<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.160> for<00:00:47.489> any<00:00:47.670> reason

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
not comfortable with that for any reason

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.910 
not comfortable with that for any reason
then<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.660> can<00:00:48.780> just<00:00:48.870> cut<00:00:49.079> each<00:00:49.320> piece<00:00:49.350> at<00:00:49.860> a

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
then you can just cut each piece at a

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.700 
then you can just cut each piece at a
time<00:00:50.010> but<00:00:50.520> again<00:00:50.789> make<00:00:51.059> sure<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.629> have<00:00:51.840> one<00:00:52.680> on

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
time but again make sure you have one on

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.260 
time but again make sure you have one on
one<00:00:52.949> direction<00:00:53.399> cut<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.850> one<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.239> other

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
one direction cut and one of the other

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.260 
one direction cut and one of the other
direction<00:00:54.570> cuts<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.559> don't<00:00:55.800> have

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
direction cuts that you don't have

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.689 
direction cuts that you don't have
pieces<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.510> don't<00:00:57.780> go<00:00:58.079> together<00:00:58.140> okay<00:00:59.129> so

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
pieces that don't go together okay so

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:00.799 
pieces that don't go together okay so
this<00:00:59.820> is<00:00:59.940> just<00:01:00.090> going<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.239> be<00:01:00.300> one<00:01:00.510> style

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
this is just going to be one style

straight pins and pin this in place just

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.880 
straight pins and pin this in place just
like<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.570> would<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.780> normal<00:01:18.869> paper<00:01:19.439> pattern

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
like you would a normal paper pattern

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.120 
like you would a normal paper pattern
okay<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.729> I'm<00:01:21.360> going<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.540> use<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.990> edge<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.710> my

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
okay and I'm going to use the edge of my

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.179 
okay and I'm going to use the edge of my
paper<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.759> make<00:01:23.790> sure<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.570> my<00:01:25.560> pattern<00:01:26.009> is

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
paper to make sure that my pattern is

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.929 
paper to make sure that my pattern is
with<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.729> grain<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.619> fabric<00:01:28.619> if<00:01:29.340> great<00:01:29.700> is

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
with the grain of the fabric if great is

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.880 
with the grain of the fabric if great is
the<00:01:30.270> direction<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.810> goes<00:01:31.140> parallel<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.799> the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
the direction that goes parallel to the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.370 
the direction that goes parallel to the
selvage<00:01:32.220> edges<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.759> fabric<00:01:33.200> again<00:01:34.200> you

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
selvage edges of the fabric again you

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.350 
selvage edges of the fabric again you
could<00:01:34.470> do<00:01:34.590> yourself<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.920> bias<00:01:35.130> good<00:01:36.119> ears

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
could do yourself a bias good ears

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.560 
could do yourself a bias good ears
cross-screen<00:01:37.490> definitely<00:01:38.490> matters<00:01:38.700> language

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
cross-screen definitely matters language

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
cross-screen definitely matters language
it<00:01:39.780> looks<00:01:39.930> good<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.790> okay<00:01:42.140> let<00:01:43.140> me<00:01:43.200> do<00:01:43.380> one

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
it looks good to you okay let me do one

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.840 
it looks good to you okay let me do one
more<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.890> turn<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.189> toe

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.429 

okay<00:01:50.450> now<00:01:51.450> one<00:01:51.689> more<00:01:51.810> thing<00:01:52.080> about<00:01:52.170> the

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
okay now one more thing about the

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.080 
okay now one more thing about the
pattern<00:01:52.799> here<00:01:53.040> before<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.490> go<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.790> cut<00:01:56.090> this

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
pattern here before you go and cut this

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.240 
pattern here before you go and cut this

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
line you lose the straight line or you

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.979 
line you lose the straight line or you
