00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
I'm driving it with let's take a look -

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:46.670 
I'm driving it with let's take a look -
maybe<00:00:33.700> -<00:00:34.000> at<00:00:34.180> a<00:00:34.240> quarter<00:00:34.540> watch<00:00:37.170> and

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
so I prefer to only use that on the wee

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.680 
so I prefer to only use that on the wee
hours<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.010> morning<00:02:35.370> or

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
hours of the morning or

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.060 
hours of the morning or
tonight<00:02:35.990> when<00:02:36.230> there's<00:02:36.380> no<00:02:36.530> ground<00:02:36.860> noise

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
tonight when there's no ground noise

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.490 
tonight when there's no ground noise
that<00:02:37.370> is<00:02:37.460> going<00:02:37.640> to<00:02:37.700> amplify<00:02:37.850> as<00:02:38.330> well<00:02:38.510> all

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
that is going to amplify as well all

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.380 
that is going to amplify as well all
right<00:02:39.650> if<00:02:40.070> I<00:02:40.160> push<00:02:40.370> this<00:02:40.520> button<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:40.940> I'll<00:02:41.180> get

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
right if I push this button and I'll get

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.910 
right if I push this button and I'll get
dial<00:02:41.600> a<00:02:41.750> lot<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:41.930> could<00:02:42.170> change<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.500> dead<00:02:42.710> key

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
dial a lot I could change the dead key

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.130 
dial a lot I could change the dead key
here<00:02:43.250> so<00:02:43.820> with<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.120> same<00:02:44.300> drive<00:02:44.600> levels<00:02:45.020> the

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
here so with the same drive levels the

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.480 
here so with the same drive levels the
way<00:02:45.260> I<00:02:45.290> have<00:02:45.680> it<00:02:46.120> what<00:02:47.120> that<00:02:47.330> would<00:02:47.480> do<00:02:47.660> for<00:02:47.690> us

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
way I have it what that would do for us

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.360 
way I have it what that would do for us
as<00:02:49.490> I<00:02:50.300> have<00:02:50.510> 110<00:02:51.200> watt<00:02:51.410> dead<00:02:51.710> key<00:02:51.980> with<00:02:52.250> the

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
as I have 110 watt dead key with the

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.310 
as I have 110 watt dead key with the
dial<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:52.820> watt<00:02:53.030> out<00:02:53.360> and<00:02:53.690> then<00:02:53.840> when<00:02:53.960> I<00:02:53.990> push

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
dial the watt out and then when I push

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.470 
dial the watt out and then when I push
it<00:02:54.500> in<00:02:54.710> don't<00:02:55.460> even<00:02:55.670> turn<00:02:55.820> the<00:02:56.000> dial<00:02:56.210> yet<00:02:56.450> I

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
it in don't even turn the dial yet I

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.750 
it in don't even turn the dial yet I
just<00:02:56.540> push<00:02:56.900> it<00:02:57.080> in<00:02:57.260> that's<00:02:57.890> going<00:02:58.190> to<00:02:58.280> drop<00:02:58.520> it

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
just push it in that's going to drop it

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.290 
just push it in that's going to drop it
to<00:02:59.410> 45<00:03:00.410> and<00:03:00.800> then<00:03:01.040> with<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.430> dial<00:03:01.670> I<00:03:01.910> can<00:03:02.120> drop

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
to 45 and then with the dial I can drop

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.320 
to 45 and then with the dial I can drop
it<00:03:02.510> all<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:02.660> way<00:03:02.870> down<00:03:03.080> the<00:03:03.260> hard<00:03:03.440> way<00:03:03.590> now<00:03:04.330> to

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
it all the way down the hard way now to

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.560 
it all the way down the hard way now to
watch<00:03:05.570> audio<00:03:06.290> check<00:03:06.560> check<00:03:07.180> all<00:03:08.180> right<00:03:08.390> I

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
watch audio check check all right I

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.140 
watch audio check check all right I
don't<00:03:09.020> see<00:03:09.140> any<00:03:09.290> use<00:03:09.470> for<00:03:09.530> that<00:03:09.940> you<00:03:10.940> have<00:03:11.120> a

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
don't see any use for that you have a

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.490 
don't see any use for that you have a
little<00:03:11.360> bit<00:03:11.540> of<00:03:11.600> use<00:03:11.810> for<00:03:12.080> it<00:03:12.230> when<00:03:12.380> you're

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
little bit of use for it when you're

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.840 
little bit of use for it when you're
using<00:03:12.680> this<00:03:12.950> amp<00:03:13.220> to<00:03:13.370> drive<00:03:13.580> another

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
using this amp to drive another

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.480 
using this amp to drive another
amplifier<00:03:14.480> you<00:03:15.020> can<00:03:15.050> fine<00:03:15.410> tune<00:03:15.440> you<00:03:15.860> can<00:03:16.280> keep

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
amplifier you can fine tune you can keep

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.640 
amplifier you can fine tune you can keep
out<00:03:16.610> of<00:03:16.760> that

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
out of that

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.480 
out of that
generally<00:03:18.650> speaking<00:03:18.920> you're<00:03:19.160> going<00:03:19.280> to<00:03:19.340> use

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
generally speaking you're going to use

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:25.870 
generally speaking you're going to use
it<00:03:19.610> here<00:03:21.190> okay<00:03:23.920> 2<00:03:24.920> meter<00:03:25.130> here<00:03:25.400> relative

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
it here okay 2 meter here relative

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.120 
it here okay 2 meter here relative
output<00:03:26.300> meter<00:03:26.510> it's<00:03:27.320> not<00:03:27.500> important<00:03:27.920> that<00:03:27.950> it

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
output meter it's not important that it

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.440 
output meter it's not important that it
goes<00:03:28.250> all<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.490> way<00:03:28.610> to<00:03:28.730> 10<00:03:29.030> different

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
goes all the way to 10 different

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.880 
goes all the way to 10 different
impedances<00:03:29.720> on<00:03:30.140> your<00:03:30.290> intent<00:03:30.590> are<00:03:30.680> going<00:03:30.830> to

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
impedances on your intent are going to

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.560 
impedances on your intent are going to
have<00:03:30.980> different<00:03:31.340> results<00:03:31.520> on<00:03:32.180> this<00:03:32.300> meter

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
have different results on this meter

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.870 
have different results on this meter
what<00:03:33.380> is<00:03:33.530> nice<00:03:33.740> is<00:03:33.770> that<00:03:34.010> you<00:03:34.280> have<00:03:34.430> an<00:03:34.550> output

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
what is nice is that you have an output

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.220 
what is nice is that you have an output
indication<00:03:35.510> so<00:03:35.660> that<00:03:35.810> it's<00:03:35.960> the<00:03:36.050> same

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
indication so that it's the same

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.590 
indication so that it's the same
indication<00:03:36.950> you<00:03:37.040> had<00:03:37.190> today<00:03:37.340> tomorrow<00:03:38.030> the

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
indication you had today tomorrow the

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.000 
indication you had today tomorrow the
next<00:03:38.780> day<00:03:38.960> at<00:03:39.260> least<00:03:39.410> you<00:03:39.500> know<00:03:39.590> it's<00:03:39.739> working

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
next day at least you know it's working

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.240 
next day at least you know it's working
like<00:03:40.100> it<00:03:40.280> well<00:03:40.480> all<00:03:41.480> right<00:03:41.660> one<00:03:42.650> other<00:03:42.680> nice

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
thing is you can tell if you're over

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.900 
thing is you can tell if you're over
driving<00:03:44.840> it<00:03:45.080> let's<00:03:45.800> say<00:03:46.010> for<00:03:46.340> if<00:03:46.520> you<00:03:46.610> had<00:03:46.760> no

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
swing on one of these things and if I

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.140 
swing on one of these things and if I
were<00:04:08.450> to<00:04:09.130> say<00:04:10.130> be<00:04:10.310> pushing<00:04:10.640> it<00:04:10.730> a<00:04:10.790> little<00:04:10.820> too

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
were to say be pushing it a little too

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.210 
were to say be pushing it a little too
hard<00:04:11.420> to<00:04:11.840> see<00:04:12.050> audio<00:04:12.650> audio<00:04:13.190> audio<00:04:13.730> audio<00:04:15.220> so

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
hard to see audio audio audio audio so

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.729 
hard to see audio audio audio audio so
you<00:04:16.280> can<00:04:16.370> just<00:04:16.580> key<00:04:16.760> the<00:04:16.910> mic
