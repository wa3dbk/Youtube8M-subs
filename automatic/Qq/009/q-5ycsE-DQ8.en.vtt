00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.360
 Hi, I'm David, are we going to continue? 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.320
 now our class is talking now 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:24.039
 little of the export of a 3 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.679
 rock well export 3d views almost like 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.289
 than all other methods of the board 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:30.369
 a low plant view a cut a 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.259
 high 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:36.790
 works the way you come here 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:40.989
 is not the vision of exporting formats 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:44.589
 dwg ready when you want him to go 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:47.290
 for the dwg format is right then 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:49.809
 You come here to move forward. 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.710
 It's good that you have not completed complexity. 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.309
 none 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.170
 okay it gets this option unchecked 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.449
 Are you going to put it in my area? 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.260
 and I'm going to put the name that I 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:01.180
 want to 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.409
 ready there is no mystery with 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.720
 relation to this 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:12.399
 since the export pro is pro autocad is 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:16.000
 very simplified closed now we 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:19.000
 we have others talking max remembering the pre 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.729
 salt is this person uses a version 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.710
 inferior to the position and must inform 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.479
 in voting time it dominates very well 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.960
 very well observed by my dear 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:32.049
 maxson is here in the act, I do not have to 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.969
 come here and define which version is the 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.600
 my user who is on the other side who 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:39.880
 it's on the other end who's almost always there 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.929
 Do not make a mistake, choose 2010 that everything is fine. 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.600
 right 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:46.719
 A good tip, okay, let's see how it is. 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.319
 he stayed there in autocad let's see well 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:56.380
 autocad open let's here pull the 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:02:00.909
 file here we do a little here is 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.429
 You understand right on the beach is it looks 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.639
 how did he come here beauty? 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:09.069
 then you're obviously not mastered 

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:11.290
 so much the autocad you see here in this 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.990
 cantinho is for example 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.540
 realistic that you see there you realize 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.160
 that the liner also came with a 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:23.390
 transparency right 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.920
 each system does not read and sees that it is a 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.220
 wonder, is not it? 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.230
 okay, well, see how it was at 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.110
 if we go back to the fight 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.690
 here in the record there is another one 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.710
 very interesting platform of 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:43.280
 export that is the dwf of let wrx 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.030
 ok this guy to extension this guy is the 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.640
 future 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.800
 here also has our dear and fc 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.670
 it's a promise but I particularly 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:56.590
 I do not give much credit, it's legal but 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:00.200
 also a very interesting promise is 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.610
 to talk among other systems between 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.700
 other platforms 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:08.150
 It's good, I fbx is ideal for anyone who goes 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:12.050
 export to 3 of maquinÃ© opa looks at 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.770
 The sea that is saying fbx here where 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.830
 reinforcements 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.660
 here the fdx is how he is talking is 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.000
 for who will work with 3d max 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.370
 thank you max, you know that it's important 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.980
 understood then these are our 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.800
 export options is right worth the 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.380
 Shame on you to test each one of them never 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.830
 according to the application you want 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.110
 to give 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.209
 It's okay, no point in wanting to stay. 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.890
 mixing things not for each 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.320
 monkey on your branch every drop of 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:43.520
 hysterism beauty closed 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:45.920
 max is this but something good only then 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.480
 although I'll shut us up 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.840
 find the next class 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.840
 thanks
