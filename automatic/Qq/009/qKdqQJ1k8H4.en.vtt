00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.600
 The fundamental objective is to protect 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.490
 our children 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.170
 so what we have done here is 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.330
 destroy mainly machines that are 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.440
 aimed at minors and also go 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.440
 continue with the fight against 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.360
 informality that the management also 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.940
 It makes prevention campaigns through 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.040
 talks in schools yes that's right 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.450
 all those actions are actions that are 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.080
 have been developing in recent years 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:48.129
 and again what we want is to protect 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.480
 to the childhood of this type of activities 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:54.470
 happily there has been and in that we have 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:57.699
 than to recognize it a development one 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.989
 very favorable evolution as a sector 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.690
 compared to what it was ago let's say 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.690
 a decade nowadays we have a sector 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.210
 much more orderly which is worthy 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.330
 to stand out because nowadays there are 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.060
 serious companies that work and pay their 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.330
 taxes are absolutely 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.640
 controlled by the mincetur and that's what 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.590
 what we want to repeat the 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.370
 fundamental objective is to protect 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.820
 our children 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:28.579
 today we are destroying 275 machines 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.969
 which 147 were intended for minors 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:30.969
 old 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.340
 citizenship that knows that somewhere 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.630
 of your community there is this kind of 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.670
 machines that are somehow 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.130
 motivating the use of minors and 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.430
 generating a bad habit in these minors 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.930
 what would be the call of the mincetur if I 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.850
 What I want to highlight is that 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.350
 here the effort is not concentrated 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.230
 only in Lima on the contrary we 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.010
 We are in the whole country 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.840
 machines the machines that we have 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.390
 destroyed today come from different 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.540
 regions also of the magnet 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:07.350
 but this is an effort that will continue 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:11.130
 the call is that those who are 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.570
 acting say informality is 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.420
 put right 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.120
 and then let's say we have all that 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.100
 have a vigilant attitude of alert 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.890
 to be able to detect with no machines 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.840
 which are used by children no no no 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.480
 we want our children to enter 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.820
 this kind of activities that then what 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.820
 It can harm them and their families
