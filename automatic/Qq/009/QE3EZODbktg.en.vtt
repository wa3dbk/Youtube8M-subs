of a part two if there is a part two but

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.660 
of a part two if there is a part two but
the<00:01:51.869> reason<00:01:52.140> what<00:01:52.229> makes<00:01:52.409> me<00:01:52.590> believe<00:01:52.770> against

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
the reason what makes me believe against

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.969 
the reason what makes me believe against
this<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.149> because<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.170> popularity<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.860> a

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
this is because of the popularity of a

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.030 
this is because of the popularity of a
comic<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.340> kill<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.990> popularity<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.680> comic<00:01:58.979> I

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
comic I kill the popularity of a comic I

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.700 
comic I kill the popularity of a comic I
kill<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.640> not<00:02:00.180> almost<00:02:00.390> non-existent<00:02:01.290> in<00:02:01.380> Japan

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
kill is not almost non-existent in Japan

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.499 
kill is not almost non-existent in Japan
let's<00:02:02.130> just<00:02:02.250> be<00:02:02.399> real<00:02:02.430> here<00:02:02.850> like<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.210> that's

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
let's just be real here like that that's

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.359 
let's just be real here like that that's
one<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.840> main<00:02:03.990> reasons<00:02:04.500> technically<00:02:05.100> why

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
one of the main reasons technically why

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.289 
one of the main reasons technically why
the<00:02:05.430> anime

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
the anime

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.389 
the anime
ended<00:02:07.049> up<00:02:07.140> like<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.530> was<00:02:07.560> even<00:02:08.039> though<00:02:08.129> it

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
ended up like it was even though it

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.430 
ended up like it was even though it
wasn't<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.849> full<00:02:09.090> reason<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.899> kind<00:02:10.349> of

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
wasn't the full reason it kind of

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.059 
wasn't the full reason it kind of
slightly<00:02:10.739> was<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:12.780> see<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.680> popularity

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
slightly was and to see the popularity

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.710 
slightly was and to see the popularity
the<00:02:14.340> longest<00:02:14.730> sales<00:02:14.879> for<00:02:15.030> instance<00:02:15.300> they<00:02:15.420> were

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
the longest sales for instance they were

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.660 
the longest sales for instance they were
non-existent<00:02:15.989> even<00:02:16.739> in<00:02:16.860> like<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.190> longest

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
non-existent even in like the longest

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.910 
non-existent even in like the longest
cells<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.300> this<00:02:18.390> year<00:02:18.660> a<00:02:18.900> comedy<00:02:19.440> guy<00:02:19.530> kill<00:02:19.769> is

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
cells of this year a comedy guy kill is

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.830 
cells of this year a comedy guy kill is
non-existent<00:02:20.550> on<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.849> even<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.209> anime<00:02:21.629> did

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
non-existent on it even the anime did

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.580 
non-existent on it even the anime did
not<00:02:21.959> boost<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.470> cell<00:02:22.739> so<00:02:23.160> I<00:02:23.519> think<00:02:24.510> mainly<00:02:25.200> the

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
not boost the cell so I think mainly the

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.170 
not boost the cell so I think mainly the
real<00:02:25.769> reason<00:02:26.129> why<00:02:26.250> coming<00:02:26.580> are<00:02:26.760> kill<00:02:26.940> most

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
real reason why coming are kill most

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.910 
real reason why coming are kill most
likely<00:02:27.540> is<00:02:27.599> ending<00:02:27.900> or<00:02:28.019> going<00:02:28.410> into<00:02:28.560> its<00:02:28.739> final

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
likely is ending or going into its final

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.759 
likely is ending or going into its final
orc<00:02:29.280> is<00:02:29.870> because<00:02:30.870> it's<00:02:31.140> not<00:02:31.290> selling<00:02:31.650> well

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
orc is because it's not selling well

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.380 
orc is because it's not selling well
it's<00:02:32.069> pretty<00:02:32.459> much<00:02:32.549> going<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.819> be<00:02:32.879> like<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.090> rush

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
it's pretty much going to be like a rush

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.839 
it's pretty much going to be like a rush
cancellation<00:02:34.080> ending<00:02:34.410> which<00:02:35.160> has<00:02:35.400> me<00:02:35.640> very

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
cancellation ending which has me very

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.660
