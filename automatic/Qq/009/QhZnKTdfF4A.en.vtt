00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
ages and you know I think one of the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.830 
ages and you know I think one of the
things<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.739> used<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.100> help<00:01:02.370> was

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
things that used to help was

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.020 
things that used to help was
radiofrequency<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:04.549> used<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.700> go<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.909> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
radiofrequency I used to go to the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.410 
radiofrequency I used to go to the
clinic

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
clinic

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.870 
clinic
you<00:01:06.659> know<00:01:06.780> once<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.530> month<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:08.040> get<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.280> done<00:01:08.640> and

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
you know once a month to get it done and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.090 
you know once a month to get it done and
then<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.090> bought<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.570> home<00:01:09.840> kit<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.680> do<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.950> myself

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
then I bought a home kit to do it myself

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.270 
then I bought a home kit to do it myself
I<00:01:11.700> think<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.299> really<00:01:12.510> helps<00:01:12.990> but<00:01:13.280> because

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
I think that really helps but because

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.490 
I think that really helps but because
what<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.760> does<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.930> know<00:01:16.080> promotes

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
what it does is it you know promotes

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.149 
what it does is it you know promotes
collagen<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.610> moves<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.119> skin<00:01:18.450> but<00:01:19.159> just

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
collagen and it moves the skin but just

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.330 
collagen and it moves the skin but just
too<00:01:20.310> lazy<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.820> do<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.659> anyway<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.340> actually

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
too lazy to do it so anyway I actually

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.149 
too lazy to do it so anyway I actually
kept<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.939> box<00:01:24.150> for<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.600> but<00:01:25.020> my<00:01:25.409> me<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.920> threw

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
kept the box for this but my me it threw

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:26.660 
kept the box for this but my me it threw
it<00:01:26.280> away

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670

night shake bottle well prior to use

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.670 
night shake bottle well prior to use
prime<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.090> applicator<00:01:48.570> by<00:01:48.810> spraying<00:01:49.290> three

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
prime the applicator by spraying three

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.219 
prime the applicator by spraying three
times<00:01:49.979> away<00:01:50.520> from<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.970> face<00:01:51.210> well<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:51.990> don't

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
times away from the face well I don't

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.039 
times away from the face well I don't
actually<00:01:52.380> do<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:53.630> checking<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.720> bottle

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
actually do that checking the bottle

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.929 
actually do that checking the bottle
again<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.829> between<00:01:56.219> each<00:01:56.520> spray<00:01:56.969> no<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:58.320> think

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
again and between each spray no I think

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.459 
again and between each spray no I think
the<00:01:59.939> very<00:02:00.240> first<00:02:00.600> time<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:00.990> do<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.200> you

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
the very first time you do it you

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.020 
the very first time you do it you
probably<00:02:01.710> need<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.159> prime<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.670> bottle

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
probably need to prime the bottle

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
probably need to prime the bottle
because<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.509> need<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.810> get

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
because you need to get

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.050 
because you need to get
the<00:02:05.450> product<00:02:06.450> into<00:02:07.230> you<00:02:07.620> know<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.920> nozzle<00:02:08.310> but

the product into you know the nozzle but

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.120 
the product into you know the nozzle but
subsequently<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.350> don't<00:02:10.619> think<00:02:10.860> there's<00:02:11.040> a

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
subsequently I don't think there's a

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.890 
subsequently I don't think there's a
need<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:11.880> oops

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
need to that oops

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.250 
need to that oops
well<00:02:13.860> I<00:02:13.890> what<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.280> do<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.580> basically<00:02:15.360> just<00:02:15.660> shake

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260

it really really really really well and

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.120 
it really really really really well and
then<00:02:19.080> spray<00:02:20.210> ticket<00:02:21.210> slightly<00:02:22.080> away<00:02:22.740> from<00:02:23.040> the

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
recommendation says to spray three lines

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.030 
recommendation says to spray three lines
on<00:02:28.920> each<00:02:29.490> side<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:30.090> face<00:02:30.330> but<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.470> one

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
on each side of the face but and one

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.520

line<00:02:32.280> across<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.790> forehead<00:02:33.200> but<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:34.230> found

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
line across the forehead but I found

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.590 
line across the forehead but I found
that<00:02:34.770> when<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:35.130> spray<00:02:35.700> three<00:02:36.000> lines<00:02:36.240> it<00:02:36.450> was<00:02:36.540> a

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
that when I spray three lines it was a

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.170 
that when I spray three lines it was a
little<00:02:36.930> bit<00:02:37.050> too<00:02:37.260> much<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.250> typically<00:02:38.880> just

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
little bit too much so I typically just

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.990 
little bit too much so I typically just
do<00:02:39.330> two<00:02:39.570> lines<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.140> then<00:02:40.490> massage<00:02:41.490> it<00:02:41.550> into

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
results I think I saw the same results

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.890 
results I think I saw the same results
after<00:03:02.100> about<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:03.180> week<00:03:04.050> or<00:03:04.500> so<00:03:04.830> now<00:03:05.780> what<00:03:06.780> it

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
after about a week or so now what it

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.940 
after about a week or so now what it
does<00:03:07.230> is<00:03:07.790> it<00:03:08.790> actually<00:03:09.470> diminishes<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.680> lines

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
does is it actually diminishes the lines

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.540 
does is it actually diminishes the lines
under<00:03:11.310> my<00:03:11.730> eyes<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.300> around<00:03:12.780> my<00:03:13.380> mouth<00:03:13.920> I

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.699

very quickly and very very well and as

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.490 
very quickly and very very well and as
you<00:04:02.280> can<00:04:02.430> see<00:04:02.580> that's<00:04:02.730> what<00:04:02.910> it<00:04:03.060> is<00:04:03.209> to<00:04:03.959> me<00:04:04.140> I
