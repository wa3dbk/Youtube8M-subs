never<00:00:28.650> really<00:00:29.010> go<00:00:29.160> all<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.519> way<00:00:29.550> up<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.849> using

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
never really go all the way up to using

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.920 
never really go all the way up to using
all<00:00:30.420> 34<00:00:31.170> gigabytes<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:32.099> but<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.340> definitely

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
all 34 gigabytes of it but I definitely

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.340 
all 34 gigabytes of it but I definitely
get<00:00:33.930> pretty<00:00:34.590> close<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.690> filling<00:00:36.690> up<00:00:36.870> each<00:00:37.050> card

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
get pretty close to filling up each card

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.860 
get pretty close to filling up each card
up<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.829> like<00:00:38.250> 3/4<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.270> for<00:00:39.420> some<00:00:39.540> reason<00:00:39.780> that

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
up to like 3/4 and for some reason that

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.930 
up to like 3/4 and for some reason that
I<00:00:40.020> don't<00:00:40.079> like<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.530> fill<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:41.070> card<00:00:41.460> all<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.850> way

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
I don't like to fill a card all the way

I don't like to fill a card all the way
up<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.180> top<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.660> just<00:00:43.309> can<00:00:44.309> say<00:00:44.430> if<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.610> lose

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
up to the top I just can say if I lose

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.760 
up to the top I just can say if I lose
all<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.570> data<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.170> card<00:00:46.440> because<00:00:46.739> I

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
all the data in that card because I

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.040 
all the data in that card because I
filled<00:00:47.039> up<00:00:47.160> too<00:00:47.370> much<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:48.270> just<00:00:48.570> gave<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.780> scared

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
filled up too much I just gave it scared

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.720 
filled up too much I just gave it scared
there's<00:00:49.200> probably<00:00:49.500> total<00:00:49.860> nonsense<00:00:50.190> you

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
there's probably total nonsense you

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.160 
there's probably total nonsense you
probably<00:00:51.000> are<00:00:51.120> absolutely<00:00:51.510> fine<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.809> fill

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
probably are absolutely fine to fill

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.100 
probably are absolutely fine to fill
card<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.890> grapes<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.850> fullness<00:00:54.780> all<00:00:55.020> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
card and grapes the fullness all the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.350 
card and grapes the fullness all the
time<00:00:55.289> but<00:00:55.469> for<00:00:55.680> me<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.399> always<00:00:57.000> leave<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.270> so

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
time but for me I always leave it so

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.029 
time but for me I always leave it so
there's<00:00:57.480> at<00:00:57.600> least<00:00:57.829> something<00:00:58.829> like<00:00:58.980> a

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
there's at least something like a

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.910 
there's at least something like a
hundred<00:00:59.430> pictures<00:00:59.699> or<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.480> go<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.109> also

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
hundred pictures or so to go and also

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
you don't ever want to be at the point

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.479 
you don't ever want to be at the point
where<00:01:03.300> you're<00:01:03.539> replacing<00:01:04.350> your<00:01:04.379> card<00:01:04.769> because

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
where you're replacing your card because

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.609 
where you're replacing your card because
