want you cut down the line out to make
it<00:01:32.289> a<00:01:32.319> little<00:01:32.469> bit<00:01:32.619> easier<00:01:32.709> to<00:01:32.979> space<00:01:33.219> is

00:01:33.449 --> 00:01:33.459 
it a little bit easier to space is

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:35.489 
it a little bit easier to space is
greater<00:01:33.850> there's<00:01:34.569> a<00:01:34.659> space<00:01:34.869> between<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.289> five

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:35.499 
greater there's a space between the five

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:38.309 
greater there's a space between the five
and<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:35.740> 50-meter<00:01:36.340> line<00:01:36.579> you've<00:01:37.389> got<00:01:37.539> seven

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:38.319 
and the 50-meter line you've got seven

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:40.139 
and the 50-meter line you've got seven
players<00:01:38.560> compressed<00:01:39.100> in<00:01:39.280> that<00:01:39.429> one<00:01:39.609> space<00:01:39.909> and

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
players compressed in that one space and

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.519 
players compressed in that one space and
makes<00:01:40.270> it<00:01:40.389> harder<00:01:40.719> makes<00:01:40.899> it<00:01:41.020> hard<00:01:41.170> to<00:01:41.319> win<00:01:41.439> the

00:01:41.519 --> 00:01:41.529 
makes it harder makes it hard to win the

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:43.349 
makes it harder makes it hard to win the
ball<00:01:41.709> we've<00:01:42.189> got<00:01:42.310> four<00:01:42.549> players<00:01:42.819> been<00:01:43.029> put<00:01:43.209> in

ball we've got four players been put in

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:45.539 
ball we've got four players been put in
that<00:01:43.389> space<00:01:43.779> a<00:01:44.109> lot<00:01:44.439> more<00:01:44.649> space<00:01:44.950> for<00:01:44.979> you<00:01:45.399> to

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
that space a lot more space for you to

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.699 
that space a lot more space for you to
hit<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:45.789> ball<00:01:45.969> so<00:01:46.240> bit<00:01:46.929> more<00:01:47.139> easier<00:01:47.409> to<00:01:47.560> win

00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:47.709 
hit the ball so bit more easier to win

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:48.770 
hit the ball so bit more easier to win
the<00:01:47.829> ball
