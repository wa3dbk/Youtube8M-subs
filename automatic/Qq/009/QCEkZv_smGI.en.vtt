trying to show you very quickly the

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.570 
trying to show you very quickly the

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.949 
crease having to wear these for a long
time<00:04:03.190> so<00:04:03.730> you<00:04:03.760> might<00:04:03.970> want<00:04:04.209> something<00:04:04.630> to<00:04:04.900> be
