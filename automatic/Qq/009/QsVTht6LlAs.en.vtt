 the piece is incredibly beautiful 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.540
 set the combat system 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.430

 mordor from x games game tivi 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.610
 why is this game really 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.910
 deserve your attention look 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.910
 Further 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.780
 unlike many other games by 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.640
 famous licensed developers from 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.650
 monolith did not become these standard by 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.780
 creating a story that was already mentioned 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.640
 film makers decided to go different 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.230
 by taking the universe as a basis 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.930
 great writer john ronald 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.930
 Tolkien and adding a pinch of your story 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.930
 and today they are bosch tka usd uah snow and 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.220
 half 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.960
 Of course the plot intersects with 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.820
 major works but still 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.100
 keeps the strips of self 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.140
 the narrative eventually comes out 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.480
 completely abstracted from the main 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.170
 plot of books and films creations having 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.270
 place to be 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.550
 This game would be good to advise everyone 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:06.010
 and all because you meet just such a miracle 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:07.840
 not so often so we are in 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.649
 huge open to explore the world with 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.899
 what to start 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.820
 yes, everything is simple we have a goal 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.620
 which you just need to kill or 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.959
 eliminate using any special 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.060
 the methods for it in turn are not that 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.100
 just make your way for it is necessary to pass 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.630
 through many enemies so that no one and 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.709
 I didn't suspect you 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.480
 you exist 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.310
 while traveling we may stumble 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.570
 on the tower above which is in the center 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.790
 anvil is located 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.590
 hitting it we automatically open 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.750
 new territory and point fast 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.489
 displace our map marked 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.989
 special active areas which 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.120
 are additional tasks 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.739
 doing them we get gold and 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.739
 necessary for pumping the runes 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.090
 so there he was 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.720
 our goals are generals orcs we 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.910
 must eliminate as you progress 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.130
 games they are displayed in a special window 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.750
 menu when we start the game their names are us 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.550
 unknown and the generals themselves 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.650
 presented in the form of anonymous dark 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.690
 silhouettes to reveal each of them 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.520
 we need a plot or 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.050
 follow these tips for the victim 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.880
 which we make tell all 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.920
 information of interest to us 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.050
 arches in middle earth behave quite 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.360
 chaotically we have many ways 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.160
 killing targets to attack directly or 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.930
 hiding distract each one when 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.470
 help a variety of auxiliary 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.270
 items 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.580
 set other wild animals on them 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:37.560
 trap or pass by 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:39.360
 trying not to create noise if 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.370
 go unnoticed failed the 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.860
 have to use the classic method 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.720
 fight directly the combat system to 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.640
 the word is quite beautifully made extremely 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.530
 strongly resembles a battle in a series of games 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.330
 batman pushing the attack button and 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.160
 counterattacks evade attacks and 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.290
 use learned abilities 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.180
 initially our hero is not capable of 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.750
 spectacular killings and ripping enemies on 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.370
 parts 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.620
 however as we progress 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.709
 we pump over thereby opening new 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.709
 opportunities 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.410
 leveling opens up additional slots 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.780
 for run which we use for 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.000
 improve your weapon data runes 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.890
 amenable to ordinary creatures by collecting 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.200
 enough we tweak 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.810
 sword under him as he will be the most 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.790
 convenient besides weapons melee with us 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.410
 there is a remote weapon which 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.660
 is a ghostly bow with 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.490
 the ability to slow down time of course 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.720
 the bow is pumped through the insert 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.720
 run as well as a sword 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.570
 aquarium 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.770
 honestly the system of finishing in this 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.599
 the game is something beautiful main character 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.910
 hacks bodies so cool that 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:02.919
 I want to watch it again and again 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.930
 opponents are really different from 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:06.580
 common enemies of other games i don't 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.770
 waiting until the character comes up and 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.479
 make a series of colorful tricks enemies 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.800
 really started to think began 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:14.380
 use a variety of weapons 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.210
 fight tactically for everything 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.639
 passage we will meet a variety of 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.539
 rivals there is a special feature 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:21.849
 pumping 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:24.009
 if the hero is suddenly killed the game will not say 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:26.080
 you start with a control point no one 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.909
 the arc that killed you will get a boost 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.889
 that means he will have more 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:32.789
 strong armor great health and 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:32.789
 enhanced damage 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:48.710
 maybe someone will seem somewhat 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.780
 sad plot in the game is delayed on 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.610
 second plan wandering around the face of ores and more 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.419
 passionate about exploration and epic 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.160
 battles 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.900
 it so happened that the plot is not so 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.180
 interesting than what happens 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.310
 around but looking at another plot 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.990
 video to learn more something new plot 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.990
 there is a desire to pass the game 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.150
 everything looks just gorgeous landscapes 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.520
 looks extremely cinematic 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.560
 the graphics are really amazing game 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.960
 allows you to plunge into the world of Middle-earth 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.120
 this is the most beautiful game of all that 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.070
 It came out of the universe and the professor 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.650
 generally one of the most beautiful fantasy games 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.750
 At the moment, of course, optimization 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.669
 pretty good game initially 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:35.770
 was directed to the next-gen console and 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:35.770
 so the old computer will not work 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:44.250
 summarize the middle of shadow of 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.900
 mordor great game 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.479
 which will be interesting to all who 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.889
 not indifferent to the product of Tolkien and 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:52.199
 who was never familiar with him 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:54.389
 creativity if you love good 

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:56.580

 graphics creates incredible sensations and 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:13.139
