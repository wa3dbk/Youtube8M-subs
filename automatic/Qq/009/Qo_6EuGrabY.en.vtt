I<00:00:10.230> don't<00:00:10.980> know<00:00:11.040> it<00:00:11.160> depends<00:00:11.519> how<00:00:11.820> hard<00:00:12.030> you

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
I don't know it depends how hard you

I don't know it depends how hard you
work<00:00:12.300> how<00:00:12.330> much<00:00:12.690> effort<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:12.990> put<00:00:13.049> in<00:00:13.259> when<00:00:13.440> you

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
work how much effort you put in when you

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.880 
work how much effort you put in when you
are<00:00:13.559> working<00:00:15.109> I<00:00:16.109> can't<00:00:16.410> really<00:00:16.529> give<00:00:16.740> you<00:00:16.770> a

are working I can't really give you a
yes<00:00:17.460> there's<00:00:18.270> no<00:00:18.420> distinction<00:00:18.840> in<00:00:19.080> that

question<00:00:19.560> between<00:00:19.680> how<00:00:20.039> many<00:00:20.220> hours<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.520> did

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
question between how many hours I did

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.130 
question between how many hours I did
spend<00:00:20.910> on<00:00:21.060> revision<00:00:21.449> per<00:00:21.570> week<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.900> how<00:00:21.990> many

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
spend on revision per week and how many

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.580 
spend on revision per week and how many
hours<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.439> should<00:00:22.500> have<00:00:22.710> done<00:00:23.930> there's<00:00:24.930> some

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
hours I should have done there's some

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.089 
hours I should have done there's some
people<00:00:25.740> who<00:00:26.039> always<00:00:26.220> work<00:00:26.460> far<00:00:26.820> too<00:00:27.029> much<00:00:28.099> or

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
people who always work far too much or

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.220 
people who always work far too much or
too<00:00:29.130> little<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.789> should<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.060> know<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:30.990> thing

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
too little and should you know you thing

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.450 
too little and should you know you thing
I<00:00:31.439> think<00:00:31.800> yeah<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.250> think<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.880> wouldn't<00:00:33.630> advise

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
I think yeah I think I wouldn't advise

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.620 
I think yeah I think I wouldn't advise
being<00:00:35.460> specific<00:00:36.059> on<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.239> number<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.510> hours

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
being specific on the number of hours

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.330 
being specific on the number of hours
it's<00:00:36.899> mainly<00:00:37.260> if<00:00:37.410> you're<00:00:37.559> feeling<00:00:38.190> productive

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
it's mainly if you're feeling productive

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.720 
it's mainly if you're feeling productive
and<00:00:39.110> that<00:00:40.110> could<00:00:40.260> be<00:00:40.379> short<00:00:40.710> intense<00:00:41.100> bursts

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
and that could be short intense bursts

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.450 
and that could be short intense bursts
or<00:00:41.960> longer<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.500> then<00:00:43.620> one<00:00:43.829> other<00:00:44.040> thing<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.280> do

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
or longer and then one other thing I do

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.119 
or longer and then one other thing I do
say<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.940> find<00:00:45.690> quite<00:00:45.870> useful<00:00:45.899> ism<00:00:46.559> if<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:46.950> have

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
say is find quite useful ism if you have

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.650 
say is find quite useful ism if you have
like<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.640> know<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.270> quite<00:00:48.450> good<00:00:48.570> for

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
like I know this is quite good for

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.119 
like I know this is quite good for
history<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.260> I'm<00:00:49.469> not<00:00:49.590> sure<00:00:49.710> about<00:00:49.800> science

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
history and I'm not sure about science

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.139 
history and I'm not sure about science
but<00:00:50.250> there's<00:00:50.399> probably<00:00:50.489> there's<00:00:50.820> lots<00:00:51.030> of

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
but there's probably there's lots of

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.000 
but there's probably there's lots of
popular<00:00:51.570> science<00:00:51.690> podcast<00:00:52.010> population

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
popular science podcast population

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.310 
popular science podcast population
podcast<00:00:53.370> stuff<00:00:53.520> like<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.850> um<00:00:54.420> they're<00:00:55.050> free

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
podcast stuff like that um they're free

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.350 
podcast stuff like that um they're free
and<00:00:55.829> if<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.129> just<00:00:56.280> get<00:00:56.460> one<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.850> solve

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
and if you just get one that you solve

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.880 
and if you just get one that you solve
quite<00:00:57.539> like<00:00:57.750> my<00:00:57.930> profile<00:00:58.320> one<00:00:58.500> called<00:00:58.710> Rex

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
quite like my profile one called Rex

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.670 
quite like my profile one called Rex
factor<00:00:59.370> which<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.760> quite<00:01:00.000> useful<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:01.530> it's

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
factor which is quite useful and it's

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.729 
factor which is quite useful and it's
quite<00:01:01.829> fun<00:01:02.329> so<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.359> just<00:01:03.719> put<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.409> on<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
quite fun so I just put that on in the

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.250 
quite fun so I just put that on in the
background<00:01:05.100> like<00:01:05.220> well<00:01:05.430> I'm<00:01:05.549> sort<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.260> making

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
background like well I'm sort of making

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.500 
background like well I'm sort of making
tea<00:01:07.650> or<00:01:07.860> something<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.430> it's<00:01:08.520> just<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.790> funny

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
tea or something and it's just so funny

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.660 
tea or something and it's just so funny
and<00:01:09.869> relaxing<00:01:10.380> also<00:01:10.830> just<00:01:11.220> sort<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.369> helps

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
and relaxing also just sort of helps

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.880 
and relaxing also just sort of helps
cement<00:01:11.909> some<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.500> basics<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.650> your<00:01:13.770> head

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
cement some of the basics in your head

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.109 
cement some of the basics in your head
yeah<00:01:14.640> there<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:14.939> definitely<00:01:15.659> coming<00:01:16.140> up<00:01:16.229> to

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
yeah there is definitely coming up to

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.730 
yeah there is definitely coming up to
digging<00:01:18.119> sounds<00:01:18.450> at<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.570> end<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.200> uni<00:01:19.500> but<00:01:19.680> I

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
digging sounds at the end of uni but I

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.830 
digging sounds at the end of uni but I
think<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.040> happens<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.549> any<00:01:21.270> sort<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.540> exams

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
think it happens in any sort of exams

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.570 
think it happens in any sort of exams
there's<00:01:22.080> kind<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.409> an<00:01:22.530> assumption<00:01:22.860> an

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
there's kind of an assumption an

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.490 
there's kind of an assumption an
unspoken<00:01:24.000> assumption<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.720> revision<00:01:25.200> must

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
unspoken assumption that revision must

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.039 
unspoken assumption that revision must
inherently<00:01:26.040> be<00:01:26.310> horrible<00:01:26.790> or<00:01:27.119> be<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.509> difficult

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
inherently be horrible or be a difficult

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.569 
inherently be horrible or be a difficult
thing<00:01:28.080> or<00:01:28.500> be<00:01:28.650> tiring<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.310> sort<00:01:29.520> of

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
thing or be tiring and that sort of

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.800 
thing or be tiring and that sort of
stuff<00:01:29.759> but<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.030> really<00:01:30.119> doesn't<00:01:30.360> have<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.720> be

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
stuff but it really doesn't have to be

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.249 
stuff but it really doesn't have to be
just<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.650> just<00:01:31.829> have<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.420> kind<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.540> have<00:01:33.600> have

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
just you just have to kind of have have

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.410 
just you just have to kind of have have
the<00:01:34.530> confidence<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:35.100> only<00:01:35.369> doing<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:36.030> certain

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
the confidence that only doing a certain

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.749 
the confidence that only doing a certain
amount<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.780> day<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.320> sleeping<00:01:38.310> like<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.640> may

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
amount a day and sleeping like you may

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.700 
amount a day and sleeping like you may
not<00:01:38.939> see<00:01:39.150> any<00:01:39.270> eating<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.780> exercising<00:01:40.409> lots

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
not see any eating and exercising lots

library all the time because they're not

valuable<00:01:52.350> do<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.740> think<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.100> tutorials<00:01:53.670> are

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
valuable do you think the tutorials are

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.609 
valuable do you think the tutorials are
with<00:01:53.970> relevant<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.630> your<00:01:54.780> advancement<00:01:55.350> in

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
with relevant to your advancement in

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.580 
with relevant to your advancement in
your<00:01:55.799> course<00:01:56.899> obviously<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.020> first<00:01:58.200> thing<00:01:58.350> to

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
your course obviously the first thing to

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.910 
your course obviously the first thing to
say<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:59.009> tutorials<00:01:59.909> aren't<00:02:00.920> like

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
say is that tutorials aren't like

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.870 
say is that tutorials aren't like
coursework<00:02:02.579> or<00:02:02.820> things<00:02:03.630> like<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.439> or<00:02:04.680> like

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
coursework or things like that or like

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.010 
coursework or things like that or like
periodic<00:02:05.880> assessments<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.600> you

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
periodic assessments that you

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.050 
periodic assessments that you
at<00:02:07.229> suburban<00:02:07.470> universities<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.520> they<00:02:08.880> don't

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
at suburban universities and they don't

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.260 
at suburban universities and they don't
count<00:02:09.270> towards<00:02:09.569> your<00:02:10.410> final<00:02:10.940> result<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.090> it's

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
count towards your final result so it's

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.620 
count towards your final result so it's
important<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.690> make<00:02:12.900> that<00:02:12.930> point<00:02:14.209> but<00:02:15.209> the

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
important to make that point but the

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.320 
important to make that point but the
tutorials<00:02:16.340> for<00:02:17.340> any<00:02:17.489> subject<00:02:17.819> really<00:02:18.150> are

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
tutorials for any subject really are

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.360 
tutorials for any subject really are
meant<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.569> be<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.989> discussion<00:02:19.770> about<00:02:20.130> the

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
meant to be a discussion about the

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.250 
meant to be a discussion about the
subject<00:02:20.790> matter<00:02:20.819> that<00:02:21.300> clarifies<00:02:21.840> what

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
subject matter that clarifies what

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.990 
subject matter that clarifies what
you've<00:02:22.500> been<00:02:22.680> doing<00:02:22.980> in<00:02:23.130> your<00:02:23.280> own<00:02:23.400> time<00:02:23.700> I

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
you've been doing in your own time I

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.670 
you've been doing in your own time I
think<00:02:24.510> that'd<00:02:24.599> be<00:02:24.690> fair<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.959> say<00:02:25.110> across<00:02:25.440> both

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
think that'd be fair to say across both

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.850 
think that'd be fair to say across both
the<00:02:25.739> humanities<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.730> sciences<00:02:27.739> so<00:02:28.739> it's

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
the humanities and the sciences so it's

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.759 
the humanities and the sciences so it's
an<00:02:28.920> opportunity<00:02:29.010> for<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.730> tutor<00:02:30.150> on<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.769> weekly

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
an opportunity for the tutor on a weekly

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.699 
an opportunity for the tutor on a weekly
or<00:02:32.040> more<00:02:32.910> often<00:02:33.090> basis<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:33.989> check<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.560> you've

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
or more often basis to check that you've

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.339 
or more often basis to check that you've
understood<00:02:34.890> what<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.550> learn<00:02:35.790> what<00:02:36.180> your<00:02:36.349> what

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
understood what you learn what your what

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.729 
understood what you learn what your what
you'd<00:02:37.500> be<00:02:37.620> reading<00:02:38.099> and<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:38.489> you<00:02:38.849> have<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.360> foe

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
you'd be reading and that you have a foe

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.570 
you'd be reading and that you have a foe
understanding<00:02:40.739> of<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.890> topic<00:02:41.190> well<00:02:41.400> then

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
understanding of the topic well then

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.630 
understanding of the topic well then
just<00:02:41.730> be<00:02:41.819> able<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.090> put<00:02:42.209> it<00:02:42.299> down<00:02:42.540> on<00:02:42.810> paper<00:02:43.640> if

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
just be able to put it down on paper if

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.289 
just be able to put it down on paper if
that<00:02:44.790> makes<00:02:45.000> sense

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
that makes sense

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.900 
that makes sense
and<00:02:45.630> so<00:02:45.870> I<00:02:45.980> find<00:02:46.980> incredibly<00:02:47.430> applewhite

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
and so I find incredibly applewhite

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.670 
and so I find incredibly applewhite
