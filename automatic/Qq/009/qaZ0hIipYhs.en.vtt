pretty much gives you a piece of ours
that<00:05:41.029> person<00:05:41.659> we<00:05:42.229> can<00:05:42.349> hear<00:05:42.499> a<00:05:42.529> little<00:05:42.679> bit<00:05:42.919> of

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979 
that person we can hear a little bit of

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:47.049 
that person we can hear a little bit of
the<00:05:43.249> trim<00:05:43.789> pieces<00:05:43.999> inside<00:05:44.449> vibrating<00:05:46.059> the

00:05:47.049 --> 00:05:47.059 
the trim pieces inside vibrating the

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:49.179 
the trim pieces inside vibrating the
steering<00:05:47.419> wheel<00:05:47.539> doesn't<00:05:47.659> shake<00:05:47.990> at<00:05:48.169> all<00:05:48.319> but

00:05:49.179 --> 00:05:49.189 
steering wheel doesn't shake at all but

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:52.329 
steering wheel doesn't shake at all but
the<00:05:49.279> tires<00:05:50.270> it<00:05:50.599> has<00:05:50.719> larger<00:05:51.229> after<00:05:51.379> after<00:05:52.159> more

00:05:52.329 --> 00:05:52.339 
the tires it has larger after after more

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:54.249 
the tires it has larger after after more
if<00:05:52.459> you<00:05:52.639> say<00:05:52.789> aftermarket<00:05:53.300> the<00:05:53.389> factory<00:05:53.779> AMG

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:54.259 
if you say aftermarket the factory AMG

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:56.690 
if you say aftermarket the factory AMG
rims<00:05:54.559> Mitchell<00:05:55.159> and

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
rims Mitchell and

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.549 
rims Mitchell and
but

00:05:58.549 --> 00:05:58.559 
but

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:01.519 
but
they're<00:05:59.099> not<00:05:59.369> original<00:05:59.729> to<00:06:00.119> spar<00:06:00.629> they<00:06:01.139> do

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:01.529 
they're not original to spar they do

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:03.930 
they're not original to spar they do
need<00:06:01.769> to<00:06:01.799> be<00:06:01.949> balanced

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
need to be balanced

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.190 
need to be balanced
so<00:06:04.150> there's<00:06:04.300> a<00:06:04.330> little<00:06:04.450> bit<00:06:04.570> of<00:06:04.690> a<00:06:04.780> vibration

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:05.200 
so there's a little bit of a vibration

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.060 
so there's a little bit of a vibration
between<00:06:05.590> like<00:06:06.010> 45

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.070
