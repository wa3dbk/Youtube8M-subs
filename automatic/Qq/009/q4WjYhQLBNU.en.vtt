over and against it it has to say no and
part<00:00:20.740> of<00:00:20.770> our<00:00:20.890> identity<00:00:20.920> is<00:00:21.400> that<00:00:21.700> I<00:00:21.730> means

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.030 
part of our identity is that I means

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.690 
part of our identity is that I means
like<00:00:22.150> building<00:00:22.600> the<00:00:22.660> walls<00:00:22.840> of<00:00:23.020> Jerusalem

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:23.700 
like building the walls of Jerusalem

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.190 
like building the walls of Jerusalem
when<00:00:24.700> Ezra<00:00:25.000> and<00:00:25.090> Nehemiah<00:00:25.150> come<00:00:25.750> back<00:00:25.930> from

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.200 
when Ezra and Nehemiah come back from

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.160 
when Ezra and Nehemiah come back from
exile<00:00:26.680> their<00:00:27.670> first<00:00:28.030> move<00:00:28.300> is<00:00:28.570> to<00:00:28.600> rebuild<00:00:29.050> the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
exile their first move is to rebuild the

Jerusalem<00:00:31.090> loses<00:00:31.450> its<00:00:31.600> identity<00:00:32.020> if

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
Jerusalem loses its identity if

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.950 
Jerusalem loses its identity if
Jerusalem<00:00:33.520> loses<00:00:33.879> identity<00:00:34.360> then<00:00:34.600> it<00:00:34.719> can't

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
Jerusalem loses identity then it can't

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.840 
Jerusalem loses identity then it can't
perform<00:00:35.260> its<00:00:35.590> mission<00:00:35.770> which<00:00:36.430> is<00:00:36.460> to<00:00:36.579> draw<00:00:36.789> the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
perform its mission which is to draw the

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.759 
perform its mission which is to draw the
whole<00:00:37.030> world<00:00:37.269> to<00:00:37.420> itself<00:00:37.749> so<00:00:38.469> there<00:00:38.649> is<00:00:38.679> your

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:38.769 
whole world to itself so there is your

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:41.040 
whole world to itself so there is your
paradox<00:00:39.249> you<00:00:39.609> know<00:00:39.730> the<00:00:40.269> more<00:00:40.449> Jerusalem<00:00:40.929> is

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
paradox you know the more Jerusalem is

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.819 
paradox you know the more Jerusalem is
itself<00:00:41.589> a<00:00:42.010> city<00:00:42.640> strongly<00:00:43.210> compact<00:00:43.829> they're

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
itself a city strongly compact they're

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:46.680 
itself a city strongly compact they're
all<00:00:45.070> the<00:00:45.280> tribes<00:00:45.579> go<00:00:45.820> up<00:00:45.999> see<00:00:46.390> there's<00:00:46.570> the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
all the tribes go up see there's the

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.079 
all the tribes go up see there's the
paradoxes<00:00:47.289> is<00:00:47.440> the<00:00:47.620> more<00:00:47.800> defined<00:00:48.370> Jerusalem

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.089 
paradoxes is the more defined Jerusalem

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:51.360 
paradoxes is the more defined Jerusalem
is<00:00:49.269> the<00:00:49.539> more<00:00:50.140> defended<00:00:50.739> it<00:00:50.829> is<00:00:50.949> if<00:00:51.100> you<00:00:51.190> want

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
is the more defended it is if you want

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.369 
is the more defended it is if you want
the<00:00:51.999> more<00:00:52.239> can<00:00:52.480> become<00:00:52.719> a<00:00:52.749> magnet<00:00:53.019> to<00:00:53.260> the

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
the more can become a magnet to the

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.619 
the more can become a magnet to the
world<00:00:53.589> and<00:00:53.920> that's<00:00:54.550> the<00:00:54.819> church<00:00:55.059> the<00:00:55.449> Church

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
world and that's the church the Church

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.069 
world and that's the church the Church
of<00:00:55.659> the<00:00:55.809> New<00:00:55.960> Jerusalem<00:00:57.780> we're<00:00:58.780> a<00:00:58.809> city

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
of the New Jerusalem we're a city

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.770 
of the New Jerusalem we're a city
strongly<00:00:59.679> compact<00:01:00.219> and<00:01:00.550> if<00:01:01.089> our<00:01:01.239> walls<00:01:01.539> get

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
strongly compact and if our walls get

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.100 
strongly compact and if our walls get
compromised<00:01:02.319> then<00:01:02.979> we<00:01:03.190> lose<00:01:03.370> our<00:01:03.609> ability<00:01:04.600> to

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
compromised then we lose our ability to

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.980 
compromised then we lose our ability to
to<00:01:05.770> attract<00:01:06.370> the<00:01:06.520> world<00:01:06.700> magnetically<00:01:07.330> if<00:01:07.810> we

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
to attract the world magnetically if we

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.990 
to attract the world magnetically if we
become<00:01:08.290> just<00:01:08.500> an<00:01:08.620> echo<00:01:08.829> of<00:01:08.979> the<00:01:09.130> wider<00:01:09.460> culture

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
become just an echo of the wider culture

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.359 
become just an echo of the wider culture
then<00:01:10.210> who's<00:01:10.420> going<00:01:10.540> to<00:01:10.630> be<00:01:10.689> interested<00:01:11.049> so<00:01:11.740> if

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
then who's going to be interested so if

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.670 
then who's going to be interested so if
you<00:01:12.490> want<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.790> conservative<00:01:13.420> defensive<00:01:14.229> over

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
you want the conservative defensive over

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.830 
you want the conservative defensive over
and<00:01:14.770> against<00:01:15.009> side<00:01:15.219> of<00:01:15.340> the<00:01:15.399> church<00:01:15.610> yeah<00:01:16.329> but

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
and against side of the church yeah but

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.499 
and against side of the church yeah but
it's<00:01:16.960> in<00:01:17.079> service<00:01:17.530> of<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:18.460> inclusive<00:01:19.060> side<00:01:19.420> of

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
it's in service of the inclusive side of

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.630 
it's in service of the inclusive side of
the<00:01:19.570> church<00:01:23.219> think<00:01:24.219> of<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:24.340> bernini

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
the church think of the bernini

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.219 
the church think of the bernini
colonnade<00:01:24.759> out<00:01:25.270> here<00:01:25.479> on<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:25.719> arms<00:01:26.049> the

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
colonnade out here on the arms the

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.230 
colonnade out here on the arms the
church<00:01:26.439> reaching<00:01:26.890> out<00:01:27.039> but<00:01:27.729> it's<00:01:27.850> reaching

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
church reaching out but it's reaching

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.020 
church reaching out but it's reaching
out<00:01:28.360> to<00:01:28.570> draw<00:01:28.840> you<00:01:28.899> into<00:01:29.380> something<00:01:29.799> very

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
out to draw you into something very

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.380 
out to draw you into something very
definite<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:33.100> people<00:01:33.399> slide<00:01:33.729> off<00:01:34.119> of<00:01:34.329> that

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
definite but people slide off of that

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.020 
definite but people slide off of that
paradox<00:01:34.810> very<00:01:35.020> easily<00:01:35.229> so<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.520> inclusive

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
paradox very easily so the inclusive

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.760 
paradox very easily so the inclusive
church<00:01:37.210> becomes<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.840> anything-goes<00:01:38.289> church

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
church becomes the anything-goes church

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.289 
church becomes the anything-goes church
you<00:01:38.979> know<00:01:39.009> we<00:01:39.549> don't<00:01:39.640> really<00:01:39.880> hold<00:01:40.000> anything

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
you know we don't really hold anything

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.859 
you know we don't really hold anything
definitive<00:01:41.079> or<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:42.340> clearly<00:01:43.210> defined<00:01:43.600> church

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
definitive or the clearly defined church

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.330 
definitive or the clearly defined church
becomes<00:01:44.259> definitely<00:01:44.649> the<00:01:44.740> belligerent

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
becomes definitely the belligerent

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.240 
becomes definitely the belligerent

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
church you know us-against-them and it's

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
think of it I mean use a secular
