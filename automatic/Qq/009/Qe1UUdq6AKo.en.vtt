I know one thing to catch more catfish

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:03.980 
I know one thing to catch more catfish
you're<00:00:02.310> far<00:00:02.580> and<00:00:02.820> away<00:00:02.909> better<00:00:03.360> off<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:03.780> fish

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
you're far and away better off the fish

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.260 
you're far and away better off the fish
directly<00:00:04.470> and<00:00:05.160> back<00:00:05.430> of<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:05.790> boat<00:00:05.970> let<00:00:06.240> me

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
directly and back of the boat let me

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.140 
directly and back of the boat let me
explain<00:00:06.720> why<00:00:07.049> you<00:00:07.919> flip<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.370> bait<00:00:08.610> out<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.120> I

explain why you flip the bait out and I

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.320 
explain why you flip the bait out and I
let<00:00:09.330> it<00:00:09.450> sink<00:00:09.690> down<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.110> bottom<00:00:11.120> like<00:00:12.120> this

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
let it sink down to the bottom like this

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.910 
let it sink down to the bottom like this
I'll<00:00:12.630> let<00:00:12.780> it<00:00:12.900> sink<00:00:13.139> down<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.469> bottom

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
I'll let it sink down to the bottom

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.790 
I'll let it sink down to the bottom
right<00:00:13.950> about<00:00:14.400> there<00:00:15.049> but<00:00:16.049> what<00:00:16.260> I'm<00:00:16.379> gonna<00:00:16.500> do

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
right about there but what I'm gonna do

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.460 
right about there but what I'm gonna do
is<00:00:17.789> actually<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:18.600> reel<00:00:18.960> up<00:00:19.670> the<00:00:20.670> snell<00:00:21.470> really

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
is actually is reel up the snell really

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.429 
is actually is reel up the snell really
tight<00:00:23.210> to<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.359> sinker<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.900> sinker<00:00:25.320> is

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
tight to the sinker and the sinker is

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.950 
tight to the sinker and the sinker is
pinned<00:00:25.769> on<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.010> bottom<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.880> then<00:00:27.570> what<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:27.810> do

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
pinned on the bottom and then what I do

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.230 
pinned on the bottom and then what I do
is<00:00:28.380> actually<00:00:28.680> is<00:00:29.039> just<00:00:29.070> back<00:00:29.550> off<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.880> little

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
is actually is just back off a little

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.730 
is actually is just back off a little
bit<00:00:30.449> in<00:00:30.660> what<00:00:30.840> that's<00:00:31.050> going<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.320> cause<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.710> a

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
bit in what that's going to cause is a

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.520 
bit in what that's going to cause is a
little<00:00:32.099> bit<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.489> bow<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:32.969> my<00:00:33.000> line<00:00:33.570> what

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
little bit of a bow in my line what

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.200 
little bit of a bow in my line what
happens<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.160> lot<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.489> times<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.790> catfish

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
happens is a lot of times the catfish

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.090 
happens is a lot of times the catfish
will<00:00:36.360> come<00:00:36.540> up<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.870> pick<00:00:37.110> up<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.469> bait<00:00:37.770> in

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
will come up and pick up the bait in

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.760 
will come up and pick up the bait in
that<00:00:38.670> little<00:00:39.300> bow<00:00:39.510> in<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.840> line<00:00:39.870> will<00:00:40.320> really

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
that little bow in the line will really

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.770 
that little bow in the line will really
dictate<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.760> have<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> strike<00:00:42.360> like<00:00:42.570> right

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
dictate that I have a strike like right

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.209 
dictate that I have a strike like right
there<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.050> can<00:00:43.170> see<00:00:43.200> where<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.649> fish<00:00:43.800> hit<00:00:44.070> it

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
there you can see where the fish hit it

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.010 
there you can see where the fish hit it
but<00:00:44.670> what<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.000> fish<00:00:45.239> don't<00:00:45.750> do<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.230> feel<00:00:46.620> any

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
but what the fish don't do is feel any

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.720 
but what the fish don't do is feel any
changes<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.469> weight<00:00:49.800> -<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.460> seems<00:00:50.610> like

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
changes of weight - so it seems like

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.189 
changes of weight - so it seems like
catfish<00:00:51.180> are<00:00:51.360> real<00:00:51.510> sensitive<00:00:52.020> that

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
catfish are real sensitive that

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.869 
catfish are real sensitive that
particularly<00:00:52.680> channel<00:00:53.219> catfishing<00:00:53.760> they

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
particularly channel catfishing they

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.000 
particularly channel catfishing they
pick<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.090> up<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.360> they<00:00:54.480> feel<00:00:54.690> erratic<00:00:55.289> drag<00:00:55.680> on

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
pick it up and they feel erratic drag on

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.889 
pick it up and they feel erratic drag on
the<00:00:56.520> bait<00:00:56.730> they'll<00:00:56.940> spit<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.329> out<00:00:57.449> right<00:00:57.750> away

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
the bait they'll spit it out right away

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.270 
the bait they'll spit it out right away
so<00:00:58.829> what<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.760> it's<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.059> real<00:01:00.469> critical<00:01:01.469> that

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
so what it is it's a real critical that

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.979 
so what it is it's a real critical that
you<00:01:02.460> do<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.850> soon

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
you do that soon

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.950 
you do that soon
pretty<00:01:04.769> impressive<00:01:05.159> oh<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:06.090> just<00:01:06.360> missed<00:01:06.810> one

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
pretty impressive oh I just missed one

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.320 
pretty impressive oh I just missed one
can<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.920> see<00:01:08.159> what<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.310> mean<00:01:08.520> it's<00:01:08.760> really<00:01:08.970> dead

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
can you see what I mean it's really dead

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.140 
can you see what I mean it's really dead
that<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.930> art<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.470> it's<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.100> little<00:01:11.400> thing

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.850 
that is the art of it's a little thing
about<00:01:12.299> catfishing<00:01:13.080> but<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.229> tell<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.619> one

Bulldogs and the biggest thing is you
get<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.510> many<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.840> these<00:01:39.960> different

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
get in so many of these different

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.240 
get in so many of these different
systems<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.979> know<00:01:41.100> rivers<00:01:41.790> are<00:01:42.110> real

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
systems you know rivers are real

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.050 
systems you know rivers are real
interesting<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.460> fact<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.759> they're

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
interesting in the fact that they're

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.330 
interesting in the fact that they're
tremendously<00:01:45.900> fertile<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.830> carrying

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
tremendously fertile the carrying

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.690 
tremendously fertile the carrying
capacity<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.210> river<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.990> know<00:01:49.080> per<00:01:49.800> acre<00:01:50.100> is

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
capacity of a river you know per acre is

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.999 
capacity of a river you know per acre is
far<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.270> away<00:01:51.360> more<00:01:51.720> than<00:01:51.960> in<00:01:52.110> most<00:01:52.290> lakes<00:01:52.710> are

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
far and away more than in most lakes are

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.149 
far and away more than in most lakes are
off<00:01:53.360> reservoirs<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.440> you<00:01:55.710> know<00:01:55.800> you<00:01:55.860> have

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
off reservoirs so the you know you have

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.550 
off reservoirs so the you know you have
a<00:01:56.190> lot<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.729> Bishop<00:01:57.270> thousands<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.259> fish<00:01:58.409> you

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
a lot of Bishop thousands of fish you

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.410 
a lot of Bishop thousands of fish you
know<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:58.950> know<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.190> hearing<00:01:59.520> capacity<00:01:59.700> to

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
know you know the hearing capacity to

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.290 
know you know the hearing capacity to
slope<00:02:00.720> above<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:02.070> beyond<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.640> fertility<00:02:03.270> of

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
slope above and beyond the fertility of
