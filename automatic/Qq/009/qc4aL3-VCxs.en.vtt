00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello everyone today we get 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.970
 found for a new video 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.309
 so I'm with the cartridge of my 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.870
 sister so it's safe I'm going 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.049
 show you what's really going on 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.490
 with with pony landais the photo booth 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.490
 so we're right now 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.410
 I am in front of the photo booth I 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.180
 will show you what's going on 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.970
 you take the little room that you 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.059
 used to photograph 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.829
 so you do ok you'll see that 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.480
 well he's fighting we're not going in their 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.269
 trade finally it's not going to do like 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:51.589
 read the run makes it all the same 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:54.230
 thing so I know I had said in my 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.010
 last video that bah could have 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.670
 life etc 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.799
 but in fact I actually got it wrong 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.559
 because I did the test and of which we 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:07.040
 can not have the city 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:10.430
 so here is it just happens that 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:14.360
 slab you're just that would be a beautiful 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.820
 micron lob fatten you're just 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.100
 there we stick so that's what I 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.810
 explained in the description we are at 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.970
 foot of the stairs of the shopping street 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.579
 and we have a man all black 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.970
 or then no we can not see the 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:31.940
 city ​​we did not get hacked all that except 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:36.340
 that I saw that when you type pony 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.790
 moors on them on the searches of the 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.150
 relaxing lounge 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.409
 see that there are several cities I do not 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.520
 do not know if the person was created 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.500
 several cities or where 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.310
 people attacked but I do not know 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.350
 not how they did to be 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.600
 acquired since the photo booth only gives 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.760
 nothing you have stayed there 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.159
 during all the time it's you quit 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:59.750
 not so you can not prefer minimum 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.479
 but you can not for example can 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.220
 back all that moves and here you are 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.780
 comes from the game is to move there I arrive 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.590
 not here it's to support that too 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:16.040
 not working so nothing happens so 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:19.069
 do not be afraid so that's all 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.290
 for the truth about skin nor I had 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.950
 was scared the first time I did 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:32.599
 that's there the test the photo booth so if 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:34.130
 you turn here and they tend 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.050
 you summarize you always have your 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.640
 city ​​so I prove it to you 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.620
 for not that you 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:45.290
 I would have loved to have 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:52.100
 just plan the party flowers 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:54.370
 this is I still have my game so he goes 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.380
 nothing to do without special 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.570
 I will always have massa town 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:05.380
 worry it does not have an impact on 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:08.450
 your ds the most and here you are 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.489
 so I always finally had that 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.370
 this is the example can very well see that 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:16.610
 it's not paul nylon in it's 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:21.140

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.790
 inhabitants this is proven everything and this 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.680
 level there is no more and no 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.790
 dangerous until she is very weird 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.790
