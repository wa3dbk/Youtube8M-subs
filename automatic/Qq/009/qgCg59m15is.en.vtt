00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 good morning everyone today I am going to teach you 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.700
 to make a dessert that is very easy 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.610
 although it seems very complicated but it is 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.340
 easy look what we are going to do 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.120
 egg custard is worth the first thing 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.439
 we have to have are 5 eggs 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.600
 liter of milk 250 grams of sugar 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:23.730
 Vanilla essence and sugar for 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.269
 prepare the candy and the molds to fix 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.010
 it takes almost nothing is very easy 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.830
 the essence of vanilla replaces the 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.030
 vanilla pod the then you do not have 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.520
 to be heating the milk and 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.290
 simply it has done with cold milk 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.059
 therefore it is less work yet since 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.770
 my recipe are easy 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.809
 this is the most difficult one that will be 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.809
 is going to be making the candy that either 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.520
 special very difficult but it takes longer 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.320
 because first we throw a little and what 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.630
 we have to make it go roasting and 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.030
 let it go undoing 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.400
 and as it is falling apart then we will go 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.010
 doing more for that now I'm going to cut 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.460
 a little bit because this takes more time 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.460
 but it is very easy 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.409
 you see it is already undoing then 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.880
 it is falling apart we have to go 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.369
 adding but we have to wait for 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.310
 we are a little more undone because it is 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.890
 the area of ​​why if we let him 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.690
 Burn you bitter candy then 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.090
 see now been undone because you 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.640
 we add another little bit more and the same 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.409
 it is stirring and it is doing so 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.350
 continuously until we have the 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.030
 made candy you do not have to leave it 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.689
 a lot of time because if it did not burn 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.670
 then as long as you see that it is 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.290
 more or less like that we add a little more 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.680
 well until you have the amount that 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.680
 you want 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.820
 You see I have almost all the candy 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.860
 done I think that with this will give me 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.470
 for my molds because as you throw 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.979
 a little bit to face them then 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.610
 he tried it before is to prepare it for 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.610
 throw it into the mold 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.659
 so I leave it here and I'll go 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.659
 throwing 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:10.220
 a little bit 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:13.060
 you see a little and now and again 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.060
 another little 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.170
 ah 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.000
 well until we finish with everything like that 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.440
 that now I'm going to cut you see for example 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.390
 I only leave it in the end you 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.410
 you want you can give him value for all 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:34.370
 mold and now let's go with the flan 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:37.240
 very easy and very easy to look at we throw 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.240
 the 5 kos here 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.159
 [Music] 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.590
 this recipe super easy really 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.560
 and how are we going to use the essence 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.150
 of vanilla as the easiest base yet 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.990
 you see I already have five eggs then with 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.570
 the rod crush the yolks you see 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.480
 and you just have to move your eyes no no 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.680
 a lot and now you see is already a little 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.490
 moved then now we will go 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.680
 adding sugar 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:13.340
 while we move we do not have to debate 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.680
 but move that is different because if 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.810
 we beat 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.270
 they are going to create many holes and 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.550
 our flan 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.230
 If you want, you like them with little holes 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.780
 See if you do not like them with holes 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.780
 so just move it beat 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.119
 [Music] 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:38.440
 you see how easy it is and now we take it 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.690
 we throw the essence of vanilla gaming in 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.950
 the milk as I said you do not need 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.860
 heat it because it's vanilla essence 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.100
 you do not have to be 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.370
 preparing 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.110
 then the same thing we're going 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.950
 adding little by little while 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.950
 we are stirring 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.430
 do not worry about those things that are 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.770
 they are left from the egg because now we have it 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.100
 to strain before throwing it to our 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.100
 molds 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:16.380
 very easy secret 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.930
 with new day you would make a liter of milk 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.209
 and there is a bigger can then you see 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.950
 this just has to be moved a little 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.810
 and now what I'm going to do is leave 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.810
 because I'm going to look for a colander and we 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.580
 we're going to be focusing on this while 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.740
 as you see what we are doing is 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.880
 strain it so no man if you want 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.040
 you also do not have it because 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.350
 valerio I fly it because look you see those 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.060
 little pieces of egg because those little bits of 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.520
 egg would stay in your plan 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.960
 then as I do not want them then 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.560
 circulating because I want the plan 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.560
 be soft 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.070
 and this this the time until it has 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.450
 strained is not Italian it takes between 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.490
 four minutes what happens I'm going to 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.590
 cut because I'm not going to make a video of 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.690
 one hour 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.620
 well now what we have to do is 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.620
 fill them flaneras 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.240
 this easy, that's why it's easy, 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.770
 I'm going to record everything because we've already 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.750
 strained and I'm going to fill it 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.529
 You see we have already filled them now 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.169
 what we do is place it 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:18.429
 we put it in but we still have not 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.129
 finished because what we have to 

00:05:18.429 --> 00:05:22.749
 catch is a jug of hot water if 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:24.959
 it is possible also you could garcia vale 

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:28.569
 but it's already hot so it's not too late 

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:30.219
 and fill our tray if you go with 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:32.499
 the tray filled with water that also 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:35.939
 can but you can fall then what 

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:35.939
 it's better that you throw them like this 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.910
 you see 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.810
 I'm going to take a little more water 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.669
 because I'm missing a little more 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.620
 since it has to be more or less to the 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:53.760
 half of our mold flank but 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.760
 from the height of our flan 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:08.260
 and this already once I'm where 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:11.060
 we want I have put 180 degrees worth 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:14.690
 because cooking is done a little bit 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.710
 slower and gets better does not boil the 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.290
 all 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.689
 Then what I do, you see, 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:24.599
 then I put it 

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:26.219
 and we close it and this is already left 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:28.529
 cook and I'll show you when I'm 

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:30.989
 cooked the way to know that is 

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:33.899
 cooked with a sponge cake with a stick 

00:06:30.989 --> 00:06:35.909
 you put it if it comes out wet is not 

00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:37.319
 cooked if you see that only the 

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:39.989
 candy because candy if you stay 

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:41.260
 melted it would be cooked and then what 

00:06:39.989 --> 00:06:44.710
 I teach 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:46.330
 well this is a recipe for the easy ones 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.220
 then there are others that you can take 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:51.820
 condensed milk that is also very 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:53.800
 rich and here it's called egg custard in 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:56.440
 our country in Peru I think it's called 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.240
 roasted milk for you to know is what 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.310
 same if you do not want that to think layer 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.650
 tanned the only thing he has to do 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.390
 It is cover with foil not 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.280
 they will lodge turned and we lowered a little 

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:08.260
 the fire if you like advertised because to 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:12.280
 I like tanned we leave it such 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:14.200
 what and now then in the end I will teach you 

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:18.370
 but I want to remember that if you share 

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:20.740

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:23.260
 then I would have more time to 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.880
 dedicate me to this not like now that I have 

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.410
