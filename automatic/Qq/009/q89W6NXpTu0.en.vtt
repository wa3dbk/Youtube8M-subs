00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
and slider can take a bit of effort this

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.380 
and slider can take a bit of effort this

through<00:02:03.790> its<00:02:03.910> guide<00:02:04.120> here<00:02:04.420> and<00:02:05.250> then<00:02:06.250> it

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
through its guide here and then it

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.090 
through its guide here and then it
should<00:02:07.530> have<00:02:08.530> worked

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
should have worked

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:19.770 
should have worked
well<00:02:09.300> let's<00:02:10.300> find<00:02:10.570> out<00:02:10.750> if<00:02:10.869> it's<00:02:11.020> worked<00:02:18.780> what

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
well let's find out if it's worked what

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.490 
well let's find out if it's worked what
we'll<00:02:19.930> do<00:02:20.050> is<00:02:20.140> we'll<00:02:20.260> close<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.680> door<00:02:22.500> watch
