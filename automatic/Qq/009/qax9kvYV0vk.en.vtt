00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.119
 but if we are in a very nice text 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:17.039
 which is called flows hd reported by 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:19.950
 duster today of and good is already compatible 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.919
 with this point 11 as you can see here is 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.419
 hd but good and you will know as typical 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:26.550
 problem that has sex night of 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:27.989
 some blocks of flowers and so on like 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.270
 of 600 videos lately that are 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:31.710
 going up but see this it looks amazing 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.800
 the facts blocks 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.140
 but quite this at hours and quite and 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.430
 maximum to block story 29 because more than 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.860
 nothing the minerals here are the 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.870
 woods everything looks a lot like 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.440
 block story look here is the birch 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.760
 with his book always and here 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.260
 slowly see 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.000
 the truth that I liked so much because 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.609
 aside the sources are gray then 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.070
 they do not interfere so much on the screen and 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:58.719
 up where the tablet is sent and the 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.280
 will 10 and well we also have the 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:01.899
 selection as we select an object 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.989
 it looks like a little green arrow above it 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.940
 which looks very father and a screen 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.970
 It is great to incite the chat menu 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:13.000
 different objects are different the 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.590
 majority nothing more than if there are certain 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.860
 normal books the title is wanted as 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.350
 for example on the road you will see in your hand 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.450
 the swords are not hd but no longer just me 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.909
 I discussed bombings and we have here the post 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.679
 sun that here is more different from what 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.350
 what is the normal grass we are going to change 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:32.310
 the first person 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.890
 so that they appreciate it well it looks more 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.330
 detailed and here we have what they are 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.659
 minerals here I mean that 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.299
 improved it absorbs you look at this 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.869
 see how it looks, everything is incredible 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:49.000
 true and this is identical to the block of 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.509
 emerald of what I could swear what is not 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.710
 I know but well let's continue because 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.600
 all blocks do not have any bug 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.390
 more than as the basic ones that then 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.549
 it is not so much that it is not so much in the hands 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.690
 of the carriers but because as they 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.430
 said is minecraft thing but now 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.630
 it's enjoyable I told you in everything 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.510
 from the sections you want are 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.990
 perfectly usable the book of the fed 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:14.240
 unless you live instead of birch 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:17.230
 but even then that the paintings that 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.970
 they perform super hb 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.769
 and I love deep ads it looks very 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.799
 professional around here 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:29.469

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.719
 stones like that the joints and the straw looks 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:34.959
 brightness of our glow are to pass 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:36.280
 to be tunstall there is up the straw but 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.400
 we are not going to see here what is the 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.239
 see this, it looks great 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.239
 mushrooms 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:52.620
 the turn of seeing me in the eyes does not have 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.750
 eyes to the mother was left with the eyes has 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.300
 like scissors in places too 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.300
 parents more impact on blacks and here 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.240
 we have to see the sponge and here yes 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.090
 It looks more spongy and we have lava here 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.740
 this looks like orange soda here 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.030
 we have bats that are very 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:14.670
 linear view their real facets and for 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.680
 here those who have books in lasexta hd 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.409
 normal from minecraft right now 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.359
 lenderman of the ribs covers the face 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:25.100
 but the cycle of this you can go to 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:27.050
 escape but do not install brother 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.870

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.780
 super macabre see it or the detail in 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.380
 his ribs are amazing we have by 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.620

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.290
 ships looks very strange 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.760
 but like watering beta 1 in case 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.710
 the update is saying it has 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.810
 its short stones the bookstores 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:54.150
 villagers and their strange faces now 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.920
 the chickens are for the cream the 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.090
 little cows 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:03.450

 fuck castÃ¡n the champions that do not have 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.410
 mushrooms because I think it's beta 1 or the 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.790
 texture does not mark but the texture of 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.670

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.780

 are the sheep that go up too 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.729
 Realistically, I am seriously disturbed by 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.309
 realism these ears 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:36.070
 which are the most realistic in this in 

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:39.960
 those things I do not know 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:43.820
 they wait a little control of the venous flight 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.960
 I get too close and it looks so hd 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.960

 and see the face near venice 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.430
 I do not know I think this is more than 64 bits 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.729
 the sheep I'm sure the others if you 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.729
 come 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.940
 if you notice beloved pixels and notice the 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:12.240
 others and they are 64 the sheep does not look like 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:15.270
 of 128 the sheep looks very very hd is it 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.990
 its characteristic is disturbing since 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.930
 here 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:23.850

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:25.590

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.070
 the flowers with their normal books because 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.060
 it's a chile texture of the lianas 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.639
 stairs the cactus 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.620
 and now that we have the doors that 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:40.310
 They have very modern 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:42.470
 and the furnaces in fact all this all 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.570
 Matter reminds me of santa blog story 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.130

 action I speak actor and it's a game that 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:53.820

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:56.550
 minecraft but with super hd texture 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.960

 the motorcycle generator looks very good 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:15.960
 we have all the desire 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:18.570
