00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
which is an icon it'll do a quick

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.050 
which is an icon it'll do a quick
self-test<00:00:53.970> and<00:00:54.970> it<00:00:55.540> will<00:00:55.690> say<00:00:55.960> it<00:00:56.830> will<00:00:57.060> that

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.060 
self-test and it will say it will that

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.080 
self-test and it will say it will that
will<00:00:58.240> check<00:00:58.510> to<00:00:58.540> see<00:00:58.720> if<00:00:58.870> it's<00:00:59.140> able<00:00:59.290> to<00:00:59.470> learn

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
will check to see if it's able to learn

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.960 
will check to see if it's able to learn
I<00:01:01.150> don't<00:01:01.960> know<00:01:02.080> offhand<00:01:02.290> I<00:01:02.680> think<00:01:02.860> it's<00:01:03.040> like

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
I don't know offhand I think it's like

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.380 
I don't know offhand I think it's like
52<00:01:04.600> is<00:01:04.960> the<00:01:05.170> guide<00:01:05.379> number<00:01:05.590> I've<00:01:06.580> asked<00:01:06.790> you<00:01:06.970> 24

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
52 is the guide number I've asked you 24

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.249 
52 is the guide number I've asked you 24
but<00:01:07.810> I'm<00:01:08.020> probably<00:01:08.229> wrong<00:01:09.450> alright<00:01:10.450> now<00:01:10.960> it

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
but I'm probably wrong alright now it

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.020 
but I'm probably wrong alright now it
tells<00:01:11.500> you<00:01:11.590> just<00:01:11.649> you<00:01:12.070> then<00:01:12.280> set<00:01:12.609> your<00:01:12.729> Flash

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
tells you just you then set your Flash

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.789 
tells you just you then set your Flash
to<00:01:13.270> manual<00:01:13.659> power<00:01:14.219> and<00:01:15.219> you'll<00:01:15.969> set<00:01:16.270> it<00:01:16.420> to

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
to manual power and you'll set it to

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.529 
to manual power and you'll set it to
one-half<00:01:17.799> power<00:01:18.100> which<00:01:18.490> I<00:01:18.640> just<00:01:18.850> did<00:01:19.119> you'll

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:19.539 
one-half power which I just did you'll

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:31.950 
one-half power which I just did you'll
hit<00:01:19.659> OK<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:23.439> will<00:01:23.499> go<00:01:23.649> through<00:01:23.859> some<00:01:24.039> testing

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.630 

the<00:01:32.080> one<00:01:32.290> thing<00:01:32.470> about<00:01:32.530> testing<00:01:33.010> is<00:01:33.340> you<00:01:33.490> need

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
the one thing about testing is you need

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.970 
the one thing about testing is you need
to<00:01:33.670> make<00:01:33.790> sure<00:01:33.910> to<00:01:34.270> have<00:01:34.300> fresh<00:01:34.750> batteries<00:01:34.990> if

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
to make sure to have fresh batteries if

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.770 
to make sure to have fresh batteries if
you<00:01:36.070> do<00:01:36.190> not<00:01:36.310> have<00:01:36.520> fresh<00:01:36.760> batteries<00:01:37.000> you're

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
you do not have fresh batteries you're

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.380 
you do not have fresh batteries you're
gonna<00:01:37.900> end<00:01:38.170> up<00:01:38.380> failing<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.520> test<00:01:39.550> because<00:01:40.240> it

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
gonna end up failing the test because it

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.950 
gonna end up failing the test because it
needs<00:01:40.600> to<00:01:40.750> be<00:01:41.710> able<00:01:41.860> to<00:01:41.980> recycle<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:43.540> now<00:01:43.720> says

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
needs to be able to recycle it now says

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.170 
needs to be able to recycle it now says
go<00:01:44.140> to<00:01:44.170> 1/4<00:01:44.680> power<00:01:44.920> so<00:01:45.160> we'll<00:01:45.280> go<00:01:45.400> to<00:01:45.490> 1/4<00:01:45.940> power

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
go to 1/4 power so we'll go to 1/4 power

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:52.290 
go to 1/4 power so we'll go to 1/4 power
let<00:01:47.170> it<00:01:47.290> go<00:01:49.830> you'll<00:01:50.830> need<00:01:51.010> to<00:01:51.130> be<00:01:51.250> about<00:01:51.490> they

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
let it go you'll need to be about they

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.450 
let it go you'll need to be about they
say<00:01:52.510> 1<00:01:52.750> meter<00:01:53.020> which<00:01:53.320> is<00:01:53.350> about<00:01:53.500> 3<00:01:54.100> feet<00:01:54.310> away

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
say 1 meter which is about 3 feet away

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.450 
say 1 meter which is about 3 feet away
from<00:01:54.580> a<00:01:54.820> white<00:01:55.030> surface<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:57.100> we're<00:01:57.280> then

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
from a white surface and we're then

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:09.479 
from a white surface and we're then
going<00:01:57.640> to<00:01:57.760> set<00:01:58.030> it<00:01:58.300> at<00:01:58.619> one<00:01:59.619> eight<00:01:59.740> bar<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:08.489> now

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
going to set it at one eight bar and now

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:19.710 
going to set it at one eight bar and now
1/16<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:17.650> since<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.430> flash<00:02:18.670> is<00:02:19.060> not<00:02:19.120> doesn't

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
1/16 and since the flash is not doesn't

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.770 
1/16 and since the flash is not doesn't
go<00:02:19.959> past<00:02:20.230> 1/16<00:02:20.920> we're<00:02:21.160> gonna<00:02:21.250> do<00:02:21.430> skip<00:02:21.760> on<00:02:21.910> 1/32

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
go past 1/16 we're gonna do skip on 1/32

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.160 
go past 1/16 we're gonna do skip on 1/32
skip<00:02:23.590> on<00:02:23.739> one<00:02:23.950> 64th<00:02:25.020> skip<00:02:26.020> on<00:02:26.170> one<00:02:26.350> 1:28<00:02:27.070> and

skip on one 64th skip on one 1:28 and
we're<00:02:29.170> gonna<00:02:29.260> switch<00:02:29.530> it<00:02:29.560> back<00:02:29.770> to<00:02:29.950> TTL<00:02:30.280> mode

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
we're gonna switch it back to TTL mode

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.070 
we're gonna switch it back to TTL mode

the front of the the trigger that is

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.430 
the front of the the trigger that is
used<00:02:55.989> to<00:02:56.790> gauge<00:02:57.790> flashes<00:02:58.450> so<00:02:58.750> it's<00:02:58.930> using<00:02:59.290> it

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
used to gauge flashes so it's using it

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.550 
used to gauge flashes so it's using it
to<00:02:59.620> gauge<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:01.540> amount<00:03:01.630> of<00:03:01.870> power<00:03:02.049> that<00:03:02.230> it

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
to gauge the amount of power that it

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.430 
to gauge the amount of power that it
needs<00:03:02.769> and<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:04.150> output<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:04.989> to<00:03:05.260> make

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
needs and the the output and to make

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.570 
needs and the the output and to make
sure<00:03:05.620> that<00:03:05.830> it's<00:03:06.010> got<00:03:06.160> all<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.400> ratios

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
sure that it's got all the ratios

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.660 
sure that it's got all the ratios
correctly<00:03:07.390> it<00:03:08.320> will<00:03:08.440> cycle<00:03:08.739> through<00:03:08.980> all<00:03:09.310> the

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
correctly it will cycle through all the

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.190 
correctly it will cycle through all the
different<00:03:10.000> settings<00:03:10.180> like<00:03:10.510> right<00:03:10.840> now<00:03:10.989> it's

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
different settings like right now it's

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.440 
different settings like right now it's
at<00:03:11.350> 1/4<00:03:11.830> power<00:03:12.100> and<00:03:13.030> it<00:03:13.120> will<00:03:13.239> keep<00:03:13.390> going

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
at 1/4 power and it will keep going

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.880 
at 1/4 power and it will keep going
until<00:03:13.870> it<00:03:14.290> gets<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:15.040> 1/16<00:03:15.850> and<00:03:19.350> other<00:03:20.350> flashes

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
until it gets to 1/16 and other flashes

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.870 
until it gets to 1/16 and other flashes
if<00:03:21.040> they<00:03:21.190> go<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.400> 1<00:03:21.610> 128<00:03:22.360> through<00:03:22.690> 1/64<00:03:23.670> it<00:03:24.670> will

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
if they go to 1 128 through 1/64 it will

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.350 
if they go to 1 128 through 1/64 it will
go<00:03:25.030> through<00:03:25.390> those<00:03:25.540> settings<00:03:26.079> to<00:03:30.360> most

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
go through those settings to most

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.390 
go through those settings to most
generic<00:03:32.220> TTL<00:03:33.220> flashes<00:03:33.700> with<00:03:33.850> each<00:03:34.000> brand<00:03:35.400> will

generic TTL flashes with each brand will

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.660 
generic TTL flashes with each brand will
self<00:03:36.700> learn<00:03:37.590> you<00:03:38.590> know<00:03:38.709> we<00:03:38.860> they<00:03:39.220> can<00:03:39.459> of

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
self learn you know we they can of

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.300 
self learn you know we they can of
course<00:03:39.970> guarantee<00:03:40.720> that<00:03:41.320> every<00:03:41.680> flash<00:03:41.919> moment

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
course guarantee that every flash moment

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.250 
course guarantee that every flash moment
will<00:03:42.459> but<00:03:42.790> most<00:03:43.150> will<00:03:43.419> especially<00:03:44.049> if<00:03:44.169> they

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
will but most will especially if they

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.700 
will but most will especially if they
pass

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:45.710 
pass

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.480 
pass
the<00:03:46.710> flash<00:03:47.390> testing<00:03:48.390> so<00:03:48.960> now<00:03:49.590> you<00:03:49.650> can<00:03:50.280> create

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
the flash testing so now you can create

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:56.480 
the flash testing so now you can create
a<00:03:50.550> name<00:03:52.010> so<00:03:53.010> hit<00:03:53.280> okay<00:03:54.590> great<00:03:55.590> we'll<00:03:56.130> call<00:03:56.340> this
