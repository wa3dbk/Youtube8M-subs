bolts<00:00:41.680> in<00:00:41.800> the<00:00:41.980> subframe<00:00:42.430> and<00:00:43.830> then<00:00:44.830> I've

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
bolts in the subframe and then I've

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.100 
bolts in the subframe and then I've
welded<00:00:45.820> on<00:00:46.090> a<00:00:46.350> welded<00:00:47.350> and<00:00:47.500> bolted<00:00:47.620> on<00:00:48.010> a<00:00:48.040> plate

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
400 bucks on subframe connectors and

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:18.330 
400 bucks on subframe connectors and
it's<00:01:06.280> fun<00:01:06.490> for<00:01:06.700> me<00:01:06.759> so

working<00:01:26.520> on<00:01:26.580> subframe<00:01:27.090> connectors<00:01:28.610> basically

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
working on subframe connectors basically

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.840 
working on subframe connectors basically
I<00:01:29.640> got<00:01:29.910> some<00:01:30.120> two<00:01:30.270> by<00:01:30.420> three<00:01:30.630> tubing<00:01:31.730> cut<00:01:32.730> the

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
I'm just getting really pissed off I've

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.400 
I'm just getting really pissed off I've
been<00:03:23.910> going<00:03:24.090> on<00:03:24.209> for<00:03:24.420> probably<00:03:24.510> two<00:03:24.870> hours<00:03:24.930> now

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
been going on for probably two hours now

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.880 
been going on for probably two hours now
drink<00:03:26.310> this<00:03:26.569> stupid<00:03:28.440> done<00:03:28.650> it

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
drink this stupid done it

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.009 
drink this stupid done it
is<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.430> most<00:03:29.670> retard<00:03:30.030> design<00:03:30.390> I<00:03:30.420> think<00:03:30.569> that's

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
is the most retard design I think that's

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.140 
is the most retard design I think that's
ever<00:03:31.230> been<00:03:31.410> made<00:03:31.730> basically<00:03:32.730> when<00:03:32.910> you<00:03:32.970> turn

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
ever been made basically when you turn

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.420 
ever been made basically when you turn
the<00:03:33.300> nut<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:34.019> whole<00:03:34.200> shaft<00:03:34.500> turns<00:03:34.769> it's<00:03:35.340> you

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
the nut the whole shaft turns it's you

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.369 
the nut the whole shaft turns it's you
get<00:03:35.550> to<00:03:35.640> try<00:03:35.819> and<00:03:35.970> get<00:03:36.060> a<00:03:36.090> little<00:03:36.390> a<00:03:36.660> vice<00:03:37.349> grip

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
get to try and get a little a vice grip

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.110 
get to try and get a little a vice grip
on<00:03:37.800> there<00:03:38.129> on<00:03:38.250> that<00:03:38.370> little<00:03:38.550> nut<00:03:38.790> right<00:03:38.940> there

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
on there on that little nut right there

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.870 
on there on that little nut right there
on<00:03:39.330> that<00:03:39.360> put<00:03:40.349> a<00:03:40.380> shaft<00:03:40.680> right<00:03:40.890> there<00:03:41.099> and<00:03:41.280> turn

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
on that put a shaft right there and turn

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.220 
on that put a shaft right there and turn
them<00:03:42.060> out<00:03:42.150> at<00:03:42.269> the<00:03:42.330> same<00:03:42.510> time<00:03:42.720> but<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.019> vise

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
them out at the same time but the vise

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.960 
them out at the same time but the vise
grip<00:03:43.470> just<00:03:43.650> keeps<00:03:43.830> slipping<00:03:44.040> off<00:03:44.310> it's

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
grip just keeps slipping off it's

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.150 
grip just keeps slipping off it's
impossible<00:03:45.690> it's<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.140> stupidest<00:03:46.620> design<00:03:46.890> I

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
impossible it's the stupidest design I

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.940 
impossible it's the stupidest design I
think<00:03:47.489> I've<00:03:47.670> ever<00:03:47.849> seen

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
think I've ever seen

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.470 
think I've ever seen
but<00:03:49.950> anyways<00:03:50.280> I'm<00:03:50.760> trying<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:51.060> get<00:03:51.150> my<00:03:51.209> shocks

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480
