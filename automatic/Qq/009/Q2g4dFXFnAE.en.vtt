00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:49.820 
this thing is going to have plenty of

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.690 
this thing is going to have plenty of
power<00:06:50.090> now<00:06:50.440> so<00:06:51.440> what<00:06:51.980> you<00:06:52.070> gonna<00:06:52.190> have<00:06:52.310> to<00:06:52.520> wait

power now so what you gonna have to wait

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.340 
power now so what you gonna have to wait
a<00:06:52.730> little<00:06:52.880> bit<00:06:53.030> longer<00:06:53.150> to<00:06:53.540> fly<00:06:53.750> it<00:06:53.810> but<00:06:54.140> I

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 
show a video of how I do the scaling

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.910 
show a video of how I do the scaling
part<00:07:13.970> not<00:07:14.240> know<00:07:14.390> the<00:07:14.510> construction<00:07:15.080> part<00:07:15.260> but

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:15.920 
part not know the construction part but

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.650 
part not know the construction part but
they're<00:07:16.130> scaling<00:07:16.520> part<00:07:16.760> and<00:07:17.330> like<00:07:17.450> I<00:07:17.600> said

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:17.660 
they're scaling part and like I said

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.080 
they're scaling part and like I said
before<00:07:17.780> I<00:07:18.080> only<00:07:18.320> have<00:07:18.500> two<00:07:19.370> servos<00:07:19.850> right

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:20.090 
before I only have two servos right

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.450 
before I only have two servos right
there<00:07:20.240> left<00:07:20.570> and<00:07:21.140> I<00:07:21.260> have<00:07:21.440> a<00:07:21.470> micro<00:07:21.980> jet<00:07:22.160> engine

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:22.460 
there left and I have a micro jet engine

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.010 
there left and I have a micro jet engine
right<00:07:22.580> here<00:07:22.820> and<00:07:22.970> a<00:07:23.000> 20-amp<00:07:23.270> is<00:07:23.510> the<00:07:23.630> control

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:24.020 
right here and a 20-amp is the control

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.470 
right here and a 20-amp is the control
and<00:07:24.710> the<00:07:24.890> detail<00:07:25.280> needs<00:07:25.580> so<00:07:26.060> what<00:07:26.180> I'm<00:07:26.300> going

to make they the parallel connection and
the<00:07:54.460> cellular<00:07:55.460> connection<00:07:56.030> for<00:07:56.210> two<00:07:56.750> bodies

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:57.110 
the cellular connection for two bodies

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:58.900 
the cellular connection for two bodies
but<00:07:57.500> I<00:07:57.560> don't<00:07:57.740> have<00:07:57.830> any<00:07:58.040> plug<00:07:58.340> guys<00:07:58.610> I<00:07:58.820> don't
