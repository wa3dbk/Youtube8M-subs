00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
trying to find out the answer yourself

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:46.080 
trying to find out the answer yourself
I<00:02:43.800> find<00:02:44.800> that<00:02:44.920> lots<00:02:45.220> of<00:02:45.370> activities<00:02:45.940> in

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
I find that lots of activities in

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.880 
I find that lots of activities in
schools<00:02:46.390> really<00:02:46.780> are<00:02:47.230> based<00:02:47.620> around

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
schools really are based around

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.550 
schools really are based around
assessment<00:02:48.490> so<00:02:49.390> that<00:02:49.420> they<00:02:49.930> live<00:02:50.170> and<00:02:50.350> die

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
assessment so that they live and die

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.480 
assessment so that they live and die
based<00:02:51.250> on<00:02:51.490> that<00:02:52.300> concept<00:02:53.170> of<00:02:53.440> it<00:02:53.860> being<00:02:54.100> self

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
based on that concept of it being self

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.570 
based on that concept of it being self
contained<00:02:54.850> in<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.120> classroom<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:57.400> I<00:02:57.520> don't

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
contained in the classroom and I don't

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.000 
contained in the classroom and I don't
think<00:02:57.940> that's<00:02:58.090> what<00:02:58.270> happens<00:02:58.540> in<00:02:58.660> real<00:02:58.780> life

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
think that's what happens in real life

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.500 
think that's what happens in real life
so<00:03:00.010> my<00:03:00.190> philosophy<00:03:00.370> aims<00:03:00.910> to<00:03:01.180> bring<00:03:01.390> the

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
so my philosophy aims to bring the

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.990 
so my philosophy aims to bring the
outside<00:03:01.660> world<00:03:02.170> into<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:03.790> classroom<00:03:04.270> I

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
outside world into the classroom I

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.250 
outside world into the classroom I
always<00:03:07.000> find<00:03:07.210> it's<00:03:07.390> important<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:08.020> put<00:03:08.170> the

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
always find it's important to put the

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.340 
always find it's important to put the
focus<00:03:08.470> on<00:03:08.920> multiple<00:03:09.790> people<00:03:10.570> from<00:03:10.960> multiple

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
focus on multiple people from multiple

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.740 
focus on multiple people from multiple
cultures<00:03:11.770> coming<00:03:11.980> together<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:12.670> finding<00:03:13.540> a

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
cultures coming together and finding a

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.400 
cultures coming together and finding a
way<00:03:13.990> to<00:03:14.020> communicate<00:03:14.380> well<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.540> I<00:03:16.540> think

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
way to communicate well and I think

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.500 
way to communicate well and I think
that's<00:03:17.680> created<00:03:18.280> an<00:03:18.400> environment<00:03:18.670> where

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
that's created an environment where

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.590 
that's created an environment where
people<00:03:20.200> really<00:03:20.410> can<00:03:21.010> be<00:03:21.160> open<00:03:21.550> and<00:03:21.760> honest

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
people really can be open and honest

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.270 
people really can be open and honest
they<00:03:23.110> can<00:03:23.260> be<00:03:23.350> authentic<00:03:23.890> and<00:03:24.010> be<00:03:24.130> themselves

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
they can be authentic and be themselves

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.460 
they can be authentic and be themselves
and<00:03:24.910> I<00:03:25.300> think<00:03:25.330> it's<00:03:25.600> very<00:03:25.750> important<00:03:26.200> for<00:03:26.290> me

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
and I think it's very important for me

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.930 
and I think it's very important for me
to<00:03:26.590> get<00:03:26.710> to<00:03:26.830> know<00:03:26.950> each<00:03:27.130> and<00:03:27.400> every<00:03:27.580> one<00:03:27.700> of<00:03:27.730> my

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
to get to know each and every one of my

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.980 
to get to know each and every one of my
students<00:03:28.240> very<00:03:28.450> well<00:03:30.210> the<00:03:31.210> strength<00:03:31.570> of<00:03:31.750> the

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
students very well the strength of the

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.980 
students very well the strength of the
Isaac<00:03:32.410> community<00:03:32.920> is<00:03:33.160> we<00:03:33.910> take<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.390> time<00:03:34.630> at

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
Isaac community is we take the time at

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.550 
Isaac community is we take the time at
Isaac<00:03:35.530> every<00:03:36.340> day<00:03:36.520> to<00:03:37.090> ask<00:03:37.300> our<00:03:37.690> kids<00:03:37.990> what

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
Isaac every day to ask our kids what

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.800 
Isaac every day to ask our kids what
they<00:03:38.860> care<00:03:39.130> about<00:03:39.250> and<00:03:39.820> I<00:03:40.210> think<00:03:40.510> that's<00:03:40.720> very

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
they care about and I think that's very

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.100 
they care about and I think that's very
unique<00:03:41.410> we<00:03:41.890> really<00:03:42.520> want<00:03:43.210> them<00:03:43.540> to<00:03:43.600> be

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
unique we really want them to be

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.590 
unique we really want them to be
empowered<00:03:44.530> to<00:03:44.950> change<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:45.700> world<00:03:45.910> to<00:03:46.570> be

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
empowered to change the world to be

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.840 
empowered to change the world to be
catalyst<00:03:47.290> for<00:03:47.620> positive<00:03:47.800> change

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.820 

previously<00:03:53.850> I<00:03:54.120> would<00:03:54.350> just<00:03:55.350> want<00:03:55.620> to<00:03:55.680> be<00:03:55.800> a

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
previously I would just want to be a

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.670 
previously I would just want to be a
sheep<00:03:56.220> in<00:03:56.550> the<00:03:56.910> crowd<00:03:57.450> I<00:03:57.480> guess<00:03:57.660> she'd<00:03:58.530> been

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
sheep in the crowd I guess she'd been

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.740 
sheep in the crowd I guess she'd been
the<00:03:58.770> team<00:03:58.980> just<00:03:59.250> follow<00:03:59.490> along<00:03:59.850> but<00:04:00.540> now<00:04:00.720> I

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
the team just follow along but now I

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.160 
the team just follow along but now I
feel<00:04:01.110> like<00:04:01.140> I<00:04:01.740> can<00:04:02.569> learn<00:04:03.569> more<00:04:03.810> about<00:04:03.900> myself

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
feel like I can learn more about myself

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.010 
feel like I can learn more about myself
and<00:04:04.620> I<00:04:04.709> can<00:04:04.950> do

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
and I can do

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.500 
and I can do
more<00:04:06.620> than<00:04:06.860> just<00:04:07.100> be<00:04:07.220> a<00:04:07.250> sheep<00:04:07.490> I<00:04:07.640> can<00:04:07.880> start<00:04:08.300> to

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
more than just be a sheep I can start to

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.620 
more than just be a sheep I can start to
lead<00:04:08.720> and<00:04:09.080> not<00:04:09.920> only<00:04:10.130> just<00:04:10.640> follow<00:04:13.570> you<00:04:14.570> have

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
lead and not only just follow you have

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.060 
lead and not only just follow you have
to<00:04:14.810> work<00:04:14.960> slowly<00:04:15.320> to<00:04:15.590> become<00:04:15.950> a

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
to work slowly to become a

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.340 
to work slowly to become a
transformational<00:04:16.760> leader<00:04:16.820> and<00:04:17.270> when<00:04:17.959> you<00:04:18.080> do

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
transformational leader and when you do

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.960 
transformational leader and when you do
become<00:04:18.530> a<00:04:18.890> transformation<00:04:19.550> leader<00:04:19.730> you<00:04:19.850> have

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
become a transformation leader you have

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.030 
become a transformation leader you have
to<00:04:20.060> stay<00:04:20.390> at<00:04:20.510> that<00:04:20.690> spot<00:04:20.989> and<00:04:21.230> help<00:04:21.800> other

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
to stay at that spot and help other

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.760 
to stay at that spot and help other
people<00:04:22.160> achieve<00:04:22.670> their<00:04:22.880> goals<00:04:23.390> and<00:04:23.690> help<00:04:24.500> them

people achieve their goals and help them

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.680 
people achieve their goals and help them
become<00:04:24.980> transformational<00:04:25.820> leaders<00:04:26.090> so<00:04:26.660> that

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
become transformational leaders so that

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.510 
become transformational leaders so that
you<00:04:27.050> know<00:04:27.170> it<00:04:27.380> grows<00:04:27.620> and<00:04:27.950> grows<00:04:28.100> and<00:04:28.220> grows

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
you know it grows and grows and grows

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.300 
you know it grows and grows and grows
and<00:04:28.850> one<00:04:29.570> day<00:04:29.750> maybe<00:04:29.960> it's<00:04:30.710> a<00:04:30.830> world<00:04:31.040> where

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
and one day maybe it's a world where

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.060 
and one day maybe it's a world where
everyone<00:04:31.850> is<00:04:32.090> can<00:04:32.840> be<00:04:32.990> defined<00:04:33.410> as<00:04:33.740> a<00:04:33.770> leader

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
everyone is can be defined as a leader

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.190 
everyone is can be defined as a leader
and<00:04:34.310> then<00:04:34.820> everyone<00:04:35.300> can<00:04:35.330> help<00:04:35.630> each<00:04:35.900> other<00:04:36.050> to

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
and then everyone can help each other to

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.680 
and then everyone can help each other to
be<00:04:36.530> to<00:04:36.950> make<00:04:37.190> this<00:04:37.340> world<00:04:37.910> a<00:04:38.060> better<00:04:38.210> place<00:04:38.330> to

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
be to make this world a better place to

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:54.050 
be to make this world a better place to
live
