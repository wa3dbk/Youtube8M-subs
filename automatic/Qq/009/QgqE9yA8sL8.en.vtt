00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:31.959 

that's<00:01:31.039> a<00:01:31.100> nice<00:01:31.280> feature<00:01:31.520> because<00:01:31.939> it

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:31.969 
that's a nice feature because it

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:33.819 
that's a nice feature because it
actually<00:01:32.240> pronounces<00:01:32.899> the<00:01:33.079> sound<00:01:33.350> and<00:01:33.710> this

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
actually pronounces the sound and this

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.609 
actually pronounces the sound and this
has<00:01:33.950> helped<00:01:34.130> my<00:01:34.340> son<00:01:34.780> to<00:01:35.780> actually<00:01:36.259> be<00:01:36.409> able<00:01:36.500> to

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
has helped my son to actually be able to

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.169 
has helped my son to actually be able to
learn<00:01:36.950> his<00:01:37.130> letters<00:01:37.399> a<00:01:37.460> little<00:01:37.609> bit<00:01:37.729> better<00:01:37.880> so

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
learn his letters a little bit better so

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:40.899 
learn his letters a little bit better so
that<00:01:38.359> alone<00:01:38.630> makes<00:01:38.899> it<00:01:39.020> invaluable<00:01:39.759> you<00:01:40.759> can

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
that alone makes it invaluable you can

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.270 
that alone makes it invaluable you can
switch<00:01:41.090> to<00:01:41.119> music<00:01:41.750> or<00:01:41.990> you<00:01:42.590> can<00:01:42.740> switch<00:01:42.920> up<00:01:43.100> to

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
switch to music or you can switch up to

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.959 
switch to music or you can switch up to
animal<00:01:43.670> activities<00:01:47.319> and<00:01:48.759> this<00:01:49.759> would

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 
animal activities and this would

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:51.940 
animal activities and this would
actually<00:01:50.119> show<00:01:50.600> you<00:01:50.659> a<00:01:50.840> picture<00:01:51.049> on<00:01:51.590> that

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
actually show you a picture on that

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.319 
actually show you a picture on that
black<00:01:52.219> and<00:01:52.250> white<00:01:52.459> screen<00:01:52.850> and<00:01:53.119> you<00:01:53.240> can

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
black and white screen and you can

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:54.580 
black and white screen and you can
probably<00:01:53.509> barely<00:01:53.840> make<00:01:54.140> it<00:01:54.170> out<00:01:54.319> right<00:01:54.560> here

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
probably barely make it out right here

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.190 
probably barely make it out right here
but<00:01:55.429> again<00:01:55.549> it's<00:01:56.119> pretty<00:01:56.299> easy<00:01:56.569> to<00:01:56.780> see<00:01:56.959> once

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
but again it's pretty easy to see once

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.770 
but again it's pretty easy to see once
you<00:01:57.350> have<00:01:57.500> it<00:01:57.590> up<00:01:57.679> right<00:01:57.890> there<00:01:58.130> and<00:01:58.569> it<00:01:59.569> does

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
you have it up right there and it does

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.899 
you have it up right there and it does
coordinating<00:02:00.649> nicely<00:02:03.579> the<00:02:04.579> other<00:02:04.700> nice<00:02:04.849> thing

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
coordinating nicely the other nice thing

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:06.160 
coordinating nicely the other nice thing
about<00:02:05.030> this<00:02:05.239> twist<00:02:05.420> doesn't<00:02:05.810> use<00:02:05.929> a<00:02:05.959> lot<00:02:06.140> of

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
about this twist doesn't use a lot of

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.380 
about this twist doesn't use a lot of
batteries<00:02:06.649> we<00:02:06.829> have<00:02:07.009> the<00:02:07.159> same<00:02:07.489> battery<00:02:08.209> in

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
batteries we have the same battery in

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.910 
batteries we have the same battery in
this<00:02:08.569> that<00:02:08.780> we've<00:02:08.899> had<00:02:09.079> for<00:02:09.259> over<00:02:09.530> a<00:02:09.560> year<00:02:09.649> now

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
this that we've had for over a year now

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.890 
this that we've had for over a year now
and<00:02:10.220> that's<00:02:10.459> very<00:02:10.759> nice<00:02:10.970> so<00:02:11.239> between<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.690> fact

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
and that's very nice so between the fact

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.630 
and that's very nice so between the fact
that<00:02:12.110> you<00:02:12.200> can<00:02:12.380> you<00:02:12.799> can<00:02:12.829> personalize<00:02:13.459> this

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
that you can you can personalize this

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.339 
that you can you can personalize this
with<00:02:13.790> your<00:02:13.940> child's<00:02:14.269> information<00:02:14.840> it's<00:02:15.230> a

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
with your child's information it's a

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.440 
with your child's information it's a
real<00:02:15.530> small<00:02:15.860> size<00:02:16.160> that's<00:02:16.849> not<00:02:17.180> very

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
real small size that's not very

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.940 
real small size that's not very
expensive<00:02:17.870> again<00:02:18.260> about<00:02:18.440> twenty<00:02:18.799> five

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
expensive again about twenty five

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.250 
expensive again about twenty five
dollars<00:02:19.459> or<00:02:19.640> so<00:02:19.819> at<00:02:20.030> most<00:02:20.269> I<00:02:20.629> would<00:02:20.900> think

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
dollars or so at most I would think

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.740 
dollars or so at most I would think
would<00:02:21.860> be<00:02:21.920> a<00:02:22.040> reasonable<00:02:22.579> price<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.420> I<00:02:23.569> would

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
would be a reasonable price and I would

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.839 
would be a reasonable price and I would
give<00:02:23.900> this<00:02:24.049> a<00:02:24.110> solid<00:02:24.410> three<00:02:25.340> perhaps<00:02:25.610> four

give this a solid three perhaps four

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.449 
give this a solid three perhaps four
