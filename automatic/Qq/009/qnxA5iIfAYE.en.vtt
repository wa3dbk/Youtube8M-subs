 Hello dear friends with you Kuzi and 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.879
 welcome to my channel today 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.189
 I will show you 7 friends in a game consisting of 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.929
 minor glitchy bugs and so on with 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.210
 about two years ago 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.009
 month and during this time a lot has accumulated 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.470
 funny bugs that you can 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.310
 do with your friends and have fun 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.380
 spend time 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.109
 don't forget to like this video and 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.970
 let's start our seven and so are friends 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.619
 for the first bug you need to arrive to 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.510
 oil rig right here it is 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.640
 place on the map and the tank is 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.380
 that you can this oil rig and 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.690
 take it down and make it so 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.460
 flew air for this you need 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.350
 to have your friend turn on passive mode 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.050
 and crawled inside this oil rig and 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.840
 after which you must throw a couple bombs 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.270
 stickies on the bottom of the tower and see for yourself how 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.489
 will begin to spring and move in 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.140
 the air is the oil rig itself and after 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.420
 what the tower seems to be in the air 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.870
 blow up and throw another sticky bombs 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.180
 Or shoot from the RPP so on so 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.010
 she will move very easily 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.510
 funny bug and generally in the game now alone 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.760
 bugs exactly with such strange 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.619
 objects and therefore it is most 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.479
 the gods from this video will be about how 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.880
 move some large items to 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.700
 the game is well and the next bug is similar 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.350
 only now we will do so 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.479
 a hefty windmill fell to the ground and here 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.220
 it was also possible to move places to 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.110
 map where this kind of cancer 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.030
 see now on your screens and 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.650
 this bug only works with one 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.630
 breeze which is next to 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.549
 yellow staircase meaning the same 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.979
 throw bombs velcro on the ground 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.560
 wind turbine and it slightly rises and soars 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.210
 in the air after you blow those bombs 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.220
 which either topic were bunches which 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.890
 threw on this windmill and for example 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.140
 machines are trying to move it and so 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.869
 the way he will drop this windmill to the ground 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.119
 and how his screws will also spin 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.680
 and property as you see it turns out that's 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.299
 such a funny picture windmill 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.610
 falling screws starts spinning and 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.380
 you can leave these screws 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.149
 parents of the car you may also 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.430
 teleport throw a little 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.740
 air and so on in general very very 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.200
 funny bug so friends can be good 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.880
 have fun doing this very tank and 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.530
 the next forever only do 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.420
 chromed colored tires for 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.940
 This we charge in los anos to sleep with any 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.740
 go to the car in the wheel types 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.900
 choose maslkar 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.330
 select wheels after and there 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.940
 already buy wheels either spuner or up 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.500
 admin something one and after you 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.720
 get one of these wheels 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.640
 come in wheel colors and choose 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.710
 any color you want to see on 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.930
 your chrome drives come in 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.210
 again in the type of wheels in maslkar 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.820
 chrome and already chrome 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.980
 Rims choose again either a spuner or 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.600
 dot mana in this way using this 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.170
 ticks you get chrome 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.660
 wheels 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.030
 do that is chrome wheels you 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:46.380
 make color though without glitches it 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.450
 impossible next very simple tank 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.730

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.370
 and direct up down with the mouse and 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.920
 we get this funny 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.680
 the result is less weight in the game boat 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.520
 the higher you will fly up 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:07.410
 bounce using this 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:09.360
