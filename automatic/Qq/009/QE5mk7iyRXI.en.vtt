kind of media this is your multimedia

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.400 
kind of media this is your multimedia
player<00:02:25.550> it<00:02:25.790> makes<00:02:26.000> it<00:02:26.150> smoother<00:02:26.570> and<00:02:26.780> makes<00:02:27.290> it

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
player it makes it smoother and makes it

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.830 
player it makes it smoother and makes it
faster<00:02:27.830> and<00:02:27.980> because<00:02:28.250> it's<00:02:28.430> Windows<00:02:28.850> 8<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:29.330> HP

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
faster and because it's Windows 8 and HP

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.680 
faster and because it's Windows 8 and HP
it's<00:02:30.050> more<00:02:30.260> reliable<00:02:30.740> and<00:02:31.340> it's<00:02:32.000> easier<00:02:32.420> to

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
it's more reliable and it's easier to

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.600 
it's more reliable and it's easier to
use<00:02:32.960> so<00:02:33.200> I<00:02:33.230> think<00:02:33.410> Adam<00:02:33.860> that's<00:02:34.040> why<00:02:34.280> this<00:02:34.340> is

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
use so I think Adam that's why this is

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.610 
use so I think Adam that's why this is
so<00:02:34.730> popular<00:02:34.880> I'll<00:02:35.450> remind<00:02:35.810> you<00:02:35.960> it<00:02:36.170> does<00:02:36.440> have
