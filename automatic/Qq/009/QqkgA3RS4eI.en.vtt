is<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:21.180> lockable<00:00:21.960> chest<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:22.680> again<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.910> whole

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
is a lockable chest so again the whole

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.390 
is a lockable chest so again the whole
our<00:00:24.359> argument<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.230> storage<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:25.949> lockable

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
our argument of storage and lockable

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.759 
our argument of storage and lockable
chests<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:26.939> all<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.269> jazz<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.840> really<00:00:28.260> kind

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
chests and all that jazz is really kind

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.830 
chests and all that jazz is really kind
of<00:00:28.890> mundane<00:00:29.070> because<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.880> know<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.269> my<00:00:30.300> server<00:00:30.660> I

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
of mundane because I know in my server I

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.510 
of mundane because I know in my server I
have<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:31.140> lot<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.380> challenges<00:00:31.890> sometimes<00:00:32.099> where

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
have a lot of challenges sometimes where

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.040 
have a lot of challenges sometimes where
I<00:00:32.550> only<00:00:32.730> give<00:00:33.000> certain<00:00:33.300> privileges<00:00:33.809> so

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
I only give certain privileges so

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.470 
I only give certain privileges so
sometimes<00:00:34.950> I'm<00:00:35.190> like<00:00:35.370> can<00:00:35.670> open<00:00:35.969> containers

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
sometimes I'm like can open containers

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.090 
sometimes I'm like can open containers
but<00:00:36.660> honestly<00:00:36.989> opening<00:00:37.440> containers<00:00:37.920> is

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
but honestly opening containers is

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.260 
but honestly opening containers is
pretty<00:00:38.309> stupid<00:00:38.550> because<00:00:38.760> if<00:00:38.969> they<00:00:39.059> combine

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
pretty stupid because if they combine

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.000 
pretty stupid because if they combine
blocks<00:00:39.690> they<00:00:39.840> just<00:00:40.020> bust<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.379> chests<00:00:40.620> anyway

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
blocks they just bust the chests anyway

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.760 
blocks they just bust the chests anyway
so<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.149> am<00:00:42.390> picky<00:00:42.840> about<00:00:42.870> what<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.260> do<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.649> who<00:00:43.739> I

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
so I am picky about what I do and who I

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.130 
so I am picky about what I do and who I
let<00:00:44.040> but<00:00:44.250> on<00:00:44.489> this<00:00:44.879> one<00:00:45.090> here<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.840> going

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
let but on this one here this is going

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.690 
let but on this one here this is going
to<00:00:46.200> be<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.350> lockable<00:00:46.739> chest<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.340> has<00:00:47.489> all

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
mine and all of that again they would

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.280 
mine and all of that again they would
end<00:01:14.790> up<00:01:14.880> mining<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.450> they<00:01:15.659> could<00:01:15.869> bust<00:01:16.170> it

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
end up mining this they could bust it

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.289 
end up mining this they could bust it
out<00:01:16.380> if<00:01:16.530> they<00:01:16.650> really<00:01:16.680> wanted<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.369> but<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.880> would

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
out if they really wanted to but I would

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.999 
out if they really wanted to but I would
just<00:01:18.450> keep<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.810> button<00:01:19.080> on<00:01:19.229> me<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.619> then<00:01:19.799> use

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
just keep the button on me and then use

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.070 
just keep the button on me and then use
it<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.340> again<00:01:20.580> I'm<00:01:20.820> much<00:01:21.150> more<00:01:21.420> picky<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:21.900> my

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
it and again I'm much more picky in my

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.620 
it and again I'm much more picky in my
world<00:01:22.350> out<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.580> all<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.939> privileges<00:01:24.150> that

people<00:01:36.119> do<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.659> because<00:01:36.810> they<00:01:37.170> often<00:01:37.350> try<00:01:37.710> to

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
people do that because they often try to

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.679 
people do that because they often try to
use<00:01:38.040> my<00:01:38.220> redstone<00:01:38.430> contraptions<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.299> destroy

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
use my redstone contraptions and destroy

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.810 
use my redstone contraptions and destroy
them<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.710> one<00:01:40.979> here<00:01:41.220> guys<00:01:41.369> I'm<00:01:41.610> just

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
them so this one here guys I'm just

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.069 
them so this one here guys I'm just
going<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.000> go<00:01:42.150> ahead<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.479> bust<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.810> out<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.049> you

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
going to go ahead and bust it out so you

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.749 
going to go ahead and bust it out so you
can<00:01:43.200> see<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.770> kind<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.130> dimensions<00:01:44.579> will

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
can see the kind of dimensions will

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.249 
can see the kind of dimensions will
build<00:01:44.970> one<00:01:45.149> right<00:01:45.299> next<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.720> just<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.079> show

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
build one right next to it just to show

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.440 
build one right next to it just to show
you<00:01:46.320> all<00:01:46.560> all<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.310> sass<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:47.850> it's<00:01:48.000> very

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
you all all the sass of it it's very

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.899 
you all all the sass of it it's very
easy<00:01:48.659> guys<00:01:49.229> but<00:01:50.159> again<00:01:50.430> if<00:01:50.579> you're<00:01:50.729> in<00:01:50.820> a

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
easy guys but again if you're in a

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.460 
easy guys but again if you're in a
server<00:01:51.210> all<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.570> got<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.810> do<00:01:51.930> with<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.229> one

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
server all you got to do with this one

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.190 
server all you got to do with this one
here<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.799> just<00:01:53.009> make<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:53.430> people<00:01:53.579> can't<00:01:53.939> use

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
here is just make it so people can't use

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.020 
here is just make it so people can't use
buttons<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.380> switches<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.860> then<00:01:56.219> that's<00:01:56.850> as

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
buttons and switches and then that's as

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.149 
buttons and switches and then that's as
protected<00:01:57.570> as<00:01:57.659> you're<00:01:57.810> going<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.049> get<00:01:58.229> as<00:01:59.100> well

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
protected as you're going to get as well

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.160 
protected as you're going to get as well
anyway<00:01:59.909> they're<00:02:00.119> going<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.299> bust<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.659> open<00:02:00.780> but

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
anyway they're going to bust it open but

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.810 
anyway they're going to bust it open but
look<00:02:01.469> how<00:02:01.590> straightforward<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.549> it's

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
look how straightforward that is it's

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.499 
look how straightforward that is it's
pretty<00:02:03.329> easy<00:02:04.790> what<00:02:05.790> we're<00:02:06.000> going<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.270> go<00:02:06.390> ahead

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
pretty easy what we're going to go ahead

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.589 
pretty easy what we're going to go ahead
and<00:02:06.899> do<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.439> start<00:02:08.069> with<00:02:08.310> some<00:02:08.700> sticky<00:02:09.179> pistons

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
and do is start with some sticky pistons

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.449 
and do is start with some sticky pistons
so<00:02:09.840> on<00:02:09.989> this<00:02:10.259> one<00:02:10.440> here<00:02:10.649> guys<00:02:10.830> we're<00:02:11.250> going<00:02:11.400> to

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
so on this one here guys we're going to

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.320 
so on this one here guys we're going to
go<00:02:11.610> ahead<00:02:11.730> and

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
go ahead and

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.120 
go ahead and
one<00:02:12.510> right<00:02:12.690> here<00:02:12.960> will<00:02:13.440> put<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.800> sticky

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
one right here will put the sticky

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.180 
one right here will put the sticky
piston<00:02:14.520> here<00:02:15.500> we'll<00:02:16.500> put<00:02:16.830> stairs<00:02:17.640> stairs

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
piston here we'll put stairs stairs

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.980 
piston here we'll put stairs stairs
block<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:20.610> then<00:02:21.360> we'll<00:02:21.510> throw<00:02:21.720> another

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
block and then we'll throw another

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.420 
block and then we'll throw another
sticky<00:02:22.380> piston<00:02:22.740> on<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:22.890> side<00:02:23.190> right<00:02:23.370> here

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
sticky piston on the side right here

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.340 
sticky piston on the side right here
again<00:02:23.820> it's<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.090> very<00:02:24.120> simple<00:02:24.600> build<00:02:24.960> but<00:02:25.020> it<00:02:25.230> is

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
again it's a very simple build but it is

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.830 
again it's a very simple build but it is
pretty<00:02:25.650> cool<00:02:26.030> what<00:02:27.030> I'm<00:02:27.120> going<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:27.300> do<00:02:27.480> is<00:02:27.630> is

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
pretty cool what I'm going to do is is

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.780 
pretty cool what I'm going to do is is
just<00:02:28.170> jump<00:02:28.440> in<00:02:28.560> here<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.950> throw<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.460> sticky

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
just jump in here and throw the sticky

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.410 
just jump in here and throw the sticky
piston<00:02:30.150> in<00:02:30.270> right<00:02:30.450> there<00:02:32.150> notice<00:02:33.150> what<00:02:33.300> we

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
piston in right there notice what we

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.400 
piston in right there notice what we
have<00:02:33.600> very<00:02:34.050> similar<00:02:34.320> to<00:02:34.650> this<00:02:34.740> one<00:02:34.920> over<00:02:34.950> here

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
have very similar to this one over here

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.480 
have very similar to this one over here
actually<00:02:37.410> what<00:02:37.560> we're<00:02:37.680> going<00:02:37.800> to<00:02:37.830> do<00:02:38.040> is<00:02:38.190> leave

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
actually what we're going to do is leave

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.950 
actually what we're going to do is leave
one<00:02:38.850> spot<00:02:39.270> right<00:02:39.480> there

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
one spot right there

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.290 
one spot right there
that's<00:02:40.770> what<00:02:41.070> I<00:02:41.100> did<00:02:41.370> wrong<00:02:41.640> so<00:02:41.850> where's<00:02:42.150> my

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
that's what I did wrong so where's my

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.670 
that's what I did wrong so where's my
piston<00:02:42.660> at<00:02:42.780> I<00:02:42.960> just<00:02:43.230> picked<00:02:43.440> it<00:02:43.530> up<00:02:44.450> hmm<00:02:45.680> that's

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
piston at I just picked it up hmm that's

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.260 
piston at I just picked it up hmm that's
pretty<00:02:46.950> tricky<00:02:47.190> where<00:02:47.490> do<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.700> piston<00:02:48.090> go

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
pretty tricky where do the piston go

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.580 
pretty tricky where do the piston go
that<00:02:48.510> I<00:02:48.540> just<00:02:48.780> dropped<00:02:49.370> very<00:02:50.370> tricky<00:02:50.790> so<00:02:51.590> leave

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
that I just dropped very tricky so leave

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.970 
that I just dropped very tricky so leave
one<00:02:52.740> spot<00:02:53.330> now<00:02:54.330> it<00:02:54.540> looks<00:02:54.750> good<00:02:54.840> perfect<00:02:55.590> guy

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
one spot now it looks good perfect guy

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.980 
one spot now it looks good perfect guy
so<00:02:56.250> basically<00:02:56.700> top<00:02:57.030> this<00:02:57.240> bad<00:02:57.420> boy<00:02:57.600> up<00:02:57.780> right

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
so basically top this bad boy up right

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.360 
so basically top this bad boy up right
here<00:02:58.170> 1<00:02:58.860> 2<00:02:59.220> 3<00:02:59.250> 4<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:00.420> then<00:03:01.200> throw<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:01.740> torch<00:03:02.130> on

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
here 1 2 3 4 and then throw a torch on

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.270 
here 1 2 3 4 and then throw a torch on
each<00:03:02.790> side<00:03:05.540> and<00:03:06.540> then<00:03:07.350> I'm<00:03:07.650> just<00:03:07.709> going<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.070> use

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
each side and then I'm just going to use

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.310 
each side and then I'm just going to use
this<00:03:08.459> to<00:03:08.670> build<00:03:08.880> up<00:03:09.090> on<00:03:09.240> the<00:03:09.360> sky<00:03:09.630> for<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.900> second

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
this to build up on the sky for a second

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.740 
this to build up on the sky for a second
so<00:03:10.860> throw<00:03:11.400> some<00:03:11.610> redstone<00:03:11.790> dust<00:03:12.180> on<00:03:12.360> top<00:03:12.420> of

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
so throw some redstone dust on top of

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.540 
so throw some redstone dust on top of
this<00:03:12.840> bad<00:03:13.050> boy<00:03:14.840> and<00:03:16.040> there<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.130> go<00:03:17.280> guys

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
this bad boy and there you go guys

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.000 
this bad boy and there you go guys
that's<00:03:18.120> pretty<00:03:18.480> much<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.900> whole<00:03:18.930> gist<00:03:19.709> of<00:03:19.890> it

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
that's pretty much the whole gist of it

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.320 
that's pretty much the whole gist of it
right<00:03:20.160> there<00:03:20.400> let's<00:03:20.640> go<00:03:20.790> ahead<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.150> throw<00:03:21.300> a

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
right there let's go ahead and throw a

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:29.060 
right there let's go ahead and throw a
chest<00:03:22.310> right<00:03:27.140> hold<00:03:28.140> on<00:03:28.260> one<00:03:28.440> sec<00:03:28.650> I<00:03:28.739> just<00:03:28.769> gotta

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
chest right hold on one sec I just gotta
