00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.810
 hello we are starting rehearsal 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.210
 rather, how it starts for now 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.250
 It looks like this 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.880
 just a mess all run especially 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.460
 baby 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.199
 here you are sitting humbly waiting 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.900
 changed the truth jacket threw 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.600
 still cool overall is not yet clear 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.079
 what will be when what number we will 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.590
 perform so while such a mess 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:42.600
 until then mum will be one hundred percent of the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:48.690
 that three girls can quickly transform 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:51.899
 dressing room with an important mission 1 booty and 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:57.719
 because we found a brewing closet we 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:01:01.760
 found coffee we know where we are we know 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.760
 there they are to we now lead him to steal 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:17.210
 20 groups rehearses lines all 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.210
 acquires for divorces 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.780
 with 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.210
 girls life hacking how to make 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:51.940
 shoes that are served were shown 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:52.960
 mean to you because srach it 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.170
 nice i 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.909
 You said and did not say that srach srach 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.700
 an additional electron and now UTB UTB 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.700
 beat we here already slowly converge mother 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.220
 it is already terribly scary somehow 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.050
 tension reaches its peak yet 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.500
 probably not very soon to go out 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.500
 somehow 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.680
 butterflies fly alive all 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.630
 and vodka twist there now I do not 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.700
 earlier on since what is it damp 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.799
 I have nothing we are most 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.540
 last we have already worried 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.000
 pretty decent and we still 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.069
 worry too pretty much and then 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.230
 we have literally three minutes to 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.640
 change clothes 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.890
 bun we were allowed to do can 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.709
 let's go with that hair and yes already go 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.590
 on flash mob so we have these for 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:56.010
 wash it the fastest and called 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:03:01.720
 not only if they are not normal 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:09.359
 no good and tell me what's next 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:09.359
 The makeup is very obvious. Very get. 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:39.100
 most likely we are finally home 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.590
 now somewhere around midnight we just 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.900
 after the show they decided to drive another 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.190
 Altron on the avengers I generally with 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.020
 I am watching now with pleasure 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.440
 film companies marvel and name is these 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.120
 stages of development of the film universe someone 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.890
 knows someone does not know the first stage already 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.020
 ended on avengers that is when 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.780
 the heroes just did come together and 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.910
 Now it is the second stage, it seems to me 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.700
 such a great idea on the one hand 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:06.010
 up husband is right really good 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.720
 way yourself money because on 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.370
 some movie might not have gone to 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.280
 for example man ant doctor 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.830
 going to be released and knowing that he 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.020
 part that 's ken and part of these 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.340
 stages and it is possible that there 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.190
 another stone will appear 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:25.300
 infinity probably already 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:27.640
 you go therefore here on one side to 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.370
 but on the other hand for me personally this 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:33.100
 here is the feeling of some epochal 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:38.350
 captures i love science fiction i love 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:41.320
 when all this is all a little put 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:43.090
 connects into something big so on 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:47.350
 I personally think that this idea is very 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:49.570
 cool standing and I already managed 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.789
 watch our show and if dough i 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.010
 I was a little upset there do not smile 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:56.099
 girls go smiling flying 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.790
 air i'm so serious and i'm 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:59.830
 I understand that I was in favor 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:03.160
 this is the way to get on their shoes 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:05.140
 I lost them three times rather not quite that 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.320
 shoes I was losing this net did not leave on 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:10.570
 track I heel slipped and back I 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.030
 I could get that is how it happened 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:15.340
 I have no idea at the rehearsal all in 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:18.130
 okay I was still gluing this one 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:21.160
 Here, nickname did not give anything that head fall 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.870
 but somehow this is all mysterious and 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.060
 plan at least in the video this is not 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.530
 visible that is, with this task not 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.220
 handled that is there was nothing 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:34.690
 noticeably went as usual yes that is 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:36.370
 you go and that's it so it's nice but 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:39.040
 I would certainly like to smile 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.750
 but emotions it was of course pure 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.580
 adrenaline I do not regret that 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:45.490
 generally participated in such a project and 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.800
 what generally what went through that is 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:53.350
 some new impressions are some 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:57.130
 new facets yes some new visions 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:59.980
 something so not knowing anything not 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:02.050
 regret what i liked everything i want 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.880
 thank you all so much 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.830

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.500

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.960

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.460
 dreams what they will be what bugs 

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:20.770
 I was not very crazy language 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:23.400
 braids so I will go to sleep 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:26.500
 she won't wash her hair even though 

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:28.480
 there would be so much varnish there 

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:32.070
