scale<00:00:36.329> factor<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.809> 1<00:00:37.020> it's<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.410> 0.01<00:00:38.399> because

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
scale factor to 1 it's in 0.01 because

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.270 
scale factor to 1 it's in 0.01 because
if<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.570> put<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.930> 1<00:00:40.140> then<00:00:40.379> my<00:00:40.530> other<00:00:40.680> game

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
if I put it to 1 then my other game

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.850 
if I put it to 1 then my other game
the<00:00:41.430> ship<00:00:41.670> will<00:00:41.850> appear<00:00:42.149> huge<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.530> that's<00:00:43.710> why

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
the ship will appear huge so that's why

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.850 
the ship will appear huge so that's why
I<00:00:43.890> can't<00:00:44.250> touch<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.750> but<00:00:45.750> said<00:00:46.230> yours<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.620> scale

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
I can't touch it but said yours to scale

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.130 
I can't touch it but said yours to scale
factor<00:00:47.219> 1<00:00:47.430> as<00:00:47.789> for<00:00:48.059> me<00:00:48.180> how<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.570> go<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.780> scale

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
factor 1 as for me how to go to scale

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.520 
factor 1 as for me how to go to scale
and<00:00:49.379> just<00:00:49.590> scale<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:50.730> size<00:00:51.660> bigger<00:00:54.350> okay<00:00:55.379> oh

you<00:00:55.949> can<00:00:56.070> see<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.340> inside<00:00:56.699> just<00:00:58.100> move<00:00:59.100> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
you can see the inside just move the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.360 
you can see the inside just move the
ship<00:00:59.609> above<00:01:00.090> him<00:01:00.590> now<00:01:01.590> we're<00:01:01.770> gonna<00:01:01.859> add<00:01:02.070> some

animation to the ship so to add
animation<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.820> could<00:01:06.060> also<00:01:06.210> work<00:01:06.450> with

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
animation this could also work with

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.050 
animation this could also work with
other<00:01:06.810> objects<00:01:07.320> as<00:01:07.470> well<00:01:07.650> select<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.640> object

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
will insert a new keyframe so let's add

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.480 
will insert a new keyframe so let's add
a<00:01:36.119> keyframe<00:01:36.570> right<00:01:36.990> at<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.470> beginning<00:01:37.590> where

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
a keyframe right at the beginning where

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.370 
a keyframe right at the beginning where
the<00:01:38.520> ship<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.119> like<00:01:39.740> forward<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.640> then<00:01:41.759> again

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
the ship is like forward and then again

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:54.680 
the ship is like forward and then again
around<00:01:43.380> here<00:01:49.159> it<00:01:50.159> rotates<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.729> bit

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.210 

then<00:01:55.110> they<00:01:55.200> just<00:01:55.410> willed<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.680> camera<00:01:58.160> there<00:01:59.160> you

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
then they just willed a camera there you

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:08.240 
then they just willed a camera there you
go<00:02:03.920> just<00:02:04.920> continue<00:02:05.490> like<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:06.920> make<00:02:07.920> sure<00:02:08.100> you

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
go just continue like that make sure you

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:22.570 
go just continue like that make sure you
know<00:02:08.400> what<00:02:08.760> timing<00:02:09.119> you're<00:02:09.479> doing

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.060 

we'll<00:02:23.090> do<00:02:23.300> this<00:02:23.450> up<00:02:23.660> to<00:02:23.840> like<00:02:24.020> four<00:02:24.470> seconds<00:02:24.950> or

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
we'll do this up to like four seconds or

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:36.850 
we'll do this up to like four seconds or
something<00:02:29.470> okay<00:02:30.470> let<00:02:30.620> me--just<00:02:30.710> is<00:02:31.010> not<00:02:35.860> okay

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
something okay let me--just is not okay

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.750 
something okay let me--just is not okay
so<00:02:36.920> let's<00:02:37.790> just<00:02:37.970> stop<00:02:38.150> at<00:02:38.300> four<00:02:38.540> seconds<00:02:39.110> and

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
so let's just stop at four seconds and

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.080 
so let's just stop at four seconds and
then<00:02:40.760> add<00:02:41.240> around<00:02:41.770> four<00:02:42.770> three<00:02:43.040> four<00:02:43.940> and<00:02:44.060> a

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
then add around four three four and a

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.630 
then add around four three four and a
half<00:02:44.120> seconds<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:45.470> ship<00:02:45.680> starts<00:02:46.070> moving<00:02:46.490> a

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
half seconds the ship starts moving a

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.560 
half seconds the ship starts moving a
little<00:02:47.000> bit<00:02:47.120> back<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:48.490> it's<00:02:49.490> leaning<00:02:49.700> forward

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
little bit back and it's leaning forward

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.290 
little bit back and it's leaning forward
that<00:02:50.960> means<00:02:51.170> it's<00:02:51.380> getting<00:02:52.040> ready<00:02:52.430> ready<00:02:53.120> to

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
that means it's getting ready ready to

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.210 
that means it's getting ready ready to
start<00:02:53.600> and<00:02:54.670> one<00:02:55.670> second<00:02:56.060> later<00:02:56.240> it<00:02:56.870> moves<00:02:57.220> like

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
start and one second later it moves like

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.370 
start and one second later it moves like
this<00:02:58.330> yeah<00:02:59.330> I<00:02:59.540> know<00:02:59.630> it<00:02:59.840> looks<00:03:00.020> like<00:03:00.110> it's

going down so we have to move it a
little<00:03:02.600> up<00:03:03.190> or<00:03:04.190> take<00:03:04.520> this<00:03:08.350> okay<00:03:09.350> and<00:03:10.240> about
