00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:14.790
 to me 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.579
 why 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.080
 I won 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.390
 make is great 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.430
 to 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.060
 if the reason for happy because 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.010
 right in the past he had done 900 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.319
 of the tournament but good a match 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.209
 quite stuck in the first time 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.280
 they were for there's more a little bit more 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.170
 disorderly and faced everything different 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.430
 in his last if the truth that finally 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.069
 it cost us a lot, I think we did not have 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.200
 no chance for a clear goal 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.940
 they came out with a very blocking 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.410
 smart because we could not play not 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.190
 we could get to the area 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.240
 and also very physical and good I think 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.340
 one time of the talk we try 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.260
 correct some things and we knew that 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.790
 we are going to make few chances and the 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.680
 objective to take advantage of them so 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.930
 luck can be done if it was a match 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.840
 very even the truth that we liked it 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.610
 half bitter so it was a result 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.040
 I think that bank does not have to lose 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.090
 view that has to go forward all 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.690
 Saturdays or soups or quiet 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.330
 and good nothing to keep growing little 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.709
 well maybe the eyes fail very 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.019
 shorts they had in the second half 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.970
 was what perhaps ends up defining a 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.550
 little party 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.050
 no I not think it is well on the 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.820
 short is always a move that can 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.190
 make a difference in a match but 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.980
 I do not think that's the case and others fail 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.450
 but we had mistakes all along 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.730
 the match is not that the with the short 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.990
 I have defined the result I am dad 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.870
 I have to isolate a little bit from training the 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.300
 selected and while it's looking at that 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.820
 there are interesting players in both 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.960
 equipment not the central bank nation 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.240
 plays very well the central steering wheel 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:55.650
 also a lane on the left 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:57.990
 also and good one has to go looking 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.030
 and everything he can but today comes from 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.870
 dad binner to the mica 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:06.780
 at the same time play I love I love me 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.550
 I love coming to see my children and so much 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.170
 friend like matthew that they 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.170
 have fun enjoying 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.630
 Time goes by quickly because my daughter 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.790
 Juan first 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.790
 it is a very great satisfaction to be able to 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.100
 come to enjoy like dad not like 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:27.060
 coach or give directions or anything 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.290
 take cases and dad I come to enjoy and 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.590
 as you said before the relaxed note 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.840
 because you do not have you do not have the attention of 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.460
 result I want him to win obviously 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.770
 but I want you to enjoy I want the 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.000
 go well with her friends and what and what 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.580
 defend our club's shirt 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.590
 with the heart getting every ball there 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.930
 as if it were the last and how it does 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.140
 I remain calm and enjoy a lot of 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.140
 see her
