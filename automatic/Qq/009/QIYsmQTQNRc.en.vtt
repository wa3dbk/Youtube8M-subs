yeah<00:00:30.769> Uranus<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.040> Pluto<00:00:32.070> are<00:00:32.369> slow-moving

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
yeah Uranus and Pluto are slow-moving

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.500 
yeah Uranus and Pluto are slow-moving
planetary<00:00:34.020> pair<00:00:34.380> they<00:00:35.040> were<00:00:35.100> exactly<00:00:35.880> aligned

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
planetary pair they were exactly aligned

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.170 
planetary pair they were exactly aligned
in<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.989> mid-1960s<00:00:37.890> most<00:00:38.730> astrologers

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
in the mid-1960s most astrologers

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.660 
in the mid-1960s most astrologers
acknowledge<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.290> what<00:00:40.530> we<00:00:40.680> call<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.219> 60s

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
acknowledge that what we call the 60s

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.819 
acknowledge that what we call the 60s
which<00:00:41.969> really<00:00:42.510> was<00:00:42.750> from<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.050> mid<00:00:43.200> 60s<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
which really was from the mid 60s to the

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.549 
which really was from the mid 60s to the
early<00:00:44.190> 70s<00:00:44.789> was<00:00:45.300> really<00:00:45.629> an<00:00:45.750> artifact<00:00:46.289> of

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
early 70s was really an artifact of

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.160 
early 70s was really an artifact of
Uranus<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.100> planet<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.730> social<00:00:48.180> revolution

the planet that brings the hidden stuff

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.250 
the planet that brings the hidden stuff
from<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.610> underworld<00:00:57.120> into<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.719> out<00:00:57.899> into

from the underworld into the out into
into<00:00:58.890> consciousness<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.730> that<00:01:00.180> these<00:01:00.449> two

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.389 
into consciousness and that these two
planets<00:01:01.109> again<00:01:01.410> r<00:01:01.680> square<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.250> they're

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
planets again r square and they're

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.149 
planets again r square and they're
exactly<00:01:03.000> square<00:01:03.480> on<00:01:03.690> November<00:01:04.199> first<00:01:04.409> setting

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
exactly square on November first setting

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.649 
exactly square on November first setting
the<00:01:05.280> tone<00:01:05.460> for<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.820> entire<00:01:05.850> month<00:01:06.479> of

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
the tone for the entire month of

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.960 
the tone for the entire month of
transformation<00:01:07.500> yeah<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.460> think<00:01:08.520> we're

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
transformation yeah and I think we're

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.969 
transformation yeah and I think we're
seeing<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.420> return<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:10.110> some<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.409> those<00:01:10.500> 60

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
seeing a return to some of those 60

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.320 
seeing a return to some of those 60
values<00:01:11.400> at<00:01:11.580> least<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.060> state<00:01:12.299> of

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
values at least in the state of

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.990 
values at least in the state of
Washington<00:01:13.020> where<00:01:13.200> we<00:01:13.380> live<00:01:13.680> where<00:01:14.250> sixties

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
Washington where we live where sixties

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.929 
Washington where we live where sixties
issues<00:01:15.479> like<00:01:15.840> marijuana<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.979> sexual<00:01:17.610> freedom

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
issues like marijuana and sexual freedom

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.600 
issues like marijuana and sexual freedom
have<00:01:18.540> been<00:01:18.780> legalized<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:19.860> our<00:01:20.009> state<00:01:20.400> and

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
have been legalized in our state and

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.420 
have been legalized in our state and
these<00:01:20.970> are<00:01:21.270> likely<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.720> be<00:01:21.840> bellwether<00:01:22.710> issues

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
these are likely to be bellwether issues

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.550 
these are likely to be bellwether issues
that<00:01:23.670> are<00:01:23.790> going<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.939> spread<00:01:24.420> over<00:01:24.930> much<00:01:25.530> of

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
that are going to spread over much of

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.320 
that are going to spread over much of
the<00:01:25.770> country<00:01:26.130> well<00:01:26.340> yeah<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.670> think<00:01:27.060> you're

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
the country well yeah I think you're

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.390 
the country well yeah I think you're
right<00:01:27.390> Jeff<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:27.990> think<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.829> course<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.250> goes

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
right Jeff and I think of course it goes

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.219 
right Jeff and I think of course it goes
deeper<00:01:29.850> than<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.689> uranus<00:01:31.200> pluto

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
deeper than that this uranus pluto

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.039 
deeper than that this uranus pluto
square<00:01:31.860> this<00:01:32.159> time<00:01:32.400> round<00:01:32.670> mirrors<00:01:33.570> some<00:01:33.869> of

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
square this time round mirrors some of

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.380 
square this time round mirrors some of
the<00:01:34.170> ongoing<00:01:34.350> uranus<00:01:35.159> pluto<00:01:35.189> issues<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.240> he

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
the ongoing uranus pluto issues that he

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.730 
the ongoing uranus pluto issues that he
can<00:01:36.570> go<00:01:36.720> back<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.290> uranus<00:01:37.710> pluto

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
can go back to the uranus pluto

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.620 
can go back to the uranus pluto
connection<00:01:38.640> during<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.270> french<00:01:39.479> revolution

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
connection during the french revolution

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.990 
connection during the french revolution
oh<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.860> then<00:01:41.070> with<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.310> when<00:01:41.700> there<00:01:41.880> was

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
oh and then with that when there was

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.420 
oh and then with that when there was
social<00:01:42.210> revolution<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.140> upheaval<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.920> now

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
social revolution and upheaval and now

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.160 
social revolution and upheaval and now
with<00:01:44.700> what's<00:01:44.939> been<00:01:45.090> going<00:01:45.390> on<00:01:45.509> not<00:01:45.780> only<00:01:46.020> in

with what's been going on not only in

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.380 
with what's been going on not only in
the<00:01:46.259> United<00:01:46.290> States<00:01:46.680> but<00:01:47.220> certainly<00:01:47.579> in

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
the United States but certainly in

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.620 
the United States but certainly in

Indonesia in North Africa in Egypt and
in<00:01:52.939> Istanbul<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.210> mean<00:01:54.540> these<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:54.990> Syria<00:01:55.439> the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
in Istanbul I mean these in Syria the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.520 
in Istanbul I mean these in Syria the
issues<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.219> social<00:01:56.399> unrest<00:01:56.759> are<00:01:57.240> again<00:01:57.960> on<00:01:58.229> us

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
issues of social unrest are again on us

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.590 
issues of social unrest are again on us
in<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.799> way<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:59.250> they<00:01:59.399> were<00:01:59.460> also<00:02:00.090> back<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:00.509> the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
in a way that they were also back in the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.950 
in a way that they were also back in the
60s<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.259> yet<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.399> think<00:02:02.729> individuals<00:02:03.689> trying

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
60s and yet I think individuals trying

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.679 
60s and yet I think individuals trying
to<00:02:04.170> solve<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.619> world's<00:02:04.950> problems<00:02:05.009> are<00:02:05.729> noble

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
to solve the world's problems are noble
