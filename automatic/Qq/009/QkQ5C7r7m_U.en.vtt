00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.740 
neutral as we go higher it gets more
alkaline<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:25.560> 8<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:25.830> more<00:00:26.250> outline<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.789> 79<00:00:27.510> is

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
anything below 7 is acid now we

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.780 
anything below 7 is acid now we
obviously<00:00:34.440> tend<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:34.950> want<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.160> avoid<00:00:35.340> acid

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
obviously tend to want to avoid acid

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.430 
obviously tend to want to avoid acid
because<00:00:35.969> we<00:00:36.210> we<00:00:36.420> believe<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:36.899> another<00:00:37.140> acids

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
acid now what you need to know is that

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.319 
acid now what you need to know is that
when<00:00:46.710> something's<00:00:47.070> acid<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.789> saturated

electricity rich now what we've always

body runs on electricity all right this

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.729

is<00:01:02.969> very<00:01:03.480> very<00:01:03.600> different<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.379> medical

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
is very very different to medical

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.789 
is very very different to medical
science<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.729> Western<00:01:06.420> medical<00:01:06.799> thinking

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
that the body runs on sugar or glucose

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.289 
that the body runs on sugar or glucose
we've<00:01:10.320> never<00:01:10.650> believed<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.760> we<00:01:11.909> don't<00:01:12.030> think

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
we've never believed that we don't think

we've never believed that we don't think
of<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.510> we<00:01:12.630> think<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.900> glucose<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.500> an

of that we think the glucose is an

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.230

have conflicting opinions but generally
we<00:02:04.439> think<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:05.189> need<00:02:05.340> at<00:02:05.460> least<00:02:05.490> one<00:02:06.030> or<00:02:06.240> at

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
we think you need at least one or at

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.980 
we think you need at least one or at
least<00:02:06.329> 2<00:02:06.869> liters<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:07.290> water

least 2 liters of water
day<00:02:08.170> just<00:02:08.590> to<00:02:08.649> make<00:02:08.800> your<00:02:08.890> bowels<00:02:09.310> go<00:02:09.489> normal

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
day just to make your bowels go normal

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.860 
day just to make your bowels go normal
so<00:02:10.989> what<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.530> PA<00:02:11.709> pH<00:02:12.310> drops<00:02:12.520> really<00:02:13.030> do<00:02:13.239> is

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
so what the PA pH drops really do is

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.800 
so what the PA pH drops really do is
they<00:02:14.530> raise<00:02:15.099> the<00:02:15.370> pH<00:02:15.640> generally<00:02:16.090> we<00:02:16.209> aim<00:02:16.480> for

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
they raise the pH generally we aim for

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.620 
they raise the pH generally we aim for
about<00:02:16.989> 9<00:02:17.290> 10<00:02:17.590> or<00:02:17.739> 11<00:02:18.099> but<00:02:18.640> they<00:02:18.790> raise<00:02:19.360> your

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
about 9 10 or 11 but they raise your

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.360 
about 9 10 or 11 but they raise your
water<00:02:19.989> to<00:02:20.200> be<00:02:20.319> full<00:02:20.560> of<00:02:20.680> electricity<00:02:21.010> or<00:02:21.190> full

of<00:02:21.400> electrical<00:02:22.030> energy<00:02:22.560> energy<00:02:23.560> so<00:02:23.920> seven<00:02:24.280> to

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
of electrical energy energy so seven to

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.479 
of electrical energy energy so seven to
eight<00:02:24.550> is<00:02:24.790> a<00:02:24.849> ten<00:02:25.360> times<00:02:25.599> more<00:02:25.720> alkaline<00:02:26.489> from

eight is a ten times more alkaline from
seven<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.090> nine<00:02:28.120> is<00:02:28.569> a<00:02:28.599> hundred<00:02:29.050> times<00:02:29.200> more

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
seven to nine is a hundred times more

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.470 
seven to nine is a hundred times more

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
alkaline than seven seven to ten is a

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.330 
alkaline than seven seven to ten is a
thousand<00:02:32.110> times<00:02:32.200> more<00:02:32.380> alkaline<00:02:32.590> seven<00:02:33.220> to

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
eleven is 10,000 times more alkaline so

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.280 
eleven is 10,000 times more alkaline so

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
get you through business meetings help

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.570 
get you through business meetings help
you<00:02:56.470> make<00:02:56.620> love<00:02:56.799> to<00:02:56.890> you<00:02:56.980> spouse<00:02:57.160> whatever<00:02:57.489> you

you make love to you spouse whatever you

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.050 
you make love to you spouse whatever you
need<00:02:57.730> to<00:02:57.760> do<00:02:58.319> you<00:02:59.319> need<00:02:59.860> energy<00:03:00.010> and<00:03:00.400> in<00:03:00.880> fact

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
need to do you need energy and in fact

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.160 
need to do you need energy and in fact
i'll<00:03:01.209> give<00:03:01.330> you<00:03:01.420> equation<00:03:01.600> thing<00:03:01.900> about<00:03:02.049> this

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
i'll give you equation thing about this

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.289 
i'll give you equation thing about this
health<00:03:02.500> equals<00:03:02.980> energy<00:03:03.160> because<00:03:04.030> your<00:03:04.150> body

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
health equals energy because your body

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:05.759 
health equals energy because your body
in<00:03:04.390> his<00:03:04.450> energy<00:03:04.810> to<00:03:04.900> run<00:03:05.049> and<00:03:05.260> its<00:03:05.380> energy<00:03:05.739> to

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
in his energy to run and its energy to

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.460 
in his energy to run and its energy to
regenerate<00:03:06.430> it<00:03:06.549> needs<00:03:06.700> energy<00:03:07.290> no<00:03:08.290> that's

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
regenerate it needs energy no that's

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.750 
regenerate it needs energy no that's
what<00:03:08.620> you<00:03:08.709> do<00:03:08.890> at<00:03:09.010> night<00:03:09.040> you<00:03:09.610> know<00:03:09.700> you

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
what you do at night you know you

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.630 
what you do at night you know you
regenerate<00:03:10.510> so<00:03:10.750> this<00:03:10.930> is<00:03:11.080> a<00:03:11.260> way<00:03:11.319> to<00:03:11.640> perhaps

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
regenerate so this is a way to perhaps

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.479 
regenerate so this is a way to perhaps
even<00:03:12.910> shave<00:03:13.239> time<00:03:13.510> off<00:03:13.570> how<00:03:13.840> much<00:03:13.989> you<00:03:14.140> sleep

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
even shave time off how much you sleep

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.580 
even shave time off how much you sleep
but<00:03:15.489> certainly<00:03:15.850> make<00:03:16.030> you<00:03:16.150> more<00:03:16.329> alert<00:03:16.590> even

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
but certainly make you more alert even

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.050 
but certainly make you more alert even
make<00:03:17.769> you<00:03:17.920> you<00:03:18.100> a<00:03:18.130> lift<00:03:18.400> weights<00:03:18.640> make<00:03:18.970> you

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
make you you a lift weights make you

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.270 
make you you a lift weights make you
physically<00:03:19.420> stronger<00:03:19.959> so<00:03:20.590> this<00:03:20.739> is<00:03:20.920> this<00:03:21.070> is

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
physically stronger so this is this is

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.890 
physically stronger so this is this is
certainly<00:03:21.579> the<00:03:21.820> perfect<00:03:22.359> place<00:03:22.480> to<00:03:22.690> start

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
certainly the perfect place to start

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.440 
certainly the perfect place to start
after<00:03:23.290> after<00:03:23.530> oxygen<00:03:24.220> we<00:03:24.760> have<00:03:24.940> water<00:03:25.180> and

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
after after oxygen we have water and

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.000 
after after oxygen we have water and
then<00:03:25.540> we<00:03:25.630> have<00:03:25.780> chlorophyll<00:03:26.290> so<00:03:26.470> once<00:03:26.650> we<00:03:26.799> take
