00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 Hello everybody with you guys as always I 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.649
 vlad sale your rubric acura mystic 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.719
 I will show you in brief today about 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.750
 so interesting to the market here I have it 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.320
 there is a float called she polyp tirus 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.630
 Senegalese one of the most unusual 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.880
 freshwater fisherman in my opinion 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.609
 Poly Senegalese grows to 30 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.449
 centimeters in aquarium nature can 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.640
 grow to 50 while this counts 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.009
 aquarium survivor duration 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.540
 life is up to 30 years old but that is 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.980
 under good conditions 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.070
 recommended content temperatures for 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.079
 good comfortable living in akoya not 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.809
 25-29 degrees recommended 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.210
 aquarium from about 200 liters at 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.160
 this amount he can grow to his 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.829
 maximum size of about 30 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.539
 centimeters aquarium survival with 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.570
 other fish though poly sochi 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.340
 considered such a pronounced predator 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.070
 he can get along with many 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.210
 fish most importantly that this fish is not 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.990
 was able to enter him 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.680
 fall open 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.740
 rather big and in size so that 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.369
 the fish was not less than half 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.939
 police russo about feed feed 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.939
 it can 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.840
 how do you instant as a live feed and 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.590
 frozen 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.869
 let's say the hotel can also teach them 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.170
 to dry food that will please 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.759
 to the bottom from the bottom this case does not eat up 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.060
 the only thing to teach him to something 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.860
 here if young finger r us 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.810
 you know that you will feed with dry feed 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.759
 better start feeding him right away 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.920
 push their pockets what is usually 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.049
 by they are getting used to 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.240
 let's say live formula in ice cream 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:59.560
 then it will be harder to teach 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.659
 significantly on dry food is also there 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.450
 his caramel since childhood with dry 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.929
 the predator's instinct is reduced 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.739
 it allows you to keep it also with 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.170
 small fish 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.360
 Well, of course not the fact that she ever 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.030
 a little hungry sleepy can 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.329
 allegiance is, well, like water more 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.569
 getting used to being peaceful since childhood 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:24.760
 Sukhachev also need a radio 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:29.319
 filtration and weekly water change 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.150
 percent 20 30 but so this in short you 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.950
 told quite interesting it 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.760
 fish in general is very, very strong 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.150
 like cool this rubric is mine 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.530
 I will continue to shoot further 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.709
 briefly tell you what is not smoked 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.660
