00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.530
 they were under rapid transport control 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.660
 In fact, it was 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.660
 for the 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.390
 not only as in Brazil and other countries have to exceed motoboy 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.160
 It is essential for heartburn companies not six writers and industry 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.999
 the bike but without doubt is the solution is 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:28.009
 the solution 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:29.399
 is unpredictable 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:32.399
 long time ago that motoboys have been demonstrating henrique 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.200
 And I know if we get hard, right? 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.560
 for me the solution is in my point of view 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.970
 what I think if we can not stop 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.129
 the profession is actually a very 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.410
 dangerous is a risky profession 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.660
 I 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.020
 I worked for 11 years in this profession. 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.580
 already suffered three accidents unfortunately 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.430
 p I live laziness too but does not have three each 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.160
 They do not earn very badly. 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.810
 should be based on today's neutral wage is also land 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.589
 if I always spoke so home 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.710
 a woman having a child is late leaving 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.260
 So I think we have to be really appreciated. 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.760
 pimentel 22 years old and motoboy 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.620
 I started at 20 years ago than 42 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.060
 I mean I do not have much evolution like that but I am too 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.060
 same 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.310
 so you're changing the examples are getting so the more service is 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.860
 the same and working with the role 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.660
 is the when I comment with money balloons fortunately the character has nothing 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.840
 by the fact that we work 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.180
 you approve of something that runs away before you face as a thief and is not 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.160
 that is not quite so by motoboys the thief state wants to know leyria sexta 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.220
 it seems that some work in the nuclear field 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.420
 I wanted to see a little more concentration for everything 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.820
 no drivers either 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.860
 of the entire population the truth because 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.860
 the motoboy he is a worker like any other worker 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.200
 and it is being seen much like 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.690
 the thug with the thief mussavi 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.729
 it's a terrible determination 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.509
 I think it should end 

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:14.039
 Why do the thieves do? 

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:16.569
 riding a motorcycle as well as riding a car 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.230
 but 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.359
 the motoboy 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:21.729
 first stage to be identified 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:25.749
 he thrashed with the clay he walks alone on the bike I ride with croup 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:29.029
 hardly anyone will assault you if you are alone on the bike 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:33.189
 I'm hot foot with the major 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:36.959
 driver who exposes a lot of truck people with the bid up to cinelandia 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:40.789
 protected him with his own biker 

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:43.699
 many people responsible 

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:46.819
 I am not in the world with those who respect others 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.419
 the new world respects 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.099
 I will obey every day 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.149
 There are people who take respect 

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:57.759
 as there are people who want the psb have people who made it to the beach for you 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:58.629
 do not pass 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:59.910
 I know he 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.720
 How do you think it's okay to walk in the corridors? Is it one side of the corridor? 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.620
 only I walk very carefully and care not to pm mocked and there are many 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.279
 others the semester 

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:13.929
 this was their relationship in traffic and confusing not even in car training with the 

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:14.829
 same car 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.409
 and we have with that work there that besides running and trauma in the head and that 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:21.769
 ends up causing more disorder, it makes a pair of the profession, we get people to 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.929
 sale in the corridor is going to take jobs to us 

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:27.889
 from late afternoon the car is so modern plus nothing good service the correct motoboy 

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:30.039
 even the woman 

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:34.169
 is very bad and much more is understood in the traffic naetran is chaotic 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:38.569
 the taxis are the interns with motoboys we filmed or the bus driver 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.599
 it is not understood that the taxi driver there is not understood as tubes to be sefaz and that 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.529
 put now to motoboy also became a mess no one means 

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:47.969
 nobody did the same 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:52.919
 motoboy has to drive by itself and for everyone, we really do not have to be 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:54.709
 smart are not all 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.849
 giving a tone I'm telling you that they're all like that right 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:02.969
 It may be that the one expected is talking but most motoboys then 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:05.619
 profession of 

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:08.149
 at the height of small islands 

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:11.129
 we have that is a bit more important biker agent also not 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.129
 rival that also makes a lot of difference 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:18.569
 that's not anyone I know people who work one day 

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:19.749
 one day and no more
