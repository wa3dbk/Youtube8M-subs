00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
about it we had a ninja 1000 for the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.939 
about it we had a ninja 1000 for the
last<00:00:19.260> couple<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.710> years<00:00:19.920> now<00:00:21.650> looks<00:00:22.650> pretty

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
last couple of years now looks pretty

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.200 
last couple of years now looks pretty
much<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.160> same<00:00:24.050> but<00:00:25.050> there<00:00:25.199> are<00:00:25.350> some<00:00:25.500> changes

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
much the same but there are some changes

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.630 
much the same but there are some changes
this<00:00:27.210> it's<00:00:27.720> only<00:00:28.019> available<00:00:28.680> with<00:00:28.859> ABS<00:00:29.340> for

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
this it's only available with ABS for

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.810 
this it's only available with ABS for
2014<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.630> then<00:00:31.410> now<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.679> traction<00:00:32.430> control

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
2014 and then now the traction control

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.240 
2014 and then now the traction control
has<00:00:32.850> also<00:00:33.300> been<00:00:33.600> added<00:00:34.040> so<00:00:35.040> we've<00:00:35.130> got

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
has also been added so we've got

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.569 
has also been added so we've got
traction<00:00:35.579> control<00:00:36.180> abs<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.710> standard<00:00:38.250> on<00:00:38.430> it

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
traction control abs is standard on it

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.630 
traction control abs is standard on it
now<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.290> then<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.410> also<00:00:40.649> have<00:00:40.950> power<00:00:41.190> modes

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
now and then you also have power modes

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.959 
now and then you also have power modes
so<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.360> can<00:00:42.540> have<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.020> button<00:00:43.410> on<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.620> dash<00:00:43.969> but

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
so you can have a button on the dash but

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.410 
so you can have a button on the dash but
that's<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.300> reduce<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.840> power<00:00:47.090> so<00:00:48.090> you've<00:00:48.270> got

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
that's to reduce the power so you've got

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.180 
that's to reduce the power so you've got
a<00:00:48.450> little<00:00:48.690> switch<00:00:49.500> here<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.860> that's<00:00:50.010> going<00:00:50.129> to

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
a little switch here and that's going to

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.040 
a little switch here and that's going to
let<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.430> select<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.940> traction<00:00:51.420> control<00:00:51.449> in

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
let you select the traction control in

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.170 
let you select the traction control in
the<00:00:52.710> power<00:00:52.920> modes<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.550> will<00:00:53.670> be<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.940> dash

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
the power modes and will be on the dash

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.270 
the power modes and will be on the dash
there's<00:00:54.539> three<00:00:54.750> different<00:00:54.920> traction<00:00:55.920> control

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
there's three different traction control

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.029 
there's three different traction control
modes<00:00:57.440> and<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.680> can<00:00:58.800> turn<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.010> traction

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
modes and you can turn the traction

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.650 
modes and you can turn the traction
control<00:00:59.340> off<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.120> there's<00:01:00.390> going<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.539> be<00:01:00.600> a

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
control off and there's going to be a

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.700 
control off and there's going to be a
full<00:01:00.930> power<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.530> low<00:01:01.710> power<00:01:01.949> mode<00:01:03.500> with<00:01:04.500> low

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
full power in a low power mode with low

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.140 
full power in a low power mode with low
power<00:01:04.949> being<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.400> buff<00:01:05.939> lis<00:01:06.180> 70%<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:08.150> available

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
power being a buff lis 70% of available

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.740 
power being a buff lis 70% of available
power<00:01:10.310> so<00:01:11.310> let's<00:01:11.670> see<00:01:11.820> what<00:01:12.000> else<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.330> new<00:01:12.510> one

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
power so let's see what else is new one

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.240 
power so let's see what else is new one
of<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.900> things<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.200> notice<00:01:13.530> that's<00:01:13.740> new<00:01:13.979> is

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
of the things I notice that's new is

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.380 
of the things I notice that's new is
this<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.420> gesture<00:01:16.140> for<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.650> shock<00:01:17.150> so<00:01:18.150> this

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
this is a gesture for the shock so this

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.539 
this is a gesture for the shock so this
lets<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.840> stiffen<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.650> soften<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.340> rear

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
lets you stiffen and soften the rear

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.690 
lets you stiffen and soften the rear
shock<00:01:20.930> spring<00:01:21.930> tension<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:23.310> if<00:01:23.549> you're

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700

shock spring tension so if you're
carrying<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.030> passenger<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.659> can<00:01:24.810> stiffen<00:01:25.080> it

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
carrying a passenger you can stiffen it

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.230 
carrying a passenger you can stiffen it
up<00:01:25.290> if<00:01:25.530> you've<00:01:25.680> got<00:01:25.860> luggage<00:01:26.729> or<00:01:26.970> gear

strapped on the bike you can stiffen it

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.039 
strapped on the bike you can stiffen it
up<00:01:29.369> real<00:01:29.729> easily<00:01:29.939> just<00:01:30.360> by<00:01:30.509> turning<00:01:30.570> right

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
up real easily just by turning right

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.499 
up real easily just by turning right
here<00:01:31.350> no<00:01:31.650> special<00:01:32.130> tools<00:01:32.369> required<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:33.479> can

here no special tools required you can
turn<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.350> feel<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.590> little<00:01:34.890> flick<00:01:36.079> so<00:01:37.079> you

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
turn this you feel a little flick so you

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.530 
turn this you feel a little flick so you
can<00:01:37.290> count<00:01:37.530> your<00:01:37.680> clicks<00:01:37.979> -<00:01:38.220> clicks<00:01:38.369> in<00:01:38.759> look

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
can count your clicks - clicks in look

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.170 
can count your clicks - clicks in look
back<00:01:40.110> out<00:01:40.350> -<00:01:40.590> clicks

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
back out - clicks

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.900 
back out - clicks
so<00:01:42.600> it's<00:01:42.780> got<00:01:42.930> some<00:01:42.960> flex<00:01:43.410> to<00:01:43.650> it<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.880> can

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
so it's got some flex to it so you can

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.580 
so it's got some flex to it so you can
kind<00:01:45.150> of<00:01:45.180> keep<00:01:45.360> track<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.840> your<00:01:45.930> setting<00:01:46.320> where

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
kind of keep track of your setting where

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.090 
kind of keep track of your setting where
you're<00:01:46.740> at

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
you're at

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.730 
you're at
countless<00:01:47.400> clicks<00:01:48.080> the<00:01:49.080> mufflers<00:01:49.530> are<00:01:49.710> a

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
countless clicks the mufflers are a

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.740 
countless clicks the mufflers are a
little<00:01:49.950> different

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
little different

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.830

let's see what else news new 6th gear in

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.050 
let's see what else news new 6th gear in
this<00:01:54.990> bike<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.470> six<00:01:55.770> gears<00:01:56.010> now<00:01:56.280> taller<00:01:56.670> so

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
this bike so six gears now taller so

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.690 
this bike so six gears now taller so
going<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.300> reduce<00:01:57.600> rpms<00:01:58.440> and<00:01:58.590> sixth<00:01:59.400> gear

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
going to reduce rpms and sixth gear

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.000 
going to reduce rpms and sixth gear
front<00:02:00.600> brake<00:02:00.840> calipers<00:02:01.350> are<00:02:01.500> different<00:02:01.860> these

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
are a four piston monoblock caliper so

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.660 
are a four piston monoblock caliper so
what<00:02:06.120> does<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.240> mean<00:02:06.570> monoblock<00:02:07.670> it's

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
what does that mean monoblock it's

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.310 
what does that mean monoblock it's
already<00:02:09.030> it's<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.270> Rayleigh<00:02:09.720> mounted<00:02:10.050> four

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
already it's a Rayleigh mounted four

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.830 
already it's a Rayleigh mounted four
piston<00:02:10.710> caliper<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:11.760> we've<00:02:12.000> got<00:02:12.150> most<00:02:12.420> readily

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
piston caliper so we've got most readily

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.110 
piston caliper so we've got most readily
mounted<00:02:13.440> four<00:02:13.980> piston<00:02:14.400> there's<00:02:14.550> two<00:02:14.730> Pistons

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
mounted four piston there's two Pistons

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.150 
mounted four piston there's two Pistons
here<00:02:15.420> two<00:02:15.960> Pistons<00:02:16.410> on<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.710> back<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:17.100> the

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
here two Pistons on the back of the

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.590 
here two Pistons on the back of the
caliper<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.790> you've<00:02:17.910> got<00:02:18.060> this<00:02:18.240> on<00:02:18.420> two

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
caliper and you've got this on two

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.200 
caliper and you've got this on two
different<00:02:18.780> two<00:02:19.140> calipers<00:02:19.620> so<00:02:20.430> total<00:02:20.970> of<00:02:21.030> eight

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
different two calipers so total of eight

Pistons<00:02:21.720> on<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:21.960> front<00:02:22.760> but<00:02:23.760> what<00:02:23.940> does

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
Pistons on the front but what does

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.240 
Pistons on the front but what does
monoblock<00:02:24.660> me<00:02:24.900> monoblock<00:02:25.680> means<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.070> this

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
monoblock me monoblock means that this

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.270 
monoblock me monoblock means that this
caliper<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:27.120> brake<00:02:27.330> caliper<00:02:27.840> is<00:02:27.990> one<00:02:28.830> piece

they're<00:02:32.610> not<00:02:32.760> all<00:02:32.840> most<00:02:33.840> of<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.230> calipers

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
they're not all most of the calipers

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.710 
they're not all most of the calipers
that<00:02:34.770> you<00:02:35.100> see<00:02:35.280> on<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.520> old<00:02:37.100> 1000<00:02:38.120> into<00:02:39.120> 1000

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
that you see on the old 1000 into 1000

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.900 
that you see on the old 1000 into 1000
even<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.110> current<00:02:40.500> policy<00:02:40.920> extends<00:02:41.310> are<00:02:41.580> a

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
even the current policy extends are a

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.640 
even the current policy extends are a
two-piece<00:02:42.510> caliper<00:02:43.020> and<00:02:43.170> they're<00:02:43.260> bolted

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
two-piece caliper and they're bolted

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.110 
two-piece caliper and they're bolted
together<00:02:43.770> now<00:02:44.520> when<00:02:44.700> you<00:02:44.790> look<00:02:44.940> at<00:02:45.030> the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
together now when you look at the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.460 
together now when you look at the
caliper<00:02:45.510> from<00:02:45.600> this<00:02:45.780> side<00:02:45.960> you<00:02:45.990> don't<00:02:46.290> see

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
caliper from this side you don't see

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.780 
caliper from this side you don't see
that<00:02:46.620> because<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:47.010> bolts<00:02:47.310> are<00:02:47.400> on<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.580> back

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
that because the bolts are on the back

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.850 
that because the bolts are on the back
but<00:02:48.060> if<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.239> look<00:02:48.390> at<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.600> backside<00:02:49.170> of<00:02:49.500> the

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
but if you look at the backside of the

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.800 
but if you look at the backside of the
caliper<00:02:50.250> from<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.640> other<00:02:50.760> side<00:02:51.030> you'll<00:02:51.720> see

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
caliper from the other side you'll see

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.900 
caliper from the other side you'll see
those<00:02:52.230> bolts<00:02:52.709> bolting<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.250> caliper<00:02:53.640> together

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
those bolts bolting the caliper together

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.710 
those bolts bolting the caliper together
it's<00:02:54.150> two<00:02:54.480> pieces<00:02:54.989> so<00:02:55.880> this<00:02:56.880> is<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.060> one-piece

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
it's two pieces so this is a one-piece

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.130 
it's two pieces so this is a one-piece
caliper<00:02:58.290> monoblock<00:02:59.100> caliper<00:02:59.840> the<00:03:00.840> may<00:03:00.959> by

caliper monoblock caliper the may by

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.440 
caliper monoblock caliper the may by
Tokiko<00:03:02.030> it's<00:03:03.030> got<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.239> Kawasaki<00:03:03.690> logo<00:03:04.140> on<00:03:04.410> it

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
Tokiko it's got the Kawasaki logo on it

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.270 
Tokiko it's got the Kawasaki logo on it
but<00:03:06.450> one<00:03:06.959> piece<00:03:07.080> Kelly<00:03:07.320> is<00:03:07.500> that<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:07.709> huge<00:03:07.980> deal

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
but one piece Kelly is that a huge deal

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.030 
but one piece Kelly is that a huge deal
well<00:03:09.030> I<00:03:09.360> don't<00:03:10.170> know<00:03:10.260> it's<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.560> huge<00:03:10.800> deal<00:03:10.980> for

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
well I don't know it's a huge deal for

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.020 
well I don't know it's a huge deal for
most<00:03:11.459> of<00:03:11.670> us<00:03:11.840> this<00:03:12.840> is<00:03:13.020> a<00:03:13.050> more<00:03:13.380> expensive<00:03:14.030> way

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
most of us this is a more expensive way

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.970 
most of us this is a more expensive way
to<00:03:15.090> make<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.480> caliper<00:03:15.870> it's<00:03:16.110> harder<00:03:16.860> to

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
to make the caliper it's harder to

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.570 
to make the caliper it's harder to
machine<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:17.430> all<00:03:17.610> in<00:03:17.820> one<00:03:18.000> piece<00:03:18.440> and<00:03:19.440> so

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
machine it all in one piece and so

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.430 
machine it all in one piece and so
your<00:03:21.000> machine<00:03:21.270> to<00:03:21.420> pieces<00:03:21.870> that<00:03:22.050> holds<00:03:22.320> it

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
your machine to pieces that holds it

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.030 
your machine to pieces that holds it
together<00:03:22.530> so<00:03:23.490> takes<00:03:24.090> more<00:03:24.390> time<00:03:24.900> to<00:03:25.830> make<00:03:26.010> it

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
together so takes more time to make it

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.190 
together so takes more time to make it
some<00:03:26.340> more<00:03:26.550> maybe<00:03:26.940> precision<00:03:27.540> part<00:03:27.840> there's

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
some more maybe precision part there's

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.110 
some more maybe precision part there's
not<00:03:28.380> going<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.620> be<00:03:28.710> any<00:03:28.830> movement<00:03:29.370> between<00:03:29.820> the

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
not going to be any movement between the

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.760 
not going to be any movement between the
two<00:03:30.300> halves<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.720> caliber<00:03:31.140> there<00:03:31.290> probably

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
two halves the caliber there probably

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.380 
two halves the caliber there probably
isn't<00:03:32.040> in<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.400> other<00:03:32.580> ones<00:03:32.820> because<00:03:33.120> we<00:03:33.240> don't

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
isn't in the other ones because we don't

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.330 
isn't in the other ones because we don't
seem<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:33.660> have<00:03:33.780> problems<00:03:34.200> for<00:03:34.320> those<00:03:34.470> but<00:03:35.100> it's

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
seem to have problems for those but it's

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
seem to have problems for those but it's
a<00:03:35.430> pretty<00:03:35.610> cool<00:03:35.790> feature

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
a pretty cool feature

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.720

so monobloc calipers of course you've

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.360 
so monobloc calipers of course you've

has a horizontal shock a horizontal
horizontal<00:04:21.150> factory<00:04:21.930> if<00:04:22.019> they<00:04:22.109> call<00:04:22.320> it<00:04:22.470> so

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
horizontal factory if they call it so

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.620 
horizontal factory if they call it so
the<00:04:23.040> shock<00:04:23.310> is<00:04:23.520> running<00:04:23.790> like<00:04:23.940> this<00:04:24.180> then

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
the shock is running like this then

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.960 
the shock is running like this then
there's<00:04:24.780> a<00:04:24.840> piece<00:04:24.990> of<00:04:25.140> linkage<00:04:25.550> works<00:04:26.550> in<00:04:26.760> like

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
there's a piece of linkage works in like

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.690 
there's a piece of linkage works in like
that<00:04:27.530> it's<00:04:28.530> a<00:04:28.620> wide<00:04:28.830> Malka<00:04:29.190> shock<00:04:29.460> like<00:04:29.669> that

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
that it's a wide Malka shock like that

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.550 
that it's a wide Malka shock like that
one<00:04:30.090> of<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.270> reasons<00:04:30.630> the<00:04:30.750> collar<00:04:30.960> cycle<00:04:31.380> did

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
one of the reasons the collar cycle did

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.250 
one of the reasons the collar cycle did
that<00:04:31.910> was<00:04:32.910> that<00:04:33.060> putting<00:04:33.540> the<00:04:33.570> shock<00:04:33.870> up<00:04:34.080> here

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
that was that putting the shock up here

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.560 
that was that putting the shock up here
gets<00:04:34.500> it<00:04:34.620> away<00:04:34.710> from<00:04:35.040> the<00:04:35.190> exhaust<00:04:35.490> the<00:04:36.270> cooler

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
gets it away from the exhaust the cooler

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.290 
gets it away from the exhaust the cooler
that<00:04:36.900> shock<00:04:37.260> stays<00:04:37.800> the<00:04:38.610> cooler<00:04:38.910> of<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:39.060> oil

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
that shock stays the cooler of the oil

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.370 
that shock stays the cooler of the oil
stay<00:04:40.040> the<00:04:41.040> better<00:04:41.820> suspension<00:04:42.690> action<00:04:43.260> you're

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
stay the better suspension action you're

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.659 
stay the better suspension action you're
going<00:04:43.470> to<00:04:43.560> have<00:04:43.740> the<00:04:43.919> shocks<00:04:44.160> not<00:04:44.430> going<00:04:44.550> to<00:04:44.610> be

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
going to have the shocks not going to be

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.480 
going to have the shocks not going to be
heating<00:04:45.000> up<00:04:45.180> a<00:04:45.530> lot<00:04:46.530> and<00:04:46.860> it's<00:04:47.070> just<00:04:47.250> going<00:04:47.400> to

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
heating up a lot and it's just going to

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.280 
heating up a lot and it's just going to
provide<00:04:47.790> better<00:04:48.060> suspension<00:04:48.600> action<00:04:49.140> so<00:04:49.260> that

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
provide better suspension action so that

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.690 
provide better suspension action so that
was<00:04:49.500> one<00:04:49.680> of<00:04:49.740> the<00:04:49.800> benefits<00:04:50.160> of<00:04:50.280> moving<00:04:50.400> that

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
was one of the benefits of moving that

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.330 
was one of the benefits of moving that
shock<00:04:50.970> up<00:04:51.630> there<00:04:52.020> of<00:04:52.650> course<00:04:52.890> when<00:04:53.040> we<00:04:53.100> look<00:04:53.280> at

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
shock up there of course when we look at

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
shock up there of course when we look at
the<00:04:53.490> rear<00:04:53.669> wheel<00:04:54.290> you<00:04:55.290> can<00:04:55.470> see<00:04:55.710> the<00:04:56.360> sensors

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
the rear wheel you can see the sensors

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.620 
the rear wheel you can see the sensors
for<00:04:57.630> the<00:04:57.690> traction<00:04:58.110> control<00:04:58.500> and<00:04:58.770> abs<00:04:59.630> these

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
for the traction control and abs these

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.659 
for the traction control and abs these
are<00:05:00.750> what<00:05:00.840> they<00:05:00.960> call<00:05:00.990> eccentric<00:05:01.710> chain

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
are what they call eccentric chain

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.469 
are what they call eccentric chain
adjusters<00:05:03.210> so<00:05:03.450> this<00:05:03.690> moves<00:05:04.850> like<00:05:05.850> on<00:05:06.180> a<00:05:06.210> cam

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
adjusters so this moves like on a cam

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.409 
adjusters so this moves like on a cam
all<00:05:06.780> those<00:05:06.990> to<00:05:07.640> adjust<00:05:08.640> the<00:05:08.760> chain<00:05:08.970> for<00:05:09.330> the

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
all those to adjust the chain for the

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.510 
all those to adjust the chain for the
cool<00:05:09.620> I've<00:05:10.620> always<00:05:10.919> loved<00:05:11.100> those<00:05:11.250> five

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
cool I've always loved those five

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.230 
cool I've always loved those five
adjusters<00:05:13.520> you<00:05:14.520> know<00:05:14.610> lots<00:05:14.820> of<00:05:14.970> little<00:05:15.180> things

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
adjusters you know lots of little things

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.420 
adjusters you know lots of little things
for<00:05:15.479> this<00:05:15.630> bike<00:05:15.840> this<00:05:16.050> bike<00:05:16.260> is<00:05:16.500> a<00:05:16.680> is<00:05:16.950> a<00:05:17.010> sport

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
really a great bike it's probably what

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.630 
really a great bike it's probably what
most<00:05:25.080> of<00:05:25.320> us<00:05:25.470> should<00:05:25.950> be<00:05:25.979> riding<00:05:26.430> on<00:05:26.520> the

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
most of us should be riding on the

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.620 
most of us should be riding on the
street<00:05:26.700> because<00:05:27.690> it<00:05:27.840> really<00:05:29.030> rides<00:05:30.030> good<00:05:30.419> it's

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
street because it really rides good it's

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:31.909 
street because it really rides good it's
got<00:05:30.750> a<00:05:30.780> more<00:05:30.960> comfortable<00:05:31.200> seat<00:05:31.650> a<00:05:31.800> little

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
got a more comfortable seat a little

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:33.950 
got a more comfortable seat a little
more<00:05:32.220> of<00:05:32.280> an<00:05:32.370> upright<00:05:32.760> riding<00:05:32.910> position<00:05:33.090> yeah

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
more of an upright riding position yeah

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.930 
more of an upright riding position yeah
it<00:05:34.080> really<00:05:34.260> does<00:05:34.530> have<00:05:34.770> top-notch<00:05:35.100> suspension

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940
