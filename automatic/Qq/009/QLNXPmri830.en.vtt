00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:15.139 
spectra because I wanted to do this

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:17.229 
spectra because I wanted to do this
video<00:04:15.290> so<00:04:15.590> I<00:04:15.650> looked<00:04:15.860> for<00:04:16.010> a<00:04:16.039> cool<00:04:16.220> face<00:04:16.970> chart

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
video so I looked for a cool face chart

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.069 
video so I looked for a cool face chart
and<00:04:17.650> there's<00:04:18.650> many<00:04:19.549> so<00:04:20.120> this<00:04:20.659> is<00:04:20.780> the<00:04:20.900> one<00:04:21.049> I

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
and there's many so this is the one I

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:21.819 
and there's many so this is the one I
did<00:04:21.260> it's<00:04:21.470> from

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
did it's from

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.589 
did it's from
coming<00:04:22.159> monogram<00:04:22.520> collection<00:04:22.939> except<00:04:23.509> I

couldn't<00:04:23.810> really<00:04:23.900> see<00:04:24.050> the<00:04:24.139> details<00:04:24.500> because

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
couldn't really see the details because

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.460 
couldn't really see the details because
you<00:04:25.550> know<00:04:25.669> it<00:04:26.240> hasn't<00:04:26.419> came<00:04:26.629> out<00:04:26.780> yet<00:04:26.960> so<00:04:27.139> i

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
you know it hasn't came out yet so i

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:28.749 
you know it hasn't came out yet so i
might<00:04:27.710> look<00:04:27.889> completely<00:04:28.220> different<00:04:28.340> one<00:04:28.669> in

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:28.759 
might look completely different one in

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.189 
might look completely different one in
dust<00:04:28.939> come<00:04:29.090> out<00:04:29.180> but<00:04:29.360> that's<00:04:29.509> okay<00:04:29.780> because<00:04:29.810> i

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 
dust come out but that's okay because i

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:33.429 
dust come out but that's okay because i
think<00:04:30.259> this<00:04:30.500> looks<00:04:30.740> really<00:04:30.919> cool<00:04:32.139> so<00:04:33.139> we<00:04:33.259> can't

00:04:33.429 --> 00:04:33.439 
think this looks really cool so we can't

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:39.520 
think this looks really cool so we can't
