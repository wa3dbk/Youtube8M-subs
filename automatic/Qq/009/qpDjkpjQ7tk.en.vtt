like that very boring anyway on to the
phone<00:02:11.450> itself<00:02:11.750> so<00:02:12.680> as<00:02:12.830> we<00:02:12.980> take<00:02:13.130> this<00:02:13.220> plastic

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
phone itself so as we take this plastic

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.480 
phone itself so as we take this plastic
off<00:02:13.930> you<00:02:14.930> can<00:02:15.110> actually<00:02:15.230> see<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.890> phone<00:02:16.190> is<00:02:16.460> in

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
off you can actually see the phone is in

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.140 
off you can actually see the phone is in
this<00:02:17.050> protective<00:02:18.050> film<00:02:18.380> front<00:02:18.710> and<00:02:18.890> back<00:02:19.150> so

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
this protective film front and back so

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.780 
this protective film front and back so
let's<00:02:20.480> just<00:02:20.540> peel<00:02:20.870> that<00:02:21.080> off<00:02:21.140> quickly<00:02:24.790> that's

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
let's just peel that off quickly that's

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.410 
let's just peel that off quickly that's
one<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:28.400> second<00:02:28.760> one<00:02:30.700> too<00:02:31.700> okay<00:02:32.360> so

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
one and the second one too okay so

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.580 
one and the second one too okay so
starting<00:02:32.750> from<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.930> left<00:02:32.959> hand<00:02:33.200> side<00:02:33.290> you<00:02:33.470> can

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
starting from the left hand side you can

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.440 
starting from the left hand side you can
see<00:02:33.620> there<00:02:33.860> is<00:02:33.920> a<00:02:33.950> port<00:02:34.250> there<00:02:34.459> I<00:02:34.640> think<00:02:35.240> that

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
see there is a port there I think that

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.570 
see there is a port there I think that
is<00:02:35.570> a<00:02:35.600> language<00:02:35.870> strap<00:02:36.320> not<00:02:36.590> 100%<00:02:37.160> sure<00:02:37.190> but

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
is a language strap not 100% sure but

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.850 
is a language strap not 100% sure but
I'm<00:02:37.700> pretty<00:02:37.730> sure<00:02:38.000> that's<00:02:38.240> for<00:02:38.510> a<00:02:38.540> lanyard<00:02:38.860> you

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
I'm pretty sure that's for a lanyard you

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.190 
I'm pretty sure that's for a lanyard you
got<00:02:40.010> your<00:02:40.720> magnetic<00:02:41.720> dock<00:02:42.320> and<00:02:42.620> charger

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
got your magnetic dock and charger

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.680 
got your magnetic dock and charger
section<00:02:45.200> right<00:02:45.380> there<00:02:45.440> so<00:02:45.830> you<00:02:45.920> can<00:02:46.130> dock<00:02:46.400> it

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
section right there so you can dock it

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.250 
section right there so you can dock it
under<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:47.810> first<00:02:48.170> flap<00:02:48.970> see<00:02:49.970> there<00:02:50.870> we<00:02:50.959> go<00:02:51.080> so

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
under the first flap see there we go so

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.770 
under the first flap see there we go so
that's<00:02:51.470> where<00:02:51.709> your<00:02:51.920> micro<00:02:52.310> USB<00:02:52.700> port<00:02:53.000> is<00:02:53.180> for

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
that's where your micro USB port is for

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.140 
that's where your micro USB port is for
charging<00:02:54.230> and<00:02:54.320> syncing<00:02:54.760> if<00:02:55.760> we<00:02:55.850> look<00:02:55.970> at<00:02:56.030> the

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
charging and syncing if we look at the

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.229 
charging and syncing if we look at the
top<00:02:57.130> you<00:02:58.130> can<00:02:58.220> see<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.489> three<00:02:58.670> and<00:02:58.790> a<00:02:58.820> half<00:02:58.850> mil

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
top you can see the three and a half mil

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.810 
top you can see the three and a half mil
headphone<00:02:59.900> jack<00:03:00.110> and<00:03:00.140> a<00:03:00.350> microphone<00:03:00.860> and<00:03:01.100> as

headphone jack and a microphone and as

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.850 
headphone jack and a microphone and as
we<00:03:01.970> keep<00:03:02.120> turning<00:03:02.480> around<00:03:02.600> you<00:03:03.470> can<00:03:03.590> see<00:03:03.620> this

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
we keep turning around you can see this

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.530 
we keep turning around you can see this
is<00:03:03.980> where<00:03:04.130> your<00:03:04.280> micro<00:03:04.700> SD<00:03:05.060> card<00:03:05.330> goes

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
is where your micro SD card goes

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.840 
is where your micro SD card goes
anything<00:03:06.050> else<00:03:06.200> under<00:03:06.440> there<00:03:06.590> and<00:03:06.800> just<00:03:07.700> sim

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
anything else under there and just sim

anything else under there and just sim
card<00:03:08.090> of<00:03:08.209> course<00:03:08.420> I'm<00:03:08.510> pretty<00:03:08.720> sure<00:03:08.930> it

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
card of course I'm pretty sure it

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.720 
card of course I'm pretty sure it
actually<00:03:09.170> takes<00:03:09.470> a<00:03:09.590> nano<00:03:09.770> SIM<00:03:10.070> card<00:03:10.310> there<00:03:10.520> but

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
actually takes a nano SIM card there but

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.780 
actually takes a nano SIM card there but
it<00:03:10.820> does<00:03:10.940> take<00:03:11.120> a<00:03:11.180> micro<00:03:11.720> SD<00:03:11.870> card<00:03:12.709> up<00:03:12.860> to<00:03:12.980> 128

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
it does take a micro SD card up to 128

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.970 
it does take a micro SD card up to 128

variants but you can expand it of course
okay<00:03:21.110> here<00:03:21.320> you<00:03:21.410> have<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.650> power/lock<00:03:22.130> key

and that is a volume rocker button and

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.250 
and that is a volume rocker button and
something<00:03:26.120> I<00:03:26.180> really<00:03:26.450> like<00:03:26.630> to<00:03:26.780> see<00:03:26.930> I<00:03:26.959> wish

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
something I really like to see I wish

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.289 
something I really like to see I wish
most<00:03:27.500> phones<00:03:27.799> would<00:03:28.100> incorporate<00:03:28.459> this<00:03:28.850> but

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
most phones would incorporate this but

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:30.759 
most phones would incorporate this but
there<00:03:29.420> is<00:03:29.540> a<00:03:29.570> camera<00:03:29.870> shutter<00:03:30.230> button<00:03:30.590> just

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
there is a camera shutter button just

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.590 
there is a camera shutter button just
there<00:03:30.890> as<00:03:31.190> well<00:03:31.400> and<00:03:32.030> at<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.209> bottom<00:03:32.330> is

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
there as well and at the bottom is

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.900 
there as well and at the bottom is
completely<00:03:33.110> clean<00:03:33.380> okay<00:03:34.310> so<00:03:34.370> as<00:03:34.580> we<00:03:34.700> look<00:03:34.730> at

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
completely clean okay so as we look at

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.580 
completely clean okay so as we look at
the<00:03:35.000> top<00:03:35.239> you<00:03:35.420> can<00:03:35.540> see<00:03:35.600> there<00:03:36.049> is<00:03:36.140> a<00:03:36.170> speaker

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
the top you can see there is a speaker

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.050 
the top you can see there is a speaker
there<00:03:36.769> and<00:03:36.890> a<00:03:36.950> speaker<00:03:37.340> there<00:03:37.549> hopefully

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
there and a speaker there hopefully

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.210 
there and a speaker there hopefully
first<00:03:38.480> some<00:03:38.690> stereo<00:03:39.140> loudspeaker<00:03:39.860> a<00:03:39.890> bit<00:03:40.100> like

the<00:03:40.310> HTC<00:03:41.350> very<00:03:42.350> unlikely<00:03:42.739> to<00:03:42.980> be<00:03:43.010> as<00:03:43.190> powerful

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
the HTC very unlikely to be as powerful

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.180 
the HTC very unlikely to be as powerful
as<00:03:43.670> HTC<00:03:44.030> but<00:03:44.540> still<00:03:44.959> it's<00:03:45.290> good<00:03:45.410> that<00:03:46.040> they've

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
as HTC but still it's good that they've

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.920 
as HTC but still it's good that they've
incorporated<00:03:46.519> that<00:03:47.120> you've<00:03:47.810> got<00:03:47.900> a

incorporated that you've got a

as<00:03:58.310> well<00:03:58.489> with<00:03:58.670> experian<00:03:59.239> othing<00:03:59.540> else<00:03:59.660> there

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
as well with experian othing else there

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.350 
as well with experian othing else there
so<00:04:00.440> this<00:04:00.769> rear<00:04:01.130> facing<00:04:01.370> camera<00:04:01.820> is<00:04:01.880> capable<00:04:02.090> of

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
so this rear facing camera is capable of

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.860 
so this rear facing camera is capable of
4k<00:04:02.930> at<00:04:02.989> 30<00:04:03.290> frames<00:04:03.530> per<00:04:03.739> second<00:04:04.190> 1080p<00:04:05.150> at<00:04:05.360> 60

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
4k at 30 frames per second 1080p at 60

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.759

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
and 720p at 120 days per second so let's

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.440 
and 720p at 120 days per second so let's
get<00:04:09.890> this<00:04:09.980> thing<00:04:10.040> powered<00:04:10.430> up<00:04:10.549> five<00:04:11.000> point<00:04:11.329> two

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
get this thing powered up five point two

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.110 
get this thing powered up five point two

I<00:05:09.259> do<00:05:09.319> like<00:05:09.620> with<00:05:09.979> this<00:05:10.069> phone<00:05:10.340> is<00:05:10.550> that<00:05:11.060> they

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
I do like with this phone is that they

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.730 
I do like with this phone is that they
have<00:05:11.449> curved<00:05:11.779> the<00:05:11.930> edges<00:05:12.169> compared<00:05:12.500> to<00:05:12.620> the

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
have curved the edges compared to the

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.670 
have curved the edges compared to the
previous<00:05:12.979> Sony's<00:05:13.580> in<00:05:14.449> fact<00:05:14.659> the<00:05:14.930> Sony<00:05:15.110> said<00:05:15.349> 12

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
previous Sony's in fact the Sony said 12

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.740 
previous Sony's in fact the Sony said 12
the<00:05:15.800> z2<00:05:16.159> was<00:05:16.340> pretty<00:05:16.639> much<00:05:16.729> identical<00:05:16.909> and

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
the z2 was pretty much identical and

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.629 
the z2 was pretty much identical and
this<00:05:18.590> one<00:05:18.740> at<00:05:18.860> least<00:05:18.949> they've<00:05:19.219> curved<00:05:19.520> the

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
this one at least they've curved the

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.269 
this one at least they've curved the
edges<00:05:19.969> it<00:05:20.779> is<00:05:20.960> i<00:05:21.139> want<00:05:21.500> nearly<00:05:21.770> drop<00:05:21.949> that<00:05:22.069> then

00:05:22.269 --> 00:05:22.279 
edges it is i want nearly drop that then

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:24.040 
edges it is i want nearly drop that then
so<00:05:22.550> probably<00:05:23.090> a<00:05:23.150> little<00:05:23.270> bit<00:05:23.449> too<00:05:23.659> slippy

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
so probably a little bit too slippy

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.140 
so probably a little bit too slippy
still<00:05:24.319> butter<00:05:24.620> put<00:05:25.370> a<00:05:25.430> case<00:05:25.610> on<00:05:25.639> there<00:05:25.909> that'll

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
still butter put a case on there that'll

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.529 
still butter put a case on there that'll
be<00:05:26.240> fine<00:05:26.889> but<00:05:27.889> it<00:05:28.219> is<00:05:28.669> still<00:05:28.940> very<00:05:29.000> much<00:05:29.300> like

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:29.539 
be fine but it is still very much like

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:31.029 
be fine but it is still very much like
the<00:05:29.690> others<00:05:30.020> which<00:05:30.319> is<00:05:30.440> not<00:05:30.560> necessarily<00:05:30.710> a

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 
the others which is not necessarily a

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.089 
the others which is not necessarily a
bad<00:05:31.219> thing<00:05:31.330> it's<00:05:32.330> just<00:05:32.479> I<00:05:32.840> probably<00:05:33.770> would've

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
bad thing it's just I probably would've

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.399 
bad thing it's just I probably would've
called<00:05:34.340> it<00:05:34.490> a<00:05:34.520> Zed<00:05:34.759> 3<00:05:35.090> you<00:05:35.750> know<00:05:35.870> like<00:05:36.080> kind<00:05:36.349> of

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:36.409 
called it a Zed 3 you know like kind of

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:38.980 
called it a Zed 3 you know like kind of
z2<00:05:37.009> s<00:05:37.039> then<00:05:37.849> again<00:05:38.089> the<00:05:38.330> Zed<00:05:38.479> to<00:05:38.659> was<00:05:38.810> a<00:05:38.839> bit

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
z2 s then again the Zed to was a bit

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.079 
z2 s then again the Zed to was a bit
like<00:05:39.110> the<00:05:39.229> Zed<00:05:39.379> one<00:05:39.620> so<00:05:39.830> maybe<00:05:39.949> I<00:05:40.069> said<00:05:40.279> 1s<00:05:40.699> but

00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:41.089 
like the Zed one so maybe I said 1s but

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:42.939 
like the Zed one so maybe I said 1s but
anyway<00:05:41.360> let's<00:05:41.629> have<00:05:41.839> a<00:05:41.900> look<00:05:42.050> around<00:05:42.199> the<00:05:42.440> OSC

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:42.949 
anyway let's have a look around the OSC

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:44.230 
anyway let's have a look around the OSC
