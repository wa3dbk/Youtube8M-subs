00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
night and I think the few people kind of

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.560 
night and I think the few people kind of
go<00:00:20.010> into<00:00:20.160> bed<00:00:20.340> maybe<00:00:20.550> thinking<00:00:21.060> about<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.449> and

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
go into bed maybe thinking about it and

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
last thing we want is to do a long

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.020 
last thing we want is to do a long
yesterday<00:01:10.979> we<00:01:11.220> need<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.400> learn<00:01:11.520> from<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.880> and

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030

you<00:01:12.840> always<00:01:12.960> learn<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.229> lot<00:01:13.409> more<00:01:13.470> when<00:01:13.740> you

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
you always learn a lot more when you

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.620 
you always learn a lot more when you
lose<00:01:13.979> than<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.220> do<00:01:14.400> when<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.610> win<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:15.509> they'll

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
lose than you do when you win so they'll

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.999 
lose than you do when you win so they'll
be<00:01:15.720> massive<00:01:16.020> lessons<00:01:16.320> learned<00:01:16.500> when<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.680> will

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
be massive lessons learned when I will

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.429 
be massive lessons learned when I will
analyze<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.490> game<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.420> just<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.900> know<00:01:18.960> find

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
analyze the game and just you know find

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.990 
analyze the game and just you know find
out<00:01:19.619> why<00:01:19.799> we<00:01:20.009> didn't<00:01:20.189> perform<00:01:20.310> really<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:20.909> why

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
out why we didn't perform really and why

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.490 
out why we didn't perform really and why
we<00:01:21.180> kind<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.659> looks<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.900> little<00:01:21.990> bit<00:01:22.140> nervy

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
we kind of looks a little bit nervy

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.499 
we kind of looks a little bit nervy
hopefully<00:01:23.490> now<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.700> opening<00:01:24.090> games<00:01:24.270> out<00:01:24.479> of

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
hopefully now that opening games out of

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.820 
hopefully now that opening games out of
the<00:01:24.600> way<00:01:24.689> those<00:01:24.869> opening<00:01:25.200> going<00:01:25.380> nerves

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
the way those opening going nerves

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.890 
the way those opening going nerves
hopefully<00:01:26.430> about<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.700> way<00:01:26.790> we<00:01:27.000> can<00:01:27.570> go<00:01:27.689> out<00:01:27.780> on

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
hopefully about the way we can go out on

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.270 
hopefully about the way we can go out on
Monday<00:01:27.960> little<00:01:28.320> bit<00:01:28.409> more<00:01:28.530> relaxed<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:29.100> then

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
Monday little bit more relaxed and then

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.710 
Monday little bit more relaxed and then
play<00:01:29.490> because<00:01:29.759> we<00:01:29.880> can<00:01:30.090> play<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.479> we<00:01:30.540> didn't

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720
