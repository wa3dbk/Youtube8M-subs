but speaking about its connection here

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.450 
but speaking about its connection here
its<00:01:27.330> strength<00:01:27.900> has<00:01:28.229> been<00:01:28.259> quite<00:01:28.890> impressive

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
its strength has been quite impressive

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.760

is it never disconnected or shown any

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.969 
is it never disconnected or shown any
horrible<00:01:36.270> skipped<00:01:36.780> frames<00:01:37.110> now<00:01:37.710> I'm<00:01:37.799> sure

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
horrible skipped frames now I'm sure

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.380 
horrible skipped frames now I'm sure
everyone's<00:01:38.430> experience<00:01:38.939> will<00:01:39.030> be<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.150> little

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
everyone's experience will be a little

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.819 
everyone's experience will be a little
bit<00:01:39.479> different<00:01:39.689> but<00:01:40.110> if<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.320> have<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.500> good

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
bit different but if you have a good

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.429 
bit different but if you have a good
router<00:01:41.130> with<00:01:41.490> good<00:01:41.909> signal<00:01:42.420> strength<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.869> think

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
router with good signal strength I think

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.350 
router with good signal strength I think
you<00:01:43.530> should<00:01:43.710> be<00:01:43.799> fine<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.880> overall<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
you should be fine so overall the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.240 
you should be fine so overall the
physical<00:01:45.689> build<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:46.020> quite<00:01:46.380> simple<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.040> it's

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
physical build is quite simple and it's

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.069 
physical build is quite simple and it's
very<00:01:47.340> straightforward<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.600> can<00:01:48.780> say<00:01:48.930> it's

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
very straightforward and I can say it's

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.109 
very straightforward and I can say it's
the<00:01:49.170> same<00:01:49.470> with<00:01:49.770> setting<00:01:50.130> up<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.250> device<00:01:50.520> it's

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
the same with setting up the device it's

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
in now this is where I start noticing

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.460 
in now this is where I start noticing
the<00:02:08.190> budget<00:02:08.580> price<00:02:08.849> tag<00:02:09.149> being<00:02:09.479> reflected<00:02:10.140> not

the budget price tag being reflected not

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.809 
the budget price tag being reflected not
saying<00:02:10.709> it's<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.920> bad<00:02:10.950> thing<00:02:11.129> but<00:02:11.580> if<00:02:11.700> you're

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
saying it's a bad thing but if you're

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.240 
saying it's a bad thing but if you're
shopping<00:02:12.060> for<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.360> camera<00:02:12.660> here<00:02:12.959> are<00:02:13.050> some

right off the bat their resolution on

right off the bat their resolution on
this<00:02:17.030> one<00:02:17.240> here<00:02:17.510> and<00:02:17.660> many<00:02:17.990> budget<00:02:18.410> models

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
this one here and many budget models

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.630 
this one here and many budget models
goes<00:02:19.280> up<00:02:19.490> to<00:02:19.700> a<00:02:19.730> maximum<00:02:20.390> of<00:02:20.620> 640<00:02:21.620> by<00:02:22.040> 480

goes up to a maximum of 640 by 480
that's<00:02:23.180> basically<00:02:23.570> standard<00:02:24.110> resolution

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
that's basically standard resolution

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.620 
that's basically standard resolution
some<00:02:25.130> people<00:02:25.370> may<00:02:25.490> be<00:02:25.520> fine<00:02:25.850> with<00:02:26.030> it<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:26.360> that

some people may be fine with it and that

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.630 
some people may be fine with it and that
basically<00:02:27.080> fits<00:02:27.410> their<00:02:27.620> needs<00:02:27.650> into<00:02:28.550> the

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
attaced for standard resolution it's if

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.990 
attaced for standard resolution it's if
you're<00:02:31.160> not<00:02:31.280> comparing<00:02:31.640> to<00:02:31.700> any<00:02:31.850> other

being jim's reviewer here here's a quick

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.040 
being jim's reviewer here here's a quick
comparison<00:02:38.470> first<00:02:39.470> is<00:02:39.830> Belkin<00:02:40.490> of<00:02:40.640> course

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
comparison first is Belkin of course

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.540 
comparison first is Belkin of course
second<00:02:42.050> is<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.410> mid<00:02:42.680> grade<00:02:42.890> d-link<00:02:43.370> that

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
second is the mid grade d-link that

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.540 
second is the mid grade d-link that
shows<00:02:43.730> a<00:02:43.910> 720p<00:02:44.600> resolution<00:02:44.720> and<00:02:45.440> last<00:02:46.220> year<00:02:46.430> is

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
shows a 720p resolution and last year is

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.910 
shows a 720p resolution and last year is
the<00:02:47.000> almighty<00:02:47.600> drop<00:02:48.020> cam<00:02:48.320> that<00:02:48.470> started<00:02:48.830> this

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
the almighty drop cam that started this

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.310 
the almighty drop cam that started this
all<00:02:49.100> this<00:02:49.370> also<00:02:49.640> comes<00:02:49.970> in<00:02:50.120> only<00:02:50.209> 720p<00:02:50.930> as<00:02:51.050> well

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
all this also comes in only 720p as well

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.380 
all this also comes in only 720p as well
now<00:02:52.130> all<00:02:52.160> three<00:02:52.520> models<00:02:52.700> were<00:02:52.970> at<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.180> same

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
now all three models were at the same

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.090 
now all three models were at the same
distance<00:02:53.750> from<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.080> router<00:02:54.350> and<00:02:54.650> what<00:02:55.070> I

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
distance from the router and what I

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.860 
distance from the router and what I
noticed<00:02:55.430> first<00:02:55.489> besides<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:56.360> resolution

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
noticed first besides the resolution

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.350 
noticed first besides the resolution
here<00:02:57.050> is<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.709> wideness<00:02:58.310> of<00:02:58.459> the<00:02:58.550> lens<00:02:58.850> it's<00:02:59.180> a

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
here is the wideness of the lens it's a

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.570 
here is the wideness of the lens it's a
bit<00:02:59.510> more<00:02:59.660> narrow<00:02:59.959> showing<00:03:00.440> 64<00:03:01.010> degrees<00:03:01.340> of

horizontal viewing now keep in mind the

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.520 
horizontal viewing now keep in mind the
resolution<00:03:04.550> stated<00:03:04.850> earlier<00:03:05.150> is<00:03:05.300> also<00:03:05.780> a<00:03:05.810> 4<00:03:06.410> by

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
3 aspect ratio it's not widescreen now

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.080 
3 aspect ratio it's not widescreen now
second<00:03:09.920> here<00:03:10.100> with<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.430> more<00:03:10.700> expensive

can pinch and pull to zoom in and out

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.890

now of course this being standard
definition<00:03:18.350> zooming<00:03:18.769> in<00:03:18.860> would<00:03:19.040> make<00:03:19.220> the

image quality more pixelated but keep

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.780 
image quality more pixelated but keep
that<00:03:21.590> in<00:03:21.709> mind<00:03:21.980> if<00:03:22.190> this<00:03:22.280> is<00:03:22.430> something<00:03:22.760> that

that in mind if this is something that

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.670 
that in mind if this is something that
you'd<00:03:22.970> need<00:03:23.239> to<00:03:23.480> consider<00:03:23.810> but<00:03:24.410> if<00:03:24.560> you're

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
you'd need to consider but if you're

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.039 
you'd need to consider but if you're
utilizing<00:03:25.430> this<00:03:25.549> maybe<00:03:26.030> for<00:03:26.299> a<00:03:26.330> warehouse<00:03:26.660> or
