00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.069
 Hi, I'm Tony Moix, weeks from the 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.690
 inertia shop and today we'll talk about 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.509
 the protections that are used for the 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.179
 discipline of longboard in the discipline 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:16.430
 of longboard basically the helmet is used 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.620
 vitally important 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.170
 gloves 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:25.170
 and elbow pads 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.080
 and for those who need cholera 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.090
 the helmet the helmet for hype 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.270
 We will use a classic helmet 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.220
 Freestyle freestyle helmet covers us 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.930
 it protects our nape a lot 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.940
 difference of fitness bike helmets 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.739
 so they are helmets that go with 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.699
 much more go much more covered 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.670
 protect 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:47.370
 much more the head 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.579
 today many helmets carry with 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.079
 an adjustment for the diameter of the head 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.170
 so that it stays well 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.470
 tight and then also from a 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.210
 extra 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.170
 what's going on the chin is very important 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:05.610
 put on the chin tab well 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.530
 foot is well adjusted can not be left 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.900
 can not be left unfit to see being 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.700
 the helmet when we fall will not be 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.420
 in the correct position and will protect us 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.420
 by name 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.490
 we will continue talking about the gloves in 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.170
 the gloves for longboard we can 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.780
 basically distinguish between the two 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.450
 types 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.670
 the first carries a plate and the other 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.729
 takes three plates leads to a stop 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.229
 for soul for these two here and another 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.240
 fat parallel 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.190
 if we are beginners always 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.440
 We will better recommend this type of glove 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.300
 have plates for the fingers when 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.130
 principle we are not very used to or 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.590
 we can not lift our fingers when 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.899
 we make a slide because we are for the 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.659
 things when we learn then it's more 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.580
 recommended that you have plates the fingers 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.210
 and in the big toe 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.700
 when I have a more advanced level 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:01.000
 we already recommend more this type of gloves 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.890
 the one that has a plate nothing more between him 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.600
 between the gloves there are different types 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.420
 of plates to learn the quality of 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.810
 glove is an important thing because 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.820
 according to what type of asphalts or pavements 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.430
 the plate without there being much and now that 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.250
 the arm separates us the point of support and 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.470
 will not go too this is important that the 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.830
 material of the plate, be it a 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.540
 certain quality in longo gloves 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.790
 we will also find two types of 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.380
 material gloves so more quality 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.070
 They are usually made in skin they are very 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.150
 similar to motorcycle gloves and 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.870
 gloves of lower quality because they are already 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.230
 gloves made of fiber and 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.450
 another type of fabrics does not 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.390
 in protections for bone board also 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.720
 it is quite important what are the 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.720
 anger 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.770
 reactions to stop successfully for the 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.010
 career 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.570
 make them parrot and many others 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.520
 sometimes we want backwards or 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.710
 thin and the snakes then we 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.050
 will protect everything that is the area of ​​the 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.370
 hip 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.840
 the important thing also and to finish already 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.220
 we will talk about the shin guards yes that is 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.650
 true that the fungus is not used much 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.430
 if they are used more in the 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.579
 downhill discipline 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.739
 the people who are going to use the 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.750
 typical shin guards that we go on 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.689
 a curve and chop with a stone or 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.519
 branch or tree or whatever it is the 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:30.620
 shin guards will protect us this 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.620
 area that is a very painful area 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.860
 the protections of walking will end 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.620
 with elbow pads and knee pads in the 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.540
 blocks of longboard it is important that 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.340
 be a hip that has a good 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.080
 protection surface is to say that 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.700
 encompass a good space of protection 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.740
 when we stayed on longboard there 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.440
 we look for a lot then it is important 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.330
 that the hip is to this quilt gives 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.460
 stop the impact so that when 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.870
 Typical fall fall nailed 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.710
 we got the kibble we can put the 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.650
 elbow to roll and especially that we have left 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:05.170
 tight brown hip protections 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.700
 always come with the flanges these 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.740
 drinks are elastic the feet are 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.900
 elastic with time they are giving of 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.940
 yes then it is important that when the 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.650
 let's buy when it's new 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.750
 skills are very fair to us very 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.000
 Prietas if we hesitate between two sizes 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.680
 always we choose the smallest because 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.370
 over time all the protections will 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.080
 they are giving of themselves 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.440
 in the knees of amber 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.540
 exactly the same 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.330
 we will also have to choose what are the 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.730
 flanges the protection strips 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.400
 of the knee brace we have the most written 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.660
 more than as tight as possible in 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.910
 the knees of the longboard can 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.500
 find many many different types 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.020
 of knee brace that can be used for 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.910
 stop this line of longboard we can 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:50.090
 find her on one knee of this type 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.550
 which is rather finite is not very big 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.080
 then this will help us make the 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.760
 knee joint be more 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.220
 comfortable and do not bother us so much when 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.930
 to skate or if we knee like 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.120
 these are stuffed much better 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.830
 worked much more moved but that 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.380
 otherwise, they will not be so 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.880
 comfortable to carry not always what 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.530
 we win on the one hand we lose on the other 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.380
 here we must be who 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:15.300
 let's decide the type of skate we have 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.550
 depending on the type of skating that 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.350
 we have then we will decide for a 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.260
 protection by a knee brace that is 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:26.340
 much more padded you have 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.840
 have the richest and most extractable and 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.710
 we can re change or just a 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.660
 knee brace more simple that does not protect 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.660
 so much but that for the type of skating 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.100
 what do we do if that soft not very 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.090
 aggressive because it can serve us 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.880
 perfectly 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.620
 good up here the video today many 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.240
 thank you for watching it I hope you have 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.699
 liked to have been of interest to you 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.260
 for any query we always
