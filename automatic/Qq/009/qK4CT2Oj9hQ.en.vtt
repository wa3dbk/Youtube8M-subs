to improve energy efficiency along with

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.710 
to improve energy efficiency along with
green<00:02:14.350> building<00:02:14.850> durability<00:02:15.850> is<00:02:16.030> also<00:02:16.570> an

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
green building durability is also an

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.440 
green building durability is also an
important<00:02:17.290> aspect<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:17.920> it<00:02:18.040> so<00:02:18.220> we<00:02:19.000> look<00:02:19.210> for

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
important aspect of it so we look for

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.810 
important aspect of it so we look for
products<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.590> we<00:02:20.680> look<00:02:20.860> for<00:02:21.010> trade<00:02:21.280> partners

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
that are going to be able to really

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.030 
that are going to be able to really
instill<00:02:25.080> longevity<00:02:26.080> in<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.380> actual<00:02:26.770> process

construction sequence so we will go over

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.800 
construction sequence so we will go over
exactly<00:04:03.400> what<00:04:03.610> materials<00:04:04.420> are<00:04:04.570> going<00:04:04.660> to<00:04:04.750> be

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
exactly what materials are going to be

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.710 
exactly what materials are going to be
important<00:04:05.410> for<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:05.590> structural<00:04:06.220> we<00:04:07.000> will<00:04:07.420> go
