00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:11.740
 in the farm right cues 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:14.510
 which is breeding worms 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.450
 Californian shot at 12 b per 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.550
 production sometimes we are interested in all 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:25.190
 who is useful to the rabbit chir-vik 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:27.199
 a worm like a king Dmitry I think that in 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.529
 this situation, someone who is useful rather 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.890
 just say so here and there 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:36.280
 why because from the rabbit remains 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:39.400
 this is not a mystery waste product 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.750
 which can be used for 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.900
 california worm which is this 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.580
 the product of vital activity loves 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.780
 Take a lot of this guys here there 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:52.549
 sit this california worms this 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:56.799
 technological worm he's fast 

00:00:52.549 --> 00:01:00.949
 breeds good eats good eats and 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:02.479
 can he currently sits on 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.420
 cattle 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:08.869
 but I 'm sure 200 percent will be with 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.090
 happy to eat rabbit dung 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:14.140
 why because twisted is considered 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.579
 one of the more easily accessible to the worm 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.090
 for this it is necessary that he was without a match 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:21.950
 the most important thing and at least that 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.869
 lay there not a month or two 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:29.420
 so ammonia of your land well snow for 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:31.609
 populated easily in principle taken by 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.590
 I tell the idea how I did it 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:39.320
 breeding stock that is a worm with 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.420
 the substrate in which he was and with 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.229
 one side adds your manure 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.950
 your rabbits and just watched the day 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.380
 23 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.600
 if the worm immediately goes into the dung 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.969
 problems you will never have again 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.340
 it means he he likes you will live 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:57.350
 if the worm your manure does not go and 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.810
 called a helicopter he climbs it like that 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.670
 that's spinning means still in your manure 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.659
 have urine 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.689
 Rabbit is a worm for the well, as it were, 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.239
 Now this situation and perhaps a 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.830
 that in the feed maybe antibiotics were 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.050
 to sadist zhenka 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.709
 This is also quite a significant fact why 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.870
 because I had a horse situation 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:24.599
 anthelmintic i travail my worm 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:27.489
 not checked usually done in practice 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.549
 let's say the test batch is taken 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.530
 even one thing cervical and took 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:35.739
 planted in manure looked day 2 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.489
 if he is alive and mobility worm on 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.519
 you fit there is such a situation 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.390
 feeding rabbits is important for a worm 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.360
 surely what are you driving at 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.849
 Well, ideally, of course, good feed 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.519
 good clean without chemistry is the best 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:56.410
 option second city ​​is generally perfect it 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:59.980
 when you plant food grass there is not 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.200
 I know the teams carrot rabbit because 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.890
 what about the worm i am reconciled than him 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.780
 feed here with rabbits 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.380
 what is at hand let's say the same 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.920
 that many 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:15.040
 but small there let the farmer who 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.829
 i land grow my bakery who's there 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.900
 already obtained manure clean and in 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:23.410
 based on what is necessary makers here can 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.410
 so here we do not keep coaches it 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.829
 this will catch you see here krovniki 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:32.079
 the healthy principle of every household is not 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.120
 more can be in the box to keep these 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.609
 vegetable 64 100 200 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.819
 can i do it when you started 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:43.299
 just took euro pallets stuffed 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.579
 somewhere 640 centimeters over 60 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.410
 undesirable worm will choke then 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.069
 there is still agrofiber beat so that the worm 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.430
 didn't climb out 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:54.130
 there is a lot of this option 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.260
 situation when kept running means 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.470
 colleagues from sugar such a skid 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.880
 healthy over he too is comfortable just 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.590
 california than i like he doesn't 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.989
 climbs ie he sits in one place 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.130
 Here he was given food he will work under 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.769
 don't forget to water 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.650
 that other chery tiggo senden pellets i 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:13.700
 too for him 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.650
 they can't walk 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.440
 what about how many 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:22.280
 manure how many times can they cut 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.229
 volume processing is considered that the check 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.169
 kilogram person recycles day 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:32.330
 half a kilo of substrate but at the age of 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:34.460
 bases, that is, read 10 kilograms 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.289
 let's say 5 kilograms to process 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.449
 manure per day well, it turns out 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:41.900
 commodity year and if we sell 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:46.010
 Packed up about 300 grams but let's say 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:48.770
 people who can not pack for themselves 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.600
 don't overpower just take lure 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.820
 from there the worm 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.250
 lure and use there in the greenhouse 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.760
 in my grandfather and need to lure 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.729
 ordinary shield is put plastic and there 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.930
 lies down here and so fresh feed and 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.539
 the worm then climbs that is 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.250
 do at least a month later 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:09.280
 option you can sort out your hands but it 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.470
 long and tedious third option which 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.570
 small scale healthy tass there 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:17.630
 worm poured into the sun set and 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.919
 through each about there well there is 20-30 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.780
 days in a minute 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.389
 start fresh substrate from above 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.789
 rake the worm hiding the sun goes away 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.919
 clear trend and then you remain 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:30.169
 just beat the mass of chili on this land 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:32.030
 can use but there you are somewhere 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:34.280
 kokande then fry will fall but i think 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.050
 this is not much harm in the garden not 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.940
 don't bring 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.919
 Well , we only take the biomass itself 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.330
 can be used for bird feed 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.060
 even at home 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.460
 I know that I have guys too 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.970
 They came to take 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:52.310
 some not there with such claps 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:55.430
 guy somewhere once a week 15 20 centuries 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.050
 gives and does not use an antibiotic but there 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.260
 an important fact is necessary so that the turn 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:04.430
 lay down freed my food how much I 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:09.460
 Here to fight with these ghouls things I have here 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:15.850
 these guys are like that 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:15.850
 we dig here dug not gone 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:24.770
 we understood that like a rabbit we need a worm 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:30.800
 such a worm except they are each other and so 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:33.169
 I think they understand the roller land and land 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.530
 get a clean product for a rabbit 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:39.860
 there are plants only well and blueberries product 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:42.440
 bunny and each other i think they 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:48.100
 if they were talking type said 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:48.100
 thanks for being with him
