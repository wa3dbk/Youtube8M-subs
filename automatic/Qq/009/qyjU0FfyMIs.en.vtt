side<00:02:53.799> is<00:02:54.040> actually<00:02:54.310> a<00:02:54.340> lot<00:02:54.459> easier<00:02:54.519> in<00:02:54.939> my

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
side is actually a lot easier in my

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.399 
side is actually a lot easier in my
opinion<00:02:55.090> one<00:02:55.599> thing<00:02:55.840> is<00:02:55.959> for<00:02:56.170> sure<00:02:56.200> is<00:02:56.379> that

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:56.409 
opinion one thing is for sure is that

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.050 
opinion one thing is for sure is that
the<00:02:56.620> enemy<00:02:56.739> will<00:02:56.950> be<00:02:57.010> coming<00:02:57.280> towards<00:02:57.640> you<00:02:57.849> so

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.069 
the enemy will be coming towards you so
you<00:02:58.090> don't<00:02:58.239> have<00:02:58.420> necessarily<00:02:58.629> have<00:02:58.930> to<00:02:58.959> go

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
you don't have necessarily have to go

right nearby the objectives the other
thing<00:04:05.799> too<00:04:05.919> is<00:04:05.980> that<00:04:06.069> if<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.280> spawn<00:04:06.639> trucks

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:06.909 
thing too is that if the spawn trucks

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:08.939 
thing too is that if the spawn trucks
already<00:04:07.120> there<00:04:07.510> take<00:04:08.169> one<00:04:08.470> of<00:04:08.560> the<00:04:08.650> armored
