then<00:02:22.170> what<00:02:22.560> I'll<00:02:22.680> need<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:22.950> do<00:02:23.100> in<00:02:23.250> here<00:02:23.580> is<00:02:23.780> go

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
then what I'll need to do in here is go

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.280 
then what I'll need to do in here is go
to<00:02:24.840> maximum<00:02:25.790> again<00:02:27.709> hit<00:02:28.709> OK<00:02:30.290> bada-bing

everything<00:02:32.130> looks<00:02:32.370> great<00:02:32.570> so<00:02:33.570> keep<00:02:33.930> this<00:02:34.080> in

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140
