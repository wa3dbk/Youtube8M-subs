00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.840
 the movement repeated billions of times 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.880
 a lot of people worldwide 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.460
 the estimation of the world 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.900
 health is that one- third of the adult population 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.180
 movie 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.480
 this represents almost a million and a half 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.480
 of people 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.580
 In Brazil alone there are almost 30 million 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.140
 smokers if each smoker smokes average 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:42.170
 five cigarettes a day we can 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.170
 reach 150 million bitas per day 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.190
 giving greater of this habit is even for the 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.680
 health of these people but who smokes 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.540
 also damages the environment and 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.540
 most of the time she does not even notice 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:04.470
 when playing in the street the filter of the cigarette to 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.930
 person is discarding called a micro 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.720
 this case a mixture of paper and 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:14.759
 cotton that takes an average of ten 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:18.360
 years but I go people there is only one 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.170
 A bituca is not a language, it's not going to have 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.720
 problem 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.420
 but if you jointed butts from various 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.880
 smokers and goes to the manholes and 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.729
 drains will go ne for the sheets 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.429
 groundwater to rivers the fish eat 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.000
 then she has studies mainly 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:40.920
 in the coastal areas of the impact of 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.450
 residue impact on marine animals 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.610
 can be avoided 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.649
 about ten years of a student here 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.170
 University of Brasília had the idea of 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.090
 make paper using the butts as 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.759
 teacher of arts 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.659
 liked and the chemistry institute accepted the 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.909
 challenge 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.640
 That's how the tests started. 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.830
 so certain that the project was patented and 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.369
 turned reference to the country is very 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.489
 simple is ridiculously simple, not for 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.649
 even though it is feasible to be 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:15.270
 replicated in low-impact technology 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:20.270
 and you can even add the labor is 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.270
 much more than it is machines 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.250
 the drinks are served with soda 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.410
 caustic and water 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:32.200
 after crushing are already ready 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.200
 to take the forms take out paper 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.780
 because I was smoker 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.030
 interested when she spoke of using 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.090
 cigarette butt to the paper 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.800
 you told mashai to transform again 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.690
 raw material that disposable trash it 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.340
 become a material like any other 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.340
 you can work in different ways 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.980
 the collection of butts is a result of 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.780
 other initiatives 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.220
 one of them works at this university 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.710
 private 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.960
 Also in Brasilia the project started 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.550
 with the butts because the 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.890
 cigarette was a problem within the 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.020
 institution often found in the 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.980
 ground or in the green areas near 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.070
 trees right 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.980
 then beyond the issue of visual pollution 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.830
 This bituca on the ground is how it rains. 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.870
 This residue and leached butt 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.060
 leached bituca we have a problem 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.400
 manhole so it is not just a matter 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.460
 aesthetics but is an environmental problem 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.080
 on average the institution collects 1,600 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.120
 butts per month 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.160
 who takes care of the project says that since 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.950
 At the outset the proposal was well received 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.940
 students both smokers and 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.940
 the students that I was not 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.260
 a neat nerd different the place when 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:52.400
 played on the floor was full spread and there 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.409
 people who are not smokers and bother today 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.269
 these behaviors and finished ninth in the 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:59.340
 run day to day and in a section 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:02.849
 paulo celular final step in the long 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.489
 taxi that make of it once it 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.819
 discards the father of having 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.819
 her responsibility 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.050
 one serventuário still move in place 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:17.640
 right and on the 45 call I'm sure 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.640
 We'll learn how to do it, I feel. 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.320
 goiania became so interested in the subject 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.870
 who created a daring project she wants 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.150
 change the habits of colleagues and the routine 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:32.610
 this campus of which is in unb 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.610
 Planaltina 40 kilometers from Brasília 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.860
 people are not aware that since 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.440
 the implementation of tobacco until it reaches 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.840
 But then she degrades the idea. 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.090
 at least in this final cycle to 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.060
 to tell the cemetery of all this 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.130
 garbage give him an appropriate destination 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.320
 here the actions of the project have three 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.150
 fronts with people using students 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.000
 teachers and staff for the 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.040
 risks of smoking show the impacts of this 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.200
 chain for the environment that still 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.690
 offer an alternative to discarding 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.060
 of the campus 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.550
 Planaltina same place perfect for 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.889
 this first stage of the touch project 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.410
 used is that part of the 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:19.090
 students studying in this unit of nbb 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:21.220
 do the environmental management course in goiânia 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.070
 is part of this group and has already 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.350
 important partnerships with six 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:30.550
 were donated to the university and 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:32.470
 installed on campus and the boxes 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.389
 collectors, we also gained the 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.030
 partnership of são paulo personnel that are 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:39.010
 supplying these boots 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.440
 butts these boots of education 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.590
 portable to carry in your pocket 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.880
 so I think you are filled in 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.710
 collection box 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.720
 as soon as the collectors are full 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.150
 the intention is to send some of this material 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.160
 to see you land in minas gerais where 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:57.130
 will be transformed into fertilizer 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.139
 the rest also already has a certain destination 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.360
 studio pray the teacher who 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:03.430
 thanks but draw your attention to the 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.880
 need to extend the process of 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.340
 transition 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.290
 an action of the paper bituca one 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.750
 technology with the university places 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.520
 society's disposition and that people 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.200
 can this partner with 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.470
 investors 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:20.500
 for this without being implemented in order to 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:24.390
 a continuous production does not add 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.390
 people and generate income
