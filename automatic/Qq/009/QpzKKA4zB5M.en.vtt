series comes out in April and it's only

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.470 
series comes out in April and it's only
going<00:01:39.410> to<00:01:39.500> have<00:01:39.680> 12<00:01:40.010> episodes<00:01:40.520> which<00:01:40.850> is<00:01:41.030> not<00:01:41.450> a

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
going to have 12 episodes which is not a

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.540 
going to have 12 episodes which is not a
lot<00:01:41.780> if<00:01:42.350> it<00:01:42.500> does<00:01:42.710> well<00:01:42.920> it<00:01:43.100> might<00:01:43.250> have<00:01:43.400> more

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
lot if it does well it might have more

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.420 
lot if it does well it might have more
seasons<00:01:43.970> but<00:01:44.240> um<00:01:44.450> I<00:01:44.870> don't<00:01:45.800> know<00:01:45.950> it<00:01:46.130> might<00:01:46.280> do

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
seasons but um I don't know it might do

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.040 
seasons but um I don't know it might do
good<00:01:46.460> it's<00:01:46.880> just<00:01:47.120> about<00:01:47.300> a<00:01:47.360> boy<00:01:47.570> and<00:01:47.600> his

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
good it's just about a boy and his

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.370 
good it's just about a boy and his
friends<00:01:48.230> causing<00:01:49.130> mischief<00:01:49.430> so<00:01:50.000> I<00:01:50.380> guess

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
friends causing mischief so I guess

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.230 
friends causing mischief so I guess
that's<00:01:51.590> relatable<00:01:51.980> to<00:01:52.190> a<00:01:52.250> lot<00:01:52.430> of<00:01:52.550> kids<00:01:52.760> and<00:01:52.970> a
