00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.180
 hello youtube friends we are in a 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.640
 new video tutorial where I come to 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.850
 teach how to set up with geely 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.490
 tours alfal 8 hits and racing 2 well 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.470
 let's start the first thing that has to 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.380
 we must have are the following 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.480
 applications the speed booster is 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:24.130
 optional in my case I'm not going to 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:26.810
 use since it makes me very heavy 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.140
 when using it 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.119
 other applications that we are going to use 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.760
 these have to be the last 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:38.590
 updates that have come out that are 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.660
 the kily tools and the cyber 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.420
 These two can be found in the 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:47.140
 ppd shop today are free so 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:50.559
 nothing in my case those configurations if 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.020
 they serve for the latest versions of 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.690
 these two games in my case in the ffaa 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.470
 of 8 already found how to hack the good 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.170
 do not hack it gameloft means is this 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.559
 game version 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.090
 since they had blocked my account so 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.310
 that nothing is a long story and 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.159
 let's start with the good tutorial 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.580
 first we have to have permits 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.030
 root user we open geely tools and 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.430
 we look for the game in your case if ever 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.039
 they have configured it they have to look for it 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.500
 but as I configure them, they are going to 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:28.560
 appear at the beginning so here they are 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.509
 I will first set up until 8 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.500
 first of all to do these 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.690
 settings how can I move I open 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.460
 until 8 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:44.380
 and to begin, look 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.380
 now I'm going to open racing 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.220
 did the same configurations not 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:56.000
 they change into nothing so we 're not going to 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:59.840
 start with asphalt 8 first on tree 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.760
 custom settings here have to give in 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.550
 definitive 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.440
 here nothing 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:12.670
 By 16 bit rendering they mark it optimize 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.640
 the sliders mark it in textures in water 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.870
 understanding texture 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.599
 Isabel 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.319
 in nahuel texture of the compression network and 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:29.650
 taste to me in Basque textures runs me 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:33.610
 well in limit 256 by 256 but if not 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.900
 they are doing well, mark 0.5 for but I 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.150
 leave like this 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:43.079
 here do not move anything 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:47.430
 in gpu name emulation they have to mark 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:51.569
 gpu info and cpu info in yushu templete 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:55.390
 they have to dial sgx540 for them 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:58.030
 run well or nothing will work 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.030
 and those last options are from the last 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.550
 upgrade 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.670
 that if you do not have it, it will not work in 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.880
 nothing we mark simple map buffer mulay 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.880
 are 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:15.849
 textures 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.849
 fix efe 6 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.439
 decorate that rgb and ya 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.920
 now let's move on to closing 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.530
 the cyber is to decrease to the since 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.380
 with these settings sometimes if there 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.420
 when a race starts first 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.920
 when you just installed it on 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.920
 cyber will be disabled 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.180
 and beat and you will have this option 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:56.440
 activated are you going to 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.340
 deactivate and they will mark this one 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.730
 and is 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:05.510
 here where I did rn reservais performance 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.910
 that profile will be in light and you 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.459
 they have to if they have a swap partition 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.319
 that I do not have it, they will give 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.900
 moderate 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:18.139
 but since I do not have the swap partition 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.859
 I'm going to give him an aggressive and here above what 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.859
 they are going to activate it 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.100
 there they see that I made in outsider the 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:30.470
 reduction is to reduce water in 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.810
 all the phone and on the android system 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:38.570
 we wait for him to change 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.570
 Once this is done we left 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.210
 and we open until 8 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.110
 when the charging circle ends this 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:56.419
 they have to press fast like a few 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.419
 fucking ninjas the home key 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:05.360
 and reopen it 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:09.319
 what is this for to decrease a 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:12.229
 1% of those to be synchronized 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:15.529
 the audio well and so that it accommodates 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:18.439
 the textures that sometimes there are failures 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:20.539
 so here in the gameloft logo 

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:22.869
 it may take a few seconds and then it 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:22.869
 remove 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.960
 this video goes to the community of 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.620
 samsung galaxy in spanish that is a 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.620
 facebook group 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.140
 do not worry so you are going to see 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.430
 or maybe he can
